PMC3825524	245050	Introduction	OMIM	False	There exists also a testis-specific isoform SCOT-t (gene name OXCT2), sharing 74 % amino acid identity with SCOT (Tanaka et al 2002). 	Mutations in the human OXCT1 gene on chromosome location 5p13 result in the rare autosomal recessive deficiency of SCOT (OMIM 245050) (Mitchell and Fukao 2001). 	SCOT-deficient patients, often with neonatal onset, present with recurrent ketoacidosis episodes that could be life-threatening, but with no symptoms between episodes (Niezen-Koning et al 1997). The number of reported cases is few, and symptoms, which may vary among individuals, include vomiting, lethargy and tachypnea, as well as unconsciousness caused by severe ketoacidosis (Berry et al 2001; Sakazaki et al 1995; Snyderman et al 1998). 
PMC3825524	1M3E	Methods	PDBe	False	SCOT crystallized in the P21 space group with four molecules in the asymmetric unit (Supplementary Table 1). 	The structure of human SCOT was solved by molecular replacement with PHASER (McCoy et al 2005), using the pig heart structure as search model (PDB code 1M3E)(Bateman et al 2002). 	Initial automated model building was performed with ARP/wARP (Perrakis et al 2001), followed by cycles of iterative manual model building with COOT (Emsley and Cowtan 2004) and REFMAC5 refinement (Murshudov et al 1997). The refined model consists of protein residues 40–285 and 297–519. 
PMC3825524	3DLX	Methods	PDBe	False	No ligand density for acetyl-CoA was found in the active site though it was added during crystallization. 	Structure factors and coordinates were deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the accession code 3DLX.

PMC5989807	NCT01199874	Methods	NCT	False	Study design and participants 	All participating Pakistani infants were healthy, 4–6 weeks of age at enrolment, with a birth-weight > 1500g (exact gestational age unknown), and had been previously enrolled in a phase IV, open-label randomized clinical trial of RV1 immunogenicity (NCT01199874, clinicaltrials.gov) examining the effect of different RV1 dosing schedules (6/10/14, 6/10 and 10/14 weeks) and withholding breastfeeding around the time of vaccine administration on RV1 immunogenicity.18,19 	The trial was conducted in a peri-urban, low-income slum along the seacoast in Karachi, Pakistan. Serum samples were collected prior to the first dose of vaccine and 28 days following the last dose of vaccine (14 or 18 weeks depending on study arm) for anti-rotavirus IgA antibody measurements.

PMC5064356	248200	Article	OMIM	False		Stargardt disease (STGD1: OMIM #248200) is an inherited macular dystrophy leading to progressive loss of central vision in early childhood, accounting for approximately 7% of all retinal dystrophies and affecting about 1 in 10,000 individuals1. 	Most affected individuals maintain full peripheral visual function albeit with central scotomas of miscellaneous sizes. A progressive decrease in central visual acuity occurs throughout life with values approaching 0.1 or worse in the final stages of the disease. 
PMC5064356	4P31	Discussion	PDBe	False	To predict the pathogenicity, we constructed a crystal structure of mutant ABCA4 protein for this novel mutation, and compared it with the wild-type one. 	Because the three-dimensional protein structure of ABCA4 has not been available yet, we used LptB (PDB ID: 4P31) as the template to predict the likely structure impact of p.A2064T substitution on ABCA4 protein with PyMOL, based on their similar functions as ATP-binding proteins21. 	The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) systems comprise a broad and heterogeneous group of proteins that specialized in the active transport of various substrates across all domains of life2223. Many of these transporters share a common architecture of two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), which couple the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to the transport across cellular membranes, against a concentration gradient. 
PMC3413693	1L6X	Methods	PDBe	False	Molecular Modeling and Docking of hFcRn/m2a1/sp62 Complex 	The initial coordinates of m2a1 were constructed via homology modeling (http://swissmodel.expasy.org) [40]–[42] based on a 1.65 Å Fc structure (pdb entry: 1L6X) [43]. 	A water box was then added using VMD 1.8.6 program [44] and water molecules were retained in the molecular dynamics simulation. The m2a1 was simulated with CHARMM force field using NAMD program [45]. 
PMC3413693	3MNW	Methods	PDBe	False	The structure was first minimized for 5000 steps with conjugate gradient method, and equilibrated for 10 ps with the time step of 1 fs, then were further minimized for 90,000 steps for analysis with VMD program. 	The coordinates of gp41 MPER-derived peptide sp62 was obtained from a complex structure of sp62 with an IgG Fab fragement (pdb entry: 3MNW) [46]. 	Docking simulation of sp62 with energy-minimized m2a1 was performed using the Rosetta-Dock program. At last, the docked sp62-m2a1 and human FcRn (pdb entry: 3M17 [47]) were superimposed onto the complex structure of rat FcRn-Fc (pdb entry: 1I1A) [48], and were welled matched with rat IgG2a Fc CH2 domain and rat FcRn, respectively. 
PMC3413693	3M17	Methods	PDBe	False	Docking simulation of sp62 with energy-minimized m2a1 was performed using the Rosetta-Dock program. 	At last, the docked sp62-m2a1 and human FcRn (pdb entry: 3M17 [47]) were superimposed onto the complex structure of rat FcRn-Fc (pdb entry: 1I1A) [48], and were welled matched with rat IgG2a Fc CH2 domain and rat FcRn, respectively. 	
PMC5322397	rs149343557	Results	RefSNP	False	The A329T mutant is insensitive to Ca2+-CaM stimulation 	Three rare-variant point mutations (E268K; I328M, rs149343557; A329T, rs768551666) that occur close to the ATP-binding site of the catalytic domain of human CaMKK2 (Fig. 4a), have been detected in two large-scale genetic studies1524. 	Additionally, the E268K mutation has also been found in the acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line MOLT-4, whereas the A329T mutation has been detected in tissue samples derived from endometrial carcinoma1830. As shown in Fig. 4b, the E268K mutant had significantly reduced autonomous activity compared with WT CaMKK2.

PMC5859159	NC_010449.4	Results	RefSeq	False	The donor DNA plasmid encodes for homologous arms that range from 500 bp at the 5’ to 250 bp at the 3′ end of the position of the point mutation (Fig. 1A). 	The 3′-homology arm surpasses a sequence gap in the porcine reference sequence (Sus scrofa 10.2, NC_010449.4, chr.7, 81078606–81078706). 	This region was determined by Sanger sequencing in German Landrace pigs (Fig. S1).Figure 1Generation of transgenic fibroblasts and pigs. (A) Schematic drawing of the genome editing approach. 
PMC4363047	XM_003356616.1	Methods	RefSeq	False		Double-stranded RNA sequences were designed with Invitrogen BlockiT RNAi Designer according to the Sus scrofa p38 mRNA sequence (Genbank accession number XM_003356616.1); the designed sequences were then synthesized by Invitrogen. 	The p38-specific siRNA sequence was 5′-GCAGGAGCUGAACAAGACATT-3′. The control siRNA had the following sequence: 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3′. 
PMC6124012	GSE12708	Methods	GEO	False	RNA-Seq raw sequence data are available via GSE116744 from gene expression omnibus (GEO) (http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). 	The gene expression (microarray) data of SUM44 tamoxifen-resistant (SUM44 TamR) and parental cells (SUM44PE) were downloaded from GEO [GSE12708]. 	Probes with the highest interquartile range were selected for genes that matched to multiple probes. DE analysis was performed with R package Limma [22], and a Benjamini-Hochberg–adjusted P value of less than 0.05 was used to call DE genes in SUM44 TamR cells. 
PMC6124012	GSE20181	Methods	GEO	False	Analysis of clinical samples 	Gene expression microarray data of ER+ breast cancers treated with letrozole were obtained from the GEO database [GEO: GSE20181] [23]. 	Gene expression changes after 3-month treatment with letrozole were determined for genes of interest in responders and non-responders, as defined by tumor volume reduction by 50%. Pearson’s chi-squared test was used to check the dependence of the gene expression change and the response to letrozole. 
PMC6124012	GSE20181	Results	GEO	False	Black solid lines, increased expression of SREBP1 with 3-month treatment; gray dashed lines, decreased expression of SREBP1 with 3-month treatment.
