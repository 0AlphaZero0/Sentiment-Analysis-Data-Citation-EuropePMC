#### :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: Deep Learning, NLP, Representation :

http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-NLP-RNNs-Representations/

 - **Perceptron** : Supervised learning algorithm with binary classifiers
 - **t-SNE** algortithm : Proximity between 2 points ==> usefull with a lot of features, it's easier to see points that are really close        (:warning: more than 3 dimensions)
 - **NLP** : Neuro-linguistic programming
 - **N-grams** : Computationnal linguistics, sequence of *n-items* from a text or speech
 - **Recursive neural network / Models / Matrix Vector RNN** : ???
 
***Softwares & libraries for Text Mining*** :

#### :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: SciLite :

 - ELIXIR platform/service
Make deeper links between literature and biological data sources thanks to text mining.
Platform that allow text mining annotation from any provider to be highlighted on scientific papers.
 - Work on full articles (~900 000 articles)
 - Annotation stored on MangoDB
 - Resource Description(RDF) : graph model that describe in a formal way WEB ressources.
 - Annotation types :
  - Named entities (genes, protein names, organisms, diseases, GO terms, chemicals, accession numbers)
  - Biological events (phosphorylation)
  - Relationships (Target-Disease)
  - Text phrases (Gene RIF : "*Gene Referencing to a Function*"; Molecular Interaction)

Output :
