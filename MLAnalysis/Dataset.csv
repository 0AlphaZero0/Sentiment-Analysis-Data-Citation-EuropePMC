PMC5983642	E-GEOD-52009	Results	ArrayExpress	False	Search in GEO (query “glioblastoma”, filters “homo sapiens” and “DataSets”) yielded four appropriate datasets: GSE4290/GDS1962, GSE23806/GDS3885, GSE4412/GDS1975, and GSE4412/GDS1976. 	In ArrayExpress, the query »glioblastoma, grade« (with filters »homo sapiens«, »RNA assay«, and »array assay«) yielded three appropriate datasets (E-GEOD-52009, E-GEOD-68848, and E-GEOD-16011), the query »glioblastoma, stem cells« (same filters) yielded two datasets (E-GEOD-4536 and E-GEOD-74571), while the last query »glioblastoma, neurospheres« (same filter) produced no appropriate results. 	The best of the appropriate datasets—i.e., the datasets that contained curated data and/or permitted multiple comparisons relevant for selection of new GB/GSC marker candidates (see Table 1)—were chosen to be used for selection of new marker candidates. These datasets were the GEO datasets GSE4290/GDS1962 and GSE23806/GDS3885, as well as the single GLIOMASdb dataset (see Table 2). 
PMC5983642	E-GEOD-4536	Results	ArrayExpress	False	The aim of these selection tests was to identify new GB/GSC marker candidates. 	Similarly, 13 pairwise comparisons were conducted for bioinformatic validation of new GB/GSC marker candidates between groups of samples from the seven independent validation datasets (i.e., GSE4412/GDS1975, GSE4412/GDS1976, E-GEOD-52009, E-GEOD-68848, E-GEOD-16011, E-GEOD-4536, and E-GEOD-74571).

PMC4360730	CHEBI:23965	Article	ChEBI	False	This example, showing a subset of the full breadth of metadata annotated for an ENCODE experiment, emphasizes the annotation of three experimental metadata categories (treatment, biosample and assay) in two experiments. 	Treatments have been annotated to ChEBI (e.g. 20-hydroxyecdysone—CHEBI:16587 and estradiol—CHEBI:23965). 	Biosamples have been annotated to one of three ontologies: Uberon, CL and EFO (e.g. hepatic stellate cell—CL:0000632 and Hep-G2—EFO:0001187).

PMC4360730	EFO:0001187	Article	EFO	False	Treatments have been annotated to ChEBI (e.g. 20-hydroxyecdysone—CHEBI:16587 and estradiol—CHEBI:23965). 	Biosamples have been annotated to one of three ontologies: Uberon, CL and EFO (e.g. hepatic stellate cell—CL:0000632 and Hep-G2—EFO:0001187). 	Assays have been annotated to OBI (e.g. RRBS—OBI:0001862 and MeDIP-seq—OBI:000693). The terms in the middle are parent terms found in the ontology that provide a more general context and can be used to find these experiments (i.e. biological role for treatments, organ for biosamples, assay category for experimental assays). 
PMC4360730	EFO:0001187	Article	EFO	False	The integration of the three ontologies uses three relationships: is_a, part_of and derives_from. 	The is_a relationship indicates that one entity is a subtype of another entity (e.g. Hep-G2—EFO:0001187 is a type of hepatoma cell line—EFO:0005216). 	The part_of relationship indicates a part-whole relationship, such that an child term is fully and always contained within the parent term (e.g. all hepatocytes—CL:0000182 are found in the liver—UBERON:0002107). The derives_from relationship indicates that the child term succeeds parent term over some temporal divide, such that at least a significant biological portion is inherited (e.g. hepatoma cell lines—EFO:0005216 are cancerous hepatocyte cells—CL:0000182). 
PMC4360730	EFO:0005216	Article	EFO	False	The part_of relationship indicates a part-whole relationship, such that an child term is fully and always contained within the parent term (e.g. all hepatocytes—CL:0000182 are found in the liver—UBERON:0002107). 	The derives_from relationship indicates that the child term succeeds parent term over some temporal divide, such that at least a significant biological portion is inherited (e.g. hepatoma cell lines—EFO:0005216 are cancerous hepatocyte cells—CL:0000182). 	Inferred relationships are connections between two terms that are transitively reasoned via the explicit relationships. Transitive relationships remain true across multiple links of the relationships. 
PMC4360730	EFO:0002067	Article	EFO	False	In addition, terms in EFO can be related to a specific disease. 	Immortalized cell lines are annotated using EFO, as well as induced pluripotent stem cells and established stem cell lines (e.g. K562—EFO:0002067, induced pluripotent stem cell—EFO:0004905 and H1-hESC—EFO:0003042). 	In addition, we have decided to annotate the intended product of in vitro differentiations rather than capturing individual combinations of treatment and biosample in the ontologies. As a result, this category of biosamples can be annotated to either CL or EFO following the rules described above.

One gene was annotated as a typical L-lactate dehydrogenase gene (L-ldh) (GenBank accession number: KT946599). 	To disrupt the L-ldh gene, gene-specific primers KLN16F (5′–TATATAGAAAGGACGATGTAAATGAGTG–3′) and KLN16R (5′–TCTTATCTTATTTGCCTGATCAAATGCC–3′) were designed to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplify the L-ldh gene and its 5′- and 3′-flanking regions.

DNA fragments containing about 370 bp of the regions upstream and downstream of phbC were amplified using primers which introduced a KpnI restriction site on the 3′ end of the upstream fragment (phbCFwUp 5′-TCAGTCGACCAGCAGTTTTGTTAGTC-3′ and phbCRvUp 5′-TCGGTACCTGTTCATGCTCGGATCTG-3′) and on the 5′ end of the downstream fragment (phbCFwDw 5′-TAGGTACCATAAAAAAGAGGGCGGTG-3′ and phbCRvDw 5′-AAGGATCCGATGCATGGATATCGAAG-3′). These DNA fragments were initially cloned separately into pTZ57R/T (ThermoScientific, USA), and then both fragments were ligated to each other using the KpnI site. 
PMC3783465	CP002039	Methods	ENA	False	Libraries of each biological replicates were sequenced twice independently. 	Reads were mapped against H. seropedicae genome reference sequence (Genbank accession number CP002039.1). 	Data processing and statistical analyses were performed using the CLC Genomics Workbench 5.1 and the results were expressed in RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped reads) [24]. 
PMC3783465	ADJ63152	Results	ENA	False	The most abundant protein associated with the H. seropedicae PHB granule is the phasin which has been described as responsible for preventing granule coalescence [27]. 	Genome analysis indicated two genes coding for phasins in H. seropedicae (Hsero_1639 and Hsero_4759) (GenBank accession number ADJ63152.1 and ADJ66220.1, respectively [12]). 	These genes code for 19.8 kDa proteins with pI of 6.7, sharing 58% identity and 74% similarity. Our analysis indicates that PhaP1 (encoded by Hsero_1639) is the main phasin coating PHB in H. seropedicae, since under our experimental conditions, PhaP2 (Hsero_4759) was not observed. 
PMC3783465	ADJ63901	Results	ENA	False	Moreover, another protein associated with the PHB granule was also identified in the ΔphaP1 mutant strain. 	Hsero_2402 (GenBank accession number ADJ63901.1) encodes a hypothetical protein with a calculated 21.6 kDa and pI of 6.2 and no conserved domain. 	It has 14.3% identity and 36% similarity with PhaP1 and 13.3% identity and 34.5% similarity with PhaP2. Although Hsero_2402 encoded protein shows low similarity with PhaP1 and PhaP2, prediction of secondary structure indicates a protein with high content of α-helix (supplementary material, Fig. 
PMC5684421	SRP059342	Methods	ENA	False	In silico analysis of Ger receptor genes in 152 gIICb strains 	The raw Illumina reads of a previously published37 diverse set of 152 gIICb strains were retrieved from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive database (Accession number: SRP059342, no corresponding assembly available). 	The fastq files were processed with BBduk for removal of adapter contamination, trimming (Phred score >28), and size exclusion (read length >50 bp). Each fastq file was subsequently inspected with FastQC for quality control38. 
PMC4968819	X07441	Results	ENA	False	In the original analysis several reads were classified as Turnip Yellow Mosaic Virus (TYMV), a virus belonging to the Tymovirus, but this virus could not be identified using Kraken. 	However, Granberg et al. state in the publication that for TYMV, one contig of 225 bp was generated and it shared 91% nucleotide sequence similarity with its most similar reference genome (GenBank X07441), but only over a stretch of 56 bp in the middle. Since the ends did not show any resemblance with the reference, this could either indicate a new type of TYMV-like virus or an incorrectly assembled contig. 	206 reads similar to two vFams containing sequences only from Tymoviridae were found by MetLab. This additional information brought by the analysis at the protein-level indicates that a virus distantly related to the TYMV could be present in the dataset.

PMC3108997	AF093683	Methods	ENA	False	Luciferase-reporter constructs 	The 3.7 kb RET full-length promoter (1545 to 5270, AF032124, Genbank), the 372 bp minimal promoter and the mutated RET full-length promoter containing -5G>A and -1A>C or -1A>C alleles, were generated by PCR and cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter in the pXP1 vector (AF093683, GenBank) [13]. 	All of these constructs contain a 195 bp 5′UTR of RET gene. A 1.4 kb 5′ deletion construct (Del.D), was generated by cloning of the PCR fragment (-1205 to 195) of RET gene upstream of the luciferase reporter in the pXP1 vector.

PMC2755741	X05490	Methods	ENA	False	Homology search was performed as a stepwise procedure. 	In the first stage, we started with the sequence of the functional human 7SK sequence (X05490, X04236 (Krüger and Benecke 1987; Murphy et al. 1984; Wassarman and Steitz 1991; Zieve and Penman 1976)) and performed a search against the genome assemblies available in (version 42). 	In this way, we identified candidates in other vertebrate genomes, including the following, previously published sequences: Mus musculus (M63671, Moon and Krause 1991), Rattus norvegicus (K02909, Reddy et al. 1984), Takifugu rubripes (AJ890104, Egloff et al. 2006; Myslinksi et al. 2004), Tetraodon nigroviridis (AJ890103, Egloff et al. 2006), Danio rerio (AJ890102, Egloff et al. 2006), and Gallus gallus (AJ890104, Egloff et al. 2006). In addition, we searched the shotgun traces of a selection of unfinished mammalian genomes as well as all unfinished nonmammalian animals.

In addition, we searched the shotgun traces of a selection of unfinished mammalian genomes as well as all unfinished nonmammalian animals. Beyond jawed vertebrates, this initial search recovered a single candidate in the genome of the lamprey Petromyzon marinus, which turned out the be very closely related to the published sequence of Lampetra fluviatilis 7SK RNA (Gürsoy et al. 2000).

PMC4014860	CP000919	Results	ENA	False	Phages of group 2 were found in the 2 isolates of SWE6B-2 (BHN237 and BHN427) and were also similar but not identical in the 2 genomes (82% nucleotide sequence identity over alignable areas). 	BHN191 belonging to SWE6B-3 contained a second prophage that did not correlate with any of the 3 phage groups described by Romero et al [16], but similar sequences can be found in the 2 sequenced isolates SP19-BS75 and JJA (GenBank accession numbers ABAF00000000 and CP000919). 	In both BHN191 and JJA, the phage is located between TIGR4 genes SP_1908 and SP_1909. To further investigate the possible role of the prophages in intraclonal variation and invasive-disease potential, we next studied the presence of phages in all serotype 6B isolates by PCR and performed functional assays of lysogeny by phage induction using mitomycin C [16] (Table 2). 
PMC6486976	KR611522	Results	ENA	False	To investigate the association and diversity of CPV-2 strains circulating in Vietnam, we sequenced and analyzed 16 complete VP2 genes of CPV-2 strains collected from the three regions of Vietnam. 	Phylogenetic analysis based on the nucleotide sequences of the complete VP2 gene revealed two clusters that were prototype CPV-2c strains and Asian CPV-2c clusters (15 isolates from this study together with the Chinese strain [KR611522, KT156832, KT162005, KY937650, and MF467229], and Taiwanese strain [KU244254]) (Fig. 4). 	The VP2 genes of CPV-2c in Vietnam are more genetically similar to CPV-2c strains in China and Taiwan than to prototype CPV-2c strains (FJ222821) or first Vietnamese CPV-2c (AB120727) (Fig. 4). In addition, one Vietnamese strain (DN33) in this study was clustered with a CPV-2a vaccine strain (FJ197847) (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Phylogenetic relationships based on the complete VP2 gene of CPV-2 between.

PMC4299518	AY673970	Methods	ENA	False	Construction of plasmid and plant transformation 	The F-box protein Required for Pathogenicity 1 (FRP1) (Genbank AY673970.1), F. oxysporum Wilt 2 (FOW2) (GenBank AB266616.1) and a previously uncharacterized gene with homology to plant 12-oxophytodienoate-10,11-reductase gene (OPR) (Genbank AFQF01002613) fragments used for the construction of the RNAi constructs were amplified from F. oxysporum cDNA by PCR using the primers shown in Table 1. 	The FRP1 and FOW2 fragments were 817 and 846 bp, respectively and were cloned into the pHannibal intermediate RNAi vector in the sense (XhoI/EcoRI) and antisense (BamHI/XbaI) orientations under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S and the OCS-terminator. The RNAi cassettes were then excised with NotI and cloned into the pUQC247 binary vector. 
PMC4299518	AB266616	Results	ENA	False	For this study we selected three Fusarium genes with different characteristics. 	The first targeted gene, FOW2 (Genbank AB266616.1) encodes a putative transcription regulator belonging to the Zn(II)2Cys6 family and has been shown to be essential for pathogenicity of F. oxysporum f. sp. melonis (Imazaki et al., 2007). FOW2-targeted mutants completely lost pathogenicity, being unable to colonize the roots of the host but were not impaired in vegetative growth or conidiation when grown in culture. 	In addition, mutations in the same gene of a different forma specialis (f. sp. lycopersici) also resulted in loss of pathogenicity, implying the universal importance of the gene for pathogenicity. The second gene selected was FRP1 (Genbank AY673970.1) which encodes an F-box protein that interacts with SKP1 to facilitate targeting of proteins to the SCF-ubiquitination complex. 
PMC4299518	AY673970	Results	ENA	False	In addition, mutations in the same gene of a different forma specialis (f. sp. lycopersici) also resulted in loss of pathogenicity, implying the universal importance of the gene for pathogenicity. 	The second gene selected was FRP1 (Genbank AY673970.1) which encodes an F-box protein that interacts with SKP1 to facilitate targeting of proteins to the SCF-ubiquitination complex. 	FRP1 is necessary for F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopercisi pathogenicity and, as with FOW2, FRP1-deficient mutants were still able to grow in artificial media but did not colonize host plants (Duyvesteijn et al., 2005). The final target of our study is a gene encoding for a protein with homology to 12-oxo-phytodienoate reductase (OPR) (Genbank AFQF01002613), an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid (JA) in plants (Wasternack, 2007). 
PMC4299518	JQ965663	Results	ENA	False	Fungal gene expression levels were determined by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) with gene-specific primers designed to bind outside the DNA fragments used for the RNAi constructs to avoid possible artifacts. 	Levels of F. oxysporum actin (GenBank JQ965663.1) were assumed to remain constant in all fungal cells and were therefore used for normalization of results. 	Optimization experiments showed that all primer pairs were able to amplify their intended specific targets, confirmed by sequencing, with reproducible Ct values (results not shown). Figure 1 shows that for each of the three targeted genes, the mRNA levels in fungi infecting their respective Arabidopsis HD-RNAi lines are lower than those observed in fungi infecting Col-0 controls. FOW2 mRNA levels were reduced by 75 and 78% in the two independent transgenic lines assayed (Figure 1A). 
PMC4299518	JQ965663	Results	ENA	True	Wild type and T3 homozygous transgenic lines expressing the HD-RNAi constructs for (A) FOW2, (B) FRP1, and (C) OPR were infected with F. oxysporum f. sp. conglutinans. 	Total RNA extracted from above-ground tissues of 3-week-old transgenic lines at 7 days post inoculation was used (n = 20) for cDNA synthesis as a template for quantitative real time PCR with pathogen gene-specific primers. F. oxysporum actin levels (GenBank JQ965663.1) were used for normalization purposes. 	For each gene, the relative mRNA level measured in F. oxysporum infecting wild type plants was given the arbitrary value of one and the remaining mRNA levels referred to it. Values shown are means ± SE of three biological replicates. *p ≤ 0.05; **p ≤ 0.005. 
PMC4299518	AAT85970	Discussion	ENA	False	Disruption in FRP1 led to a complete loss of pathogenicity in tomato with mutant fungi unable to colonize the roots (Duyvesteijn et al., 2005). 	The fact that FRP1 is an F-box protein and that it physically interacts with F. oxysporum SKP1 (Genebank AAT85970.1) suggests that FRP1 is part of a SCF ubiquitin kinase complex. 	The F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici FRP1 protein has highly homologous counterparts (86–100% identity) in other Fusarium species (F. oxysporum f. sp. conglutinans; f. sp. cubense races 1 and 4, F. fujikuroi, F. graminearum and F. pseudograminearum) and it is also present in other plant pathogenic fungi such as Colletotrichum graminicola (63% identity) and even non plant pathogenic fungi such as Beauveria bassiana (66% identity) and Neurospora crassa (55% identity). The relatively high level of homology is probably due to the conservation of the F-box motif and points to the suggestion that an FRP1-associated SCF ubiquitin ligase complex plays an important role in degradation of pathogenicity-related proteins through ubiquitination (Duyvesteijn et al., 2005).

PMC3650022	KC347596	Results	ENA	False	This gene was recently shown to encode Eogt [11], and to be conserved in mouse [21]. 	We now show that one of the splice forms of the human gene C3orf64 cloned from HEK 293T cells (GenBank accesssion number KC347596.1), is an active human EOGT homologue. 	To establish that it has EOGT activity, Drosophila S2 cells or S2 cells incubated with a dsRNA designed to target endogenous eogt, were co-transfected with a soluble Drosophila Notch fragment tagged at the C-terminus with alkaline phosphatase (N(EGF1-20)-AP). There are 17 perfect matches to the consensus site for Eogt modification on Drosophila Notch (EGF repeats 3, 5, 9, 11–17, 19, 20, 22, 25–28). 
PMC3650022	KC347596	Discussion	ENA	False		In this paper we identify a transcript of the human EGF-specific O-GlcNAc transferase EOGT that encodes O-GlcNAc transferase activity (Genbank KC347596.1). 	It is identical in sequence (527 aa) to the conceptual protein deduced from the proposed C3orf64 transcript b in AceView [53]. We show that transfection of this EOGT cDNA causes O-GlcNAcylation of Drosphila N, Dl and Ser EGF repeats; it also requires a conserved DXD motif for optimal activity, and it is primarily responsible for the transfer of O-GlcNAc to high molecular weight proteins, including Dp, in Drosophila larvae.

By DNA and cDNA sequence, both ewes were homozygous for TMEM154 A4Δ53 and had TMEM154 “4,4” diplotypes [GenBank: KP142216 - KP142219]. Thus, the TMEM154 DNA and corresponding mRNA sequences were identical, with no evidence of alternate splicing of TMEM154 at the transcript sequence level. 	To verify the infection status of the two seropositive ewes with TMEM154 “4,4” diplotypes, and to characterize the SRLVs they were infected by, nested PCR for SRLV proviral gag was conducted on blood DNAs isolated from the two animals (Table 2). Additionally, the PCR was conducted on blood DNAs from 15 seropositive ewes of the same flock with other TMEM154 diplotypes, to determine if similar SRLVs had infected sheep with or without TMEM154 “4,4” diplotypes (Table 2).

For convenience of description, the full-length cDNA was designated PtrICE1 and has been deposited in GenBank under accession number KJ812152. 	PtrICE1 was predicted to encode a protein of 559 aa, with an estimated molecular mass of 61.2kDa and a pI of 5.27.

PMC3156760	AY029364	Discussion	ENA	False	Although these isoforms differ by N-terminal or internal residues, they all retain the bZIP domain, suggesting that their transcriptional activity is conserved, even if their regulation is intrinsically different [48], [49]. 	Another ATF2 splicing variant is expressed in myometrial tissues during pregnancy/labor (GenBank: AY029364.1) [50]. 	ATF2-small (ATF2-sm) only comprises the first two and last two exons, lacking therefore the most part of the functional domains, i.e. the sequence encompassing the two threonine residues 69 and 71 of the activation domain and the bZIP domain. Nevertheless, it was intriguingly described to exhibit a CRE-binding activity and to be transcriptionally active to an equivalent degree to that of full length ATF2 [50]. 
PMC3156760	BC042363	Methods	ENA	False	The recombinant human ATF7 isoforms used in this study are ATF7-4 and ATF7-1, the latter referred to as ATF7-FL, keeping the amino acid coordinates of the largest protein (ATF7-3, 494 residues) [8]. 	The full sequences of the ATF7-4 transcript (787 nucleotides) and protein (117 amino acids) have been given the GenBank and Swissprot accession numbers BC042363 and Q8IVR8 respectively. 	The pG4-ATF7(2–82) and pG4-ATF2(19–96) plasmids encode the DNA-binding domain of the yeast Gal4 protein fused to the human activation domain of either ATF7-FL (amino acids 2–82) or ATF2 (amino acids 19–96), as previously described [39], [52]. The (17m5)-TK-Luc reporter [61] contains the luciferase gene driven by the thymidine kinase promoter and five Gal4 binding sites.

The results showed that the knockdown of NR_027457 and AF085938 significantly suppressed the cell migration and invasion abilities in vitro (Figure 4A, 4B), while the silencing of G36948 and AK002210 in SVneo cells significantly promoted the cell migration and invasion abilities (Figure 4C, 4D). These results suggest that NR_027457, AF085938, G36948, and AK002210 act as important regulators in the SVneo cell line. 
PMC5646247	CP018363	Article	ENA	False	Curiously, one IS family consisting of six copies (MLM_1414, MLM_1873, MLM_2691, MLM_2913, MLM_3078, and MLM_3876) shows 84% nucleotide identity with the ISMsm2 mobile element from Mycobacterium smegmatis (NCBI accession number WP_003887303). 	A BLAST search showed that this IS family resides in only a few other unrelated mycobacteria and not in the MAC, with the exception of a more diverged copy (with 78% identity) present in the plasmid of M. avium subsp. hominissuis strain 88Br (GenBank accession number KR997898.1) and a truncated copy (with 81% identity) in the genome of M. avium subsp. hominissuis strain H87 (GenBank accession number CP018363.1). 	Strikingly, when we analyzed the genomic synteny between M. lepraemurium, M. intracellulare, and M. avium subsp. hominissuis, all the synteny breaks in M. lepraemurium occurred at the locations of this particular IS (Fig. S3A and B). The synteny plot between M. lepraemurium and M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis looked different from the aforementioned genomes, which is probably due to genomic rearrangements in M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Fig. S3C).

Midpoint rooting is appropriate for this phylogeny since the Paracoccus clade is distant to the Ehrlichia/Anaplasma clade, ensuring consistency with outgroup rooting procedures (58).

Two MLK4 isoforms have different 3′-sequences and an identical 5′-region (1–1936 bp). The 5′ UTR of 261 bp contains an in-frame stop codon at position 118. 
PMC4510602	AAG44591	Discussion	ENA	False	The MLK4 catalytic domain is a hybrid between those in the serine/threonine and tyrosine protein kinases with 69%–72% homology to MLK3 (GenBank accession No. 	NP_002410), MLK1 (GenBank accession No. AAG44591) and MLK2 (GenBank accession No. Q02779); see Figure 2. 	The SRC homology 3 (SH3) domain of MLK4 is similar to that of MLK3 (68% identity), MLK1 (66% identity) and MLK2 (64% identity) (Fig. 2). It is generally assumed that the SH3 domain is involved in specific protein–protein interactions and recognizes proline-rich sequences containing the core PxxP.22 
PMC4510602	AJ311798	Results	ENA	False	The controversial results of the possible involvement of MLK4 and other MLKs in cell proliferation suggest that a more detailed functional study of the MLK family will be necessary. 	Mutational analysis of the MLK4 kinase domain in 147 colorectal cancers revealed a rather high frequency (6.8%) of somatic mutations.31 In this study, our MLK4 sequence was used (GenBank database, accession No. AJ311798). 	However, Shao et al. 2007 did not find any mutations in the MLK4 kinase domain in 46 colorectal samples isolated from Japanese patients and only two of 24 cell lines in the study harbored the mutation R470C in the MLK4 gene.32 No mutations in MLK4 were found in gastric and hepatocellular carcinomas from Korean patients either, suggesting that the MLK4 kinase domain mutations are rare and may not contribute to the development of these carcinomas.33 The relevance of these observations is unclear and currently, no evidence suggests that any MLK family member functions as an oncogene in humans. MLK4β-transgenic mice were produced but, surprisingly, no obvious phenotypical abnormalities were observed compared to the non-transgenic mice after 12 months’ observation.

To generate pXCS-LIB, an adapter (AAGCTTGGCCATTACGGCCAATAGGCCGCCTCGGCCGAATTC, HindIII and EcoRI sites underlined) was ligated into the HindIII and EcoRI site in pXCS-HAStrep. The new constructed plasmid was sequenced using primer LibSeq (5′-TCCTTCGCAAGACCCTTCCT-3′) to confirm right structure. 
PMC6059418	AP018342	Methods	ENA	False	Mt gene orders were examined for all five representatives of the saccopharyngiform families. 	All newly determined mitogenomic DNA sequences were deposited as AP018342–46 in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases (S1 File). 	The 13 protein coding gene sequences contained in the mitogenome were aligned by eye for a total of 79 taxa (S2 File) and the MiFish DNA sequences were aligned using ProAlign [50] including only sites with posterior probabilities of 90% or higher (S3 File). The resultant dataset, including a total of 11,400 base pairs (S2 File), was sectioned into three partitions (-q option) corresponding to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd codon positions of the protein coding genes assuming that codon positions experience more similar selection across genes.

Furthermore, deletion of zitB and zntA has proved zntA as primary transporter to combat high zinc concentrations (Grass et al. 2001). 
PMC5519609	AAH58009	Methods	ENA	False	The X-ray or NMR structure of CFHR3 protein has not yet been successfully determined. 	Starting from the amino acid sequence 19–330 (AAH58009.1), 3D homology-modeled structures of wild-type and mutant CFHR3 were first generated by an integrated platform for automated protein structures called iterative threading assembly refinement (I-TASSER) server (http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/)35. 	The one with the highest value of C-score was selected to be refined closer to the native structure by a molecular dynamics (MD) tool called Fragment-Guided MD simulation (FG-MD)36. Potential energy of refined protein was estimated by “Calculate Energy” protocol of Discovery Studio (DS) 3.0.

We used the placozoan rDNA accessions AY652583.1, AY652578.1, AY652585.1, AY652580.1, AY652587.1, AY652581.1. 	Multiple sequence alignments were generated with MAFFT using the LINSI algorithm for protein sequences (CO1, ND1) and the GINSI algorithm for ribosomal genes (16S, 18S, 28S) with otherwise default settings. Individual alignments were created for each class within Porifera and Cnidaria to reduce unambiguously aligned sites. 
PMC4521924	AB036910	Methods	ENA	False	The HBV viral load was quantified by using a previously described method [39]. 	Samples with more than 2,000 viral copies/ml were subjected to a nested PCR to amplify a portion (879 bp) of the HBV genome (nucleotides 221 to 1100 relative to reference AB036910 strain) which allowed us to differentiate HBV at the sub-genotype level [27]. 	The HBV genotype was first determined by using a web-based program [40] and confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. A dataset with the Panamanian HBV sequences and HBV reference sequences, obtained from Genbank, were aligned by using Muscle v3.8.31 [41].

PMC4008362	SRR057573	Results	ENA	False		To determine whether meta-assembly would improve transcriptome quality across taxa, the meta-assembly process was performed on three archived datasets (Oncopeltus fasciatus: SRR057573; Silene vulgaris: SRR245489; Ictidomys tridecemlineatus: SRR352220) using the same pipeline used to generate the T. biloba transcriptome. 	
PMC4008362	SRR818498	Results	ENA	False	Sepsidae is more closely related to Tephritidae than the drosophilids [17], so it would be expected that higher sequence conservation exists between these two families, and that comparison to a tephritid would identify more transcripts. 	To determine whether such a comparison would identify more transcripts than Drosophila, a transcriptome was constructed using archived Illumina sequence reads from adult male and female Bactrocera dorsalis (SRR818498, SRR818496) [50]. 	Bi-directional alignments were created using T. biloba, B. dorsalis, and D. melanogaster. Contrary to our prediction, the alignments between T. biloba and B. dorsalis did not show increased aligned contigs or even conserved sequence versus Drosophila (Table 5).

PMC4634563	AIE11922	Methods	ENA	False	The search for homologs of the EBOV polymerase and the three-dimensional structure modeling of the EBOV RdRp domain were performed using the PHYRE web server version 2.0 [43]. 	One Zaire Ebola virus L protein sequence (Sierra Leona, Makona-G3686.1; AIE11922) from the current outbreak was downloaded from NCBI’s Viral Genome Resource (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/viruses/). 	The sequence was edited according to the information provided by the Conserved Domain Database [44], leaving only the fragment of the sequence which corresponds to the entry “Mononegavirales RNA dependent RNA polymerase” (CDD 250248). This edited fragment of the protein was used as the PHYRE version 2.0 server query sequence.

PMC4247701	HM585369	Introduction	ENA	False	In our earlier findings, we have reported that exogenous application of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and salicylic acid (SA) increases withanolide content due to the presence of stress regulatory elements within the upstream promoter regions of their genes [20,23]. 	We, in present study report isolation, heterologous expression and transcript profiling of two A-type P450 monooxygenases viz. WsCYP98A (GenBank: HM585369) and WsCYP76A (GenBank: KC008573). 	These are supposed to be involved mainly in the shikmate and phenylpropanoid pathway biosynthesizing the various defence molecules during biotic and abiotic stress. CYP98A (p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase) catalyzes the meta-hydroxylation of p-coumarate derivatives for the biosynthesis of lignins and chlorogenic acid, which constitutes a crucial bottleneck in phenylpropanoid pathway [24]. 
PMC4247701	HM036710	Results	ENA	False	Consensus residues present were shown below.

PMC4000234	U54702	Methods	ENA	False	A consensus sequence derived from alignment of 57 phyocystatin sequences was developed to enhance phytocystatin properties. 	To design the consensus phytocystatin gene, a tBLASTN search of the Genbank database was performed using OSA-I (Oryza sativa; U54702), ZMA2 (Zea mays; D38130) and HAN1 (Helianthus annuus; Q10993) protein sequences as search probes. 	The accession codes and sources of sequences used to derive the consensus sequence are shown in Supplementary Table SI. These coding sequences were translated and aligned using the program MULTALIN (Corpet, 1988). 
PMC4000234	KJ474865	Methods	ENA	False	This consensus protein was then further modified and truncated for use as a non-antibody protein scaffold, termed Adhiron, and an E. coli codon optimised gene was synthesised (GenScript) (Fig. 1A). 	The Adhiron scaffold coding region was cloned between NheI and NotI restriction sites in a phagemid vector pBSTG1 (GenBank accession number KJ474865) developed from pHEN1 (Hoogenboom et al., 1991). 	Cloning into pBSTG1 creates a fusion coding sequence encoding a DsbA secretion signal peptide, Adhiron, TAG codon and C-terminal half of gene III of bacteriophage M13 (Fig. 1B). The resulting phagemid is referred to as pBSTG1-Adh. 
PMC4358728	SRA020131	Results	ENA	False	It provides us an important resource to depict the genetic diversity of wild and cultivated populations, and to detect the footprints of domestication events. 	Thus, we downloaded all the short reads of sequencing soybeans from NCBI Short Read Archive under accession numbers SRA020131, SRA009252, SRP015830, and ERP002622. 	These reads were aligned to the soybean reference genome Glycine max (Phytozome v9) with SOAP2 [15], and were subsequently used to detect SNVs with SOAPsnp pipeline [16]. A total of 9,820,934 SNVs were identified across all accessions, of which 8,168,883 and 5,201,747 appear in wild and cultivars, respectively.

The full-length ZNF366 open reading frame was reconstituted from the pACTII-ZNF366 clone and IMAGE EST clone 5204702 (accession no. BI770486), to generate pCMVSPORT6-ZNF366 in which ZNF366 is C-terminally FLAG-tagged. 	ZNF366 deletion and point mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis according to manufacturer's protocols (Stratagene, UK). 
PMC1693901	BI523869	Results	ENA	False	Human ESTs were identified using the NCBI site () by carrying out a BLAST search against the database of human ESTs, using sequences derived from the yeast 2-hybrid clone. 	The exact intron/exon structure of ZNF366 was established by complete DNA sequencing of overlapping EST IMAGE clones with GenBank accession nos BI523869, 5201353, BI770486 and BE552137 to generate an mRNA sequence encoding a predicted polypeptide of 744 amino acids (Figure 1A), encoded within 5 exons. 	Based on the homology with the Fugu fZF1 gene, this was subsequently confirmed by Gilligan et al. (52). Homology searches identified genes in mouse, rat, dog, chicken and Xenopus tropicalis, having very high amino acid sequence homology (93% or greater) in the zinc finger region and all of which encode 11 zinc fingers (Figure 1B).

The alignment of quality trimmed data of TERIBR1 with reference NRRL3357 (accession number EQ963472) strain was performed using Bowtie2 version 2.2.8. 	SNP with a minimum read depth of 5 and not in vicinity (10 bp) of INDEL were filtered. Candidate genes conferring chromium resistance were selected and SNPs were identified. 
PMC6004538	CP000424	Discussion	ENA	False	As the operon was more highly expressed in the absence of cysteine, it may indeed be involved in the transport of cysteine or of the precursors needed for cysteine biosynthesis. 	This transport system was also found on a plasmid in L. paracasei ATCC 334 (GenBank acc. no.CP000424) but not in other L. paracasei genomes in the GenBank database. 	Since cheese is a cysteine-poor environment, the presence of a cysteine transport system apparently does not provide an evolutionary advantage for this bacterium, which could explain why this transport system is not widely distributed in L. paracasei strains, especially those of dairy origin. Analysis of the RNA-seq data enabled identification of the genes that formed transcriptional units (Figure 3).

The template used for mutagenesis was the coding sequence for mature Tha4 from pea (Pisum sativum; GenBank accession no. AAD33943) lacking the chloroplast targeting peptide; the protein sequence begins with “MAFFGLGVPE…” (Fincher et al., 2003) and is labeled starting with the N-terminal methionine as position 1. 	All Tha4 constructs were cloned into pGEM4Z (Promega). All cpTatC constructs were prepared from pSSU13pre-cpTatC, which was constructed by splice overlap extension (Horton et al., 1989) and contains the transit peptide and first 13 residues of the mature domain of the pea (P. sativum) small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bis-phosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (GenBank accession no.

A mixture of the oligonucleotides (10 ng each) was used in a first-round ten cycles of PCR procedure using pfu polymerase to generate most sections of the coding sequence. Then, the region for XhoI restriction site and Kex2 and Ste13 cleavage sites of α-factor signal sequence of P. pastoris were added to the 5′ terminal of the synthesized fragment in the second-round PCR using the most 5′ end primer N1 (see Table 1).

Because the genome of P. multocida 0818 has not been sequenced, all of the primers designed for P. multocida 0818 in Table 2 were based on the genomic sequence of P. multocida Pm70 (AE004439.1) (25). P. multocida was cultured in Bacto brain heart infusion (BHI) broth (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA), and Salmonella Choleraesuis and Escherichia coli were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth. 	The antibiotics and reagents used in this study were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). LB broth, BHI broth, and chromoazurol S (CAS) broth were routinely used (26).

Typhimurium fur (Gene ID 1252213) or E. coli fur (Gene ID 945295); however, the 441-bp sequence of the Pm70 fur gene was predicted to encode a 146-amino acid polypeptide, which showed 67% identity to both S. Typhimurium Fur (Protein ID, AAL19637.1) and E. coli Fur (Protein ID, CDZ19538.1). 	Thus, we proposed that this protein might perform the same functions as other Fur proteins. To further evaluate the functionality of P. multocida Fur, Δfur mutants of S.

When subcloned as a humanized IgG4P (serine-to-proline mutation at residue 241 to reduce propensity for Fab-arm exchange31) isotype, this antibody is known as rozanolixizumab (Supplementary Figure 1; these sequence data have been submitted to the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases under accession number MG976502 (light chain) and MG976503 (heavy chain)). 	Rozanolixizumab was humanized using CDR-grafting.32 Under the 2014 INN/WHO method for assigning generic names, rozanolixizumab was given the -xizu- sub-stem, designating it a chimeric/humanized molecule; the chimeric designation was assigned due to sequence similarities with Macaque monkey IgG sequences, however, no Macaque monkey sequences were used in the humanization process. This designation has been criticized and used as an example in the literature to show some of the inaccuracies and inconsistencies with the INN/WHO system;33,34 the naming system has subsequently been revised and superseded.34

PMC6175101	BM815987	Results	ENA	False	In a preliminary expression analysis with all three genes, we found that LOX2.A displayed a more consistent response to −K than did the other HvLOX2 genes identified, and therefore, we selected it for further study. 	No VSP homologue was found in the available barley nucleotide or protein sequence databases, but a number of Me‐JA‐induced genes (“JA‐induced proteins”, JIPs) have been identified (Andresen et al., 1992; Weidhase et al., 1987). HvJIP60 (BM815987), used here, encodes a ribosome‐inactivating protein with glycosidase activity (Chaudhry et al., 1994; Dunaeva, Goebel, Wasternack, Parthier, & Goerschen, 1999; Reinbothe et al., 1994). 	Three barley genes, encoding α‐tubulin (Hvα‐TUB, U40042), glyceraldehyde 3‐phosphate dehydrogenase (HvGAPDH, M36650), and ubiquitin (HvUBQ, M60175), were tested for their suitability as reference genes by determining the variation of Ct values and the frequency distribution of transcript levels obtained by qPCR across a number of different conditions (Supporting Information Figure S5). From this analysis, Hvα‐TUB emerged as a robust constitutive reference and was used for normalization of transcript levels.

Two representative clones were obtained for the group and completely sequenced (AF254576). 	An open reading frame was identified from nucleotides 9–356, with the ATG at nucleotide 9 having a good match to the translation initiation start site consensus for vertebrates (CCCAGCAUGC versus GCCA/GCCAUGG) (Kozak 1991). To demonstrate expression of the gene, the coding sequence was used to probe a Northern blot, which identified a signal of ∼900 bp in testis (Fig. 1 a).

PMC3710569	D00869	Methods	ENA	False		As in Wallny et al. (2006), peptides were predicted from VP2 sequence derived from F52/70 (accession number D00869.2) by using the GCG program FINDPATTERNS (Anonymous 1991) and relaxed motifs for the dominantly expressed class I molecules of two chicken haplotypes. 	These relaxed motifs allow both octamers and nonamers with all residues found in anchor positions by pool sequencing (Wallny et al. 2006). The motifs are denoted for FINDPATTERNS by the notation xxx(x,xx)(V,I)xx(V,L,I) for B12 and xRxxxx(x,xx)Y for B15, in which x denotes any amino acid, single capital letters refer to amino acids in the IUPAC single letter code and parentheses enclose alternatives, so (x,xx) means either one or two amino acids, and (V,L,I) means either valine, leucine or isoleucine.

However, much of the HA drift is due to frequent aa mutations, so that HA positives (as defined by BLAST) are still 91% between 1934 Puerto Rico and 1976 New Jersey. 
PMC4309245	ACB11812	Methods	ENA	False	As was shown in [1], Hawaii 2007 consists mainly of two hydropathically recognizable subsets, one labeled “Brisbane,” and the other, “Solomon Islands.” The differences in their NA R MZ(17) are large (30% of the historical shift from strain A to strain D*) [1], while their HA R MZ(1) differences are only 1.5% of R MZ(1), which is only 2∑, where ∑ is the sum of the σ's of each subset [1]. 	From HA Hawaii 2007 we selected two sequences (ACB11812, Brisbane and ACA33672, Solomon Islands) with the largest BLAST nonpositive differences and the largest R MZ(1) differences. 	Their 〈ψ(j)111〉 chain profiles exhibit a striking sign difference reversal near 180, presumed to be associated with a change in sialic acid binding (Figure 4). A smaller window value of W = 75 shifts the crossover to below 180 and introduces secondary sign reversals, apparently associated with inadequate sliding window resolution (essentially Fresnel fringes associated with hydropathic waves at the sharp sialic acid edges). 
PMC4309245	ABN59434	Conclusion	ENA	False	Such cumulative mechanical effects are even the cause of stiff α helix/soft β strand transitions in 56 aa proteins that share 88% sequence identity [28]. 	Here in 577 aa proteins the sequence identities are even higher, Rome 1949-Ft Warren1950: 94% identity (ABN59434-Q288V2). 	Mechanical effects dependent on stiff/soft alternation are a common theme in structures like bone, which are strong but not brittle (high yield strength) [29]. Mechanical effects are one of the dominant factors in ligand binding [30]. 
PMC4309245	ACU80014	Figure	ENA	True	HA (1–565) is structurally separated into head HA1 (18–342) and stalk HA2 (344–565) parts, the latter being attached to the membrane. 	The head hydroprofiles of the two historic HA strains, Fort Dix 1976 (Genbank ACU80014) and Puerto Rico 1934 (P03452), are compared with a modern (vaccination moderated) strain, New York ACQ84467. 	The origin of the severity of the 1976 Fort Dix strain is explained by its strongly hydrophobic head amino acid content, especially near site 110. The advent of swine flu (2001–2007) and the response (2009–2011) to its vaccination program flattened (smoothed) current strains (like New York 2009) and reduced their virulence. 
PMC4309245	ADT78876	Figure	ENA	True	Studies with the epitope covering 108–122 of mice infected with the three strains shown here would be well worth further effort. 	The 〈ψ(j)111〉 chain profiles of four HA1 sequences, Netherlands 1954 (ADT78876), Fort Dix outbreak 1976 (ACU80014), postvaccination California 1978 (ABY81349, identical to Memphis 1983), and Texas 1986 (ABO44123), cut off at 266 (A1 chain only) to show more clearly mutational trends below 220. 	The Fort Dix outbreak increased hydrophobicity, especially below 150. After the 1976-77 vaccination program, in 1978–86 hydrophobicity dropped below the 1954 level in the region 120–230, spanning the two sialic acid binding sites determined crystallographically [7]. 
PMC4309245	ACB11812	Figure	ENA	True	After the 1976-77 vaccination program, in 1978–86 hydrophobicity dropped below the 1954 level in the region 120–230, spanning the two sialic acid binding sites determined crystallographically [7]. 	The 〈ψ(j)111〉 HA1 chain profiles (55 < j < 311) of Genbank Brisbane ACB11812 (B) and Solomon Islands ACA33672 (A) [Hawaii 2007]. 	The key B-A mutations are K64I, MT (205, 206) KA, and N238D. The left-right difference crossover near 180 can be described as a hydropathic twist. 
PMC4309245	ABO44123	Figure	ENA	True	The advent of swine flu also caused the HA1 block below 130 to increase hydrophobically almost identically in New York in 2003 and in Berlin in 2005, as shown here. 	The Genbank sequences used here are ABO44123 (Texas 1986), ACL 12261 (Siena 1989), ACI32714 (Berlin 2005), AAX56530 (New York 2000), and ABB82205 (New York 2003).

PMC6230719	AAY32316	Introduction	ENA	False	Twenty-six T. spiralis genes, which putatively encode DNase II homologs, have been identified from the AWs and NBL cDNA library, 15 of these genes are expressed in NBL and 11 genes are expressed in AWs (Liu et al., 2008; Liao et al., 2014). 	In our previous studies, T. spiralis adult-specific DNase II-1 (TsDNase II-1, GenBank: AAY32316.1)/TsDNase II-7 (GenBank: AAY32322.1) was identified from AWs and IIL excretory–secretory (ES) or surface proteins by immunoproteomics (Liu R.D. et al., 2015, 2016a,b; Wang et al., 2017). 	In this study, we cloned and expressed the two T. spiralis adult-specific DNase II (TsDNase II-1 and TsDNase II-7) enzymes. Their biological characteristics were investigated, and their role as potential vaccine candidate target molecules against trichinellosis was evaluated in mice. 
PMC6230719	AY963695	Methods	ENA	False		The complete cDNA sequence of TsDNase II-1 (GenBank: AY963695.1) and TsDNase II-7 (GenBank: AY963701.1) were analyzed by the open reading frame (ORF) finder program in the NCBI website. 	The conserved domains of the two proteins were predicted using the Conserved Domain Database of NCBI (Long et al., 2014). Amino acid sequences of TsDNase II-1 and TsDNase II-7 were submitted to an online tool1 for predicting their molecular weights (MWs) and isoelectric points (pI). 
PMC6230719	AAY32316	Results	ENA	True		Amino acid sequence alignment of Trichinella spiralis TsDNase II-1 (AAY32316.1) and TsDNase II -7 (AAY32322.1) with the DNase II of other Trichinella species and other organisms. 	The other DNase II were WbDAII (Wuchereria bancrofti, EJW85434.1), CeCRN-7 (Caenorhabditis elegans, NP_498817.1), TnDAII (Trichinella nativa, OUC49849.1), MmDAIIα (Mus musculus, NP_034192.1), HsDAIIα (Homo sapiens, NP_001366.1), TpDAIIα (Trichinella pseudospiralis, KRY93508.1), TmDAIIα (Trichinella murrelli, KRX36402.1), and TbDAIIα (Trichinella britovi, KRY55822.1).

PMC3685763	JF819666	Results	ENA	False	From the 77 EBIs, PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments were sequenced, and all isolates were identified as a result of nucleotide blast (megablast) hits analysis. 	Seventy-seven EBI's annotated 16S rRNA gene fragments nucleotide sequences have been submitted to the GenBank/DDBJ/EMBL under accession numbers: JF819666-JF819685, and JF938917-JF938973. 	Analysis of identified 77 EBIs revealed that agarwood-producing 7 Aquilaria species are harboring 18 different types of bacterial endophytes. Figure 1 show the total number of isolates of identified 18 types of bacterial endophytes, and the identified bacterial endophytes and their respective host (Aquilaria) species are depicted in Table 1. 
PMC3685763	JF819683	Discussion	ENA	False	The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity % was >95%, except for one isolate, where the similarity % was only 82%. 	This isolate (from A. subintegra) was putatively identified as Pantoea agglomerans (Accession no: JF819683) and need further verification. 	Though 9 species of the bacterial endophytes are represented by only one isolate, it cannot be inferred that they are respective Aquilaria species-specific, because sample numbers used in the study were limited (in number) and samples were from only one plant of each Aquilaria species. The seasonal fluctuation of the endophytes has been reported in other plant species;[1920] hence, it is possible that various other types of bacterial endophytes might be also associated with agarwood-producing Aquilaria species. 
PMC4916946	JQ673480	Methods	ENA	False	KOS-37 BAC, containing the complete strain KOS HSV-1 genome on a BAC,37 was kindly provided by David Leib (Dartmouth Medical School, NH). 	The HSV unique short (US) region in this BAC is in the reverse orientation relative to the published sequence (positions 132,503–145,393) of HSV-1 KOS38 (GenBank Accession number JQ673480). 	All modifications of this vector were introduced by Red/ET-mediated Recombination using the Gene Bridges Counter-Selection BAC modification kit with primers designed to generate homology arms for recombination into the BAC (Table 1). First, KOS-37 BAC was modified by replacement of the internal repeat region of the HSV genome (117,078–131,902 of JQ673480) with a modified GW cassette. 
PMC4916946	JQ673480	Methods	ENA	False	The final recombinant BACs were referred to as T-GW. 	A second tk promoter (47,976–47,744 of JQ673480) and TRPV1 coding sequence were inserted in place of the UL41 (host shut-off, vhs) promoter and coding sequence, replacing positions 91,088–92,699 of JQ673480, using the technique described above. 	The counter-selection cassette was PCR amplified using primers CS_UL41F and CS_UL41R; the tk promoter-driven TRPV1 cDNA was amplified from the previously described T-GW BAC using primers VR1_UL41F and VR1_UL41R. Finally, the ampicillin resistance gene from pcDNA3.1 was recombined into the BAC genome between UL55 and UL56 (after position 116,070 of JQ673480).

These DNA sequences were then analysed using the Clustal W and BLAST programmes [13, 14]. To obtain more information, the cbhI genes were also deduced after alignment against the known cbhI mRNA sequences (P. ostreatus sp. 'Florida' [AM262873.1 and AM262871.1], Flammulina velutipes Fv-1 [AB540999.1], and Irpex lacteus [AB019376.1]).

PMC3997481	BC043409	Introduction	ENA	False	Based on the reported transcripts, each promoter of KCNH5 is predicted to give rise to two protein isoforms, resulting in four predicted isoforms for KCNH5. 	Unexpectedly, one pKCNH5 mRNA and two EST sequences in Genbank were derived from melanotic melanoma (BC043409, BQ439615 and BX281706). 	The KCNH5 gene (also known as EAG2), encodes an EAG voltage-gated potassium channel that is involved in the regulation of cell cycle and proliferation [21]. Previous work investigating the oncogenic potential of a closely related EAG potassium channel (EAG1/KCNH1; ∼70% homologous to KCNH5 [22], [23]) detected expression in several somatic cancer cell lines (including melanoma), normal adult brain and placenta, but not in other normal somatic cells [21].

An EST sequence from Lolium perenne (GR509039) indicates its presence in land plants. 	In the stramenopile A. anophagefferens the domain is coupled with a WD40 repeat-like domain. A special case of this independent occurrence is the apicortin where the partial p25alpha domain is combined with a DCX (Pfam03607, IPR003533) domain [38].

PMC6521586	CP028791	Results	ENA	False		Isolate CX90 from Patient X had an additional large IncFIB (Mar) blaOXA-1-positive (284 904 bp) plasmid which had high sequence similarity to a previously sequenced 288 222 bp virulence plasmid isolated from a human host at Chengdu, Sichuan, in July 2016 (CP028791.1). 	As well as carrying AMR genes involved in fluoroquinolone and aminoglycoside resistance (aac(6')Ib-cr), phenicol resistance (catB3), rifampicin resistance (arr-3) and sulphonamide resistance (sul1), this plasmid carried the previously identified rmpA and rmpA2 markers of hypermucovisity and iucABCD operon involved in aerobactin synthesis (Fig. 2). This plasmid was absent from all isolates other than those from Patient X. Because these two highly related isolates were not involved in further transmissions to other patients (Fig. 1a), it is likely that this plasmid was acquired de novo by the strain infecting Patient X (Fig. 4, Tables S8 and S9).

We selected two rpoB sequences (Genbank accessions KY629892 and KY629911) from a study of vampire bat Bartonella [16] for which the same individuals exhibited 100% identity in the gltA gene to our blood sequences, and we used Bowtie2 to map quality filtered reads and contigs to those sequences [69]. 	Lastly, because nucleic acid pools were DNase treated for metagenomic sequencing, potentially reducing detection sensitivity, we used the same nested PCR protocol as used for blood-derived DNA [51] to test for the presence of gltA in DNA from individual saliva and fecal swab samples that made up metagenomic pools (n = 58; 28 saliva and 30 feces). As with our blood samples, we randomly selected a subset of positive amplicons for Sanger sequencing.

Our BLAST procedure also identified weakly related Bartonella from rodents (e.g., 90% to Rattus norvegicus from the United States [KC763951] and 92% to Apodemus agrarius from China [KX549996]) and from carnivores (e.g., 89% to Procyon lotor from the United States [CP019786]).

PMC3592801	GU216763	Results	ENA	False	Each one of these matches was subsequently screened on the basis of the degree of homology and degree of sequence continuity with the full length and mature sequences of each of the 8 previously identified cellular miRNAs. 	These analyses resulted in the discovery of a perfect match (100%) from nucleotide positions 1 through 18 of the mature hsa-miR-195 sequence, including the seed region at nucleotide positions 2–7, within the envelope (env) protein-coding sequences of an HIV-1 isolate from South Africa (accession #GU216763) (Table 2). 	Two other isolates, #GU216768 and #GU216773, from the same individual also showed homology with hsa-miRNA-195 in the same region of the Env gene and again matched miR-195 at positions 1–18, with 17 of 18 (94%) nucleotides matching perfectly (Table 2). This single nucleotide mutation (i.e. 17 versus 18 nucleotides) represents the genetic diversity due to mutations known to be present in all HIV-1 envelope genes of both acute and chronically HIV-1 infected individuals [29]. 
PMC3592801	GU216763	Results	ENA	False	This single nucleotide mutation (i.e. 17 versus 18 nucleotides) represents the genetic diversity due to mutations known to be present in all HIV-1 envelope genes of both acute and chronically HIV-1 infected individuals [29]. 	In addition to the sequence homology in the South African HIV-1 isolates (#GU216763), we have identified two other strains from Tanzania, #HM215313 and #DQ199139, whose Env gene sequences also matched with the same region of hsa-miR-195 at 17 of 18 nucleotide positions, as in the GU216763 isolate (Table 2). 	Identification of HIV-ENV Gene Homology Domains in Other Cellular microRNAs Analyses of the remaining seven cellular miRNAs that were predicted to be associated with multiple dysregulated proteins expressed in our experimentally HIV-infected cells (Table 1) also showed sequence similarities between 4 microRNA sequences and the env regions of several other HIV-1 strains (Tables 3, 4). 
PMC3592801	GU216763	Results	ENA	True	The hsa-miR-195-like region is shown in blue. 	The mismatches between the HXB2 sequence and the miR-like sequence present in the African strain #GU216763 are due to the sequence variations in envelope regions of all HIV genomes. 	
PMC3592801	K03455	Results	ENA	False	While detailed maps of the env region exist for several HIV-1 strains, there is no map at present for the HIV-1 genomes from Africa in which we found the greatest homology. 	We therefore cross-referenced our sequence with the HXB2 strain (Clade B) for which a detailed map is available (GenBank accession number K03455). 	The HXB2 genome is used as a common reference strain for many different functional studies, and it has a standardized position numbering scheme available at the Los Alamos National Laboratory website (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/). The alignment given in Table 5 can be cross-referenced with the nucleotide-specific map of the HXB2 strain and indicates that the ‘hsa-miRNA-195-like’ sequence maps to the segment from position 7611 through 7628 within the env gene of the HXB2 genome (Figure 2). 
PMC3592801	GU216763	Discussion	ENA	False	Further, the potential action of a miRNA is mostly dependent on base pairing between the miRNA seed sequence and its target; positions 13–16 of the miRNA may aid in pairing as well [5], [36]. 	The miR-195-like sequence we have identified in #GU216763 contains both the seed region and positions 13–16 of hsa-miR-195 and is 100% conserved in these regions. 	It has also been predicted computationally that the cellular hsa-miR-195 may interact with the HIV-1 Nef in the3’ LTR region based on a perfect complementarity of a 7 nucleotide seed sequence with its viral target [31]. Whether the microRNA-like sequences are of viral origin or products of provirus integration millions of years ago remains to be explored.

PMC2834773	AB259783	Results	ENA	False	Identification of a Vrs1 paralog in barley 	The best hit (E-value, e-110) from a BLASTN search based on the Vrs1 cDNA sequence (accession no. AB259783) as a query was the barley full-length cDNA clone Hv2074A10 (accession no. AB490233) extracted from the seedling shoots and root of cv. 	Haruna Nijo (NIAS barley database). Four lesser hits (E-values < e-10) were also identified from the same library. 
PMC2834773	AC216056	Results	ENA	False	Identification of Vrs1 homologues in the Poaceae 	The Vrs1 cDNA sequence was used to query each species database in turn. Vrs1 homologues were present in rice (Os07g0581700, Oshox14), B. distachyon (Bradi1g23460.1), sorghum (Sb02g03750), and maize (AC216056.2_FG006 and AC187394.3_FG016). 	The presence of two (rather than just one) Vrs1 homologues in maize probably reflects the cryptic tetraploidy of the maize genome (Paterson et al. 2004; Swigonova et al. 2004; Wei et al. 2007). BLASTN search using HvHox2 as the query sequence produced the same hits. 
PMC2834773	AB490234	Discussion	ENA	False	On the basis of polypeptide sequences, it seems likely that the molecular role of HvHox2 and its Poaceae orthologs is identical. 	Within barley itself, the genome sequence of HvHox2 (accession no. AB490234) in the two-rowed type (KNG and Haruna Nijo) is the same as that in the six-rowed type (AZ and Morex) (Supplementary Fig. 1), whereas the Vrs1 sequence is remarkably variable among these same cultivars (Komatsuda et al. 2007). 	The lack of a Oshox14 mutant in the Tos17 insertion mutant collection (Hirochika 2001) does not contradict with the notion that HvHox2 is essential for plant growth and development in the cereals. In contrast, the loss of Vrs1 function both in natural variants, and in many induced mutants (including the total deletion of the gene) indicates that Vrs1 is non-essential for plant growth and development (Komatsuda et al. 2007).

The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain NA2 shows the highest level of sequence similarity with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strain: DGM3 (98.01%) (JQ707953) as shown in Figure 2. 	
PMC5136706	AF342790	Methods	ENA	False	Maximum parsimony was not used for the following reasons: performing maximum parsimony analyses with sufficient number of bootstrap replicates turned out to be extremely time consuming using MEGA (Tamura et al. 2013) or MESQUITE (Maddison and Maddison 2015) and is unlikely to be used in such way in metabarcoding studies. 	Halicryptus spinulosus sequence (AF342790) was used to root all phylogenetic trees. 	Monophyletic clades with bootstrap support of 70% and higher were considered well supported and fully resolved.

PMC5577242	J04431	Discussion	ENA	False	In the nucleus, this complex acts as a transcriptional activator or inhibitor by binding to a GC response element (GRE) in the promoter of a target gene. 	When we analyzed the promoter regions of TGF-β genes using the MatInspector V2.2 program56, our results showed that the promoters of the human (GenBank Accession # J04431), rat (GenBank Accession # AF239170 and # AF249327) and mouse (GenBank Accession # M57902) TGF-β1 gene have binding sites for consensus GRE (5′-AGAACA). 	These observations support the hypothesis that GCs may be involved in the regulation of TGF-β genes inhibited in skeletal tissue after denervation by a GR pathway. The results in this study are important from a clinical standpoint because reduction of bone formation is a significant metabolic response in denervated patients. 
PMC5104453	KM670093	Methods	ENA	False	Identification and Cloning of LdCAS 	To screen for potential OSCs, we performed a TBLASTX search in the transcriptome assembly of L. dendroidea [38] using the nucleotide sequence of the characterized A. annua cycloartenol synthase (CAS) (GenBank accession KM670093 [39]) as query. 	The domain composition of the sequence coding for the OSC from L. dendroidea was obtained through search for conserved domains using the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Conserved Domain Database (CDD) [40]. Afterwards, L. dendroidea specimens obtained from an unialgal culture (see 38 for details) were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to a fine powder using a mortar and pestle.

A complete homologous search by BLAST demonstrated that the nucleotide and putative protein sequence had, respectively, sequence identities of 91% and 95% with the published D. salina G3PDH with NAD+ as coenzyme (AY845323.1), 83% and 78% with D. viridis G3PDH1 (EU624406.1), 76% and 72% with D. viridis G3PDH2 (EU624407.1), which indicated that the protein encoded by the obtained cDNA in this study might belong to the G3PDH family with NAD+ as coenzyme. 	The Conserved Domain Database (CDD) provided by NCBI was employed to predict the structural and functional region (Fig. 2), which manifested that the putative polypeptide from D. salina contained three conserved regions including phosphoserine phosphatase (SerB) domain, N- and C- terminals binding to NAD+ (Fig. 2). Using Pfam database to search and predict the structural and functional domain of this putative polypeptide gained a similar result as shown by Fig. 3. 
PMC3633914	AY845323	Discussion	ENA	False	The G3PDH protein deduced from G3PDH cDNA contains 699 amino acids, of which the molecular weight is 76.6 kDa and the isoelectric point is 6.49, with −3.33 charge in pH 7.0. 	This G3PDH gene and protein had 91% and 95% identity with the putative G3PDH gene sequence (AY845323.1) and protein (AAX56341.1) [20]. 	The putative G3PDH protein contained 701 amino acids, with the molecular weight of 76.9 kDa, isoelectric point of 6.1 and −6.08 charge in pH 7.0 environment. So, it was showed some certain structural differences between them, and also reflected the diversity and complicity of G3PDH isoenzyme with NAD+ as coenzyme.

PMC2490746	AB079873	Methods	ENA	False	The Oryza sativa Dmc1A and Dmc1B genes were expressed even in rice somatic cells, which were maintained on culture medium containing an auxin, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) (33,34). 	Accordingly, full-length cDNA sequences encoding the Oryza sativa DMC1A and DMC1B proteins (NCBI accession nos. AB079873 and AB079874, respectively) were amplified from total RNA preparations from the cultured cells of rice (O. sativa, cv. 	Nipponbare), by using the standard protocols for reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE and 3′-RACE). The DNA fragments containing the Oryza sativa Dmc1A and Dmc1B coding sequences were then inserted into the pZErO-2 plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and were further subcloned into the NdeI-BamHI sites of the pET-15b vector (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany). 
PMC4186419	EU581860	Methods	ENA	False	Vector characteristic and in vivo gene delivery 	The pGL4.32[luc2P/NF-κB-RE/Hygro] vector (GenBank/EMBL Accession Number EU581860) contains five copies of an NF-κB responsive element (NF-κB-RE) that drives transcription of the luciferase reporter gene luc2P (Photinus pyralis). 	Luc2P is a synthetically derived luciferase sequence with humanized codon optimization that is designed for high expression and reduced anomalous transcription. The luc2P gene contains hPEST, a protein destabilization sequence. 
PMC4687411	Z83834	Methods	ENA	False	Phylogenetic analyses at the amino acid level were performed using the DNAMAN software with the parameters “observed divergency” and “toss gaps”, and the support for the branching arrangements was evaluated by bootstrap analysis using 1000 replicates. 	The GenBank accession numbers of Arabidopsis AtMLO1–AtMLO15, barley HvMLO (Z83834), and maize ZmMLO1 (AY029312) came from Devoto et al. (2003). 	The other MLOs used were tomato SlMLO1 (AY967408) and pea PsMLO1 (FJ463618). The predicted MLO proteins in the cucurbit crops cucumber, watermelon and melon were screened from the cucurbit genomics database5 (Huang et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2013) and melonomics (Garcia-Mas et al., 2012). 
PMC4687411	CGN20854	Results	ENA	False		Interestingly, the sequences of the insertion fragments of haplotype A and CGN20854 were nearly identical (95.6% identity), with one short fragment duplication (Target Site Duplication, TSD) 5′-ATTAT-3′ and 5′-CCTTT-3′ flanking both sides of the insertions of haplotype A and CGN20854, respectively (Supplementary Figure S4A). 	There were 184 bp and 196 bp identical long terminal repeats (LTRs) at both ends of the insertion sequences (after and before the TSD) of haplotype A and CGN20854, respectively (Supplementary Figure S4B). Moreover, BLASTN analysis of the insertion sequences in TAIR13 was performed and the best hit was a transposable element gene, AT3G30815.1, which is a member of Copia-like retrotransposon family.

There were 184 bp and 196 bp identical long terminal repeats (LTRs) at both ends of the insertion sequences (after and before the TSD) of haplotype A and CGN20854, respectively (Supplementary Figure S4B). 	Moreover, BLASTN analysis of the insertion sequences in TAIR13 was performed and the best hit was a transposable element gene, AT3G30815.1, which is a member of Copia-like retrotransposon family. Therefore, the results showed that the function of CsMLO1 was disturbed via insertion mutations in haplotype A, by integration of a transposable element (TE) similar to the Copia LTR-retrotransposon. 
PMC4687411	CGN20854	Results	ENA	False	Compared with the susceptible line S05, the S1003 and R077 lines showed low levels of truncated transcripts, whereas lines PI197088-R and CGN20854 showed similar bands to S05 (Figure 5B). 	Sequence analysis of the transcripts of S1003, R077, PI197088-R, and CGN20854 further showed that the entire 11th exon (174 bp) and fifth exon (61 bp) were lost in S1003 and R077, respectively, the transcript of PI197088-R had a 1-bp insertion compared with that of S05 at the 15th exon, and the transcript of CGN20854 shared the same 1725-bp CDS as that of the susceptible line S52, which had 1-bp difference from that of S1001 (Supplementary Figure S5A). 	The cDNA of the CsMLO1 allele in 9930 was also sequenced and was the same as that of R077 (Supplementary Figure S5A). Additionally, three other cDNAs were obtained by transcriptome analysis for S1003 and one of them stemmed from the insertion of the 1449-bp DNA fragment into the CsMLO1 genomic sequence (Supplementary Figure S5B).

PMC5538324	AJ784260	Methods	ENA	False	Genetic distances among 20 B. tabaci cryptic species (19 reported in previous studies and one new cryptic species detected in this study) were calculated as mean Kimura two-parameter sequence divergences as implemented in MEGA 6.06 (Tamura et al. 2013) and tabled as a distance matrix (Table 2). 	Sequence of Bemisia afer (Priesner and Hosny) (AJ784260) and sequence of Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood) (AF418672) were selected as outgroups (see Fig. 2). 	The phylogenetic tree was constructed using Bayesian methods as implemented in MrBayes (ver 3.1; Huelsenbeck et al. 2001). The most appropriate model of sequence evolution (GTR + I+gamma) was selected using Modeltest (ver. 3.7; Posada and Crandall 1998).

PMC3784485	M92818	Results	ENA	False	For most strains, the only available sequences in the Genbank database are the 522-bp fragment of the gp21 env gene. 	We therefore compared the gp21 env gene fragments of seven proviral sequences from Australia, including five new proviral strains (Aus-Cs, Aus-DF, Aus-NR, Aus-GN and Aus-GM) and two previously characterized sequences (MSHR-1 and Aus-RDJ) (Genbank: M92818 and JX891480, respectively) [15], [25], with HTLV-1 proviral strains from PNG (MEL1, MEL2 and MEL7), Vanuatu (EM5, VAN54, VAN136, VAN251 and PE376) and the Solomon Islands (MEL3 to MEL6 and MEL8 to MEL10) [9], [13], [18], [31]. 	Phylogenetic analyses performed with both NJ and ML methods clearly demonstrate the existence of three subgroups: “Papua New Guinean”, “Solomon/Vanuatu” and “Australian”, within the HTLV-1c subtype. Furthermore, inside the Australian subgroup, which comprises all the 7 Australian proviral strains, two distinct clades are now observed. 
PMC3784485	M85207	Results	ENA	False	Unfortunately, no complete LTR proviral sequence from PNG is available in the sequences databases. 	However, phylogenetic analysis based on a partial 627-bp fragment of the LTR region, including the PNG-1 strain from Papua New Guinea (Genbank: M85207), clearly confirmed the existence of three distinct clades within the HTLV-1c subtype (data not shown) [32].

In addition, two of these complete proviral sequences were selected as the representative prototypes of each Australian clade (“Northern” clade, Aus-NR; “Southern” clade, Aus-GM. The general genomic organization of these two prototypic sequences is similar to that of HTLV-1 prototypes ATK-1 and MEL5 strains (Genbank: J02029 and L02534, respectively). 
PMC3784485	J02029	Results	ENA	False	In addition, two of these complete proviral sequences were selected as the representative prototypes of each Australian clade (“Northern” clade, Aus-NR; “Southern” clade, Aus-GM. 	The general genomic organization of these two prototypic sequences is similar to that of HTLV-1 prototypes ATK-1 and MEL5 strains (Genbank: J02029 and L02534, respectively). 	The overall range of nucleotide divergence of the first complete Australian strains from the prototypes ATK-1 and MEL5 was 7.8–8% and 3.3–3.4% respectively. The nucleotide homology between these two Australian prototypic sequences was 98.9% (102 differences over 9,046-bp).

PMC4682501	EF462198	Results	ENA	False	The length of phage SMSAP5 genome was 45,552 bp with 33 % G+C contents. 	As the results of genome sequence were searched by blastn, the Phage SMSAP5 sequence shared a high nucleotide similarity (89%) with the bacteriophage tp310-2 (accession number: EF462198). 	Bioinformatic analysis of the phage SMSAP5 genome revealed 43 putative ORFs. A total of 28 ORFs were similar to gene in the GenBank with annotated function. 
PMC4682501	EGS98875	Results	ENA	False	Moreover, the protein encoded by ORF41 showed 100% similarity to the phage portal protein of Staphylococcus phage phi 12. 	The protein encoded by ORF23 in the lysogenic region was identified as a site-specific recombinase (accession number: EGS98875). 	In the replication modules, ORF1 showed 100% identity to HNH endonuclease of S. aureus A9754. HNH endonucleases are small DNA binding and digestion proteins characterized by two His residues and an Asn residue (Moodley et al., 2012). 
PMC4910261	SRP069020	Results	ENA	False	Availability of the data and materials 	Sequence data have been uploaded to the GenBank under SRA accession number SRP069020. 	All materials used for nasal brushing and washing were processed as regular samples using the same QIAGEN DNA purification kit and PCR protocols. No PCR band was visible on an agarose gel. 
PMC4981870	SRP050172	Results	ENA	False	We submitted 50 Arabidopsis genes known to control xylem cell specification for neighborhood-based gene prioritization in the PoplarGene web service (see Supplementary Figure S3A for the workflow), which returned 2,399 new candidate poplar genes. 	We then used poplar RNA-seq transcriptome data (Sequence Read Archive ID: SRP050172)5, which were obtained from a comparative study of gene expression in xylem and leaf tissue, to validate the new candidate genes. 	The top 100 candidate genes were significantly more differentially expressed in xylem versus leaf tissue than 100 randomly selected poplar genes (P = 5.2 × e−10, Wilcoxon rank sum test; Fig. 4A). We then used context-based gene prioritization in PoplarGene to prioritize poplar genes for defense response and stress response traits. 
PMC5664825	AY849382	Methods	ENA	False	The 5′ and 3′ UTRs of L1a annotated based on RNA-seq evidence were also compared to the UTRs of P1 (Fig. 4). 	For R3a in the potato, we aligned the coding sequences of R3a and genes within its cluster downloaded from GenBank (AY849382, AY849383, AY849384, and AY849385) to the potato genome. 	Because of the absence of those genes in the potato reference genome [35], we identified the closest homologs of R3a except R3a and its clustered genes in the potato genome. The duplication time of the R3a family was estimated by comparison of R3a and its homologs identified in the potato genome with the clustered genes. 
PMC6520597	LC438511	Methods	ENA	False	The untagged cDNAs were then cloned in pUASTattB (Brand and Perrimon, 1993) digested with NotI and XbaI. 	The accession numbers for TmIR25a and TmIR93a are LC438511 and LC438512, respectively.

From the previously published data, there were 29 haplotypes containing a total of 38 polymorphic sites. The combined new and published data recorded 31 haplotypes containing a total of 41 polymorphic sites (Supplementary Table 1).Table 1Variable sites of haplotypes based on mtDNA COI sequence.Unique nucleotide positions which separate the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, the Northwest Pacific from the others and the Northeast Pacific from others were represented in bold, italic and underlined text, respectively (NW = Northwest Pacific; NE = Northeast Pacific; SP = South Pacific). 
PMC5571200	EF609460	Methods	ENA	False	COI region sequences were evaluated and aligned using ClustalW multiple sequence alignment program in BioEdit sequence alignment editor V.7.2.550. 	Published sequences were also collated by directly acquiring homologous sequences from GenBank (Genbank accession numbers: EF60946038; HM007727-HM00773051; JF494499; JF494500; JQ738432; JQ738434; KM877615-KM87765612; KU312946-KU31296435; KX781877); sequences were trimmed to 604 bp to correspond to the sequences generated in the present study. 	Also we regenerated DNA sequences from published haplotype frequencies as found in Sepúlveda and González35; for example, the sequence of the “H1” haplotype was reported along with its frequency (which was 80%) from a total of 291; thus we inferred there were a total count of 233 “H1” haplotypes. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) test and pairwise genetic differences (FST) were estimated as indicators of genetic differentiation between all samples groups using Arlequin 3.5.2 and significance was assessed using 1,000 permutations52. 
PMC5571200	KC501452	Methods	ENA	False	The best model for COI was determined to be the “K2 + G: Kimura 2-parameter + Gamma” model which was selected based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) values55. 	Phylogenetic tree analyses were conducted with aligned sequences from the present study (244 sequences) and previously published (341 sequences) COI gene sequences from S. lalandi and from related Seriola species as outgroups (S. dumerili: KC501452; S. rivoliana: JN021317; S. zonata: KF930431; S. fasciata: KF930429; S. quinqueradiata: KU168712) using Neighbour-Joining (NJ)56, Maximum Parsimony (MP)57 and Maximum Likelihood (ML)58 methods, with 1,000 bootstrap replicates in MEGA 7.054. 	To test how many different species were evident from the COI sequences, a species delimitation analysis was carried out using the Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent (GMYC) approach59. Bayesian phylogenetic inferences were characterized with HKY + G (Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano + Gamma) model, assuming coalescent constant population priors with relaxed lognormal clock60 in BEAST v2.4.661. 
PMC5571200	HQ560985	Methods	ENA	False	Monophyly constraints were enforced for all clades represented by calibration points. 	Calibration points were set to 55.0 MYA (SD = 1.0) to calibrate the ancestral node of the genus Seriola from the fossil record65, 66 that has already been used in time-calibration studies67 and 52.0 MYA (SD = 1.0) for the split between Seriolina nigrofasciata and Elagatis bipinnulata derived from phylogenetic data68 and TIMETREE database69, 70 and thus here included S. nigrofasciata and E. bipinnulata (GenBank accession No. HQ560985 and JF493409, respectively) as outgroups. 	Three independent runs were implemented with 10 million MCMC steps and sampled every 1000 generations. A burn-in of 10% was used and the convergence of all parameters was assessed (ESS > 200) using the TRACER v1.671.

Assemblies were screened for obvious contamination by BLAST [45] searches against the NCBI non-redundant nucleotide database (contamination was removed from data for strain U21312). 	Relevant, published Clostridia species genomes were identified with the aid of the PATRIC database phylogeny viewer [46] and literature searches. Genome assemblies were downloaded from PATRIC [46] or GenBank [47] in fasta format (January 2015). 
PMC4778365	CP001581	Methods	ENA	False	Bootstrap replicates were conducted using the rapid bootstrapping method in RAxML [65], and the number of bootstrap replicates was determined by using the RAxML extended majority-rule consensus tree criterion [66]. 	The tree was viewed and rooted in FigTree. C. botulinum strain Kyoto-F [GenBank:CP001581] was used as the reference genome for SNP detection for Group I C. botulinum/C. sporogenes resulting in a 200,641-character core genome SNP matrix called from a 1,708,420-character core genome alignment (positions that passed quality filtering).

PMC4778365	CP000940	Methods	ENA	False	Newly sequenced genomes were aligned to previously published genome assemblies with progressiveMauve [79] to aid in understanding putative bont gene cluster locations. 	The presence of a plasmid-specific marker gene (PL-6) in all genome assemblies was determined with BLAST searches (hits above 80 % identity) of assembled genomes against a putative DNA primase gene [GenBank:CP000940.1, locus CLD_A0039] [80]. 	
PMC4778365	U20725	Results	ENA	False	The phylogenetic relationships and diversity of BoNT-producing strains were evaluated with phylogenies of the 16S rRNA gene, concatenated marker genes, and SNPs and with average nucleotide identity. 	A phylogeny of 16S rRNA gene sequences extracted from each genome assembly indicates that the newly sequenced strains (except for non-BoNT-producing strain U20725 that groups near the Group IV strain in Fig. 2) are closely related to strains within C. botulinum Groups I and II (Fig. 2). 	Group I includes serotypes A, B and F as well as bivalent and non-toxic strains. Group II includes serotypes B, E and F. BoNT-producing strains are color-coded by serotype in Fig. 2, which illustrates evidence of horizontal gene transfer and that non-BoNT-producing strains are closely related to BoNT-producing strains (e.g. C. sporogenes in Group I and C. novyi in Group III).Fig. 216S rRNA gene phylogeny of Clostridia strains. 
PMC4778365	CP001581	Results	ENA	False	However, when comparing all Group I strains ANIm values fall below 95 % (minimum of ~92.2 %) (as mentioned above), indicating the high genomic diversity present in Group I. The core genome phylogeny provides a framework for investigating Group I strains including the variation in genomic backgrounds expressing the same toxin type or subtype.Fig. 5Group I core genome phylogeny. 	Core genome phylogeny of C. botulinum Group I inferred with RAxML v8.1.1 [63] using the ASC_GTRGAMMA model on an alignment of 200,641 core genome SNPs produced with NASP [61] using C. botulinum strain Kyoto-F [GenBank:CP001581] as a reference genome. 	The consistency index is 0.57, and the retention index is 0.91. Gray circles indicate bootstrap values over 95 %. The phylogeny was rooted with the clade that includes Clostridium sporogenes and C. botulinum B serotypes (bottom of Figure) using FigTree [55]. 
PMC4778365	U21312	Results	ENA	False	Subtype A1 strains show considerable genomic diversity. 	The newly sequenced orfX+ bont/A1 strain U21312 from Argentina belongs to a clade that includes the orfX+ bont/A1 strain CDC 297 (two assemblies for this strain from New York, labeled CDC 297 and CFSAN002368, were included to compare results when analyzing the same strain sequenced and assembled by different groups and methods – the strains group together in the phylogeny) but is less closely related to strain CDC 297 than other bont/A2 and bivalent strains. 	Two clades of bont/A1(B) strains (orfX+ bont A1) are found in the Group I phylogeny. Five bont/A1(B) strains (10148, 20397, 20398, 20396 and 2039) from the United States are closely related to other bont/A1(B) strains from Ecuador, Japan and the US while three recently published bont/A1(B) strains isolated from infant botulism cases in Japan [50] fall into a distinct clade. 
PMC4778365	U21069	Results	ENA	False	Many of the newly sequenced bont/A2 strains are closely related to the bont/A2 strain C. botulinum Kyoto-F (Fig. 5). 	However, the newly sequenced bont/A2 Argentinian strains U21069, U21089, U21063 and U21075 form a distinct but closely related clade to the bont/A2 group that includes the Kyoto-F strain. 	Additionally, two newly sequenced Argentinian bont/A2 strains (U21311 and U21729) are distantly related to the previously mentioned bont/A2 strains, but appear to be more closely related to orfX+ bont/A1 and bivalent strains. One newly sequenced bont/A2 strain from the Republic of Mauritius, an island country off the eastern coast of Africa, is not closely related to any of the Argentinian bont/A2 strains or the Kyoto-F strain. 
PMC4778365	U21311	Results	ENA	False	However, the newly sequenced bont/A2 Argentinian strains U21069, U21089, U21063 and U21075 form a distinct but closely related clade to the bont/A2 group that includes the Kyoto-F strain. 	Additionally, two newly sequenced Argentinian bont/A2 strains (U21311 and U21729) are distantly related to the previously mentioned bont/A2 strains, but appear to be more closely related to orfX+ bont/A1 and bivalent strains. 	One newly sequenced bont/A2 strain from the Republic of Mauritius, an island country off the eastern coast of Africa, is not closely related to any of the Argentinian bont/A2 strains or the Kyoto-F strain. The diversity of the genomic backgrounds in which bont/A2 genes are found is evident from this analysis. 
PMC4778365	CP001056	Results	ENA	False	The BoNT/E9-producing strain CDC 66177 from Argentina falls into the clade with BoNT/B and/F-producing strains from the US, which is consistent with microarray hybridization profile analysis [83] and SNP analysis [89].Fig. 6Group II core genome phylogeny. 	Core genome phylogeny of C. botulinum Group II inferred with RAxML v8.1.1 [63] using the ASC_GTRGAMMA model on an alignment of 197,688 core genome SNPs produced with NASP [61] using C. botulinum Eklund 17B [GenBank:CP001056, CP001057] as a reference genome. 	The consistency index is 0.81, and the retention index is 0.90. Gray circles indicate bootstrap values over 95 %.

PMC5915575	CP013137	Results	ENA	False	Many other regulators, such as SigB, IspA, CitZ, CitB, and CcpE, and small RNA SsrA, influence the production of S. aureus staphyloxanthin13, 18. 	Genome sequencing of XQ (GenBank accession number: CP013137.1) and XQW was conducted to identify the gene responsible for the white phenotype of XQW. 	Genome comparison revealed 527 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in XQW genome; 392 of which were involved in 161 genes, which altered the corresponding amino acids (Supplementary Table S1). XQW contained a missense mutation in sigB(A674C), which encoded glutamine/proline substitution Q225P (Fig. 1b). 
PMC5915575	CP013137	Methods	ENA	False	The acquired contigs were assembled by Roche 454 Newbler 2.5 assembler while the gaps within the unaccomplished genome were filled by GapFiller (version 1.11). 	The accession number for XQ was obtained (CP013137.1) after submission of the whole-genome sequence to the GenBank. 	Genome comparison between XQ and XQW was carried out using Mauve software. 
PMC5799272	AY599232	Methods	ENA	False	Mini-Tn7 Transposon Strains 	Mini-Tn7 transposon vector pUC18T-mini-Tn7T-Gm (accession no. AY599232) and helper plasmid pTNS3 (accession no. EU215432) (Choi et al., 2005; Choi and Schweizer, 2006) were a generous gift of Dr. Herbert Schweizer, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States. 	Plasmid pTNS3 was maintained in strain PIR1 (pir-116; ThermoFisher). Pc-fluorescent protein-T4 terminator segments were amplified by PCR from pSW002-based plasmids and inserted into the mini-Tn7 vector using GeneArt Seamless Cloning and Assembly (ThermoFisher) and verified by sequence analysis. Mini-Tn7 plasmids containing fluorescent protein expression elements were co-electroporated into P. fluorescens SBW25 with pTNS3 (100 ng each plasmid) and plated on LB-agar containing 15 μg/ml gentamycin. 
PMC5799272	AF118811	Results	ENA	False	Secondly, in order to simplify future cloning tasks, site-directed mutagenesis was used to remove several restriction sites from pME6031. 	These include NotI(844), NotI(2377), NotI(3667), XbaI(8291) and BamHI(1) (the location on pME6031 is given in parentheses and is numbered according to published pME6031 sequence, accession number AF118811). 	NotI(844) and NotI(2377) reside in coding regions of the pVS1 resolvase and pVS1 replication protein, respectively, so silent mutations were used to preserve the amino acid sequences. The resulting plasmid was named pSW002. 
PMC5799272	AF118811	Results	ENA	False	The parental plasmid pME6031 was fully sequenced as well. 	Several minor discrepancies between the published sequence of pME6031 (accession number AF118811) and the NGS data are listed in Table 1. 	Most notably, a 66 bp deletion of a GC rich region is observed between the RK2 tetracycline resistance gene and the multiple cloning site. We performed NGS analysis of the related plasmids pME6012 and pME6032 (Heeb et al., 2000) and uncovered the same deletion, suggesting that the deletion occurred earlier in the lineage of these plasmids and was propagated in the derivatives. 
PMC5927427	MG457157	Methods	ENA	False	DNA from recombinant plasmids were sequenced by the Sanger method by an external sequencing service (Macrogen Europe, Amsterdam, NL).

Stenotrophomonas sp., and Bacillus sp., respectively (Fig. 3a–c). 	Further, the sequences for Y14p, Y16, and Y40 were deposited in GenBank database under the accession numbers JQ956432, JQ956433, and JX121858, respectively. 	The GenBank and RDP profiles of isolate Y16 closely matched that of Stenotrophomonas sp., gram-negative obligate aerobes found in water and soil. They are cited as pDNA carriers and have been noted for their robust resistance to antibiotics as well as their role in nosocomial infections [21].

PMC4871562	CP009760	Methods	ENA	False	C. muridarum (CM) strain Nigg organisms (initially acquired from Dr. Robert C Brunham’s lab at the University of Manitoba in 1999) were propagated and purified in HeLa cells (human cervical carcinoma epithelial cells, ATCC cat# CCL2) as described previously [29, 30]. 	The full genome sequence of this C. muridarum strain designated as Nigg3 is available under Genbank accession# CP009760.1. 	A passaged clone designated as Nigg3G13.32.1 was isolated from the Nigg3 stock [31]. The Nigg3 stock was also used to cure of plasmid and a resultant plasmid-free clone CMUT3G5 (for full genome sequence: Genbank accession# CP006974.1) was used for transformation with pGFP-luci-CM plasmid [32] as described previously [33, 34]. 
PMC4871562	CP006974	Methods	ENA	False	A passaged clone designated as Nigg3G13.32.1 was isolated from the Nigg3 stock [31].

The genome sequences of the C. muridarum Nigg3G13.32.1 and the luciferase-expressing CMUT3G5-pGFP-Luci are nearly identical with the only exception in the gene coding for TC0412. Although variations in this gene from C. trachomatis were found to affect the infectivity of C. trachomatis in the mouse genital tract [35], mutations in this gene were shown to have no significant effect on either the infectivity or the pathogenicity of C. muridarum in the mouse genital tract [31, 36].

Through Venn diagram analysis, 73 OTUs (GenBank accessions numbers MF114128 to MF114200) shared by karst bulk soils as well as roots and leaves of C. henryi from the two sample plots were identified (Fig 2). 	The bacteria represented by these 73 OTUs possibly play a key role in the adaptive capacity of C. henryi to karst high calcium soils. 
PMC5397612	SRP075855	Methods	ENA	False	Gene prediction was conducted using SNAP36 and AUGUSTUS v3.2.2,37 trained on Arabidopsis thaliana and S.lycopersicum as models. 	RNA-seq data obtained from corolla and leaf samples of R. speciosa (Zhuang and Tripp, in rev.; SRA accession: SRP075855) served as EST evidence to refine gene models. 	High confidence annotation of protein sequences of 31 dicot species were retrieved from the PLAZA database v3.038 to serve as protein evidence for refining gene predictions. The annotation file from the first-round run was used to create the HMM training file for SNAP. 
PMC5397612	SRP075855	Methods	ENA	False		To measure expression levels of selected anthocyanin genes and identified MYBs, reads from previous tissue-specific RNA-seq libraries (Zhuang and Tripp, in rev.; SRA accession: SRP075855) were trimmed with Trimmomatic v0.3323(parameters used: ILLUMINACLIP:TruSeq3-PE.fa:2:30:10 LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:36) and mapped back to Maker-P predicted gene sequences using BWA with default parameters. 	eXpress v1.5.179 was used to measure gene abundance with default parameters. The ‘fpkm’ column of tissue-specific eXpress output was extracted and used for building expression heatmaps using the heatmap.2 program within the gplots80 package for R. 
PMC5397612	HG530133	Methods	ENA	False	Blat was used to compared our contigs generated from MaSuRCA20 to these reference chloroplast sequences to find nucleotide sequences with high similarity.81 Five contigs (length ≥ 10,000 bp; query coverage ≥ 80%) were identified. 	We used Blast82 to compare these five contigs against reference chloroplasts and identified two with the highest e-values and query coverages: Lindenbergia philippensis (Accession: HG530133) and Andrographis paniculata (Accession: KF150644). 	These, together with a chloroplast reference from closed related species Ruellia breedlovei (Accession: KP300014) were used as references for our R. speciosa assembly. Quality trimmed paired-end reads were aligned to the references using Bowtie v2-2.2.3.83 Reads with either end mapped to the references were extracted using Samtools and an in-house Perl script.

Mapped reads were randomly subsampled from ×100 to ×500 coverage of the estimated chloroplast genome size; reads with an apparent depth under ×5 were discarded using BBmap v36.02.84 The resulting aligned reads were assembled using SPAdes v3.5.085 and scaffolded using SSPACE v2.022 against all sequenced libraries. 
PMC6096847	EH165320	Results	ENA	False	We have designated this novel nucleotide sequence (genome reference ENSBTAG00000027865) Granzyme O (following previous alphabetical allocation of letter symbols). 	Sequences matching each of the bovine granzyme genes identified from the genome were found within the GenBank bovine EST database: granzyme A (EH165320.1), granzyme O (CN787157.1), granzyme B (DN533698.1), granzyme H (CK776010.1), granzyme K (FE012584.1) and granzyme M (DV805053.1). 	Searches of this database using other murine granzyme gene sequences did not reveal any additional bovine granzymes. 
PMC6096847	BW979091	Results	ENA	False	However, a BLASTN search of the pig genome (Sscrofa11.1) revealed a full-length open reading frame (ENSSSCG00000016902) that shows 91% similarity in the coding region to the cattle gene. 	The EST sequence data in both species (pig EST database reference BW979091.1), together with RT-PCR analysis of cattle T cells in this study, indicate that granzyme O is expressed. 	Analysis of genome DNA sequence in the region between the granzyme A and K genes in human and mouse revealed an unprocessed pseudogene in human (ENSG00000249454.1) and a processed pseudogene in mouse (ENSMUSG00000051002), which exhibit 89 and 66% nucleotide similarity to cattle granzyme O gene, respectively (Supplementary 1B). The human granzyme O-like pseudogene comprises four exons that contain several premature stop codons, whereas the mouse granzyme O-like pseudogene contains only 259 bp of DNA sequence, which based on alignments appears to correspond to exon 4 in the bovine gene (Supplementary 1A).

PMC6159548	AP009485	Methods	ENA	False	Briefly, PlasmidFinder determines the presence of a plasmid by identifying plasmid-associated replicon sequences within the WGS data, whereas plasmidSPAdes utilises assembly graphs produced by SPAdes, estimates chromosome coverage and assigns contigs with read contig coverage differing from the chromosome coverage as plasmid. 	As PlasmidFinder is optimised for enterobacterial genomes, plasmid replicon sequences from M. caseolyticus plasmids, pMCCL1 and pMCCL2 (accession number AP009485.1 and AP009486.1, respectively), were used to search contigs produced by plasmidSPAdes. 	To assign the mec genes as being encoded on a plasmid, plasmidSPAdes had to identify putative plasmid-associated contigs and the pMCCL1/2 replicon sequences had to be present within those contigs, as well as the mec gene of interest. Phylogenetic relationships among the isolates were assessed with SeqSphere+ software version 4.1.9 (Ridom) [20] using a core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) and accessory genome scheme based on all 35 isolates in this study with M. caseolyticus IMD0819 (NZ_CP021058.1) as the reference genome.

For the NKG2D specific NK cytotoxicity assay, a 50:50 mixture of NKG2D ligand (ULBP6 (GenBank ID: AY039682.1) transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line labeled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) and control transfected CHO cells labeled with 670 dye, were co-incubated with effector cells (IFN-α activated PBMCs) for 16hrs. 	After co-culture, the ratio of CFSE negative (670 dye positive, control CHO cells) to CFSE positive cells (ULBP6 transfected CHO cells) was calculated to determine the percentage of specific killing. % specific lysis was calculated by 100 × {1 − [(control ratio)/(experimental ratio)]}.

PMC6409932	AUO79433	Results	ENA	False	In addition, PSI-BLAST analysis showed that ORF128 and ORF130 of AVP encode two putative components which show homology with the N-terminal and C-terminal parts of the whole DNA polymerase, respectively. 	The data of Table S3 clearly indicate that the protein encoded by ORF129 showed similarity with HNH homing endonuclease (accession no. AUO79433.1), a site-specific DNA endonuclease that promotes the horizontal transfer of a gene and its flanking DNA [47]. 	Introns, including the homing endonuclease-like genes of the HNH superfamily, have been observed in the terminase large subunit gene of the Staphylococcus phage Twort [48,49]. Thus, the gene fragment between the genes ORF128 and ORF130 may be an inserted gene fragment (Figure S3). 
PMC6409932	APZ82006	Results	ENA	False	Six putative substructural proteins of the contractile tail of AVP were analyzed, of which the ORF81–ORF88 gene products are similar to the tail proteins of other phages. 	ORF81 encodes the putative tail sheath protein, which shows similarity to the sheath proteins from the published sequences of the Enterococcus phages EFP01 (APZ82006.1), EfV12-phi1 (AYJ73482.1), phiM1EF22 (BBE37297.1), phiEF24C (YP_001504132.1) [60], and ECP3 (YP_009147092.1).

PMC4229213	SRP047118	Results	ENA	False	The integration sites and control sites were annotated as transcriptional start site (TSS)-proximal when mapping in the ±2.5 kb window around a TSS, intragenic when mapping within a transcription unit, and intergenic in all other cases. 	Among SA integrations, 58.6% were in an intergenic position, 38.9% were within the transcribed portion of at least 1 gene, and 2.5% was within a 5 kb window encompassing the TSS ( Figure 5A ; the complete list of sequences is available in GenBank database with the accession number SRP047118). 	In general, the distribution of the SB integrants in both datasets is fairly random and resembles the composition of the human genome showing no statistical differences compared to their relative controls, i.e. all p-values (both two-sample tests for proportions and Fisher's Exact Tests) were >10−2. 
PMC6471273	KT869137	Results	ENA	False	2.1. In silico Analysis of P. quinquefolium HMGR Promoter 	The 741 bp genomic DNA fragment of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase gene was isolated from hairy root cultures of P. quinquefolium and has been deposited at GenBank under accession No KT869137.1. 	This region encompasses the proximal promoter, the 5′UTR and 5′CDS fragment of the coding DNA sequence (CDS) of the HMGR gene. The section 5′UTR located between 577 and 657bp undergoes transcription; however, it is not involved in the translation process. 
PMC6471273	FJ755158	Methods	ENA	False	Two gene-specific primers, GSP1 (5′AAT GGG AGA GGA AGA GCA TCA GAG GCT T3′) and GSP2 (5′AGA AGA GGA GTG TTG ATT TTG TGA TTT GAG G3′), were used for the PCR reaction. 	These primers were designed based on a 5′ terminal fragment of the cDNA sequence (GenBank accession number: FJ755158.2) of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase gene using the OligoCalc server [63]. 	The OligoCalc server was also applied to calculate the temperature of primer melting (TM). Based on our experience, the optimal TM values resulting in a good quality PCR reaction are obtained by the salt adjusted (50 mM NaCl) algorithm [63]. 
PMC6471273	FJ755158	Methods	ENA	False	Every experiment included a negative control (sample without a cDNA template). 	The primer sequences were as follows: 5′AAC ACT CCT CTT CTC TCA AAG C3′ and 5′GGC TTG TTC TTC ACC ATG TTC3′ for the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase gene (GenBank accession number: FJ755158.2); and 5′AAG CCC AAT CGA AGA GAG GTA3′ and: 5′ATC TTC TCC CTG TTG GCC TT3′ for the reference gene (actin) (GenBank accession number: KF699319.1). 	The expected sizes of the amplicons were 121 bp for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase gene and 187 bp for the actin gene. The primers were designed using the OligoCalc server [63]. 
PMC4619333	AL123456	Methods	ENA	False	A minimum read length of 36 base pairs was used for subsequent mapping. 	Reads were then mapped to the M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome (Genbank: AL123456) using three different mappers namely the Burrows-Wheeler Alignment Tool (BWA) [33], Novoalign [34] and SMALT [35]. 	For all libraries sequenced, over 98 % of the reference genome was covered by at least one read and an average depth of coverage of 137× was achieved. The alignment files were subjected to local realignment and de-duplication using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) [36] and Picard [37]. 
PMC4706646	KR812147	Methods	ENA	False	To exclude the presence of pseudogenes or gene duplicates, the individual sequence chromatogram files were checked for the presence of double peaks, and the COI alignment was translated into amino acids and checked for premature stop codons and frame shifts using BioEdit 7.2.3.

PMC2193337	K03455	Methods	ENA	False	The proviral DNA encoding the C2-V5 region of env was amplified by a nested PCR amplification strategy using primer pairs ED31-BH2 in the first round and DR7-DR8 in the second round. 	Primer sequences for ED31, DR7, and DR8 have been described previously 31 45; primer BH2 is 7759-5′-CCTTGGTGGGTGCTACTCCTAATGGTTCA, where the number corresponds to the position in the HXB2 genome (sequence data available from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession no. K03455) of the 5′ nucleotide. 	The first and second round amplification conditions were 3 cycles of 95°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1 min, followed by 32 cycles of 94°C for 15 s, 55°C for 45 s, 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. Three serial fivefold dilutions of PBMC DNA were amplified in triplicate by nested PCR and the results were used to estimate HIV-1 proviral copy number using the program Quality 46. 
PMC6446291	AF325123	Discussion	ENA	False	Transgenic rose expressing PAP1 not only showed a more intense purple color, but also had increased concentrations of terpenoid scent compounds in its flowers [38]. 	Interestingly, the TGY transcriptome dataset included unigenes corresponding to PAP1 (GenBank accession: AF325123) with E-value < 1.0E− 6. 	The phylogenetic tree showed that CsPAP1 (c124394.graph_c0) clustered with PAP1 in Brassica oleracea, but deviated from the other three CsPAP1s (c112219.graph_c0, c53572.graph_c0, and c121522.graph_c0). Among these three CsPAP1s, c112219.graph_c0 and c121522.graph_c0 had a closer genetic distance with each other than with c53572.graph_c0.

Eight DENV-2 strains were sequenced in 2014, 21strains in 2013, 11 strains in 2012 and 2 strains in 2011. A total of 106 sequences were used in the phylogenetic analysis with 58 Indian strains. 
PMC4792444	AF038403	Methods	ENA	False	A total of 106 sequences were used in the phylogenetic analysis with 58 Indian strains. 	The 457bp (152aa) long multiple sequence alignment corresponded to 1801–2257 bp of the DENV-2 genome and 289–440 amino acid of the E protein (numbering based on the prototype NGC 44 strain; GenBank Accession Number: AF038403). 	Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree of the strains based upon the aligned sequence data showed that the study strains clustered with the Cosmopolitan genotype (Fig 1). Strains from Pakistan, China, Singapore, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Saudi Arabia were found to cluster with the strains of the present study. 
PMC5615346	MF352008	Methods	ENA	False	The exact gene and exon boundaries were verified, and the start and stop codons were manually corrected. 	The entire chloroplast genome sequence of Cyamopsis tetragonoloba, along with gene annotations was submitted to GenBank (accession number: MF352008). 	
PMC5779644	DQ915955	Methods	ENA	False	Sequences were cleaned with Trimmomatic 0.32 [14] software (ILLUMINACLIP:illumina_oligos_and_reverse_complements:2:30:5:1:true LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 MAXINFO:40:0.2 MINLEN:36 options). 	Two Bowtie 2 [15] alignments were performed (-non-deterministic -very-sensitive options) on cleaned sequences, one to the blaCTX-M-1 gene (DQ915955) so as to evaluate sequencing depth and one to phiX174. 	This second alignment was made to remove reads matching phiX174 material, which is used in Illumina sequencing in case of very redundant samples. The phiX174 unaligned reads were downsampled to fit a global coverage estimation of 80 times. 
PMC5779644	AP005147	Results	ENA	False	Sequences of the blaCTX-M- 1 plasmids 	All the 30 blaCTX-M plasmids were of the IncI1 replicon type and all shared the same G57A mutation compared to the sequence found in the Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium plasmid R64 DNA sequence (accession number AP005147). 	This G57A mutation was also present in the sequence of the previously published pC49-108 plasmid of a chicken E. coli isolate (accession number KJ484638) [29]. All 30 IncI1 plasmids were of the pMLST3 type except pCOV25, for which the entire ardA gene could not be found, but the four other alleles (pilL_2, repI1_2, sogS_1 and trbA_4) were those of the pMLST3.

In the study by Day et al [21] relative to 353 ESBL-producing E. coli from humans, animals and food in Germany, the Netherlands and the UK, the most common plasmid replicon type among 341 transformants was also IncI1 followed by multiple IncF replicons, and they observed that IncI1 was also more common in poultry in the Netherlands. 
PMC5779644	AJ242809	Results	ENA	False	According to RASTA, no putative toxin-antitoxin systems could be detected in seven plasmids, 21 had the ParE-RelB system and one (pCOV18) had the CcdB-CcdA/COG5302 system. 	The full 1263 bp ISEcp1 (accession number AJ242809) could be detected in 27 plasmids, and a partial one was detected in pCOV3 and pCOV20. 	The distance between ISEcp1 and the blaCTX-M-1 gene could be estimated for 24 plasmids, when the two sequences were obtained on the same contig: 288 bp for 20 plasmids, 1,488 bp for five of them (pCOV10, pCOV11, pCOV12, pCOV15 and pCOV24) and 27,531 bp for pCOV4. A putative transposase of 1181 bp was present in 22 plasmids and was identical to the transposase previously reported in other plasmids such as pC49-108 (accession number KJ484638, region: 102662–103842) [29] or p369 (accession number KT779550, region: 87786–88966) [37].

This transposase was found to be located at 19–22 kbp from the blaCTX-M-1 gene. The 806 bp IS26 was present on 26 plasmids at approximately 24.6 to 30 kpb from the blaCTX-M-1 gene. 
PMC5779644	KC340960	Results	ENA	False	The 806 bp IS26 was present on 26 plasmids at approximately 24.6 to 30 kpb from the blaCTX-M-1 gene. 	A 1352 nt integrase identical to IntI1 (accession number KC340960, region: 9704–10714) was found on five plasmids (pCOV4, pCOV10, pCOV11, pCOV12 and pCOV24). 	The distance between the integrase and the blaCTX-M-1 gene was greater than 22 kbp and 27 kbp on pCOV10 and pCOV24 respectively. A 616 nt portion of Int1 was detected on pCOV20. 
PMC5779644	AY545598	Results	ENA	False	Thus the five genes (iutA, hlyF, ompT, iss and iroN) that can be used as minimal predictors of APEC virulence [43] were detected. 	Johnson et al showed that several putative virulence traits, including iss, tsh, iron acquisition and transport systems including those encoding aerobactin and salmochelin, the sitABC iron transport system, and eit, a putative iron transport system novel to APEC, were located on a cluster on the pAPEC-O2-ColV (accession no. AY545598.5) plasmid [44]. 	Later, they also reported that the virulence could also be borne by a cluster on pAPEC-O1-ColBM (accession number DQ381420), which contains a putative virulence cluster similar to that of pAPEC-O2-ColV and encodes colicins B and M, not encoded by pAPEC-O2-ColV [19]. The genes encoding these colicins B and M (cma, cmi, cba and cbi) were also present on contig 3 on pCOV28B.

PMC5347681	AJ242714	Introduction	ENA	False	There is a great number of researches have shown that YBX1 facilitates cell cycle progression and suppresses apoptosis in multiple cancer cell lines [30, 31]. 	Further, we previously detected the promoter of CDC25a (GenBank accession no. AJ242714.1) contained three Y-box sequences (Figure 4A) that might bind by YBX1. 	So we hypothesized that if YBX1 could bind to CDC25a promoter and up-regulate CDC25a expression to promote tumor cell overcoming cell cycle checkpoint restriction to satisfy unlimited malignant amplification. Here we showed that the expression of CDC25a had close relationship with the expression of YBX1 in cancer tissues samples on the basis of novel adenocarcinoma subtypes classification by immunohistochemical staining for the first time. 
PMC3675194	KC820708	Methods	ENA	False	The intensity of wild-type and mutated bands was estimated by comparison to the neighbouring bands in the same sequencing lane used as a reference. 	The results of the TP53 sequencing have been deposited in GenBank (Accession Numbers: KC820708-KC820786). 	Exemplary sequencing results are presented in Fig. 
PMC4928311	AB245021	Methods	ENA	False	After incubation, each sample was mixed by gentle shaking and DNA was extracted from 1/5 of the total lysis buffer (200 μl) and processed by QIAamp® DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s instructions. 	Primers and probe targeted a 91 bp stretch in the O. ostertagi ITS2 sequence (GenBank® accession no. AB245021.2) from position 1036 according to Höglund et al. [15]. 	Duplicate amplifications were performed with a Rotor-gene Q RG-6000® (QIAGEN) in total volumes of 25 μl using 0.65 U Taq2000® polymerase (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), 0.3 μM of forward and reverse primer, 0.2 μM probe, 200 μM dNTP and 5.5 mM MgCl2 using 2 μl DNA as template. The cycling conditions were 95 °C for 10 min and amplification for 50 cycles (95 °C for 15 s, 62 °C for 60 s). 
PMC4928311	AB245021	Discussion	ENA	False	Some of this variation in the qPCR outcome could relate to genetic variation in the target sequence of the forward primer, which may provide suboptimal conditions for the qPCR. 	Indeed, a BLAST® search on the targeted ITS2 sequence (GenBank accession no: AB245021.2, query range 1,036–1,126 bp) revealed a genetic variability of 1–2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the forward primer region among 31 % of the available O. ostertagi ITS2 sequences (Additional file 2). 	The variation is observed in isolates of diverse geographical origin but a population genetic analysis of the ITS2 is beyond the scope of this paper. Another possible source of variation includes inconsistent extraction efficiency of genomic DNA from eggs compared to L1.

[15] and used in this study. 	Primers and probe are aligned in the bottom. Asterisks indicate the complete nucleotide conservation throughout all sequences; 15 sequences (31 %) contained single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the forward primer region. 
PMC4488404	AF269224	Methods	ENA	False	Nucleotide sequencing of ABCB1 cDNA: The sequence of entire cDNA of ABCB1 gene was divided into eight fragments (fragments 1 to 8), and eight primer pairs were designed (Supplementary file 4). 	Sequences of the primers were based on the GenBank database (AF269224). 	Nucleotide sequences of the amplified fragments were analyzed directly from the PCR products using the BigDye terminator v3.1/1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) and the Applied Biosystems 3130XL genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The results were confirmed by two independent experiments. 
PMC4488404	AF269224	Results	ENA	False	Nucleotide sequencing of the ABCB1 gene: In the sequence analysis, no mutation was found in the cDNAs of ABCB1 gene of 6 cell lines. 	The results were compared to the coding sequence of canine ABCB1 gene (GenBank association number AF269224). 	Western blot for P-gp: In Western blotting, a distinct band of approximately 170 kD corresponding to P-gp was detected in Ema (Fig.5Fig. 5.In Western blot analysis, the expression of P-gp was detected in CHS-1, DH82 and Ema, whereas no signal was detected in CHS-2, CHS-3 and CLBL-1.). In CHS-1 and DH82, a faint corresponding band was found. 
PMC6405135	LS999909	Results	ENA	False	Similarly, no amplicon was also obtained with DNA from C. africana, C. metapsilosis, C. conglobata, C. utilis and with human DNA. 	The ITS region of rDNA sequences from 11 bloodstream isolates from neonates (Gen Bank accession numbers LS999909 to LS999920) exhibited maximum identity with corresponding sequences from reference strains of C. lusitaniae and not with other Candida species, as expected. 	The sequence comparisons also indicated inter-strain variations among clinical C. lusitaniae isolates from Kuwait. This prompted us to perform molecular fingerprinting studies by comparing ITS region of rDNA sequences.

PMC4019573	KF255601	Results	ENA	False	Although PP5 genes from several insect species have been identified and are available on NCBI Database, the information of their sequences characterization and their functional roles in biological processes is limited. 	In our previous work, a full-length PP5 cDNA was cloned from P. xylostella (accession: KF255601) [12]. 	
PMC4019573	KF983016	Results	ENA	False		The full-length cDNAs of HaPP5 and MsPP5 were deposited into the GenBank Database with the accession numbers of KF983016 and KF983017, respectively. 	BLAST analysis of deduced amino acid sequences of these three PP5 genes on NCBI revealed their strong similarities with PP5s from other insect species. They also shared >60% identity to human PP5. 
PMC5161471	KX669637	Results	ENA	False	Endosymbiotic algae were identified molecularly by PCR on fixed cells of P. chlorelligerum. 	A partial (1223 bp long, GenBank KX669637) 18S rRNA gene sequence was obtained, and its identity was 99.3% with Meyerella planctonica isolated from environmental samples [57, 58] (Table 2). 	When this sequence was compared to the one of German P. chlorelligerum endosymbiotic algae (GenBank JX010741), identity was 98.9%, thus confirming the presence of Meyerella sp. as endosymbiont of this green ciliate. All algae cultures obtained directly from the initially grown on BBM plates were clearly not morphologically resembling the algae inhabiting the P. chlorelligerum cytoplasm, as they had distinct pyrenoid (data not shown).

All algae cultures obtained directly from the initially grown on BBM plates were clearly not morphologically resembling the algae inhabiting the P. chlorelligerum cytoplasm, as they had distinct pyrenoid (data not shown). By partial 18S rDNA sequencing they were identified as Chlorella sorokiniana. 
PMC5161471	KX669629	Results	ENA	False	Molecular characterization, sequences comparison and phylogenetic analysis of Paramecium chlorelligerum 	The almost complete 18S rRNA gene sequences (1716 bp) were obtained by direct sequencing after semi-nested amplification from the two strains (HSG1-11 GenBank KX669629, and HSG2-12 GenBank KX669630), and they were identical. 	These “Russian” P. chlorelligerum sequences were 99.8% identical to representatives of the “German” population [1, 12]. In those sequences, respectively three (position 1029, 1298 and 1310) and two (positions 1298 and 1310) mismatches were present. 
PMC5161471	KX669632	Results	ENA	False	Intriguingly these two mutations are located on opposite site of the stem with the second mutation re-establishing the correct secondary structure (they represent a compensatory base changes (CBC)); the two mutations are consequently not evolutionary independent and possibly highlight a highly variable stem in P. chlorelligerum. 	The two Russian strains had an identical sequence of COI gene (760 bp, HSG1-11 GenBank KX669632, HSG2-12 GenBank KX669633), which was 100% homologous to COI gene of the ciliates from German population [1]. 	On the contrary, the other COI sequence attributed in GenBank (KF110720) to P. chlorelligerum appeared to be completely different and probably is the result of organism misidentification. Indeed, in recent COI phylogenetic reconstruction [1], this sequence is present in the outgroup composed by different ciliate species.

Indeed, in recent COI phylogenetic reconstruction [1], this sequence is present in the outgroup composed by different ciliate species. ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 sequences were 1080 bp long and 100% identical among all P. chlorelligerum characterized by us (HSG1-11 GenBank KX669629, HSG2-12 GenBank KX669630 and German population GenBank KX669631), and no CBC were found.

Again, the GenBank sequence KF110708 attributed to P. chlorelligerum seems to be the result of a mixture of sequences belonging to Paramecium and some other ciliate, probably prostomatean (e.g. Prorodon sp.), thus showing a misidentification of ciliate cells or contamination during DNA sample preparation. After the model GTR + I + G was chosen by jModelTest, phylogeny for 18S rDNA and ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 were inferred. 
PMC5161471	KF110708	Results	ENA	False	ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 sequences were 1080 bp long and 100% identical among all P. chlorelligerum characterized by us (HSG1-11 GenBank KX669629, HSG2-12 GenBank KX669630 and German population GenBank KX669631), and no CBC were found.

After the model GTR + I + G was chosen by jModelTest, phylogeny for 18S rDNA and ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 were inferred. As previously shown [1, 12], the 18S rRNA gene phylogeny confirmed the position of P. chlorelligerum as clustering with the subgenera Cypriostomum and Paramecium (Fig 6). 
PMC5161471	KX669635	Results	ENA	False	Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of the bacterial endosymbiont 	Almost complete 16S rRNA gene sequence (1404 bp) was obtained by direct sequencing from the two strains (HSG1-11 GenBank KX669635, and HSG2-12 GenBank KX669636) harboring endosymbionts. 	These were identical between each other and presented an identity value ranging from 96.5% to 98.1 with other Holospora species (Table 3). A species-specific probe was designed and FISH experiments were carried out in order to detect the presence of the bacterial endosymbiont (Fig 11), as expected by “full-cycle rRNA approach” [49]. 
PMC5161471	KF110720	Discussion	ENA	False	Nevertheless, the increase of sampling and studies on marshy environments could lead to the retrieval of other P. chlorelligerum populations, thus allowing a deeper understanding of the real genetic diversity of this rare ciliate. 	Furthermore, as several sequences in GenBank have been incorrectly assigned to P. chlorelligerum (KF110720, KF110708), now it becomes more and more important to combine molecular tools with morphological analysis of the studied microorganism to avoid further mistakes. 	Characterization and ecology of endosymbiotic algae The characterization of Russian P. chlorelligerum algal endosymbionts was performed both morphologically and molecularly, and they were identified as members of the Meyerella genus. 
PMC5161471	KX669636	Discussion	ENA	False	Capable of horizontal and vertical transmission in the host species. 	Basis of assignment: 16S rRNA gene sequence (GenBank KX669636) and positive matching with the 16S rRNA-targeting oligonucleotide probe HoloParv_645; morphological characters pattern as above.

SPRY4 intronic transcript 1 (SPRY4‐IT1: GenBank Accession ID AK024556), which is a 687 nucleotides unspliced, polyadenylated transcript derived from the second intron of the SPRY4 gene, is firstly identified in melanoma 6. 	The SPRY4‐IT1 has demonstrated its overexpression and amplification in multiple cancer types 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, indicating that it may promote carcinogenesis. Moreover, SPRY4‐IT1 expression has been remarkably correlated with clinical characteristics such as risk, relapse, progression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) 7, nonsmall‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 8, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) 10, gastric cancer 13, 14, bladder cancer 15, and melanoma 16.

Uncorrected p-distances were examined for louse taxa and phylogenetic and other analyses were focused on avian taxa with genetic variation north and south of the Congo River (see Results: Alethe castanea, Bleda syndactlya, Illadopsis rufipennis, and Stiphrornis xanthogaster). We used MrModelTest (Nylander 2004) to determine the appropriate model of nucleotide substitution for each avian lineage (GTR+I, GTR+I+G, HKY+I, and HKY+G for Alethe, Bleda syndactyla, Illadopsis, and Stiphrornis, respectively). 
PMC3348894	GU441836	Results	ENA	False	The mll gene family in Atlantic cod 	Using degenerate PCR primers, we have successfully obtained partial cDNA sequences for five mll and two setd1 paralogues in Atlantic cod: mll1 (GU441836), mll2 (GU441837), mll3a (GU441838), mll4b (GU441839), mll5 (GU441840), setd1a (GU441841) and setd1ba (HQ315825) (Table 1). 	Comparative mapping of genes surrounding each mll and setd1 paralogue showed that proximally-located genes lie within a region of conserved synteny amongst teleosts, namely Atlantic cod, medaka (Oryzias latipes), tiger pufferfish, zebrafish, stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and green-spotted pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis) (Fig 2, Figures S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, and S9). In contrast, synteny was disrupted between teleosts and tetrapods.

PMC3563417	AAC27708	Methods	ENA	False	The 3D structure of NS2B protein/cofactor is not reported in the RCSB protein databank. 	Therefore, the amino acid sequence (128 residues) of NS2B GP78 (AAC27708) was retrieved from GenBank. 	The sequence was subjected to similarity search using BLASTp against PDB data base but no significant hit with complete query coverage for template to build 3D model of NS2B.

PMC3563417	AAC27708	Methods	ENA	False	However, the best alignment have been identified by using LALIGN in EMBOSS (Figure 2). 	Homology modeling was used to generate a reliable 3D model of NS2B protein (AAC27708) by MODELLER 9.10 [19]. 	A good quality model was not obtained even by using multiple templates so the model predicted by MODELLER was poor quality with inappropriate folded conformation. Hence, NS2B structure was predicted using I-TASSER integrated web platform which uses a composite approach for protein modeling combining ab initio, threading and comparative modeling [20]. 
PMC3563417	AAC27708	Results	ENA	False	However, the best alignments have been identified by using LALIGN inEMBOSS (Figure 2). 	3D model of NS2B protein (AAC27708) was predicted by homology modeling using MODELLER 9.10 [20] with multiple templates. 	The obtained 3D structure was poor quality with inappropriate folded conformations. Therefore, the automated 3D structure of NS2B cofactor from JEV GP78 was predicted based on the sequence-to-structure-to-function paradigm using I-TASSER (Figure 1A) and the function of NS2B protein was inferred by structurally matching the 3D models with other known proteins [36]. 
PMC4231755	AB194809	Methods	ENA	False	In order to replace the PpRAD51B gene from ATG to stop by the AtRAD51B cds, we produced the pPpAtRAD51B-KanR plasmid. 	First, we amplified a PCR fragment covering the AtRAD51B cDNA region (21) using Arabidopsis cDNA as the starting template (coordinate 47-1037 on Genbank: AB194809) and cloned it into a pUC18 plasmid to obtain pAtRAD51B. 	To generate the hybrid Physcomitrella-Arabidopsis RAD51B expression cassette pPpAtRAD51B, a 575 bp 5′ targeting fragment (partial promoter/5′UTR of PpRAD51B, coordinates 11047187-11046613 on chromosome 25) and a 560 bp 3′ targeting fragment (partial 3′UTR of PpRAD51B, coordinate 11042647-11042088 on chromosome 25) were amplified from Physcomitrella genomic DNA and cloned in pPpAtRAD51B upstream of the ATG and downstream of the stop codon of the AtRAD51B cDNA, respectively. To obtain pPpAtRAD51B-KanR, the 35S::neoR cassette flanked by two LoxP sites was recovered from pBNRF (41) and inserted in pPpAtRAD51-2 between the AtRAD51B cDNA stop codon and the 3′UTR of PpRAD51B.

PMC6193605	KU761334	Introduction	ENA	False	At 5 days postinfection (dpi), the serum concentrations of 14 out of 26 cytokines tested (interleukin-10 [IL-10], granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF], IL-3, IL-1a, Ccl5, Ccl7, IL-13, IL-4, IL-23, IL-2, IL12p70, interferon gamma [IFN-γ], IL-6, and Ccl3) were reduced in mice infected with a T. gondii RHΔMAF1 mutant compared to mice infected with the wild-type strain (RH:WT) (12), although there were no significant MAF1-dependent differences in mouse morbidity. 	However, it has also been shown that expression of an HMA+ copy of MAF1 (specifically TgMAF1RHb1 [13; GenBank accession no. KU761334], here referred to as MAF1b) in parasites that do not normally exhibit HMA provided a competitive advantage in a mixed population of HMA+ and HMA− parasites during the acute phase of infection (13), suggesting that in the type II genetic, background, MAF1b expression (and therefore HMA itself) can influence infection outcome in vivo. 	Here we aimed to assess the impact of MAF1b complementation in naturally HMA− parasites on the progression and maintenance of chronic infections in mice and the cytokine responses that occur during the progression of disease over a 4-week period of infection. Recently published in vivo dual-transcriptional profiling of T. gondii and host (in this case, mouse) RNA, which is available at ToxoDB.org, suggests that MAF1 expression remains high (>80th percentile) during chronic infection (14).

PMC3207857	AY190944	Methods	ENA	False	For accuracy, sequence alignments were manually edited and the result compared to that obtained using DiAlign version 2.2.1 [73]. 	PHASE 2.1 [74], [75] was used for estimating haplotypes from genotype data, and phylogenetic trees were constructed using the maximum likelihood method in the program PHYLIP [76] and the sequence of D. pseudoobasura as outgroup (accession number AY190944). 	The program DnaSP 4.0 [77] was used to perform analyses of the intra- and inter-specific variability of the sequences. A modified version of the equation suggested by Schneider and Stephens [78] for constructing sequence logos was used to quantify conservation along the alignment of the sequences.

PMC4803225	ENSMUST00000054883	Results	Ensembl	False	The candidate gene Pou3f3 was selected for the sequence analysis, as it is located at 42.7 Mb on chromosome 1, and a published mutant phenotype has been described with increased plasma urea and potassium levels associated with renal hypoplasia (http://www.informatics.jax.org). Pou3f3 consists of a single exon coding for a 497 aa polypeptide. 	Sequence analysis of Pou3f3 revealed a T→C point mutation at nt 1268 (ENSMUST00000054883) which leads to the amino acid exchange from leucine to proline at aa position 423. 	Therefore, the name of line HST011 was designated as Pou3f3L423P. The mutation affects the highly conserved DNA binding domain of the protein including aa 403–462.

These most likely represent critical binding interactions between the two proteins during late complex I assembly.(C) Alignment of the three in-frame NDUFA6 transcripts demonstrates that ENST00000602404 (GenBank: NM_002490.5) uses an initiator methionine downstream of that used by ENST00000498737 (GenBank: NM_002490.4). 	The shortest transcript, ENST00000470753, initiates downstream of the highly conserved LYR motif (shaded yellow) that is reported to be critical for binding the mitochondrial acyl carrier (encoded by NDUFAB1); the function of this isoform therefore remains unknown.

PMC6174280	ENST00000602404	Article	Ensembl	False	All isoforms occur in frame and use alternative methionine residues for translation initiation (Figure 2C). 	Until now, no consensus on the clinically relevant transcripts has been reached, but Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data and in-house RNA-seq data19 support ENST00000602404.5 as the predominant isoform, and RNA expression data specifically correlate with the 5′ UTR of ENST00000602404.5 (Figure S2). 	These data have led ENST00000602404.5 to now be associated with the revised accession number GenBank: NM_002490.5. In order to further characterize the functional consequence of the subjects’ NDUFA6 variants, we undertook functional investigations with fibroblast cell lines from each subject for whom tissues were available (S1–S3). 
PMC4873755	ENSOARG00000023771	Results	Ensembl	False	Intriguingly, the transcript abundance of cadherin 26 (CDH26) was significantly induced by infection in both breeds (adjusted P value or FDR < 1.63 × 10−10); and is strongly correlated with worm counts only in CS (Fig. 3). 	However, infection had a bidirectional impact on the transcript abundance of a uncharacterized gene containing a unknown microRNA (ENSOARG00000023771), which was significantly upregulated in CHB but downregulated in CS. 	The genes significantly impacted by infection only in CS included mast cell proteinase-3, γ-glutamyltransferase 5 (GGT5), CD163 as well as those involved in smooth muscle contraction, such as tropomyosin (TPM2), myosin, light chain 9, regulatory (MYL9), and calponin 1, basic, smooth muscle (CNN1). Among the genes significantly impacted by infection in CHB sheep, several cytokine receptors and chemokines were strongly upregulated.

PMC5655033	ENST00000508189	Results	Ensembl	False	These advanced analyses on the expression of RP11-234O6.2 demonstrated an important role. 	RP11-234O6.2, whose transcript is ENST00000508189.1, was located in Chromosome 4. 	From the microarray analyses of RPE/choroid samples from early AMD cases, it was found that the relative expression of RP11-234O6.2 was significantly decreased compared with controls. In order to detect the expression pattern of RP11-234O6.2 in the aging RPE in vitro model, a real-time PCR method was used to detect the content of RP11-234O6.2. 
PMC4600337	ENSECAG00000013338	Results	Ensembl	False	Two of these were known variations in the genes LYST and NID1 (rs394520771 and rs394402493, respectively). 	The variant in the gene coding for β-1,3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 (B3GALNT2 [Ensembl:ENSECAG00000013338]) was a very likely candidate for the hydrocephalus phenotype. 	The mutation introduced a stopcodon on ECA1:75,907,505 (exon 12), c.1423C>T [GenBank:XM_001491545] corresponding to p.Gln475* [GenBank:XP_001491595]. In humans, a muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy phenotype [MDDGA11, MIM:615181] including hydrocephalus has recently been associated with mutations in B3GALNT2 [30, 31].

PMC4600337	ENSMUSG00000059854	Discussion	Ensembl	False	The autosomal recessive mutation responsible for a neuropathic form of hydrocephalus has been identified in Angus beef cattle (OMIA:000487-9913, Hydrocephalus in Bos taurus). 	In mice, an autosomal recessive mutation in HYDIN (hydrocephalus-inducing [Ensembl:ENSMUSG00000059854]) causes a lethal form of a communicating hydrocephalus with a perinatal onset. 	A 2-bp deletion in exon 15 results in a premature termination of the protein [37]. The mode of inheritance of hydrocephalus in Friesian horses appears to be autosomal recessive and genetic heterogeneity was not observed within our sample of the population. 
PMC3708281	ENSG00000051180	Methods	Ensembl	False	For this study we chose the c.-61 G>T (rs1801321) and g.38922G>C (rs4417527) polymorphisms of the RAD51 gene and the g.96267 A>C (rs2270132) and g.85394 A>G (rs2380165) polymorphisms of the BLM gene with a minor allele frequency (MAF) 0.467, 0.109, 0.376 and 0.333 in European population, respectively (submitter population ID: HapMap-CEU for all; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp). 	Primers were designed according to the published nucleotide sequence in ENSEMBL database (RAD51 gene ID: ENSG00000051180 and BLM gene ID: ENSG00000197299) and using Primer3 software for c.-61 G>T, g.38922 G>C, g.96267 A>C SNPs (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/) and Web-based allele-specific primer software for g.85394 SNP (http://bioinfo.biotec.or.th/WASP). 	
PMC4065256	ENSDARP00000012766	Methods	Ensembl	False	Atlantic salmon TAAR genes and pseudogenes were identified in contig sequences from the first assembly of the Atlantic salmon genome (Davidson et al. 2010; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/313068/). 	We used the “gene comparison” function on ASalBase (www.asalbase.org), which performs BLASTx (Altschul et al. 1990) of contig sequences to identify a protein of interest: in this case using Danio rerio TAAR 1a (ENSDARP00000012766) as the query. 	We classified TAARs as putatively functional if the contig had high sequence similarity to a known TAAR and contained an open reading frame of appropriate length (approximately 1 kb) in the correct reading frame and location identified through BLASTx. We termed a TAAR a putative pseudogene if there was high sequence similarity to a known TAAR but there was no obvious open reading frame or if there was a disruption in the coding sequence that was predicted to produce a truncated or abnormal product. 
PMC6096847	ENSBTAG00000027865	Results	Ensembl	False	These included genes orthologous to the five granzyme genes found in humans (A, B, K, H and M) and a further gene with no close orthologue in any species but most closely related to granzyme A (Table 2). 	We have designated this novel nucleotide sequence (genome reference ENSBTAG00000027865) Granzyme O (following previous alphabetical allocation of letter symbols). 	Sequences matching each of the bovine granzyme genes identified from the genome were found within the GenBank bovine EST database: granzyme A (EH165320.1), granzyme O (CN787157.1), granzyme B (DN533698.1), granzyme H (CK776010.1), granzyme K (FE012584.1) and granzyme M (DV805053.1). Searches of this database using other murine granzyme gene sequences did not reveal any additional bovine granzymes. 
PMC6096847	ENSG00000249454	Results	Ensembl	False	The EST sequence data in both species (pig EST database reference BW979091.1), together with RT-PCR analysis of cattle T cells in this study, indicate that granzyme O is expressed. 	Analysis of genome DNA sequence in the region between the granzyme A and K genes in human and mouse revealed an unprocessed pseudogene in human (ENSG00000249454.1) and a processed pseudogene in mouse (ENSMUSG00000051002), which exhibit 89 and 66% nucleotide similarity to cattle granzyme O gene, respectively (Supplementary 1B). 	The human granzyme O-like pseudogene comprises four exons that contain several premature stop codons, whereas the mouse granzyme O-like pseudogene contains only 259 bp of DNA sequence, which based on alignments appears to correspond to exon 4 in the bovine gene (Supplementary 1A). Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences of bovine, human, pig and murine granzyme A, granzyme K and granzyme O identified three distinct subgroups segregated according to granzyme gene, with the O subgroup being more closely related to A than K (Supplementary 1C). 
PMC3044698	ENSG00000214274	Methods	Ensembl	False	PCR was performed (Biolase DNA polymerase kit; Bioline, Taunton, MA) using the following conditions for 35 cycles: denaturing at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 62 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 1 min. 	The angiogenin primers used were designed from the Ensembl #ENSG00000214274 sequence as follows: forward primer, 5′-CGT CCG TGT ACA CAC ACT CA-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GCA CGA AGA CCA ACA ACA AA-3′ (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). 	PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel (FisherBiotech horizontal electrophoresis system; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) at 135 V for approximately 45 min. Gels were stained using ethidium bromide. 
PMC4579392	ENSCAFT00000044150	Results	Ensembl	False	In pointing dogs, these two SNPs were specifically linked to individual amino acid exchanges in the proteins encoded by genes CYSLTR2 and SETDB2, respectively. 	Bioinformatic analyses (using the program PolyPhen-2 [14]) indicated that the non-synonymous SNP rs23041730 (Pro > Arg) in the CYSLTR2 gene might affect the functionality of the gene product (score 0.938), although SNP rs23066192 (Ser > Asn) in the SETDB2 gene (transcripts ENSCAFT00000044150 and ENSCAFT00000006968) was predicted not to affect the functionality of its encoded protein. 	SIFT [15] entries obtained from the Ensembl [16] database for the two non-synonymous exchanges indicate borderline tolerance of the rs23041730 exchange, with a score of 0.06 for the CYSLTR2 gene and tolerance of the rs23066192 exchange, with scores of 0.23 and 0.32 for the SETDB2 gene. However, the stability of the protein encoded by the SETDB2 gene was predicted (by MUpro) to increase through a Ser > Asn change (rs23066192, confidence score 0.46), whereas it decreased for a Pro > Arg change (CYSLTR2, rs23041730, confidence score: −0.49). 
PMC3362330	ENSBTAG00000006806	Results	Ensembl	False	Unlike what was observed in the bovine muscle tissue where the transcriptome was dominated by a handful of genes (Baldwin et al 2012, personal communication), the most abundant gene in the rumen epithelial transcriptome was a mitochondrial gene, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, represented by ~6.23% of sequence reads. 	The 20 most abundant genes in the rumen epithelial transcriptome, which accounted for ~23.8% of sequences, included 6 genes of mitochondrial origin, such as cytochrome b, and 3 keratin genes, such as keratin, type I cytoskeletal 17 (Ensembl ID: ENSBTAG00000006806) and keratin, type II cytoskeletal 59 kDa, component IV ( ENSBTAG00000039425). 	This is in contrast to the bovine small intestine transcriptome,21 in which the 20 most abundant genes accounted for ~13.3% of sequences. Among the 20 most abundant transcripts, only 3 genes were shared in the transcriptome of both the small intestine and the rumen epithelium, including cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (ENSBTAG00000043561), elongation factor 1-alpha 1 (ENSBTAG00000014534), and a novel protein-coding gene (ENSBTAG00000034185).

PMC4987111	GCA_000485575.1	Results	GCA	False	We compared our protein-coding gene annotation set with annotated proteins from zebrafish (Danio rerio) (Howe et al. 2013), stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) (Jones et al. 2012), medaka (Oryzias latipes) (Kasahara et al. 2007), fugu (Takifugu rubripes) (Aparicio et al. 2002), Amazon molly (Poecilia formosa) (W. 	Warren and The Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, GenBank Assembly ID GCA_000485575.1), mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus) (GenBank Assembly ID GCA_000826765.1), and turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri) (Dario et al. 2015) (fig. 2). 	In a comparison among the eight species, 4,827 genes were unique to mangrove rivulus. It is important to note that defining unique genes is a difficult endeavor, especially in teleost fish, and these are preliminary results. 
PMC5812507	GCA_000146045.2	Methods	GCA	False	Custom made Perl scripts were used to map systematic names to the annotated gene names. 	Telomere repeat sequences (TEL07R of size 7306 bp and TEL07L of size 781 bp) from the manually curated and complete reference genome for S. cerevisiae S288C RefSeq assembly accession: GCA_000146045.2 obtained from SGD were aligned to the assembly as a proxy to assess completeness of each assembled chromosome. 	SGIDs for TEL07R and TEL07L are S000028960 and S000028887, respectively. The Tablet genome browser (Milne et al.2013) was used to visualise nanopore reads aligned to the nanopore de novo assemblies. 
PMC5812507	GCA_000146045.2	Methods	GCA	False	Comparison of the CEN.PK113-7D assembly to the S288C genome 	The nanopore assembly of CEN.PK113–7D and the reference genome of S288C (Accession number GCA_000146045.2) were annotated using the MAKER2 pipeline described in the ‘De novo genome assembly’ section. 	For each genome, a list of gene names per chromosome was constructed and compared strictly on their names to identify genes names absent in the corresponding chromosome in the other genome. The ORFs of genes identified as absent in either genome were aligned using BLASTN (version 2.2.31 +) to the total set of ORFs of the other genome and matches with an alignment length of half the query and with a sequence identity of at least 95% were listed. 
PMC5812507	GCA_000146045.2	Results	GCA	False	Most chromosomes of the nanopore de novo assembly are single contigs and are flanked by telomere repeats. 	Genome completeness was determined by alignment to the manually curated reference genome of the strain S288C RefSeq assembly accession: GCA_000146045.2 (Table S2, Supporting Information). 	The two largest yeast chromosomes, IV and XII, were each split into two separate contigs, and two additional contigs (31 and 38 Kbp in length) corresponded to unplaced subtelomeric fragments. In particular, the assembly for chromosome XII was interrupted in the RDN1 locus—a repetitive region consisting of gene encoding ribosomal RNA estimated to be more than 1 Mbp long (Venema and Tollervey 1999). 
PMC6278149	GCA_000952835.1	Results	GCA	False	nrBlast was performed to identify genes containing at least one IPR domain associated with chromium tolerance in the genome of A. 	Flavus strain TERIBR1, NRRL3357 (http://fungidb.org/fungidb/app/record/organism/aflaNRRL3357) and AF70 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_000952835.1). 	23/34 bacterial IPR domains were not found in any of the three strains of A. flavus. A total of 493 candidate genes was identified to harbor one or more IPR domains of interest in TERIBR1(Table 1). 
PMC6004538	GCA_002442835.1	Methods	GCA	False	Reads shorter than 20 bp were removed using Trimmomatic version 0.36 (Bolger et al., 2014). 	Remaining reads were mapped to the genome assembly of L. paracasei FAM18149 (GenBank: GCA_002442835.1) using Bowtie2 (version 2.2.1, default parameters) (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012). 	For the differential expression analysis, the reads were counted using HTSeq (Anders et al., 2014), and only the reads that aligned to a predicted CDS were included (version 0.6.1, options: -a 1 -m intersection-nonempty). Finally, the dataset was normalized (size factor normalization) and tested (Wald test) for differential gene expression using DEseq2 (version 1.6.3) (Love et al., 2014). 
PMC5521735	GCA_001014495.1	Methods	GCA	False	To determine if Sid-1/Tag-130 homologs were present in Diptera we BLAST searched (tBLASTn) the genome assemblies of three dipteran species. 	Species selected were: Drosophila pseudoobscura (GenBank assembly accession: GCA_001014495.1), Aedes aegypti (GCA_001014885.1), and Anopheles gambiae (GCA_001542645.1). 	We used ten amino acid sequences involved in RNAi pathways known from Drosophila melanogaster and one amino acid sequence (Sid-1), which is absent in Drosophila, but is known from B. mori as query sequences (supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online). All sequences were downloaded from the NCBI protein database. We used each of the eleven amino acid sequences as a query for blastp (BLAST program suite, Altschul et al. 1990) and searched within Geneious against local BLAST databases created from the 100 transcriptomes and the seven official gene sets. 
PMC4551341	GCA_000027305.1	Methods	GCA	False	Successfully detected barcodes were removed from the sequence leaving paired-end reads of 30 nt in length, while reads containing no recognizable barcode sequence were discarded. 	Reads for each sample were aligned to the H. influenzae Rd KW20 GCA_000027305.1 genome assembly (Ensembl bacteria genome database) using Bowtie version 2.0 with default parameters and randomness which when the program is faced with a sequence that aligns to multiple parts of the genome equally well, chooses one region randomly and the others are discarded. 	Transcript abundance was determined using the feature counts program to estimate the level of transcription for each gene, and the number of reads that mapped within each annotated coding sequence (CDS) was determined. Differential expression was assessed using DESeq2, which estimates variance-mean dependence in read counts and uses negative binomial distribution to test for differential expression. 
PMC5759245	GCA_000233375.4	Methods	GCA	False	OrthoFinder represents a novel method of orthogroup detection, by performing reciprocal best-hit BLASTs that are normalised for transcript length, removing transcript length bias in the ortholog detection. 	OrthoFinder analysis was conducted for all pair-wise comparisons, for all four species assemblies, as well as against the Atlantic salmon RefSeq proteins (GCA_000233375.4) in order to identify putative orthologs within the current datasets and to provide a reference source of identified orthologs and their distribution relative to the existing high-quality protein set for Atlantic salmon. 	We used the outputs from OrthoFinder to determine the number of overlapping (shared across species) transcripts across our four assemblies. Utilising the sister taxa in the present study provides a validation of the completeness of our de novo transcriptomes.

In addition to assessing completeness of the final assemblies, we also applied OrthoFinder to assess and control completeness of our assemblies at each stage of the filtering pipeline, by comparing orthogroup size distribution within our salmon de novo assemblies relative to the Atlantic salmon RefSeq protein set (GCA_000233375.4). 	Third, we quantified the extent of overlap between our four assemblies and the recently published Atlantic salmon reference genome [12]. Transcripts from our four assemblies were aligned to the Atlantic salmon reference genome ICSASG_v2 (GenBank: GCA_000233375.4 [54]) with GMAP (2016–11-07) [55], additionally using the ‘--cross-species’ parameter for heterospecific mapping.

Fourth, we compared completeness and similarity of the current assemblies for Arctic charr, brown trout and European whitefish to previously published transcriptomes for these three species. We compared our Arctic charr assembly to the Magnanou et al.

PMC6406894	GO:0008283	Results	Gene Ontology (GO)	False	Clones A and D had a reduced growth rate as compared to the other clones (Figure 2A,B). 	Therefore, we sought to identify somatic variants in genes associated with cell population proliferation (using gene ontology term GO:0008283) that were particular to clones A and D to explain the differences in growth rate (Supplementary Tables S3 and S6). 	Potentially interesting variants such as a missense variant in the G protein-coupled receptor SMO (chr7:128850945 G>A) and an SV affecting a putative tumour suppressor CHD5 (predicted loss of function) were identified. However, the in silico prediction of the effect of the variants on the resulting proteins remains unclear, and further functional analysis would be required to assess the impact of these somatic variants on the growth rate of the clonal cell lines. 
PMC4873755	GO:0031714	Discussion	Gene Ontology (GO)	False	As a result, both classical and alternative complement pathways appeared to be activated in the resistant breed. 	Furthermore, two GO molecular functions related to C5a (GO:0031714) and C5L2 anaphylatoxin chemotactic receptor binding (GO:0031715) were significantly enriched in the resistant breed. 	It is conceivable that these peptides play a critical role in subsequent recruitment of effector cells, such eosinophils and mast cells, to the site of infection. Intriguingly, approximately 15% of the 711 genes whose transcript abundance were significantly altered by infection in the resistant breed were cell cycle related.

Particularly, in the FTD-network (Fig 2 and S1 Fig) oxidative stress was impacted due to impaired energetic metabolism [52,53] eliciting the activation of stress-responsive receptors, including Frizzled-4 (FDZ4) and EGFR [54–64], and oxidative stress-inducible Serine/Threonine kinases CAMK2A, PRKACG, PRKACB, and PRKG1 [54–83]. Collaterally, these effectors may further induce neuron membrane potentiation, leading to apoptosis through activation of the MAPK-JNK signaling pathway [73–77] and Ca2+/cAMP metabolism deregulation [84–91].

PMC4528696	GO:0051716	Results	Gene Ontology (GO)	False	We unified Pfam keywords by the Pfam Clan assignments [27]. 	For example, a high-level function of signaling receptors (collectively called membrane receptors, MR) includes ion channels and sensory receptors annotated as 7tm chemosensory receptor, 7tm odorant receptor, transporters and ion channels (GO:0006811, ion transport and GO:0051716 cellular response to stimulus, see Methods). 	Another large group of Pfam keywords is the transposition and nucleic acid processes (collectively called TNAP). The Pfam keywords that are combined by TNAP include transposase, non-specific endonucleases, viral and transposons, integrase and multiple families of reverse transcriptase (total of 23 Pfam keywords). 
PMC4528696	GO:0007160	Results	Gene Ontology (GO)	False	We conclude that the clear difference in the appearance of TNAP families (Fig. 4b) is not evident for MR function (Fig. 4d). 	Additional high-level functions such as Proteolysis (GO:0006508) and Cell-matrix adhesion (GO:0007160) failed to separate the SSFs between the two major clades of insects. 	An unbiased function view leads to biological interpretation of superfamilies By analyzing SSF we seek functions that are associated with one (or more) species. 
PMC3610648	GO:0003674	Results	Gene Ontology (GO)	False	This is comparable to the 15.3% of 95,916 unigenes annotated with GO terms in N. tabacum [49]. 	The N. benthamiana unigene transcripts were further refined to GO slim terms, annotating 25.5% as having a biological process (GO:008150), 24.3% to being a cellular component (GO:005575), and 24.3% to having a molecular function (GO:0003674). 	The distribution of the unigenes into GO slim categories is provided in Figure S1. To better understand why only such a relatively small proportion of unigenes could be annotated with GO terms, the transcriptome mapping statistics were examined.

PMC3362330	GO:0043226	Results	Gene Ontology (GO)	False	Among the indirect interactions (2nd neighbors), 1052 of the 1472 genes involved were significantly impacted by butyrate, including a total of 111 transcription factors in vitro. 	The predominant GO terms identified as enriched among its 1st neighbors relate to the cellular component organelle (GO:0043226), including membrane-bounded organelle (GO:0043227) and intracellular organelle (GO:0043229). 	CREBBP (ENSBTAG00000026403) encodes a protein with intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity, which acetylates both histone and non-histone proteins. CREBBP acts as a transcriptional coactivator of RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription and is known to play a critical role in cell growth and human diseases. 
PMC3362330	GO:0016570	Results	Gene Ontology (GO)	False	Of these CREBBP 2nd neighbors, 140 were regulated by butyrate including 19 transcription factors. 	Not coincidently, the GO terms predominantly enriched in the direct interaction of CREBBP were related to biological processes such as histone modification (GO:0016570) and covalent chromatin modification (GO0016569), cellular components such as histone acetyltransferase complex (GO:0000123) and NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex (GO:0035267), and molecular functions such as histone acetyltransferase activity (GO:0004402) and nucleic acid binding (GO:0003676). 	
PMC3362330	GO:0046332	Discussion	Gene Ontology (GO)	False	Moreover, of 24 genes in the 2nd neighbors category, all were also regulated by butyrate, including three transcription factors, JUN, upstream transcription factor 2, c-fos interacting (USF2), and REST corepressor 1 (RCOR1). 	GO analysis identified GO terms significantly enriched in this network, including SMAD binding (GO:0046332 and GO:0070412), SMAD protein signal transduction (GO:0060395), and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β receptor signaling (GO:0007179). 	FOS binding at the TGF-β1 promoter proximal AP-1 site is required for TGF-β1 production by colon carcinoma cells.43 Indeed, previous studies have shown that SMAD proteins cooperate with FOS/JUN complex to mediate TGF-β-induced transcription.44 Thus, ARACNE correctly inferred a direct interaction between FOS and JUN (Fig. 4) as well as interaction between JOS and HBEGF. HBEGF plays a pivotal role in mediating the early cellular response to intestinal injury by serving as a potent cytoprotective factor.45 Other experimental evidence also provides a strong support of a direct interaction between FOS and HBEGF.45,46

After merging these data sets, 8 consistently dysregulated miRNAs were identified (Figure 2A). The online analysis tool GEO2R revealed 5 upregulated miRNAs (miR-182, miR-20a, miR-31, miR-424, and miR-675) and 3 downregulated ones (miR-133a, miR-378, and miR-592) in the CRC tissue compared to the ANT (Figure 2B–E).

Microarray data obtained in the current study have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) public repository with GSE19275 and GSE26091 GEO accession numbers. 	Before performing the eQTL scan, the “minimum fold-change” filter implemented in the BRB-ArrayTools was applied in order to filter out those probes displaying low expression variability across the 105 muscle samples. The criterion consisted on selecting those probes with more than 20% of its expression values (from the 105 arrays) meeting at least ±1.5 times the median expression of the probe.

PMC6381672	GSE65485	Introduction	GEO	False	Although several lncRNAs have been reported to participate in the tumorigenesis and progression of HCC, the expressions and roles of most lncRNAs in HCC are still unclear. 	In this study, we analyzed differentially expressed lncRNAs in HCC compared to normal liver tissues based on the microarray data from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset (GSE65485) and identified a novel highly expressed lncRNA MCM3AP antisense RNA 1 (MCM3AP-AS1) in HCC. 	Next, we investigated the expression, clinical significance, functional role and underlying mechanisms of MCM3AP-AS1 in HCC. 
PMC6381672	GSE65485	Results	GEO	False	A novel lncRNA MCM3AP-AS1 is overexpressed in HCC 	To further disclose differentially expressed lncRNAs in HCC, we analyzed a microarray data comparing the expression of lncRNAs in 50 HCC tissues and 5 adjacent non-tumor tissues from the GEO database with the accession number GSE65485. 	Thirty-seven lncRNAs were differentially expressed in HCC tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues (Table 3). A novel lncRNA MCM3AP-AS1 (also known as MCM3APAS), which was 2.84-fold higher in HCC tissues than that in adjacent non-tumor tissues, caught our attention. 
PMC6381672	GSE45436	Results	GEO	False	Elevated expression of MCM3AP-AS1 also observed in HCC cell lines (HepG2, Hep3B, SMMC-7721 and Huh7) compared to LO2 cells (P < 0.05, Fig. 1b). 	Moreover, based on two other GEO datasets (GSE45436 and GSE54236) from R2: Genomics Analysis and Visualization Platform (http://r2.amc.nl), we found that MCM3AP-AS1 expression was prominently higher in HCC tissues compared to normal liver tissues (P < 0.0001, Fig. 1c and d). 	
PMC6184486	GSE65740	Results	GEO	False		Also a significant anti-regulation was observed for the NO-responsive transcriptome at 1 h with the transcriptome of the untreated coi1-16ein2sid2ctrl (GEO code GSE65740) mutant (Fig. 1C). 	Genes that were down-regulated by NO showed only a significant co-regulation with the transcriptome of plants under darkness (Fig. 1C). Identification and characterization of the NO-responsive transcriptome. 
PMC6184486	GSE12715	Results	GEO	False	To check whether ethylene perception and signaling are involved in sensing NO, we tested the sensitivity to NO in hypocotyl shortening assays with the ethylene-insensitive etr1-3 and ein2-5 mutants (Roman et al., 1995). Figure 3A shows that etr1-3 and ein2-5 seedlings were fully insensitive to NO in inhibiting hypocotyl elongation, thus suggesting that ethylene perception and signaling were essential for NO sensing. 	The comparison of the NO-responsive transcriptome with the differential transcriptomes previously reported for the ein2-1 and etr1-1 mutants (Cheng et al., 2009; GEO Accession GSE12715) points to a significant overlap (Fig. 3B). 	There were 57 genes that were common for the three transcriptomes and an additional 73 and 129 genes in the intersections of the NO-responsive genes and ein2-1, and the NO-responsive genes and etr1-1, respectively (Fig. 3B), thus supporting a potential relevant involvement of ETR1 and EIN2 in NO sensing. We can rule out that the involvement of ETR1 and EIN2 in NO sensing was due to transcriptional regulation of the corresponding genes by NO, as only slight increases below 1.6-fold in the corresponding transcripts were detected in NO-treated plants (Supplementary Fig.

PMC6095625	GSE52490	Results	GEO	False	RNase R-sequencing for the detection of circular RNAs 	As an initial exploration into whether EBV expresses circular RNAs, we analyzed our previously reported ribodepletion RNA-seq data from the EBV positive Burkitt’s lymphoma cell line, Akata, induced to undergo viral reactivation through B-cell receptor cross-linking (GEO series accession number, GSE52490) [25]. 	Using find_circ [26] to identify backsplice junction candidates, over a hundred unique backsplice junction calls were made across the EBV genome using this dataset (S1 Table and S1 Fig). Nevertheless, the bulk of these were low abundance and/or were deemed low-confidence upon realignment of raw RNA-seq data to conjoined sequences spanning a handful of these backsplice junctions and some backsplice junction calls mapped to simple repeat regions raising concerns about misalignment.

PMC5352074	GSE12417	Discussion	GEO	False		In this study, we derived a gene signature including 42 probes which mapped to 43 annotated genes from GDSC blood cell lines and the GEO GSE12417 dataset. 	The chemo-sensitivity score calculated based on the expression level of the 42 probes was significantly associated with OS in GSE12417 CN-AML patients and replicated in the TCGA AML dataset.

PMC3108973	GSE25317	Abstract	GEO	False	Further study in the more sensitive OVCAR-3 cell line showed that it could potently induce cell apoptosis (Annexin V-FITC assay), G2/M cell cycle arrest (PI staining analysis) and also dose-dependently inhibit OVCAR-3 xenograft tumors' growth on female athymic nude mice (BALB/c, nu/nu). 	Mechanistic studies (both in vitro and in vivo) revealed that FBA-TPQ might exert its activity through Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)-associated activation of the death receptor, p53-MDM2, and PI3K-Akt pathways in OVCAR-3 cells, which is in accordance with in vitro microarray (Human genome microarrays, Agilent) data analysis (GEO accession number: GSE25317). 	In conclusion, FBA-TPQ exhibits significant anticancer activity against ovarian cancer cells, with minimal toxicity to non-tumorigenic human IOSE-144 cells, indicating that it may be a potential therapeutic agent for ovarian cancer.

PMC5043592	GSE21510	Results	GEO	False	Global mRNA gene expression profiling of CRC tissue and adjacent normal mucosa revealed decreased levels of BMP-2 gene expression (Fig. 1a) [2]. 	Follow up bioinformatics analysis of CRC gene expression data using the GEO database (GSE21510) revealed similar pattern of down regulation of BMP-2 gene expression in CRC compared to normal tissues, and this was also observed in metastatic and metastatic recurrent CRC lesions, suggesting that loss of BMP2 is an unfavourable event in CRC pathogenesis and progression (Fig. 1b). 	Lentiviral-mediated stable overexpression of BMP2 reduced viability of HCT116 CRC cells in vitro (Fig. 1c, d). Adding exogenous recombinant BMP2 to HCT116 cells led to similar results (Additional file 1: Figure S1).

PMC3180291	GSE26280	Results	GEO	False	To elucidate the molecular basis underlying drought response, transcript levels of genes were screened under drought conditions. 	Using expression data for stress treatment in rice seedlings (http://www.ricearray.org), 12 drought-responsive ERF genes (DERF) were identified (Table S1, GEO accession number GSE26280). 	One of the DERF genes, OsDERF1 (Os08g35240), located in rice chromosome 8, encodes a 243-amino-acid protein with predicted molecular mass of 23.8 kDa. Amino acid analysis indicated that the putative protein contains a typical ERF/AP2 domain at 26–91th amino acids, an activation domain at 161–180th amino acids, and a nuclear localization signal at 25–34th amino acids.

PMC3129529	GSE26664	Methods	GEO	False	Using Edena (Hernandez et al., 2008), 9 950 730 32 nt reads were assembled with parameters m=16 and M=16, which yielded the highest N50 value (N50=170). 	The raw data and assembly are available from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE26664. 	The total DNA of a eukaryote may contain up to three different translation codes (De Grey, 2005): nuclear, mitochondrial and plastid (if the organism is photosynthetic, but this is not the case for G.pseudospinescens). To avoid mixing these signals, the user can choose to feed individual contigs to FACIL, but this might lead to a bad genetic code prediction due to shortage of data. 
PMC6307757	GSE26459	Results	GEO	False	Down‐regulated DLG5 expression in TAM‐resistant breast cancer tissues and cells 	The relationship between DLG5 expression and TAM resistance in ER+ breast cancer was firstly analysed by a gene expression profile in the GEO database (GSE26459), which showed that DLG5 expression in the TAM‐resistance MCF7 cells was significantly lower than that in the TAM‐sensitive MCF7 cells (P < 0.01, Figure 1A). 	Immunohistochemistry analysis of nine paired of TAM resistant and sensitive breast cancer tissues indicated that while higher levels of DLG5 expression were detected in adjacent tissues the levels of DLG5 expression in the TAM‐resistant breast cancer tissues were lower than that in the TAM‐sensitive breast cancer tissues in this population (Figure 1B and C, Table 1). Similarly, the relative levels of DLG5 mRNA transcripts and protein expression in the TAM‐resistant MCF7‐TamR cells were significantly lower than that in the TAM‐sensitive MCF‐7 cells, but higher than that in the high TAM‐resistant LCC2 cells (Figure 1D‐E). 
PMC6307757	GSE26459	Results	GEO	False	DLG5 suppresses the breast cancer stem cell‐like characteristics to restore TAM sensitivity by inhibiting TAZ expression and nuclear translocation 	Given that the Hippo transducer TAZ is required for sustained self‐renewal of BCSCs,16 we analysed TAZ expression in the gene expression profile from the GEO database (GSE26459) and our paired breast cancer tissues. 	The results indicated that the relative levels of TAZ expression in TAM‐resistant MCF7 cells were significantly higher than that in the TAM‐sensitive MCF7 (Figure 5A and B). Similarly, DLG5 silencing decreased the TAZ phosphorylation, and increased the relative levels of TAZ and its nuclear translocation in MCF7 cells while DLG5 overexpression increased the TAZ phosphorylation, and decreased TAZ protein expression, and nuclear translocation in LCC2 cells (Figure 5C and D).

The complete dataset from this study has been deposited at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA) with the Accession No. GSE43083. 	A ratio of the mean RPKM values (gacA mutant/WT) was computed for each gene and displayed by gene order from the chromosome origin of replication (Fig. 1). Comparisons were performed using a modified t-test and genes with differences in gene expression based on the ratio were considered for further analysis when the P-value was less than 0.05 (except as otherwise mentioned) and the expression ratio was ≥2.0 or ≤0.5 (Table S3) (Wang et al. 2011).

The gene expression profiling of MTSS1, DNMT3B and DNMT3A in different AML subsets (GEO accession number GSE1159) is shown (A and B). 	MTSS1 mRNA levels were measured by qRT-PCR in human AML cell lines carrying either a FLT3-ITD mutation (MV4-11), t(15;17) (NB4), t(8;21) (Kasumi-1) or undefined genetic changes (U937) in relative expression to GAPDH (n = 3; C) which was verified at the protein level by Western Blot analysis using GAP-DH as a loading control (D).

Using the Leukemia Gene Atlas [37] and data from the German AMLCG 1999 clinical trial [19], two groups of patients (above vs. below the median expression of MTSS1) were analyzed for overall survival (OS) in NK AML patients (n = 163, logrank test P = 0.03; GEO accession number GSE12417; B). 	Similarly, in the same trial, patients with a DNMT3B expression above vs. below the median were analyzed for survival (n = 163, logrank test P = 0.04; C). We then segregated patients into two groups based on their MTSS1 and DNMT3B expression levels according to high MTSS1 and low DNMT3B or low MTSS1 and high DNMT3B expression and assessed overall survival (AMLCG 1999, n = 163, logrank test P = 0.006; D).

PMC6092840	GSE83404	Methods	GEO	False	All 3- to 5-year-old horses had taken part in flat races at distances ranging from 1400 to 3000 m. The racing performance traits considered were wins by taking 1st, 2nd or 3rd place and the total number of wins from 1st to 3rd places, the number of races in which the horse participated, and the financial benefits obtained by the horses (wins resulting in money). 	Based on RNA-seq data previously obtained from Arabian horse blood and muscle transcriptome sequencing (GEO databases: GSE83404; GSE88951), all of the coding sequences and 3′ and 5’ UTR regions were screened to detect polymorphisms. 	DNA was isolated using the Sherlock AX DNA Isolation kit (A&A Biotechnology, Gdynia, Poland).

PMC2265304	GSE2052	Article	GEO	False	For example, WISP-1 and the secreted frizzled-related protein 2 are increased in IPF compared with hypersensitivity pneumonitis [3]. 	Several other Wnt pathway-related genes are also overexpressed in IPF lungs compared to normal controls (Table 1; dataset used in [6]; Gene Expression Omnibus database serial accession number GSE2052). 	The overall balance of the Wnt pathway genes overexpressed in IPF lungs seems to favor activation of the canonic pathway (Figure 2).

PMC4360730	GM12878	Article	IGSR/1000 Genomes	False	We attempt to bridge the ontologies by adding a relationship between the most specific parent term possible in one ontology and the most generic term possible in the other ontology to maximize connectivity across the ontology boundaries. 	For example, rather than connect cell line GM12878 (EFO:0002784) directly to B cell (CL:0000236), we used a more general term B-cell-derived cell line (EFO:0001640) to extend the relationships to current and future B cell lines. 	For cases in which two ontology boundaries needed to be crossed, we applied similar logic to both boundaries. Once determined, the required relationships are reported to the relevant ontologies using their designated format of issue submission.

The relative underperformance of sample NA10859 in the three-index library is not observed in the nine-index library and is unlikely to be due to a systemtaic problem with the ACACAT index. 	
PMC3041504	NA10859	Discussion	IGSR/1000 Genomes	False	The problem of differential ligation efficiency for individual indexes11 has been resolved here by quantifying each ligated and PCR-enriched sequencing library and then combining individual indexed sample libraries in equimolar amounts prior to target enrichment. 	In the three-index sample library, the sample with the ACACAT index (NA10859) had approximately one-third less reads than the other two indexed samples in that library. 	However, in the nine-index sample library, where the read counts for all nine individual samples were within a tight range of each other, the same ACACAT index did not under perform compared with the other indexes. Differences in sample read counts are more likely due to pipetting or quantitation error when the sequencing libraries are initially combined prior to the enrichment process.

We chose these two data sets because they were performed independently at two different institutions, used different protocols, and analyzed four cell types, HeLa S3, K562, Hu ESC, and GM12878 each with distinct features, three being transformed cells and one being a primary human embryonic stem cell. 	Furthermore, all four cell types are from distinct tissues and ESCs pluripotent cells that are not yet committed to a differentiation pathway. These PAS flanking regions were further split into three groups namely no CF, short CF (<200 nt), and long CF (≥200 nt). 
PMC6288901	GM12878	Introduction	IGSR/1000 Genomes	False	For callers identifying nested TADs, we separately investigate the enrichment of TAD-associated biological features at different levels of nesting. 	Each caller was run on the high-quality Hi-C data generated for chromosome 6 of the lymphoblastoid cell line GM12878 (Fig. 1a). 	This model was chosen as it is one of the cell lines where Hi-C data have been generated at the highest resolution [2], and chromosome 6 had the average chromosome length and number of reads per kb. Results were often heterogeneous among callers and conditions, prompting caution when drawing conclusions from specific TAD partitions, but also highlighted consistent good performance for some callers. 
PMC6288901	GM12878	Results	IGSR/1000 Genomes	False	The ability of a caller to robustly perform independent of the resolution and quality of the data is highly desirable, as Hi-C experiments with high sequencing depth remain costly and, thus, difficult to scale to large datasets. 	To specifically assess the performance of all callers when different numbers of reads are available, independent of the bin size of the matrix, we systematically subsampled Hi-C contacts determined for the GM12878 cell line (chromosome 6) and compared the TADs called with subsampled reads with those obtained from the complete contact matrix. 	For this test, we used ICE-normalized data binned in 50-kb intervals and generated 13 different matrices using different percentages of reads that ranged from 100 to 0.01%, corresponding to an estimated cost ranging from over $1000 to less than a dollar (Fig. 3 top panel). Some of the tested callers failed to return a TAD partition for low sequencing depth, in particular arrowhead and HiTAD did not identify TADs with less than 1% of the reads (Additional file 2: Figure S3). 
PMC6288901	GM12878	Results	IGSR/1000 Genomes	False	Across all analyses, we could confirm highly correlated results (Additional file 2: Figure S5), indicating that these are robust with respect to and independent of the chosen chromosome. 	To further corroborate our results, we compared TAD and TAD features derived from chromosome 6 of the GM12878 cell line with four distinct datasets: two independent replicates of the GM12878 model and two independent Hi-C datasets including human fetal fibroblasts (IMR90 cell line) and mouse cortical neurons (MCN) [45]. 	For these analyses, we selected a subset of 6 callers that exhibited variable performance across our tests: arrowhead, CaTCH, HiCseg, ICFinder, spectral, and TopDom. First, we compared the concordance (MoC) between TADs identified by each caller in the two independent GM12878 replicates. 
PMC4500966	NA12891	Methods	IGSR/1000 Genomes	False	The individual NA12891 (CEU trio father) was used as the reference for comparisons against all the other samples. 	A threshold (T) and a sliding-window size (WS) that best fitted each of our samples was chosen based on the following reasoning: we sub-sampled the reference individual NA12891 to a series of different coverage levels representative of the samples in each data set. 	We then performed DOC analysis between each of the sub-samples and the complete NA12891 reference. Since this last analysis compares samples from the same individual, we expected no CNVs to be detected.

We then performed DOC analysis between each of the sub-samples and the complete NA12891 reference.

Combinations of T and WS values producing this expected result were chosen as the best for each data set (Supplementary Table 2)(Supplementary Table 2). 
PMC4500966	NA12891	Methods	IGSR/1000 Genomes	False	Since intensity data were present for both alleles of each SNP and we were interested in the overall intensity (indicative of copy number) for each SNP position, intensities for both alleles were summed into single values. 	As in the previous analyses, we used the sample NA12891 as a reference and calculated log2-ratios between SNP intensities in this sample and all the other samples. 	Individual plots for all samples and variants were generated using R (29) and deviations from 0 (no copy number difference) were compared with the log-2 ratio plots of the DOC analysis on the same variants.

PMC4383723	NA19020	Results	IGSR/1000 Genomes	False	CTNND2 as a novel autism gene 	CTNND2 harbored two deleterious variants, G34S and R713C both of which were absent in 3,889 European controls (1000G and Exome Variant Server (EVS)); G34S was present at a frequency of 5.3x10−4 in 1,869 African ancestry samples (EVS) and in one Luhyan sample (NA19020) (Extended Data Figure 2). 	To estimate their frequency, we genotyped 10,782 samples from the HapMap and autism collections: the only additional individuals with G34S were an affected female and her mother (SSC02696, SSC03276) from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC). Principal component analysis on polymorphism data from G34S individuals found that our autism cases were not of African ancestry, identifying a new ancestral origin for G34S (Extended Data Figure 3). 
PMC4383723	NA18507	Methods	IGSR/1000 Genomes	False	Exome sequencing & read mapping 	We analyzed 10 female autism cases and 1 HapMap sample (NA18507) utilizing the Agilent SureSelect Whole Exome capture (38 megabases) and SOLiD 3+ and 4 technologies. 	For 3 additional female autism individuals, sequencing used the Illumina TruSeq Whole Exome capture (62 megabases) and Illumina technology; all Illumina exome experimental steps were performed at the Illumina sequencing center (Hayward, CA).

PMC3290568	NA18501	Methods	IGSR/1000 Genomes	False		Sequence variation was surveyed in a subset of 20 YRI belonging to the sample collection of the International HapMap Project Phase I/II (NA18501, NA18853, NA18870, NA18913, NA19092, NA19141, NA19144, NA19152, NA19203, NA19207, NA19210, NA19209, NA18522, NA18855, NA18856, NA19140, NA19160, NA19201, NA19200, NA19223). 	To perform phylogenetic evolutionary analysis of SERPINB11, we retrieved from Genbank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) the following coding sequences with the accession numbers: XM_523958 for Pan troglodytes; XM_001091618.1 for Macaca mulatta; DP000514 for Papio anubis; DP000562 for Callithrix jacchus; and XM_541073 for Canis lupus familiaris. The sequence of Colobus guereza was reconstructed from raw data downloaded from BLAST Trace Archives (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi), and Pongo pigmeus was identified using the BLAT tool (http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat). 
PMC6468893	IPR001733	Results	InterPro	False	So far, no information is available about protein structure and subunit composition of arachnid SPase. 	The catalytic subunit belongs to the serine endoprotease S26B (S26.023) family (IPR001733). 	Active site residues Ser 54 and His 94 could be identified when compared with arthropod peptidase subunit SEC11 (Drosophila melanogaster sp_Q3YMT4) (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk) [20]. The N-terminal region exhibits a cytoplasmic domain (1–19 aa). 
PMC6468893	IPR013766	Results	InterPro	False	The two mature forms of PDI (PDI_1a/1b and PDI_2) from C. salei differ by eleven mutations in a restricted area of the C-terminus, resulting in 97.8% identity between both enzymes. 	These enzymes (IPR005792) exhibit detailed signature matches as the thioredoxin-like fold (IPR012336), the thioredoxin domain (IPR013766), and the disulfide isomerase domain (IPR005788) with the redox-active disulphide region motif “APWCGHCK” in its N-terminal, as well as in its C-terminal part (amino acid residues: 48–55 and 389–396). 	So far, no sequence data for PDI identified from other spider venom gland transcriptomes are available. In our venom gland transcriptome of Alopecosa marikovskyi [22] we identified a corresponding sequence with 94.9% identity to PDI_1ab, and in the venom gland of Viridasius fasciatus we found a protein with an identity of 91.9% toward PDI_2. 
PMC6468893	IPR001314	Results	InterPro	False	These cleavage motifs are not classical PQM/iPQM and do not follow the Glu to Arg or/and Glu after Arg-processing rules [24]. 	Another VSP2 (Table 1, Supplementary Figure S1.4) is less expressed in the venom glands, but also belongs to the peptidase S1A chymotrypsin family (IPR001314) with the typical serine protease, trypsin domain (IPR001254, ~aa 43–285). 	The active site is the typical catalytic triad of His97, Asp144, and Ser237. Additionally, amino acid residues Asp231, Ser256, and Gly258 are supposed to be involved in substrate binding. 
PMC6468893	IPR014044	Results	InterPro	False	Additionally, three silent mutations were identified in the nucleotide sequences at positions G45A, A267G, and A161G. 	An InterPro scan revealed a CAP domain-like structure (IPR014044) in the N-terminal part of the precursor proteins (aa: 60–222). 	Furthermore, the following domains, related to cysteine-rich secretory proteins, were identified: allergen V5/Tpx-like (IPR001283; PR00837), and V5 allergen (IPR002413; PR00838) (aa: 52–68; 112–128; 173–192). Comparable to CRISP1, the precursor protein of CRISP2 shows the CAP domain-like structure (IPR014044, aa: 56–217), four detailed signature matches (aa: 89–107; 146–159, 174–190, 204–217) related to allergen V5/Tpx-1(IPR001283; PR00837) and three signature matches related to V5 allergen (IPR002413; PR00838) (aa: 52–68; 112–128; 173–192) (Supplementary Figure S1.8).

CRISP1 and CRISP2 only share 31.1% sequence identity, possibly reflecting different protein subfamilies and functions. 
PMC6468893	IPR014044	Results	InterPro	False	Furthermore, the following domains, related to cysteine-rich secretory proteins, were identified: allergen V5/Tpx-like (IPR001283; PR00837), and V5 allergen (IPR002413; PR00838) (aa: 52–68; 112–128; 173–192).

CRISP1 and CRISP2 only share 31.1% sequence identity, possibly reflecting different protein subfamilies and functions. The MSA of CRISP1 with CRISPs of other spiders revealed 54.7% identity with venom allergen 5 from Lycosa singoriensis, 51.8% with CRISP1 from V. fasciatus, and 37.4% identity with two further CRISPs identified in the spider S. mimosarum (Supplementary Figure S1.8). 
PMC6468893	IPR001548	Results	InterPro	False	We identified at least four ACE isoforms, featuring the following amino acid polymorphisms: A10T (signal peptide) and L315I (mature protein). 	ACE belongs to the protein domain family of peptidyl-dipeptidase A, M2 metalloprotease group (IPR001548). 	The metal-binding domain might be formed by the HEXXH +E motif. The ACE identities between different spiders vary between 83.6% (C. salei/A. marikovskyi), 74.6% (V. fasciatus), 63.8% (S. mimosarum) and 64.9% (P. tepidariorum). 
PMC6468893	IPR001211	Results	InterPro	False	PLA2 is much lower expressed in the C. salei venom gland compared to most other venom proteins (Table 1), which begs the question if it functions as a house-keeping or venomous enzyme. 	InterPro sequence classification resulted in the identification of the protein as a member of the phospholipase A2 family (IPR001211), belonging to the cl05417 superfamily, subfamily cd00125. 	Honeybee PLA2 belongs to the same superfamily, but to the cd 4704 subfamily. The MSA of C. salei PLA2_CUPSA with predicted genomic and transcriptomic PLA2 sequences from other spiders shows identities between 88.8% (A. marikovskyi), 63.0% (S. mimosarum), and 58.0% (V. fasciatus). 
PMC6468893	IPR027214	Results	InterPro	False	CSTs occur in prokaryotes and eukaryotes [59], and have been identified in the venom glands of invertebrates and vertebrates [31,60]. 	Their main function is the partial or total inhibition of cysteine-type endopeptidases, such as peptidase families C1 (papain family) and C13 (legumain family), in which CSTs are less selective inhibitors showing low discrimination between endopeptidases and exopeptidases [61]. C. salei CSTs belong to the cystatin type 2 family (IPR027214) with a cystatin conserved site (IPR018073). 	CST_2 exhibits two mutations in the mature protein as R130E and R132E. Sequence alignments of CST_1,2 with the predicted cystatins identified in A. marikovskyi and S. mimosarum show identities of 54% and 48.3% with C. salei, and even lower identities (38.2% and 34.3%) with V. fasciatus and P. tepidariorum (Supplementary Figure S1.14). 
PMC6468893	IPR036880	Results	InterPro	False	KCPs have been identified at a very low expression level (Table 1), and may act as serine protease inhibitors inside the venom glands. 	The proteins belong to the pancreatic trypsin inhibitor Kunitz domain superfamily (IPR036880). 	Interestingly, two pancreatic trypsin inhibitor Kunitz domains (IPR002223) are identified within the protein (amino acid residues 28–83 and 111–164, respectively). The isoforms (KCP_1a and KCP_1b) differ in amino acid residues D107G, K109Q, D112A, and Q116L. 
PMC6468893	IPR002223	Results	InterPro	False	The proteins belong to the pancreatic trypsin inhibitor Kunitz domain superfamily (IPR036880). 	Interestingly, two pancreatic trypsin inhibitor Kunitz domains (IPR002223) are identified within the protein (amino acid residues 28–83 and 111–164, respectively). 	The isoforms (KCP_1a and KCP_1b) differ in amino acid residues D107G, K109Q, D112A, and Q116L. Sequence alignments of different hypothetical spider KCPs with KCP1ab from C. salei show identities between 50.3% and 69.7% for araneomorph spider proteins (A. marikovskyi, V. fasciatus, S. mimosarum) and of only 36.3% for the mygalomorph spider T. loki (Supplementary Figure S1.15). 
PMC6468893	IPR036857	Results	InterPro	False	Thyroglobulin Type-1 Domain-Like Protein (TT1LP) 	We identified a protein, which exhibits two thyroglobulin type-1 domains (IPR036857). 	A second isoform is present with only one mutation (T31M). The identification of these domains points to a possible role as a protease inhibitor because the thyroglobulin type-1 domains belong to MEROPS protease inhibitor familyI31 (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk). 
PMC6468893	IPR000867	Results	InterPro	False	This protein is characterized by four overlapping domains. 	An N-terminal highly structured globular insulin-like growth factor-binding domain (IPR000867) is followed by a Kazal-domain (IPR002350), acting as linker to the two C-terminal immunoglobulin-like/immunoglobulin subtype domains (IRP007110/IPR003599). 	High sequence identities of 72%–92% were observed between different spider IGFBPrPs, ticks (62%), and the spiny lobster, Sagmariasus verreauxi, a decapod crustacean (39%) (Supplementary Figure S1.17). Decapod IGFBP-related proteins are involved in the insulin-signaling pathway and are able to bind insulin like peptides (ILPs) [74]. 
PMC6468893	IPR002181	Results	InterPro	False	Tachylectin 5A-Like Protein (TL5A) 	Two TL5A-like proteins from the venom gland of C. salei exhibit the fibrinogen, α/β/γ chain, C-terminal globular domain (IPR002181). 	Two mutations occur at positions T61A and D193N. Additionally, a silent mutation was identified at position T579C. 
PMC6468893	IPR032675	Results	InterPro	False	Leucine-Rich Repeat Domain-Containing Protein (LRR) 	We identified a protein, classified by InterPro as a possible member of the leucine-rich repeat domain superfamily (IPR032675), which exhibits five typical subtype LRR_typ_2 motifs of 20–23 amino acids. 	This protein was also identified in the transcriptomes of other spiders, and shows identities between 70.8% and 85.9% with V. fasciatus, Oxyopes lineatus and A. marikovskyi and of 68% with S. mimosarum LRRs. Leucine-rich repeats are known to often be involved in protein-protein interactions. 
PMC6468893	IPR023569	Results	InterPro	False	So far, no biological activity is described for these peptides isolated from spider and scorpion venom (Supplementary Figure S2.19). 	Interpro analysis shows that CsTx-22a, b, c comprise the prokineticin domain (IPR023569) nearly over the whole length of the peptides (amino acid residues 5–59, CsTx-22) but the crucial N-terminal AVIT sequence part, responsible for its biological activity, is lacking. 	The prokineticin domain is identified in several putative toxin precursors from different araneomorph and mygalomorph spiders, but also, surprisingly, from ticks. Sequence identities between CsTx-22a, b, c and such peptides are medium to high: for araneomorph spiders 43.9%–7.6%, for mygalomorph spiders 41.8%–49.2%, and for ticks 37.5%–39.1%. 
PMC6468893	IPR020202	Results	InterPro	False	Sequence alignments even show 22.4%–33.4% identity to the prokineticin Bm8f from the toad Bombina maxima and to MIT1 from the elapid black mamba (Supplementary Figure S2.20). 	CsTx-21a, b, c, d, e, f, g are classified as belonging to the atracotoxin family (IPR020202). 	This family classification is based on ACTX–Hvf17 [118] and six more MIT1-like ACTX orthologs isolated from the venom of the mygalomorph funnel web spiders Hadronyche versuta and H. infensa [86]. They share sequence homologies to the above-mentioned MIT1 and Bm8f, but no pharmacological activity or biological function in the venom is known. 
PMC6278149	IPR011701	Results	InterPro	False	A total of 493 candidate genes was identified to harbor one or more IPR domains of interest in TERIBR1(Table 1). 	IPR domains mdrL/yfmO (IPR011701; n = 334), recG (IPR001650; n = 71), ruvB (IPR003959; n = 45) and recG (IPR011545; n = 44) were among the maximally present protein domains related to chromium resistance.Table 1Distribution of IPR domains important in chromium bio-accumulation in A. flavus strains TERIBR1, NRRL3357 & AF70 	Identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) The read alignment rate of TERIBR1 with NRRL3357 (assembly) was 78.62% (29,001,807 / 36,890,268) of which 78.23% (22,681,743) were uniquely mapped reads. 
PMC3498115	IPR008907	Abstract	InterPro	False	The introduction of the term ‘Tubulin Polymerization Promoting Protein (TPPP)-like proteins’ is suggested. 	They constitute a eukaryotic protein superfamily, characterized by the presence of the p25alpha domain (Pfam05517, IPR008907), and named after the first identified member, TPPP/p25, exhibiting microtubule stabilizing function. 	TPPP-like proteins can be grouped on the basis of two characteristics: the length of their p25alpha domain, which can be long, short, truncated or partial, and the presence or absence of additional domain(s). TPPPs, in the strict sense, contain no other domains but one long or short p25alpha one (long- and short-type TPPPs, respectively). 
PMC3498115	IPR008907	Introduction	InterPro	False	TPPP3 but not TPPP2 shares the MAP-like features of TPPP1. 	The common C-terminal part of the three proteins (55–219 amino acids in TPPP1) is denoted as p25alpha domain, Pfam05517 or IPR008907, which corresponds practically to the whole sequence of TPPP2 or. 	There are no data about the function of these proteins except two human paralogs which are involved in developmental processes of the brain (TPPP1) [7], [12] and the musculoskeletal system (TPPP3) [16], respectively. In this paper I have investigated the conservation of this protein/gene family and the occurrence of the p25alpha domain in a systematic bioinformatics study. 
PMC3498115	IPR008907	Results	InterPro	False	Grouping of TPPP-like proteins 	TPPP-like proteins involve TPPPs and other proteins possessing one or more complete or partial p25alpha domain, Pfam05517 or IPR008907 (cf. Fig. 1 and 2). 	It is not a structural domain but was generated automatically from a sequence alignment from Prodom 2004.1 for the Pfam-B database (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/family/PF05517). The whole p25alpha domain of 140–160 amino acids can be found in TPPPs [1], [2], [9], [37]. 
PMC3498115	IPR003533	Results	InterPro	False	In the stramenopile A. anophagefferens the domain is coupled with a WD40 repeat-like domain. 	A special case of this independent occurrence is the apicortin where the partial p25alpha domain is combined with a DCX (Pfam03607, IPR003533) domain [38]. 	The DCX (doublecortin) domain is named after the brain-specific X-linked gene doublecortin [41]. Both domains (p25alpha ad DCX) are known to play an important role in the stabilization of microtubules ([8], [10] and [41], [42]) which suggests a similar function for apicortin. 
PMC4352355	146255	Case study	OMIM	False		Hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness, and renal dysplasia (HDR) syndrome (MIM 146255) is a rare autosomal dominant disease characterized by hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness, and renal dysplasia due to a heterozygous germline mutation of the GATA3 gene located on chromosome 10p15 1. 	The hypoparathyroidism is characterized by symptomatic or asymptomatic hypocalcemia with low or undetectable serum levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH). The renal phenotype of HDR syndrome has a variable expression, which includes presence or absence of symmetry, renal agenesis, and renal dysplasia; patients with HDR syndrome often develop end-stage renal failure requiring dialysis due to renal abnormalities 2. 
PMC4807911	607596	Discussion	OMIM	False	The areflexia seen in our family was only noted after the second decade, suggesting age-dependent onset. 	In the absence of autopsy findings, it is not possible to determine whether the lower motor neuron involvement identified in our family reflects a pure motor axonal neuropathy or an anterior horn cell disorder similar to that described in PCH1 (OMIM #607596). 	
PMC4807911	615686	Discussion	OMIM	False		A frameshift mutation in AMPD2 was recently reported to cause hereditary spastic paraplegia type 63 (OMIM #615686) in a single family.13 The clinical presentation was relatively mild, with normal cognition, normal NCSs, and no cerebellar signs. 	MRI of 1 affected individual identified thinning of the CC and periventricular deep white matter changes but no brainstem or cerebellar abnormalities. The identified truncation [p.(Cys107Alafs*80)] disrupts only 3 of 5 predicted AMPD2 isoforms (figure 3), whereas disruption of the deaminase domain affects all, suggesting functional redundancy of isoforms as a molecular explanation for variability in disease severity. 
PMC5674732	608576	Discussion	OMIM	False	These studies clearly establish a crucial role of GRHL2 in embryonic development, and our finding of GRHL2 deletion in two unrelated CFEOM patients suggests a role for the gene in orbital innervation. 	An involvement of GRHL2 in other physiological processes have also been described. GRHL2 (alias TFCP2L3, MIM 608576) mutation has been reported in childhood-onset progressive autosomal dominant hearing loss [DFNA28 (MIM 608641)] [24]; however, there was no evidence for hearing loss in either of our patients. 	Homozygous mutations in this gene have been implicated in an autosomal- recessive ectodermal dysplasia syndrome [25]. Besides, other polymorphic sequence variants in GRHL2 have also been implicated in age-related hearing impairment and noise-induced hearing loss [26, 27]. 
PMC3604173	150800	Introduction	OMIM	False	Compelling evidence for a genetic liability in the development of these tumors has been demonstrated in twin studies [8], [9] yet no susceptibility genes have consistently emerged from the few genome scans reported so far [10], [11]. 	Early studies of two dominantly transmitted Mendelian syndromes, multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomatosis (MCUL1; OMIM 150800), and hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC; OMIM 605839) have implicated a subregion on chromosome 1q43 that contains FH, a gene encoding the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs cycle) fumarate hydratase enzyme [12], [13]. 	Heterozygous germline mutations in FH were initially found in 25 of 42 probands in European families segregating HLRCC. These germline mutations, which included missense substitutions, protein-truncating changes and large germline deletions, were predicted to result in absent or reduced FH activity because FH functions as a homotetramer (dominant-negative effect). 
PMC3604173	602759	Discussion	OMIM	False	Several lines of evidence for a link between PLD activities and mitogenic signaling as well as suppression of apoptosis have been reported [41]. 	In addition to HLRCC and MCLU1, another cancer phenotype maps to the studied region (Predisposing for Prostate Cancer or PCaP; OMIM 602759). 	PCaP is an early-onset hereditary prostate cancer mapped to 1q42.3q43 in families from Southern Europe [42]. Further refinement of the linkage [43] placed the putative prostate locus in the interval between D1S321 (telomeric to CHML at position 241.82 Mb) and D1S2842 (telomeric to PLD5 at 242.87 Mb). 
PMC3932285	601116	Article	OMIM	False	The array showed a female molecular karyotype with a 232 kb heterozygous interstitial deletion involving chromosome region 7q31.33 [hg19 coordinates chr7:126,531,039-126,763,294] and a 647 kb duplication involving interstitial chromosome region 17q21.31 [hg 19 coordinates chr17:43,645,879-44,292,742]. 	The 7q31.33 microdeletion contains part of one gene, GRM8 (OMIM 601116), while the 17q21.31 microduplication contains a number of genes including CRHR1 (OMIM 122561), IMP5 (SPPL2C; OMIM 608284), MAPT (OMIM 157140), and STH (OMIM 607067) and a partial duplication of the KANSL1 gene (also known as KIAA1267, OMIM 612452); see Figure 1. 	In order to determine the genotype encompassing the MAPT gene, we focused on amplifying the region of intron 9 of the MAPT gene that carries a polymorphic 238 bp deletion, which is a characteristic marker of the H1/H2 genotypes. Fifty nanograms of genomic DNA was subjected to PCR amplification using Roche FastStart buffer (without Mg), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.4 mM dNTPs, 1 unit Roche Faststart Taq DNA polymerase, and 0.8 μM of each forward and reverse primer [14]. 
PMC3932285	162500	Discussion	OMIM	False	Kitsiou-Tzeli et al. [16] reported an additional 413 kb 15q11.2 deletion, and these authors have stated that this deletion may have contributed to some of the phenotypic symptoms of their patient. 	Patient 3 reported by Grisart et al. [17] had the common 17p11.2 deletion but was asymptomatic for NHPP (OMIM 162500) associated with this anomaly. 	Molecular characterisation of our patient showed two abnormalities. In the case of the 7q31.33 microdeletion, the pathological significance of a partial deletion of the GRM8 gene in this region has not been determined. 
PMC4110360	602421	Methods	OMIM	False	However, we did not consider the morphological criterion (inflammatory infiltration of biopsy specimen) since none of our patients had the pancreatic biopsy. 	Moreover, all the participants were screened for gene mutations predisposing to CP: CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; OMIM 602421), PRSS1 (cationic trypsinogen/serine protease 1; OMIM 276000), and SPINK1 (serum protease inhibitor Kazal type 1; OMIM 167790). 	
PMC5227663	614982	Article	OMIM	False	In addition, most of the pure trisomies of the whole chromosome 18p reported have been identified by conventional cytogenetic methods. 	Whole 18p trisomies are phenotypically heterogeneous with subtle dysmorphic features and moderate intellectual disabilities; however, some cases are presented with normal phenotype and no intellectual disability.10 The 18p amplification spanned over 2,5-Mb encompassing 13 genes including SMCHD1 (OMIM 614982), associated with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, a recessive developmental disorder. 	Finally, among the genes encompassed in both deleted and duplicated region, none are associated with developmental delay or seems to play a role in spermatogenesis. Sperm-FISH is a widely used screening tool to aid in counseling couples with severe male factor infertility, especially in cases of repeated failed fertilization by assisted reproductive technologies or RPL.

PMC3407419	609260	Article	OMIM	False		Sir, We read with great interest the report of a Tunisian family by Rouzier et al. (2011) describing the neurological disorder linked to a novel heterozygous missense mutation in MFN2 (1p36.2) (Rouzier et al., 2011). MFN2 mutations typically cause autosomal dominant axonal Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT2A, OMIM 609260), with peripheral nerve degeneration occasionally associated with visual failure and optic atrophy (Zuchner et al., 2004, 2006). 	Interestingly, the clinical manifestations among mutational carriers in this Tunisian family were even more variable, ranging from asymptomatic subclinical disease to an axonal sensorimotor neuropathy complicated by optic atrophy, deafness, cerebellar ataxia and proximal myopathy. Furthermore, the intriguing finding of cytochrome c oxidase (COX)-deficient fibres and multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions in skeletal muscle biopsies suggest that MFN2 mutations can result in disturbed mitochondrial DNA maintenance and an overt respiratory chain defect, in addition to marked fragmentation of the mitochondrial network. 
PMC5981322	608980	Discussion	OMIM	False	For instance, FREM1 (near locus 9p22.3) has been shown to play a role in the fusion of the nasal processes during gestation22, and was implicated in human upper lip morphology in a recent GWAS of facial shape23. 	In humans, mutations in this gene result in several Mendelian conditions affecting the midline facial structures, such as BNAR syndrome (OMIM #608980) and trigonocephaly (OMIM #190440)22,24. 	Trigonocephaly is in 34% of the cases associated with speech and/or language delay25. KREMEN1 (near locus 22q12.2) is a modulator of WNT signaling, crucial for neural tube closure26. TFRC, located 500 kb from the lead SNP of locus 3q29, is involved in craniofacial morphogenesis by regulating TGFß and BMP signaling activation27. Interestingly, one of the identified loci contained genes involved in the neural control of speech production. NAGPA at locus 16p13.3 is involved in stuttering28 and focal epilepsy with speech disorders29, respectively. 
PMC5181623	114500	Introduction	OMIM	False	We used a regional heritability approach (24) and estimated the proportion of variability in site-specific DNAm levels that is due to local genetic variation, h^r,g2. 	We also contrasted the distribution of h^r,g2 for DNAm sites within and outwith known susceptibility loci for colorectal cancer (CRC, OMIM no. 114500). 	In addition, CRC can manifest in colorectal epithelial cells (26), which are significantly more costly and challenging to extract from the colon than whole-cell biopsies. To establish the extent of the difference in the regulation of DNAm levels in colon epithelial tissue and whole-cell biopsy, we studied the phenotypic profiles and h^r,g2 for the DNAm level of genes expressed in epithelial cells obtained from laser capture microdissection (LCM) and whole-colon biopsy (WCB). 
PMC5314723	272800	Introduction	OMIM	False		Tay-Sachs disease (TSD; MIM 272800), associated with mutations in HEXA, is a neurodegenerative disease caused by accumulation of GM2-ganglioside. 	TSD most often presents in infancy with regression of skills, intellectual disability, paralysis, dementia, blindness, and death by 5 years of age. Individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) ancestry have the highest TSD risk, due to a one in 31 carrier frequency (Gross et al., 2008). 
PMC4755596	201475	Introduction	OMIM	False		The mitochondrial enzyme very-long chain Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD, OMIM 201475) is the first enzyme in the fatty acid oxidation cycle and, as such, a key enzyme in this pathway for mitochondrial energy transduction from fatty acids [1,2]. 	The clinical presentation of patients with VLCAD deficiency (VLCADD) varies from death in early childhood, associated with fasting intolerance and failing glucose homeostasis [1,3], to exercise intolerance with episodic rhabdomyolysis and myalgia in (early-)childhood and adult life, to asymptomatic individuals [3–5]. In the past decade VLCADD has been included in newborn screening programs all over the world [6]. 
PMC6030844	616624	Results	OMIM	False	The two remaining variants correspond to the mutation c.240+1G>T from the SURF1 gene and c.1969G>A (p.Ala657Thr) from the ANO3 gene. 	The SURF1 mutation was excluded as this gene is only involved in autosomal recessive diseases: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 4K (MIM #616624) and Leigh syndrome, due to COX IV deficiency (MIM #516000). 	In contrast, mutations from the ANO3 gene have been reported in the autosomal dominant Dystonia 24 and this mutation was identified by the authors as the disease-causing mutations in this family (Figure 4). 
PMC6313083	136140	Introduction	OMIM	False		Floating-Harbor syndrome (OMIM #136140) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by short stature, delayed bony maturation, unique facial morphology, and expressive language impairment [1]. 	Recently, truncating mutations in SRCAP (Snf2 related CREBBP activator protein) have been shown to cause Floating-Harbor syndrome [2]. Till date, approximately 50 cases of SRCAP exon 34 mutations, and two cases in SRCAP exon 33 mutations have been reported [3,4]. 
PMC4600337	611204	Introduction	OMIM	False	In humans, about 40 % of hydrocephalus cases have a known genetic cause according to the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database. 	Genetic heterogeneity of congenital hydrocephalus is observed: mutations in the CCDC88C gene [MIM:611204] on chromosome 14 [14, 15] and in the MPDZ gene [MIM:603785] on chromosome 9 [16] are responsible for autosomal recessive hydrocephalus (respectively HYC1 [MIM:236600] and HYC2 [MIM:615219]). 	The most common form of congenital hydrocephalus in humans (5 to 15 % of patients) is the X-linked recessive form caused by a mutation in L1CAM ([MIM:308840]; e.g. [17]; HSAS1 [MIM:307000]). Moreover, heterogeneity among phenotypes exists in humans as well as in animals [18]. 
PMC4600337	308840	Introduction	OMIM	False	Genetic heterogeneity of congenital hydrocephalus is observed: mutations in the CCDC88C gene [MIM:611204] on chromosome 14 [14, 15] and in the MPDZ gene [MIM:603785] on chromosome 9 [16] are responsible for autosomal recessive hydrocephalus (respectively HYC1 [MIM:236600] and HYC2 [MIM:615219]).

PMC4600337	615181	Results	OMIM	False	The mutation introduced a stopcodon on ECA1:75,907,505 (exon 12), c.1423C>T [GenBank:XM_001491545] corresponding to p.Gln475* [GenBank:XP_001491595]. 	In humans, a muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy phenotype [MDDGA11, MIM:615181] including hydrocephalus has recently been associated with mutations in B3GALNT2 [30, 31]. 	The 4 affected Friesian horses were homozygous for the nonsense allele, while one of the controls was heterozygous and the others were homozygous for the normal allele. The 16 cases of Friesian horses with hydrocephalus that were available for the validation were genotyped for the mutation by Sanger DNA sequencing and all were found homozygous (TT) (Additional file 1). 
PMC4600337	610194	Discussion	OMIM	False	In the current study, no genetic heterogeneity was observed for hydrocephalus with all 16 affected Friesian horses being homozygous for the same nonsense mutation in B3GALNT2. 	The strongest indication that this mutation causes the phenotype in Friesian horses is that the exact same nonsense mutation was found homozygously in a human muscular dystrophy patient with hydrocephalus by Stevens et al. [30] (Fig. 5) [MIM:610194.0006 or dbSNP:rs367543077]. 	Nine different mutations were observed in the B3GALNT2 gene in 6 human patients with muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy with brain and eye anomalies, type A, 11 (MDDGA11 [MIM:615181]). Following Stevens et al., Hedberg et al. [31] identified 2 novel mutations in B3GALNT2 in a 5-year-old girl with milder clinical features (ataxia, spasticity, muscle weakness) and brain abnormalities (e.g. cerebellar cysts) detected using MRI.

The syndrome was clinically somewhat variable and only 4 patients and 1 affected foetus (from 3 families) displayed hydrocephalus [30, 31]. 
PMC4600337	214500	Discussion	OMIM	False	One variation was located in LYST (rs394520771). 	Mutations in this gene cause Chediak-Higashi syndrome (MIM:214500) in humans, of which hydrocephalus is not a characteristic. 	The other variation was located in NID1 (rs394402493). Mice with knock-out mutations of this gene do not display a phenotype.

PMC6235972	252010	Introduction	OMIM	False	Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is carried out by five protein complexes (CI-CV) and constitutes a prime source of mitochondrial ATP1. 	OXPHOS dysfunction and isolated CI deficiency (OMIM 252010) is often associated with Leigh Syndrome (LS), a rare metabolic disorder with poorly understood pathophysiology2–6. 	Functionally, CI couples the transfer of electrons from NADH to oxidized ubiquinone-10 to the transport of H+ from the mitochondrial matrix across the mitochondrial inner membrane (MIM). This process provides the electron transport chain (ETC) with reducing equivalents to sustain a trans-MIM pH gradient (ΔpH) and electrical potential (Δψ).

The CFTR-transmitted basic defect can be used to diagnose the disease by the analysis of sweat glands,6, 7 nasal6, 7 or intestinal epithelium.7 As CF is a rare disease affecting about 1:2000 newborns in the Caucasian population, sample sizes of several 10 000 individuals desirable for many genome-wide association studies (GWAS)8 cannot be obtained for the rare disease CF. 
PMC4973067	227810	Abstract	OMIM	False		Fanconi-Bickel syndrome (FBS, OMIM 227810) is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by a deficiency of glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), a member of the facilitative glucose transporter family (Santer et al. J Inherit Metab Dis 21:191–194, 1998). 	The typical clinical picture is characterized by hepatorenal glycogen accumulation resulting in hepato- and nephromegaly, impaired utilization of glucose and galactose, proximal renal tubular dysfunction, rickets and severe short stature. 
PMC2518525	601652	Introduction	OMIM	False	POAG is a complex, genetically heterogeneous disease. 	Of the three genes from 22 genetic loci that have been identified for POAG using linkage analyses, myocilin (MYOC, OMIM 601652), optineurin (OPTN, OMIM 602432), and WD repeat-domain 36 (WDR36, OMIM 609669), none of these genes have been found to associate with POAG in African Americans, Afro Caribbeans or in West African populations [12], [13]. 	We have investigated possible differences in ONH astrocytes from populations with different genetic backgrounds, using well characterized primary human astrocytes cultures. We have found that astrocytes derived from normal AA donors exhibit differential gene expression profiles compared to astrocytes derived from normal age-matched CA donors. 
PMC5032117	168600	Article	OMIM	False		Parkinson’s disease (PD, MIM 168600) is the second most common progressive age-related neurodegenerative disorder affecting approximately 1–2% of the population over 6512. 	Autopsy studies show a selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain substantia nigra, and Lewy bodies formation accompanied by alpha-synuclein aggregation34. Motor skills are primarily devastated by the preferential demise of dopaminergic neurons. 
PMC5032117	607987	Discussion	OMIM	False	This study found that only DNAJC10 gene variant rs13414223 was related to decreased PD risk. 	The DNAJC10 gene (MIM 607987), which is mapped to chromosome 2q32.1, contains 24 exons and spans ~64 kb, is a paralog of two known PD-related genes, DNAJC6 and DNAJC13232527. 	It encodes a ~91 kDa endoplasmic reticulum (ER) co-chaperone with 793 amino acids, also known as ERdj5, or JPDI, which is a type III DnaJ protein. It is an ER-resident molecule composed of an N-terminal hydrophobic sequence, a type III DnaJ domain, four thioredoxin-like domains, and a C-terminal tetrapeptide KDEL motif mediating ER retention2728. 
PMC5548758	136550	Introduction	OMIM	False	Although generally non-progressive, complications associated with choroidal neovascularization can contribute to visual deterioration. 	The molecular genetics of NCMD has been extensively investigated with the disorder being mapped to chromosome 6q16 (MCDR1, MIM:136550) in multiple families of different ethnic origins since the early 1990s4–10. 	A similar phenotype has been assigned to a second locus at 5p15-p13 (MCDR3, MIM:608850)3, 11. Interestingly, several studies reported evidence for ancestral haplotypes at the MCDR1 locus2, 12, 13.

PMC3781641	122470	Introduction	OMIM	False		Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS; OMIM 122470) is a genetic disorder characterized by characteristic facial features, abnormal upper limb development, delayed growth and cognitive retardation (1). 	These diverse clinical features are indicative of a developmental disorder affecting the expression of multiple genes. Interestingly, all causative mutations identified in cases defined as CdLS have been in genes encoding proteins in the cohesin complex or in proteins that interact with this complex. 
PMC4401571	167320	Introduction	OMIM	False		Inclusion body myopathy (IBM) associated with Paget’s disease of the bone (PDB) and Frontotemporal Dementia, (IBMPFD, MIM 167320), was first reported in 2000 by Kimonis et al. [1] and mapped to the human chromosomal region 9p13.3–12 [2], [3]. 	In 2004, the disease was attributed to being caused by mutations in the gene encoding Valosin-Containing Protein (VCP) [4]. Classic symptoms of VCP disease include weakness and atrophy of the skeletal muscles of the pelvic and shoulder girdle muscles in 90% of individuals [1–3]. 
PMC4399909	610253	Discussion	OMIM	False	This seems to better match the observations in humans. 	Heterozygous loss of EHMT1/GLP causes Kleefstra syndrome (OMIM number 610253). 	This rare disorder is characterized by developmental delay and severe intellectual disability. Interestingly, up to 60% of Kleefstra syndrome patients suffer from recurrent infections; yet, these patients do not suffer from primary immune deficiencies [56]. 
PMC3486859	145700	Introduction	OMIM	False	Whereas many additional anomalies are associated with hypertrichosis, only a subset of disorders with congenital hypertrichosis present with excessive hair as the primary clinical feature. 	These include hypertrichosis universalis (OMIM 145700) [2], Ambras type (OMIM 145701) [3], X-linked hypertrichosis (OMIM 307150) [4] and generalized hypertrichosis terminalis with or without gingival hyperplasia (OMIM 135400) [5]. 	We previously demonstrated that a position effect on the zinc-finger transcription factor TRPS1 is associated with two hypertrichosis models, Ambras syndrome (AS) in humans and the Koala phenotype in mice [6]. Consistent with a causative role for Trps1 in hypertrichosis, the protein is expressed in the nuclei of mesenchyme-derived dermal papilla cells and the proliferative epithelial cells of human and mouse hair follicles [7]. 
PMC3486859	190350	Introduction	OMIM	False	Consistent with a causative role for Trps1 in hypertrichosis, the protein is expressed in the nuclei of mesenchyme-derived dermal papilla cells and the proliferative epithelial cells of human and mouse hair follicles [7]. 	Heterozygous germline mutations in TRPS1 on chromosome 8q23 in humans result in autosomal dominant inheritance of trichorhinophalangeal syndrome types I and III (TRPS1 I, OMIM 190350; TRPS III, OMIM 190351) [8], [9], which are characterized by sparse and slow-growing scalp hair, as well as craniofacial and skeletal abnormalities [10]. 	Correspondingly, homozygous mutant mice in which the GATA-type zinc-finger domain of Trps1 was deleted (Trps1Δgt/Δgt) were reported to have a number of hair follicle, craniofacial and skeletal defects that mirror the phenotypic characteristics of human TRPS patients [11]. Trps1Δgt/Δgt mice die within six hours of birth due to respiratory failure stemming from thoracic skeletal defects. Homozygous mutant mice were reported to completely lack vibrissae follicles during late gestation. 
PMC4316712	602917	Results	OMIM	False	The protein encoded by this gene, previously known as DSCR1 (DS critical region gene 1), interacts with calcineurin-inhibiting calcineurin-dependent signaling pathways (Carme Mulero et al., 2010). 	RCAN1 is located in the minimal candidate region of the DS phenotype, an area of approximately 3 Mb at chromosomal region 21q22 (OMIM 602917), and it is overexpressed in the DS patient's brain. 	Its overexpression is linked to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease patients and with the facilitation of neural apoptosis in the DS phenotype (Sun et al., 2014). Comparative sequence analyses of HSA21 and the mouse genome models of DS resulted in the discovery of DSRC1 (RCAN1) as a potential candidate for being a tumor suppressor gene in both lung tumor, as well as melanoma cells, through the suppression of tumor angiogenesis (Minami et al., 2014; Shin et al., 2014). 
PMC3448640	611152	Results	OMIM	False	Interestingly, the six genes predicted by the method (pointed by arrows in Figure 4) were not associated with AD in OMIM. 	Remarkably, only APH1A (1q21–q22), and PSENEN (19q13.13) lied either under or close to a linkage interval associated with AD (i.e. 1q21, OMIM:611152; and 19q13.32, OMIM:107741) and none of the remaining four genes lied under or close to a known linkage interval associated with AD. 	Moreover, the subnetwork of top-ranking AD genes covered several genes in the expert curated data set reported by Krauthammer et al. [46] such as APBB1, VLDLR, SERPINA1 and BACE1 (p-value associated with this event<1.3e-3).

PMC5936855	232300	Abstract	OMIM	False		Originally described in 1932, Pompe disease (PD), also known as “glycogen storage disease type II (OMIM #232300)”, is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive glycogen accumulation in cellular lysosomes ultimately leading to cellular damage. 	Mutations in the acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) gene, located at locus 17q25.3, are responsible for the disease leading to reduced activity of the acid alpha-glucosidase enzyme.1 Generally, the lesser the enzyme activity, the greater the disease severity with an earlier age of onset.2 Infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) is the most severe type of this disease. 
PMC6440956	604373	Results	OMIM	False	The frameshift mutation in CHEK2 leads to a truncated protein (p.Thr410MetfsTer15). 	Germline mutations in CHEK2 (OMIM: 604373), in particular truncating mutations, are considered causative of Li Fraumeni (like) syndrome 2 (LFS2) (OMIM: 609265) and are associated with increased cancer risk, with lymphoma belonging to the disease spectrum of LFS59,60. 	The BLM mutations were compound heterozygous, leading to biallelic inactivation. Indeed, clinical features of the patient were in line with the phenotype of Bloom syndrome (OMIM: 210900) but the diagnosis was not made prior to the current study.

Indeed, clinical features of the patient were in line with the phenotype of Bloom syndrome (OMIM: 210900) but the diagnosis was not made prior to the current study. 	Individuals with Bloom Syndrome, which is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by genomic instability, have been described to carry a higher risk of developing cancers including lymphomas. Taken together, 2/39 (5%) patients with pediatric BL investigated in this series carry likely pathogenic germline changes predisposing to this disease. 
PMC6132939	613001	Introduction	OMIM	False		Encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis (ECCL;[MIM:613001]) is a rare sporadic RASopathy due to one of two mutually exclusive fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) mutations p.N546K or p.K656E. 	These activating hotspot mutations are identified in affected tissues, but not in the peripheral blood of ECCL patients, and are likely the result of post-zygotic constitutional mosaicism promoting locally constitutive activation of the RAS-MAPK pathway [1]. The same FGFR1 mutations occur in subgroups of sporadic low-grade gliomas (LGG) [7, 10, 12] indicating probable intersection between ECCL and tumorigenesis, possibility further substantiated by reports of brain tumors in nine ECCL cases with wide-ranging histopathological subtypes [1–3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 13]. 
PMC5241211	119300	Article	OMIM	False	It is characterized by OFC and bilateral lower lip pits that are highly penetrant in affected families and inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion (Lam et al. 2010). 	In 2002, mutations in the IRF6 gene, which accounts for 75% of VWS (OMIM: 119300) and popliteal pterygium syndrome (PPS; OMIM: 119500), were first reported (Kondo et al. 2002). 	Resequencing of IRF6 gene in nonsyndromic OFC (a phenocopy of VWS) identified a missense mutation in IRF6 p.Val247Iso that was more frequent in cases than controls and significantly overtransmitted in affected families using the family based approach (Zucchero et al. 2004). These findings suggest that common polymorphisms in IRF6 are associated with nonsyndromic clefts and rare variants in this gene are associated with VWS and PPS. 
PMC6396496	176270	Introduction	OMIM	False	The chromosomal region 15q11–13 includes several genes showing monoallelic expression in a parent-of-origin-specific manner [1]. 	This region is responsible for Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS, OMIM #176270) and Angelman syndrome (AS, OMIM #105830). 	PWS is characterized by hypotonia during infancy, developmental delay, hyperphagia followed by morbid obesity, and cognitive impairment [2], and AS is associated with severe developmental delay, ataxia, and recurrent seizures [3]. Approximately 70% of PWS and AS patients have 5–7 Mb deletions affecting the 15q11–13 imprinted region (Fig. 1). 
PMC3773458	272430	Introduction	OMIM	False		Cold induced sweating syndrome (CISS; MIM number 272430) was first described by Soher et al.

Crisponi reported 17 newborns he encountered over 25 years ago from Sardinia, Italy, with characteristic dysmorphic facial features, musculoskeletal deformities, difficulty feeding, and unexplained recurrent episodes of high-grade fever; he suggested an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, this was later called the Crisponi syndrome (CS; MIM number 601378) [2]. It was found that both CISS and CS were caused by mutation in the same gene; the cytokine receptor-like factor 1 (CRLF1) [3, 4].

PMC6376752	606463	Introduction	OMIM	False		Gaucher disease (GD), an autosomal recessively inherited disease, is caused due to a defect in glucosylceramidase beta gene (GBA1; OMIM*606463) coding for the enzyme glucocerebrosidase (EC 3.2.1.45; alternate names: acid β-glucosidase and GCase). 	Its prevalence is 1:50000 in general population and 1:950 live births in Ashkenazi Jewish population [1, 2]. Since Philippe Charles Ernest Gaucher first described the GD phenotypes a hundred and thirty-six years ago, the eponym ‘Gaucher Disease’ was introduced. 
PMC5158031	139330	Introduction	OMIM	False	The phototransduction is the first step initiating visual signal process within the retina. 	The rod-specific Gα transducin subunit, encoded by GNAT1 (Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(t) subunit alpha-1; MIM#*139330) is a key element of this phototransduction cascade [1]. 	Defects in GNAT1 have been identified to cause autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness CSNB (adCSNB; MIM#610444 [2,3] and arCSNB; MIM#616389 [4]) (Fig 1) showing a Riggs-type electroretinogram (ERG), which is characterized by a- and b-wave amplitude reduction on the dark-adapted ERG responses secondary to rod phototransduction dysfunction [5] and no photoreceptor degeneration. In contrast, ERGs from Gnat1 null mice also revealed a- and b- wave reduction under scotopic conditions, however with a shortening of rod outer segments and subsequent progressive loss of photoreceptor nuclei [6].

Therefore this mouse model resembles more the phenotype of rod-cone dystrophy (RCD), also known as retinitis pigmentosa (RP; MIM#268000) [7] than CSNB. 	RCD is a progressive disease, characterized by an initial night vision defect followed by visual field constriction and loss of central vision in severe cases. Recently, a homozygous nonsense variant in GNAT1, c.904C>T p.(Gln302*), has been identified in a 80 year-old subject with moderate arRCD [8] (Fig 1) originating from a Irish population. 
PMC5158031	139330	Introduction	OMIM	True	Family F780 is composed of two unaffected parents (father: I.1, CIC01294; mother: I.2, CIC06690), one affected son (II.1; CIC01293) and one unaffected son (II.2). 	The nonsense variant c.963C>A p.(Cys321*) [M] in GNAT1 (NM_144499.2; MIM *139330) was found homozygous in the affected boy (II.1, CIC01293), heterozygous in the unaffected mother (I.2, CIC06690) and absent in the unaffected father (I.1, CIC01294). 	Females and males are depicted by circles and squares, respectively. Filled and unfilled symbols indicate affected and unaffected status, respectively. 
PMC5158031	180380	Results	OMIM	False	The structural differences are indeed localized in this region: the p.(Gln302*) mutant loses the last α-helix, α6, (Fig 4A; in yellow) and the C-terminal part of the α5-helix and the β6-strand (Fig 4A; in green) [8], while the p.(Cys321*) mutant, which is 19 amino acid residues longer compared to the previously reported RCD mutant, is predicted to keep the α5-helix and the β6-strand (Fig 4A; in green). 	The C-terminal part of GNAT1 is involved in the interactions with GTP/GDP, rhodopsin (RHO; MIM#*180380) and γ subunit of the phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6G, MIM#*180073) (Fig 4B). 	The guanine binding site formed by amino acid residues 321 to 323, with Thr323 residue crucial for the binding of the guanine ring, is similarly affected in both mutants (Fig 4B; in orange). Consistent with this finding, an independent in vitro study noted that the p.Gln326* mutant is no longer able to bind GTP/GDP [27]. 
PMC6406247	176670	Introduction	OMIM	False		Hutchison-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS; OMIM 176670) is a rare human genetic disorder linked with a subset of specific mutations in the LMNA gene, coding for lamin A and lamin C proteins. 	The LMNA gene is located at position 1q22. Interestingly, different sets of mutations in the LMNA gene and genes coding for interacting proteins, such as emerin (EMD/STA gene) and BAF (barrier-to-autointegration, BANF1 gene), give rise to a variety of genetic disorders collectively called laminopathies [1,2,3]. 
PMC6406247	310300	Introduction	OMIM	False	It is currently thought that at least 11 distinct disease phenotypes can be defined within the laminopathy group. 	These include: EDMD1 (Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy 1, OMIM 310300), EDMD2 (OMIM 181350), EDMD3 (OMIM 616516), DCM (dilated cardiomyopathy, OMIM 115200), FPLD2 (Dunnigan familial partial lipodystrophy type 2, OMIM 151660), CMT2B1 (Charcot–Marie–Tooth disorder, type 2B1, OMIM 605588), heart-hand syndrome, Slovenian type (OMIM 610140), Malouf syndrome (OMIM 212112), MADA (mandibuloacral dysplasia with type A lipodystrophy, OMIM 248370), and RD (restrictive dermopathy, OMIM 275210). 	MADA is a type of mandibuloacral dysplasia associated with mutation in the LMNA gene, while MADB is associated with ZMPSTE24 gene coding for cysteine proteinase (prenyl protease 1 homolog), which among other functions, is responsible for maturation of prelamin A by cleaving off the farnesylated C-terminus. Both are also considered as progeroid laminopathies. 
PMC6406247	614008	Introduction	OMIM	False	Similar genetic disorders to HGPS, with at least partially similar genetic background and molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis, have been recently characterized. 	Nestor-Guillermo progeria syndrome (OMIM 614008) [8,9] arises due to mutations in the BANF1 gene (11q13.1) coding for BAF protein, which is an interacting partner for, among others, emerin and lamin A/C complexes with chromatin. 	RD is an autosomal recessive, lethal disorder associated with mutations in two genes: LMNA and ZMPSTE24 [10,11]. 
PMC3254894	170400	Introduction	OMIM	False	The diagnosis of HOKPP is made if there are recurrent attacks of paralysis and hypokalemia, without any apparent cause for hypokalemia1). 	Patients with HOKPP can be grouped according to the underlying molecular genetic defects; HOKPP type 1 (online mendelian inheritance in man [OMIM] 170400) is due to mutations in the α-subunit of the DHP-receptor (CACNA1S)gene3) and HOKPP type 2 (OMIM 613345) is due to mutations in the α-subunit of the sodium channel (SCN4A) gene4). 	Although there are no significant differences in clinical presentation between the two groups, difference in response to treatment with certain SCN4A gene mutation has been reported5). We report two patients diagnosed with HOKPP type 1 and type 2 after identifying p.Arg528His mutation of the CACNA1S and p.Arg672His mutation of the SCN4A, respectively. 
PMC4327256	604625	Introduction	OMIM	False	The expression of PAX9 in the mesenchyme appears to be a marker for the sites of tooth formation as it occurs before any morphological manifestation of this process12. 	Mutations in this gene have been shown to be associated with autosomal dominant forms of oligodontia (agenesis of more than 6 teeth, MIM 604625) in humans10,25. 	In most families, mutations occur in exon 2 affecting the function of PAX9 paired domain that is responsible for the binding of this protein to DNA target sequences. Affected individuals have severe tooth agenesis with absence of most molars, second premolars and some incisors. PAX9 is critical for the regulation of BMP4 expression through its paired domain rather than Msx113. 
PMC5835904	609007	Introduction	OMIM	False	PD is related to the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (Moore et al., 2005; Poewe et al., 2017) and is clinically characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity and resting tremor. 	Although the majority of cases do not correlate with clear genetic causes, mutations in the Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene (PARK8; OMIM 609007) have been unequivocally related to late-onset PD. 	LRRK2 mutations have been identified in up to 13% of familial PD cases (Paisán-Ruíz et al., 2004; Zimprich et al., 2004) and also account for 1%–2% of not familial cases (Aasly et al., 2005; Goldwurm et al., 2005). LRRK2 protein includes some functional domains such as, from N- to C-terminus armadillo, ankyrin, the namesake leucine-rich repeats, a ROC GTPase domain (Ras of complex proteins), a COR dimerization domain (C-terminal of ROC), a kinase domain and WD40 repeats (Bosgraaf and Van Haastert, 2003; Mills et al., 2012).

PMC5557999	1PVC	Results	PDBe	False	The polypeptide main chain and side chains were well resolved for most of the capsid (Fig. 3d, e), allowing an atomic model for the majority of the three capsid proteins (VP0, VP1, and VP3) to be manually built into the cryo-EM maps. 	The two particles are almost indistinguishable (rmsd in Cα atoms 0.72 Å) with both showing D antigen structure—the final refined atomic models are very similar to the X-ray crystal structure of the closely related Sabin strain of PV3 (PDB 1PVC), with only 0.77 Å rmsd in Cα atoms between complete protomers of the Sabin PV3 (1PVC) and PV3 SktSC8 sVLP. 	The overall architecture of the plant-expressed PV3 SktSC8 sVLP preserves all the structural features characteristic of native conformation particles including the canyon depression around the fivefold vertex of the capsid (Fig. 3b). The only significant changes are on the interior of the particle, where the N-terminal region of the uncleaved VP0 in the empty sVLPs is less well ordered than the corresponding regions of VP4 and VP2 in the mature virus (residues corresponding to VP2 1–11 and VP4 1–25 and 41–69 are not visible in the sVLPs). 
PMC5557999	1POV	Methods	PDBe	False	For PV3 SktSC8 sVLP, a total of 37,378 particles from 2768 micrographs were subjected to reference-free two-dimensional (2D) class averaging to discard bad particles. 	The particle population was further improved by 3D classification, using the X-ray structure of PV1 (PDB 1POV), low-pass filtered to 40 Å as an initial model. 	In total, 4046 particles were selected for 3D auto-refinement. For the PV3 SktSC8 sVLP + GPP3 data set 2060 particles from 1018 micrographs were selected after 2D and 3D classification and 3D auto-refinement used a low-pass (40 Å) filtered model taken from the previously reconstructed PV3 SktSC8 sVLP data set.

The fitting was further improved with real-space refinement using Coot45. Manual model building was performed using Coot45 and in combination with iterative positional and B-factor refinement in real space with Phenix33. 
PMC2577342	1URN	Results	PDBe	False	The results indicate that although the two aromatic amino acids provide little specificity, their interactions contribute significantly to the strength of RNA binding as evidenced by the substantial loss of affinity observed when they are individually mutated.

PMC6077815	3W2S	Methods	PDBe	False	Accession and preparation of the target protein 	The protein, mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was prepared by retrieving the three-dimension crystal structure of EGFR kinase domain in complex with ligand, 1-{3[2-chloro-4- {5-[2-[2-hydroxyethoxylethyl-5H-pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidine-4- yl}amino}phenoxy]phenyl}-3-cyclohexylurea, (PDB: 3W2S) from RCSB PDB (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do) [19].

PMC6077815	3W2S	Methods	PDBe	False	Validation of docking results 	The docking results obtained were validated with the blasting of the fasta sequence of the crystal structure of the human EGFR (ID: 3W2S), which was obtained from the protein data bank unto the online available ChEMBL Database (www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/). 	The bioactivity generated by the database, having an inhibition of 4 and IC50 value of 115, was downloaded in txt format. The bioactivity was sorted out; missing or misplaced data were removed. 
PMC6077815	3W2S	Results	PDBe	False	It is obvious then that the higher binding affinity of luteolin to the binding pocket of mutant EGFR when compared to that of the cocrystallized ligand is attributed to the number of hydrogen bonds present in luteolin (10 hydrogen bonds) as compared to the standard (8 Hydrogen bonds). 	We validated the accuracy of our docking protocol by re-docking the co-crystallized ligand ((PDB Ligand ID: 2WR)) back into the binding pocket of the mutant EGFR (PDB: 3W2S). 	As stated, the re-docked pose overlapped almost totally with the experimental orientation, indicating that Autodock vina on PyRx re-docked the co crystallized ligand, with a very high accuracy, back into the binding pocket of the EGFR, this reveals that our docking methodology was reliable and the docking scores obtained are correct (Figure 4). The reliability of our docking scores was further validated using the online available ChEMBL Database, the Fasta sequence of the crystal structure of mutant EGFR (ID: 3W2S) was blasted on www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/.

The compounds obtained from the search were docked into the binding site of the mutant EGFR, a correlation coefficient graph plotted between the docking scores of the compounds generated and their corresponding ChEMBL's Pchem values (experimentally determined IC50). This showed a strong correlation coefficient between the docking scores and the experimentally derived data in the present study which gave credence to the fact that computational experiment can replicate experimental data at least in this present study and that our docking scores, using PyRx AutoDock Vina algorithm is dependable (Figure 6). 
PMC5013595	1fg9	Introduction	PDBe	False	Interferon-γ receptor 2 is a cell-surface receptor that represents a crucial molecule in the interferon-γ (IFNγ) signalization pathway, influencing innate and adaptive immunity against pathogens and tumours (Schoenborn & Wilson, 2007 ▸; Lin & Young, 2013 ▸). 	The signalling cascade is initiated by the binding of IFNγ to its high-affinity cell surface receptor 1, forming a binary complex with a structure that has already been determined [PDB entries 1fg9 (Thiel et al., 2000 ▸) and 1fyh (Landar et al., 2000 ▸)]. 	However, to activate this binary complex and activate the JAK/STAT signalization pathway (Jung et al., 1987 ▸; Cook et al., 1994 ▸; Hemmi et al., 1994 ▸), IFNγ receptor 2 must participate in a ternary complex created by a homodimer of IFNγ, two molecules of receptor 1 and molecule(s) of receptor 2. To date, detailed structural and biophysical characterization of IFNγ receptor 2, the key molecule for proper IFNγ signalization, is lacking. 
PMC5013595	3se4	Results	PDBe	False	However, there is another factor that contributes to the receptor specificity, the different mutual orientation of D1 and D2 (Supplementary Table S3), which displaces these variable regions to different positions, thus providing a unique binding interface for each receptor. 	Several structural and sequential features of receptors of interferon-α and interferon-β (PDB entry 3se4; Thomas et al., 2011 ▸), here labelled IFNαR1 and IFNαR2, distinguishes them from the other analyzed receptors. 	Specifically, IFNαR1 is composed of four instead of two domains; here, we analyzed D1 and D2. The D3–D4 pair cannot be analyzed as D4 is not resolved in the electron density. 
PMC5013595	1bqu	Results	PDBe	False	Similarity among receptors and consequences for evolution   	As discovered previously (Yoon et al., 2010 ▸), an aromatic tyrosine or phenylalanine residue situated in the cleft between D1 and D2 of gp130 (PDB entry 1bqu; Bravo et al., 1998 ▸), γc (PDB entry 4gs7; Ring et al., 2012 ▸) and IL10R2 (PDB entry 3lqm; Yoon et al., 2010 ▸) serves as the key binding epitope of promiscuous class 1 and 2 receptors, implying the existence of a common ancestor. 	Superposition of these receptor structures shows that the orientation of Phe109 and three residues in gp130, γc and IL10R2 are quite different (Fig. 2 ▸ c). No preferred rotamer of Phe109 overlaps the three former residues without significant rebuilding of the IFNγR2 backbone. 
PMC5013595	1bqu	Results	PDBe	True	(b) N-Acetyl-d-glucosamines (NAGs; blue) glycosylating Asn110 and Asn137 sandwich Trp131 (orange), reducing its hydrophobic character. 	(c) The superposition of aromatic binding epitopes shows differences between IFNγR2 (Phe109 in green) on one side and promiscuous shared cytokine receptors on the other [in red; Tyr82 of IL10R2 (PDB entry 3lqm; Yoon et al., 2010 ▸), Phe169 of gp130 (PDB entry 1bqu; Bravo et al., 1998 ▸) and Tyr103 of γc receptor (PDB entry 4gs7; Ring et al., 2012 ▸)]. 	No corresponding aromatic residue is observed in IL20R2 (Logsdon et al., 2012 ▸). Structural differences between the N-terminal (D1) and C-terminal (D2) domains of 12 class 2 cytokine receptors gauged by the r.m.s.d. values for backbone atoms of their 34 residues. 
PMC5630949	2LG4	Results	PDBe	False	BLASTp and HMMER validations resulted in 29% identities and an expected accuracy of 0.97 using the HMM profile of the family domain. 	The predicted P. variabilis toxin-like is located in the clade of the toxic ShK peptides (fig. 2B) and the ProBiS result of the modeled structure of the putative P. variabilis ShK-like peptide showed that the protein aurelin (PDB ID: 2LG4) was the second best match based on Z scores (supplementary file S1, Supplementary Material online). 	Aurelin is a known antimicrobial peptide that was identified from the mesoglea of the scyphoid jellyfish Aurelia aurita (Ovchinnikova et al. 2006), with structural and spatial conformation similar to that of ShK. The domain alignment of the predicted Protopalythoa ShK-like peptide with Aurelin revealed that both amino acid sequences have a percentage identity of 38%, with the conservation of the six cysteine residues, which stabilizes the structure of the ShK domain by forming three disulfide bridges. 
PMC5630949	1F94	Results	PDBe	False	The multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic relationship of the putative P. variabilis TFT-like Toxin_1 domain with related sequences indicate structural similarity with MALT0070C and Bucandin (fig. 2C and supplementary file S1, Supplementary Material online). 	Using ProBiS for binding site prediction indicated similarity between the structural conformation of binding sites of the P. variabilis TFT-like sequence and that of Bucandin, a TFT from the venom of the elapid Bungarus candidus (PDB ID: 1F94) (supplementary file S1, Supplementary Material online).

(A-B) Homology models of the five NHR-49 isoforms generated using the HNF4α crystal structure (PDB 1M7W) depicted in a structural overlay (A). 	Strong structural similarity is observed for both the DBD (red) and the LBD (blue) for the longest NHR-49C isoform (B), whereas other regions show variability across isoforms. (C) Overlay of the HNF4α-derived NHR-49C model with models generated using the same modeling parameters but experimentally derived PPARα (PDB 2REW; top) and PPARγ (PDB 3E00; bottom) structures as templates (PPAR derived structure: black; LBD: cyan). 
PMC5019492	2REW	Results	PDBe	True	Strong structural similarity is observed for both the DBD (red) and the LBD (blue) for the longest NHR-49C isoform (B), whereas other regions show variability across isoforms.

Both structures successfully model the NHR-49C-LBD (182 aa homology in both models), but neither has the robustness of the HNF4α-derived NHR-49C model. The PPARα-derived model had a 1.6535 RMSD and the PPARγ-derived model a 1.7144 RMSD from HNF4α-derived NHR-49C, indicating a worse overall fit. 
PMC5019492	4IQR	Methods	PDBe	False	The protein sequences for the five NHR-49 isoforms were imported from NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein) and sequence aligned. 	Using the built in BLAST search algorithm (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi), three high confidence crystal structures for HNF4 from RCSB (http://www.rcsb.org/) were identified (PDBs 4IQR; 1LV2; 1M7W) and the individual isoform amino acid sequences were threaded onto the HNF4 sequence using a Blosum62 scoring matrix. 	For PPARα and PPARγ, we identified one high confidence crystal structure each (PDB 2REW and PDB 3E00, respectively) that were used. The MODELLER algorithm was used to generate homology models (>10,000 permutations) using the Discrete Optimized Protein Energy (DOPE) method to refine loops.

The MODELLER algorithm was used to generate homology models (>10,000 permutations) using the Discrete Optimized Protein Energy (DOPE) method to refine loops. Isoform models were then refined, subjected to energy minimization (CHARMm), and side-chain rotamers were verified. In silico mutagenesis was performed and Gibb’s free energy (kcal/mol) was calculated for individual mutant models. 
PMC5019492	4IQR	Methods	PDBe	False	The lipid ligand structures were obtained from http://www.lipidmaps.org/data/structure/ using < = C18 as the ontology search and downloaded as.sdf files and prepared for docking at physiological pH. 	The ligand-binding site was defined for each prepared homology model using coordinates from the HNF4 crystal structure template (PDB 4IQR). 	High throughput screening of the wild-type and mutant protein models was performed using LibDock [49,50]. LibDock is a rigid docking algorithm in which the protein template is held in constant conformation while the molecular ligand is allowed limited flexibility to generate novel conformations based on atomic, polar, and apolar interactions within the protein cleft. 
PMC3139599	1AMN	Results	PDBe	False	In the kinetic characterization of a new enzyme, active site titration allows estimation of reaction mechanism parameters, such as the turnover number. 	We titrated the active site of Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase (TcAChE) using approximately equimolar concentrations of m-(N,N,N-trimethylammonio)trifluoroaceto-phenone (TMTFA), a transition state analogue with affinities reported [9, PDB code 1AMN] to be in the atomolar range. 	After various incubation times aliquots were diluted by a factor of 300 and the residual enzyme activity in the presence of 0.5 mM acetylthiocholine (ATCh) was measured by a standard method [10]. For a reliable determination of active site concentration, we measured three curves with different initial enzyme and titrant concentrations.

The substrates with 3′-overhanging, Y and gapped flap structures were yielded by hybridizing 50sf with 40sr, 50sf with 28sr and 50sf with 28sr and 21sr (Table 2), respectively. 	In the case of 3′-end labelling, an oligonucleotide (Table 1; 21r; 5′-GGGTGTTGCTTTAGTTGTCAT-3′) was radiolabelled with [α-32P]cordycepin-5′-triphosphate (PerkinElmer Life & Analytical Sciences, Boston, MA, USA) by using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Promega Co., Fitchburg, WI, USA). The radiolabelled substrates were incubated with 3-μM TTHB178 in 20-mM Hepes–KOH, 100-mM KCl and 5-mM MgCl2 (pH 7.5).

PMC5854945	2RH1	Article	PDBe	False	The pioneering study of SBVS for a druggable GPCR using the β2AR crystal structure was reported (Cherezov et al., 2007). 	In another SBVS, the authors utilized the inactive structure of β2AR/carazolol (PDB code: 2RH1) (Sabio et al., 2008) and screened proprietary and public databases for the identification of β2AR ligands. 	The hit rates obtained were 36 and 12%, respectively. Similarly, Kolb et al. (2009) docked ~1 × 106 commercially available compounds onto the same crystal structure and the top 25 virtual hits were selected based on their commercial availability, chemical diversity, and complementarity to the binding sites, and subjected for biological testings. 
PMC4510602	1q42	Discussion	PDBe	False	In summary, in this work, we present the cloning and sequencing of MLK4α and MLK4β for the first time. 	Using FISH, we assigned the MLK4 gene to chromosomal band 1q42. 	A number of diseases have been localized to this region, see for example.35,36 pCMV-MLK4β fusion protein was localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus of transiently transfected COS-1 cells, while pCMV-MLK4α was present in cytoplasm only. Both forms of MLK4 strongly inhibited viability and MCF7 cell proliferation in vitro. 
PMC3415135	1GMZ	Methods	PDBe	False	Docking calculations were performed with the GOLD 4.0 program [20] in order to obtain the relative in silico affinities of the Har2 ligand with respect to the sPLA2 targets. 	The sPLA2 structures were taken from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (http://www.pdb.org/), under the PDB ID: 1GMZ, 2QOG, 1PSH, and 1POC, respectively, for PrTX-III, Cdt F15, Naja, and Apis. 	The docking calculations were performed taking advantage of the flexibility of the Har2 ligand, by activating its rotational degrees of freedom. The active site was defined as all atoms within a radius of 10.0 Å from the residue 48 (His or Asp), which is an important residue according to the literature [21, 22]. 
PMC3415135	2QOG	Methods	PDBe	False	CD analysis of native and Har2-treated sPLA2 revealed that the treatment induced discrete unfolding of sPLA2, which did not modify the tridimensional structure of the proteins (See supplementary material, available at doi: 10.1155/2012/987517). 	The sPLA2 structures were represented by the PDB IDs 1GMZ, 2QOG, 1PSH, and 1POC, respectively, for PrTX-III, Cdt F15, Naja, and Apis. 	The calculated docking score values (GOLD scores) for these targets were 33.93, 44.12, 55.26, and 51.23, respectively, for PrTX-III, Cdt F15, Naja, and Apis. One can see in Figure 5 that an interesting trend between the in silico (docking scores) and in vitro (percentages of inhibition) results was observed.

A 25 bp DNA molecule of sequence 5′-d(GCTCCGATATTACAGTTGTAATTTT)-3′ was extracted from a MecI–DNA transcription repressor complex from Staphylococcus aureus (PDB ID: 1SAX). 	Overhanging 5′ bases were removed in order to generate a blunt double-stranded DNA molecule of 24 bp. The 24 bp DNA molecule was added to the cavity of HerA–NurA to yield the HerA–NurA–DNA complex.

ATP-bound HerA–NurA-DNA was assembled using the crystallographically available dimeric HerA-ANP asymmetric unit (PDB ID 4D2I). 	The hexameric ANP-bound barrel was formed via the aforementioned method. ANP ligands were converted to ATP through exchanging the γ-nitrogen atom for oxygen.

The heptameric model of HerA was built using the existing hexameric HerA (PDB ID: 4D10). The six chains of the HerA hexamer were separated and each protomer was translated and rotated in order to build a heptameric ring with six subunits.

The structure was optimized and prepared by assigning bond orders; charges, hybridizations and explicit hydrogen were added if missing. The missing side chains and loops in the structure were filled using prime module of Schrödinger suite 2015. 
PMC3689675	1T5R	Methods	PDBe	False	Molecular replacement was carried out successfully with a number of different hemolysin-like structures. 	The best results used the S component of S. aureus Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PDB ID 1T5R [21], as the search model and the program Phaser [31]. 	This gave a Z-score of 11.6 and a log-likelihood gain of 123.4 following placement of a single copy in the asymmetric unit, and an R-factor and R-free of 41.8 and 44.9% respectively following an initial rigid-body refinement round.

PMC3689675	7AHL	Methods	PDBe	False	Secondly, αHL has detectable sequence homology to Delta toxin, whereas the more recently solved (and structurally related) Vibrio cholerae cytolysin heptamer [35] has inserted domains and much lower sequence homology. 	Delta toxin was sequence aligned with a number of other known hemolysin-like atomic structures using ClustalW [36] and αHL (PDB ID 7AHL) [15], and residues corresponding to the stem and latch domains in αHL were deleted from the final refined model of Delta toxin. 	The coordinates of the refined Delta toxin minus these two regions were then optimally superposed onto the A molecule from αHL using SSM [37] in CCP4. The residues corresponding to the latch and stem domains from 7AHL where mutated to their corresponding residues in Delta toxin using Chainsaw [38] from CCP4 and these two domains added to the Delta toxin. 
PMC3689675	7AHL	Methods	PDBe	False	The coordinates of the refined Delta toxin minus these two regions were then optimally superposed onto the A molecule from αHL using SSM [37] in CCP4. 	The residues corresponding to the latch and stem domains from 7AHL where mutated to their corresponding residues in Delta toxin using Chainsaw [38] from CCP4 and these two domains added to the Delta toxin. 	This model of a Delta toxin pore-form monomer was then superposed on each of the 7 monomers in 7AHL in turn to form a model of a heptameric Delta toxin pore. The model was then energy-minimised in Phenix [32]. 
PMC3689675	1T5R	Results	PDBe	False	Analysis of the diffraction pattern and systematic absences led to Delta toxin crystals being assigned to the orthorhombic space group P21212, with unit-cell dimensions a = 112.93, b = 49.66, c = 58.48 Å. The Matthews coefficient (VM of 2.58 Å3.Da−1) suggested that the asymmetric unit contained one molecule of Delta toxin, corresponding to a crystal solvent content of 52.4%. 	C. perfringens Delta toxin structure was determined by molecular replacement using Phaser [31] and LukS-PV (PDB ID: 1T5R; [21]) as the model and yielded excellent quality electron density maps. 	The model was refined using Phenix [32] and built with Coot [33].

PMC4634563	4WSB	Results	PDBe	False	Prompted by the lack of a tertiary structure of the EBOV polymerase to an atomic resolution level, we have developed a three-dimensional model of the RdRp domain of the EBOV L protein by using the PHYRE 2.0 web server and, with the addition of a Mononegavirales L protein secondary structure-based multiple sequence alignment, identify conserved residues within the enzyme that might help in the design of specific drugs that could counteract the EBOV epidemic. 	The best match yielded by the PHYRE 2.0 server to our EBOV polymerase sequence corresponds to the bat influenza A virus (PDB code 4WSB, chain B) [17]. 	Only 253 residues of the EBOV polymerase could be aligned with confidence levels of 91.7%, and the identity between the fragments of the two proteins is of 12% (S1 Fig). Although the ss(-)RNA LaCrosse virus polymerase is now available [15], its use as a template in the alignment and model prediction were not encouraging. 
PMC4634563	2E9R	Results	PDBe	False	The completion of the abovementioned interactions is a major determinant of the intrinsic fidelity of these enzymes, which is enhanced by the presence of an exonuclease domain in many DNA polymerases, which is clearly a later evolutionary addition [7–9]. 	A structural superposition of the EBOV RdRp with a foot-and-mouth disease virus polymerase bound to a template-primer RNA and ribavirin triphosphate (Fig 5) was drawn with Chimera 1.8 using the palm subdomain as reference (PDB code 2E9R) [30]. 	The image shows that the EBOV RdRp central crevice has enough space to hold a dsRNA, and the interactions between the RNA and the protein are analogous to those previously observed in RdRps (Fig 5). The primer might could be bound to residues located in the thumb subdomain and residues within palm domain’s motif E, while the template might be coordinated by residues located in the fingers subdomain.

Three dimensional structural models for WsCYP98A and WsCYP76A were generated using Phyre2 with >90% accuracy on the basis of homology based modelling using cytochrome P450 1a2 (PDB: 2HI4) as template (Figure 4A and C). 	The amino acid residues involved in ligand binding were also predicted using the 3DLigandSite tool as depicted in Figure 4B and D.

PMC5768020	4BWM	Article	PDBe	False	b) Amino acids in proximity to the nascent base pair were chosen for saturation mutagenesis. 	Adapted from PDB ID: 4BWM19a using PyMOL (Schrödinger, LLC; New York, NY). 	c) Anticipated outcome for promising RT‐KTQ variants: high m6A discrimination for dTMP incorporation and high efficiency for dAMP misincorporation. It was reported that low‐fidelity DNA polymerases differ from high‐fidelity DNA polymerases mainly in the efficiency of correct nucleotide incorporation, whereas the incorporation of incorrect nucleotides is comparable.22 Thus, we reasoned that enhanced error rates opposite m6A would probably derive from decreased dTMP incorporation rather than from increased misincorporation.

PMC6272888	1T2F	Article	PDBe	False	All compounds were built and saved as Mol2. 	The crystal structure of human LDH-5B in complex with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide was downloaded from protein data bank (pdb code = 1T2F). 	The protein was loaded into Leadit 2.1.5 and the receptor components were chosen by selection of chain A as a main chain. Binding site was defined by choosing NAD+ as a reference ligand to which all coordinates were computed. 
PMC5173318	1J6Z	Article	PDBe	False	The tree diagram was modified from Ettema et al. (2011). 	The structures use the following PDB entries: 1J6Z (actin), 5LY3 (crenactin), 4A62 (ParM), 5LJK (MamK) and 4CZL (MreB). 	Now, in eLife, Löwe and colleagues – including Izoré as first author – have used electron cryo-microscopy to further investigate the structure of crenactin filaments (Izoré et al., 2016). However, contrary to the previous reports, Izoré et al. now show that crenactin filaments are more similar to actin filaments than previously thought. 
PMC5397143	2NRA	Results	PDBe	False	Superposition analysis revealed a small (∼9°) difference between the relative orientation of domains 2 and 3 in the two copies present in the dimer seen in the asymmetric unit, suggesting flexibility between the two domains (Supplementary Figure S6). 	Structural comparisons against the PDB (39,40) revealed that the 38 kDa fragment of RctB bears significant similarity to several replication initiator proteins from plasmid DNA replication systems, including π (2NRA, (45)), RepE (2Z90, (46), 1REP, (47)) and RepA (1HKQ, (48)), (Z scores of between 7.7 and 9 using the DALI server). 	Nearly every secondary structure element of π or RepE can be mapped on to a corresponding element of RctB domain 2 or 3 (Figure 3, Supplementary Figures S7 and S8). For RepA, the structure of only one domain of the two is available, and its secondary structure elements correspond to RctB domain 2 (Figure 3); the structure of the second domain of RepA is not known, but it likely resembles the corresponding domain of RepE based on primary sequence considerations (47). 
PMC5397143	2Z33	Results	PDBe	False	The RctB-R278A-D279A-R282A mutant could not be produced in soluble form and was not analyzed. 	Candidate DNA-binding residues in domain 3 were identified through structural alignment of RctB to PhoB bound to its target DNA (PDB entry 2Z33); based on this analysis, we anticipated that a number of residues, including Arg 420 and Arg 423, would be required for DNA binding and generated the RctB-R420A-R423A, referred to as domain 3 double-mutant. 	Similar to the domain 1 triple-mutant, domain 3 double-mutant bound to three of the six DNA probes tested differently than wild-type RctB. The Kdapp of RctB R420A-R423A binding to the 6 × 12-mer array probe was ∼1500-fold lower than wild-type RctB (Figure 4, Supplementary Figure S13), and similar marked reductions in binding to individual 12-mer and 11-mer containing probes were observed (Supplementary Figures S14 and S15).

Five templates (PDB ID: 3TQ8, 1ZDR, 3DAU, 3IA4 and 3IX9) with sequence identity of 6–29% to the target were selected by the GalaxyTBM pipeline and additionally structure was refined by using Galaxy Refine. 	To investigate the interaction between proteins (DfrA7) and inhibitor (trimethoprim), molecular docking was carried out using Autodock 4.0 [20]. The ligand trimethoprim (TMP) was docked to the available crystal structure of TMP-sensitive-Dfr (PDB- ID: 2ANQ, 100% identical to the wild type Dfr, Ac.No. AAA87976) and PGB01-DfrA7 (Ac.

PMC2777313	2CWH	Results	PDBe	True	Both methods identify the binding site, but by considering conservation information (Figure 2A), ConCavity more accurately traces the ligand. 	(B) PDB: 2CWH. Structure significantly overpredicts the extent of the ligand in the bottom left corner as well as predicting an additional pocket on the reverse of the protein. ConCavity predicts only the two ligand binding pockets. 	
PMC2777313	1G6C	Results	PDBe	False	The results for 2CWH (Figure 3B) and 1G6C (Figure 3C) demonstrate that ConCavity can predict dramatically different sets of pockets than are obtained when considering structure alone. 	In 2CWH, both methods identify the ligands, but Structure over-predicts the bottom left binding pocket and predicts an additional pocket that does not have a ligand bound. ConCavity traces the ligands more closely and does not predict any additional pockets. Structure performs quite poorly on the tetramer 1G6C: it predicts several pockets that do not bind ligands; it fails to completely identify several ligands; and it misses one ligand entirely. 	In stark contrast, ConCavity's four predicted pockets each accurately trace a ligand. The incorporation of conservation resulted in the accurate prediction of a pocket in a region where no pocket was predicted using structure alone. 
PMC2777313	3B6A	Results	PDBe	True	Bound ligands are shown in yellow, and the pocket predictions of ConCavity are represented by green meshes.

(B) The ring-shaped pentameric B-subunit of a shiga-like toxin (PDB: 1CQF) binds globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) via a relatively flat interface that surrounds the center of the ring. (C) The carbohydrate binding sites of the CBM29 protein (PDB: 1GWL) are too long and flat to be detected by ConCavity in the presence of a concave pocket between the chains.

(B) The ring-shaped pentameric B-subunit of a shiga-like toxin (PDB: 1CQF) binds globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) via a relatively flat interface that surrounds the center of the ring. 	(C) The carbohydrate binding sites of the CBM29 protein (PDB: 1GWL) are too long and flat to be detected by ConCavity in the presence of a concave pocket between the chains. As illustrated here, ConCavity's inaccurate predictions are often the result of misleading evolutionary sequence conservation information (A) or ligands that bind partially or entirely outside of well-defined concave surface pockets (B, C). 
PMC2777313	1GWL	Results	PDBe	True	(B) The ring-shaped pentameric B-subunit of a shiga-like toxin (PDB: 1CQF) binds globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) via a relatively flat interface that surrounds the center of the ring. 	(C) The carbohydrate binding sites of the CBM29 protein (PDB: 1GWL) are too long and flat to be detected by ConCavity in the presence of a concave pocket between the chains. 	As illustrated here, ConCavity's inaccurate predictions are often the result of misleading evolutionary sequence conservation information (A) or ligands that bind partially or entirely outside of well-defined concave surface pockets (B, C). In (A) and (B), ConCavity misses the ligands, but identifies functionally relevant binding sites for other types of interactions (DNA and protein). 
PMC2777313	3B6A	Results	PDBe	False	The first pattern common among these difficult cases is evolutionary sequence conservation information leading predictions away from actual ligand binding sites. Figure 7A provides an example in which the ligand binding site is less conserved than other parts of the protein. 	The ActR protein from Streptomyces coelicolor (PDB: 3B6A) contains both a small molecule ligand-binding and a DNA-binding domain [63]. 	The ligand-binding domain is in the bottom, less-conserved half of the structure. The DNA-binding domain is found in the more conserved top half of the given structure. 
PMC2777313	1CQF	Results	PDBe	False	Figure 7 also provides two examples of another difficult case: ligands bound outside of clearly defined, concave surface pockets. 	In Figure 7B, ConCavity identifies the center of the ring-shaped structure of the pentameric B-subunit of a shiga-like toxin (PDB: 1CQF) as the binding site. 	This protein binds to glycolipids, like the globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) shown, via a relatively flat interface that surrounds the center of the ring [64]. The center cavity (ConCavity's prediction) is filled by a portion of the A-subunit of the toxin (not included in the structure) which after binding breaks off and enters the host cell. Figure 7C shows the structure of a dimeric noncatalytic carbohydrate binding module (CBM29) from Piromyces equi complexed with mannohexaose (PDB: 1GWL). 
PMC2777313	1GWL	Results	PDBe	False	This protein binds to glycolipids, like the globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) shown, via a relatively flat interface that surrounds the center of the ring [64]. 	The center cavity (ConCavity's prediction) is filled by a portion of the A-subunit of the toxin (not included in the structure) which after binding breaks off and enters the host cell. Figure 7C shows the structure of a dimeric noncatalytic carbohydrate binding module (CBM29) from Piromyces equi complexed with mannohexaose (PDB: 1GWL). 	The carbohydrate ligands bind in long flat clefts on the protein surface [65]. Even though these sites exhibit significant evolutionary conservation, their geometry prevents them from being predicted. 
PMC2777313	1P5T	Methods	PDBe	False	This set consists of 337 proteins with apo (unbound) structures, each having less than 25% sequence identity with any other protein in the set. 	Five of the 337 structures were left out of the evaluation: 1P5T, 1YJG, and 3DL3 lacked holo ligand information in the database, and 2PCY and 3EZM, because their corresponding holo structures are not in PQS or HSSP. 	Each apo structure has at least one associated holo (bound) structure in which biologically relevant ligands are identified in order to define ligand binding residues and map them to the apo structure. If multiple holo structures are available for the protein, the sets of contacting residues are combined to define the binding residues for the apo structure. 
PMC2777313	1LY7	Methods	PDBe	False	This set contains a diverse set of high-quality structures (resolution <3 Å) with drug or drug-like molecules (molecular weight between 200 and 600, and 1−12 rotatable bonds) bound. 	Structure 1LY7 has been removed from the PDB, and 1R09 could not be parsed. 	We consider the 98 remaining structures. The catalytic site annotations were taken from version 2.2.9 of the Catalytic Site Atlas [66]. 
PMC3334985	3IU4	Methods	PDBe	False		Three residues of the HCDR3 loop are missing from the structure of chP3 (PDB 3IU4) [30]. 	The missing portion was manually built, and low energy conformers of this portion, as well as the residue adjacent to each side of the missing portion (making a total of five residues), were generated using the loop refinement tool in Prime [47]. The site mapping procedure (see above) was performed on the ten lowest energy conformers. 
PMC3334985	3HZK	Results	PDBe	False	However, all of the programs were able to identify the correct binding mode (i.e., less than 2.0 Å rmsd between pose and crystallographic binding mode) for at least one case, regardless of ranking. 	The exception to this is GOLD, which was able to both accurately identify and rank, as the top pose, the correct binding mode in four cases, these being all of the S73-2 complexes (PDB codes 3HZK, 3HZV and 3HZY), and the complex of S25-39 with Kdoα(2→4)Kdoα(2-OAll) (PDB 3OKK). 	Two of these successful cases are shown in Figure 2. In general, increasing the size and flexibility of the carbohydrate determinant being examined led to reduced quality predictions.

Additional models were generated with the CD11c/CD18 ectodomain X-ray structure (pdb id 3K71), using chains G and H that possess the αA domain density. 	Homology modeling between the two αA domains was used to place Fab107 on the CD11c/CD18 structure. To generate a canonical ‘bent model’, crystal structure of inactive αVβ3 ectodomain (pdb 1jv2) was superimposed on that of CD11c/CD18 ectodomain by homology modeling between the α-chain Propeller domain while the Fab107/CD11bA structure was superimposed on CD11c/CD18 as before.

To generate a canonical ‘bent model’, crystal structure of inactive αVβ3 ectodomain (pdb 1jv2) was superimposed on that of CD11c/CD18 ectodomain by homology modeling between the α-chain Propeller domain while the Fab107/CD11bA structure was superimposed on CD11c/CD18 as before. 	The final model was generated by deleting the CD11c/CD18 chains leaving the oriented αVβ3 ectodomain/Fab107 CD11bA chains. Each of the models was oriented to a common origin by a series of rigid body rotations and translations.

The ADMIDAS metal ion (cyan sphere), and Propeller and α-genu metal ions (orange spheres) in αVβ3 ectodomain are shown.

The structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program Phaser38 using the structure of Nuc, a bacterial PLD-family nuclease (PDB: 1BYR) as a search model18. 	Automatic model building was performed using ARP/wARP39, which correctly built approximately 140 residues of the 158 in the final structure. Subsequent model building and inspection were carried out using the program Coot40.

PMC5593987	4KMA	Results	PDBe	False	The BestSel method35 indicates that dSUFU CD spectrum is consistent with secondary-structure content of 20% helix and 22% ß-strand at 15 °C. 	This is in agreement with the crystal structure of the Drosophila protein 4KMA that contains 24% helix and 21% ß-strand (Table 1). 	SRCD spectra were measured as a function of increasing temperatures to characterise thermal unfolding of dSUFU (Fig. 1A). An isobestic point is present at 200 nm, indicating that a transition occurs between two states.

(B) Global view and close-up of dSUFU crystal structure 4KMA showing the superposition of several cation binding sites selected by ASSAM server. The main chain is represented as a grey cartoon; the ions are displayed as spheres and conserved aminoacid side chains are coloured as follows: His, red; Asp or Glu, blue; Tyr, magenta; Thr, cyan. 	Spectroscopic measurements show that SUFU co-purifies with zinc The X-ray fluorescence spectrum measured on a very concentrated (30 mg/ml) solution of dSUFU, expressed and purified with no added metal, showed the presence of an absorption edge at 9.66 keV, characteristic of the Zinc K level (Fig. 3A). 
PMC5593987	4KMA	Results	PDBe	False	The environment around His71 and His73 in SUFU (i.e., the presence of Tyr60, Gln180 and Asp178), constitutes a pocket that can accommodate an ion such as Zn ++ . 	Moreover, pKa calculation using pdb2pka.org server on dSUFU structure 4KMA showed that the pKa of His71 and His73 are 2 and 3.2, respectively (Fig. 4C). 	pKa calculation of hSUFU histidines gives similar results (not shown). These are considerably lower pKa values than the average pKa value of 6.5 for Histidine. 
PMC5593987	4BLB	Discussion	PDBe	False	In most structures, either EDTA or tartrate are present in the protein solution, or in the crystallisation conditions, and may therefore have chelated cations during the several day - long crystallisation process. 	Two crystal structures of a construct composed of a 6-Histidine tag, hSUFU and Maltose-Binding Protein were obtained by Cherry et al., in the presence of one zinc equivalent per protein monomer (PDB entries 4BLB and 4BLD)27. 	The zinc is bound in a non-physiological site at the interface between the 6-Histidine tag of one protein and the Maltose-Binding Protein tag of another chain. Therefore, the nine deposited structures of SUFU are devoid of zinc, most probably due to crystallisation conditions. 
PMC5593987	1M1L	Methods	PDBe	False	Examination of the protein structure showed that this site is buried in the protein and in contact with other conserved residues Y29, T105, R107 and D178 forming a potentially interesting pocket (see Fig. 2B). 	The PDB coordinates of the corresponding residues Y45, H87, H89, T121, R123 and D182 from structure 1M1L of hSUFU was input in the ASSAM server, a program that searches the protein data bank to locate structures with similar amino-acid composition and geometry38. 	Metal binding site characterisation X-ray fluorescence and absorption measurements were performed at the Proxima1 beamline (SOLEIL synchrotron). 
PMC6249285	3NHQ	Results	PDBe	False	Selected conserved amino acids are highlighted as sticks, water molecules are shown as red spheres. 	In the Pfr state of bathy bacteriophytochromes (a, wild-type Agp2-PCM and b, Agp2-PAiRFP2; c, PaBphP-PCM (P. aeruginosa; PDB entry 3NHQ29)) Tyr165, Phe192 and Arg202 show a conserved conformation. 	Furthermore, the cysteines are always β-facially bound to BV. In the Meta-F state of Agp2-PAiRFP2, the two monomers (Mol A and B) of the asymmetric unit (d, e) show slightly different structures. 
PMC6249285	4Q0J	Results	PDBe	False	In Mol B (e), the N-terminus is tightly packed to Mol A (Fig. 5). 	In the Pr states of prototypical bacterial (f, Agp1-PCMSER13 of A. fabrum, PDB entry 5HSQ30 and g, DrBphP-PCM of D. radiodurans; e.g. PDB entry 4Q0J18), cyanobacterial (h, Cph1-PCM of Synchocystis sp.; PDB entry 2VEA31) and plant (i, AtPhyB-PCM of A. thaliana; PDB entry 4OUR32) phytochromes, the rotameric states of the corresponding amino acids as well as the same two water molecules between the Tyr and Arg residues are similar to Mol A in the Meta-F state of Agp2-PAiRFP2 (d). 	Because of the low resolution (3.4 Å), these water molecules were not resolved in the AtPhyB-PCM structure32 Group III structural changes within the PHY tongue region 
PMC6249285	4Q0J	Discussion	PDBe	False	The group II structural changes seem to constitute the key process for coupling chromophore and protein structural changes. 	Here the formation of the hydrophobic pocket for ring D via reorientation of Tyr165 and Phe192 and the hydrogen bonding interactions of Tyr165 with the rotated Arg202 via two new water molecules is a structural motif that can be deduced from the various Pr state structures of prototypical bacterial (Agp1-PCMSER13 of A. fabrum [PDB entry 5HSQ30], DrBphP-PCM of D. radiodurans [e.g. PDB entry 4Q0J18]) and cyanobacterial (Cph1-PCM of Synechocystis sp.

In a set of 14 structures of the seven proteins (LeuT: PDB identifiers 2A65, 2QJU, 3F3A; Mhp1: 2JLN, 2JLO, 2X79; CaiT: 3HFX, 2WSW, 2WSX; AdiC: 3NCY, 3LRB; vSGLT: 3DH4; BetP: 2WIT; ApcT: 3GIA) we shifted the residue ranges that were assigned to the individual TMDs to minimize Cα root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) from the reference structure 2A65, which has the best resolution. 	During the process, core TMD lengths were reduced if this was necessary to keep all core residues within the ranges originally assigned for the TMDs in (Schulze et al. 2010). Thus, the alignment defines a minimal ten-helix core.

With the inward-open structure 3TT3 of LeuT, we found that the first step of this procedure did not provide a bundle axis perpendicular to the membrane. 	Given the poor electron density near the N terminus in this structure, we excluded the first two residues of TMD 1 (residues 11 and 12) from computation of the bundle axis for all LeuT structures. This exclusion did not lead to significant changes in the orientation of the bundle axis for the other LeuT structures 2A65, 3F3A, 3GJC, and 3TT1.

This can be compared to the structural change between the outward-open structure of Mhp1 (2JLN) and the inward-open structure of the same protein (2X79), which is 2.93 Å. The comparison suggests that the differences of core TMD internal conformation and orientation between the individual proteins are not exclusively due to idiosyncrasies of the proteins, but may be related at least partially to different conformational states of the shared architecture. To analyze internal conformation variability of individual TMDs we have considered the mean Cα r.m.s.d. for pairwise superposition of single TMDs in the set of structures 2WSW, 2WIT, 3DH4, 2A65, 2JLN, 3NCY, and 3GIA (Fig. 2).

PMC3578728	2A65	Results	PDBe	False		Comparison of the outward occluded structure of LeuT (2A65), an occluded structure of BetP (2W8A, meanwhile superseded by 2WIT), and the inward-open structure of vSGLT (3DH4) suggested that TMD 8 changes from a kinked internal conformation via a slightly kinked internal conformation to a straight TMD in the outward-open to inward-open transition (Ressl et al. 2009). 	For the apo form of prolin/sodium symporter PutP, a helix-loop-helix model based on EPR data revealed a kink of TMD 8 very similar to the one seen in LeuT (Hilger et al. 2009), whereas the same TMD is straight in inward-open conformations of vSGLT, which belongs to the same protein family of sodium substrate symporters (SSS) as PutP. However, in Mhp1 and LeuT, which could be crystallized in outward-open and inward-open structures, only slight straightening is observed (vide infra). 
PMC3578728	3NCY	Results	PDBe	False	However, in Mhp1 and LeuT, which could be crystallized in outward-open and inward-open structures, only slight straightening is observed (vide infra). 	In the SLC 7 family of amino acid transporters TMD 8 is straight in the outward-open structure of the arginine/agmatine antiporter AdiC (3NCY) and kinked in the inward-open structure of ApcT (3GIA). 	Hence, even if a change of internal conformation of TMD 8 is a universal feature of the transition from the outward-open to the inward-open state, extent and direction of this change differ between different proteins for currently unknown reasons. We have taken advantage of the small internal conformation variability of TMD 4 to define a robust parameter θΒ,4 (see Sect. “Methods”) that characterizes relative orientation of the bundle of TMDs 1, 2, 6, and 7 and the hash motif made up by TMDs 3, 4, 8, and 9 (see Fig. 1b).

PMC3578728	2A65	Results	PDBe	False	These changes reveal which parts of the structure are flexible and which parts move collectively. 	This is still true for conformations that may be off-path because of blocking of a binding site by detergent, as suggested for structure 2A65 of LeuT (Quick et al. 2009) but dismissed by (Wang et al. 2012), or downregulated because of low osmolarity, as suggested for structure 2WIT of BetP (Forrest et al. 2011).

This revealed that structure 3F3A with the competitive inhibitor tryptophan bound in a second binding site and structure 3QS4 of mutant F259V also bound to tryptophan agree within 0.24 Å.

PMC3578728	2X79	Results	PDBe	False	Coarse-grained analysis of the Ce ↔ Ci transition in Mhp1 	The only protein for which both an outward-open (2JLN) and inward-open structure (2X79) was known on initial submission of this work was Mhp1. 	The transition has been characterized as mainly a relative motion of the hash motif (TMDs 3, 4, 8, and 9) with respect to the bundle (TMDs 1, 2, 6, and 7), accompanied by some bending and flexing of the arm TMDs 5 and 10 (Shimamura et al. 2010). To characterize this movement we have superimposed the bundle TMDs by minimization of Cα r.m.s.d. 
PMC3578728	2JLN	Results	PDBe	False		The Cα r.m.s.d. between the two hash motifs (blue and cyan) is 6.16 Å. Coupler TMDs 5 and 10 are not displayed for structure 2JLN.

PMC3578728	2JLN	Results	PDBe	False	Such movement may help to occlude one side of the substrate translocation pathway while opening up the other side. 	If the same analysis is applied to the Ce ↔ CSec transition between structures 2JLN and 2JLO, only arm II rotates by 14.9°. 	The screw transformation of the hash and any internal changes in the bundle and hash are insignificant in this transition. Note however that structure 2JLO is based on 2JLN with remodeling of only part of loop L9–10 and TMD 10 (Weyand et al. 2008). 
PMC3578728	2JLN	Results	PDBe	False	The screw transformation of the hash and any internal changes in the bundle and hash are insignificant in this transition. 	Note however that structure 2JLO is based on 2JLN with remodeling of only part of loop L9–10 and TMD 10 (Weyand et al. 2008). 	We now discuss reorientation of the arms characterized by angles ϕ5 and ϕ10 (Fig. 3c). We have checked that this motion is generally better described as reorientation of the corresponding TMD as a whole than as an independent movement of one moiety of a kinked TMD, in agreement with the finding that the entire TMD 5 contributes to the cyoplasmic thin gate and the entire TMD 10 to the periplasmic thick gate (Shimamura et al. 2010). 
PMC3578728	2JLN	Results	PDBe	False	Complete visualization of the transition in Online Resource 1, page S 1, shows that TMD 10 kinks towards the bundle, thus occluding periplasmic access to the central binding site, as was already pointed out in (Weyand et al. 2008). 	Among the characteristic angles, θΒ,4 and ϕ5 only slightly decrease by 2.6 and 4.2°, respectively, corresponding to only 13–15 % of the total change between the Ce and Ci conformations (19.7 and 28.3°, respectively, for the structure pair 2JLN/2X79). 	In contrast, ϕ10 increases by 18.9°, which is approximately 50 % of the change between the Ce and Ci conformations. The kink or bending angle β10 between the mean axes through the N-terminal and C-terminal halves of TMD 10 increases by about 6°. 
PMC3578728	2JLN	Results	PDBe	False	Nevertheless, the 50 lowest normal modes cover about 50 % of the coordinate change. 	Similar tendencies were observed for the other structural transitions discussed in this work (data not shown).Fig. 6Dependence of normal mode coefficients d k on mode number k for expressing the coordinate change between Mhp1 structures 2JLN and 2X79 as a linear combination of ANM normal modes 	Based on our definition of fractional coverage f1 of the conformational change by a small basis of slow normal modes (see Sect. “Methods”), we have tested to what extent structural transitions can be described by a reduced basis of 50 normal modes, corresponding to about 5 % of the total number of modes for the core of transporters with the LeuT fold. This number of modes is a compromise between precision of the description and the effort required for obtaining distance constraints in order to perform such fits with the algorithm described in (Zheng and Brooks 2006). 
PMC3578728	2X79	Results	PDBe	False	The extent of coverage of the structural transition by the reduced ANM can also be assessed by the characteristic angles. 	With the ANM model, θB,4 decreases by 14.3°, whereas the decrease is 17.1° for the crystal structure 2X79. 	Hence, the ANM covers most of the motion of the hash relative to the bundle. Of the increase in ϕ10 by 17.6°, the ANM covers 10.4° and of the decrease in ϕ5 by 24.1° it covers 11.9°. 
PMC3578728	3OB6	Results	PDBe	False	For TMD 2 the fit slightly overestimates the change. 	The N terminal end of TMD 6 unwinds in the ANM fit, probably owing to problems in covering the conformational change of L5–6.Fig. 8Coverage of TMD internal conformation changes during the CSe (3OB6) → CSec (3L1L) transition of AdiC. Color code Crystal structure 3OB6 cyan, crystal structure 3L1L green, ANM fit result R f grey. a TMD 2. b TMD 6 	All these findings combined suggest that the lowest 5 % of the normal modes of ANMs can provide a reasonable, coarse description of large-scale structural changes in secondary transporters with the LeuT fold. This approach has an inherent bias to underestimate the amplitude of structural changes.

Three HO inhibitors also suppressed the disappearance of consecutive NF-positive line structures in sciatic nerve fibers on 3DIV. 	Thus, we found that in vivo treatment with HO inhibitors effectively inhibited myelin fragmentation process and axonal degradation, suggesting that HO1 regulates Wallerian degeneration in vivo.

For the construction of a grid for screening by the use of the DOCK4.0 program, the grid box was set directly on the two cavities of the FtsZ crystal structure 4DXD from the PDB database (www.pdb.org) after extraction of PC190723, which is known to have efficiency against the FtsZ and GDP molecules.

The homology model of hNAAA was constructed using the crystal structure of conjugated bile acid hydrolase (CBAH) from Clostridium Perfringens (PDB ID: 2BJF) [15] as a template in Prime (1.6 ed., Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY). 	An initial BLAST alignment between the two sequences was adjusted by taking secondary structure into account using SSpro and PSIPRED [26].

PMC5364535	1LMB	Results	PDBe	False	To recognize these different PPIs derived combinations, we needed to design specific core sequences. 	By using FoldX10, we built the complex structure of CI(N,wt)/CI(N,mut) heterodimer binding with DNA, which is based on the complex structure of CI(N,wt)/CI(N,wt) homodimer binding with DNA (PDB:1LMB), then structures corresponding to each of the single point mutants of DNA sequences in these two complexes were generated. 	The interaction energy changes of CI(N,wt)/CI(N,wt)–DNA complex (Fig. 2A) and CI(N,wt)/CI(N,mut)–DNA complex (Fig. 2B) were obtained by comparing the interaction energies of DNA mutant structures from each complex with each wild type. According to these calculations, we designed five core sequences (core-1~5) for CI(N,wt)/CI(N,wt) and CI(N,mut)/CI(N,mut), three core sequences (core-6~8) for CI(N,wt)/CI(N,mut) (Table S1).

The first conformation displays a slightly kinked alpha helix spanning from residue N432 to residue N461 with a loop connecting residues D462 to T466 (as in structure 3OKH). 	In the second conformation the kinked alpha helix is shorter (N432 to S457) and the loop is longer (W458 to T466) and adopts a different orientation (as in structure 3OKI). After superimposing the structure provided by the organizers with representative structures of each conformation, 3OKH was deemed as a suitable template to build the missing fragment of the structure.

Subsequently, appropriate capping groups were added to residue M247 of the main chain and to residues D743 and D755 of the co-activator fragment.

PMC5767197	3FXV	Methods	PDBe	False	Generation of ligand binding modes 	Binding modes for the literature data were manually build in Maestro 11 (beta) by means of an overlay with the binding mode of compounds 7a and 1a as observed in the X-ray crystal structures 3FXV and 3OKI respectively. 	For set1 of the blind datasets, a putative binding mode for the series was obtained by docking the compounds bearing the smallest (hydrogen, 91) the bulkiest (morpholino amide, 102) substituent, as well as compound 101 to probe the effect of an ionized carboxylic acid on the binding mode. Consistent binding modes were obtained for the three molecules in the crystallographic structure provided by the organizers. 
PMC5767197	3OKI	Methods	PDBe	False	A similar protocol was followed for compounds in set2, using compounds 12, 74, 76, 79 and 83 to explore the influence of different substituents in the sulfonamide. 	A consistent binding mode was found for these compounds in the protein conformation displayed in PDB ID 3OKI, and putative binding modes for the entire series were manually created from the binding mode of compound 83. 	All docking calculations were performed with rDock, generating the cavity using the two-sphere method available in the program, centering a 15 Å cavity within residues M294, I356, S336 and Y373 using 1.5 and 4.0 Å for the radius of the small and large spheres respectively. Manual building of the compounds was performed with Maestro 11 (beta) and the minimizer available in the suite was used to avoid steric clashes.

PMC4394528	1VE7	Introduction	PDBe	False	Furthermore, porcine brain APH is potently inhibited by organophosphorous compounds and has been proposed as a new pharmacological target for the cognitive-enhancing effects of these compounds in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases [7,10]. 	The crystal structure of apAPH, which is the first available APH structure, was determined in 2004 (PDB Id 1VE7) [9]. 	This enzyme is active and very stable at an optimal temperature of 90 °C. The structure of apAPH is a symmetric homodimer, in which each subunit comprises two domains. 
PMC4394528	1VE7	Introduction	PDBe	False	Despite advances in understanding the biological functions of acylpeptide hydrolases, little is known of the structural basis for the sequential deacetylation of N-terminally acetylated proteins. 	Until known, only the crystal of an APH from the thermophilic archaeon Aeropyrum pernix K1 (APH) was obtained for structure determination (PDB Id 1VE7) [9]. 	Although APH from Aeropyrum pernix K1 shares only 29%, 20% and 29% sequence identity with human, porcine, and rat acylpeptide hydrolase, respectively, there is a surprising conservation of secondary structure between mammalian APH and APH from Aeropyrum pernix K1, especially in the C-terminal domain (residues 325–581) having a canonical α/β hydrolase. It is well known that α/β hydrolase superfamily members have low sequence identity but similar function [33]. 
PMC4394528	1VE7	Results	PDBe	False		The starting model of APH has been derived from 2.7 Å resolution crystal structure of a protein (PDB code 1VE7) [9]. 	The 3D structures of chlorpyrifosmethyl oxon and dichlorvos were download from ChemSpider database (Figure 3a,b) and optimized at the B3LYP-6-31G* level by using Gaussian 09 software [38]. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) orbit of chlorpyrifosmethyl oxon and dichlorvos was generated by Gaussian view 5.07 (Figure 3c,d) [40], which indicated that the chlorine substituent group was the active center of the two inhibitors. 
PMC4452272	3J6E	Methods	PDBe	False	The recent structures for GMPCPP and GDP bound MTs at resolutions of 4.7 and 4.9 Å, respectively [15], represented an excellent starting point for building the models presented here. 	The 3×3 lattice PDB structures of 3J6E (with GMPCPP) and 3J6F (with GDP) were processed using MOE software [35] by the addition of hydrogens and prediction of ionization states. 	The central tubulin dimer of the 3×3 lattice in each case was separated and was repaired by the addition of missing residues (Residue 1 in β-tubulin and residues 1,39 to 48, 440 in α-tubulin) from the PDB structure 1TUB [36], using MOE. We modified GMPCPP into GTP since in our simulations there is no need to use the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue as hydrolysis is not expected in MD simulations.

We modified GMPCPP into GTP since in our simulations there is no need to use the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue as hydrolysis is not expected in MD simulations. Next, for both GTP and GDP systems, the repaired tubulin was superimposed over the 13 tubulin dimers in the complete MT model built by Wells and Aksimentiev [24], producing a hybrid complete MT model for both systems.

PMC3326311	2W36	Results	PDBe	False	The crystallographic analysis revealed that NurA adopts an RNAseH-like fold (Figure 4A). 	The closest, functionally characterized, structural relative of NurA is endonuclease V from Thermotoga maritima (PDB id: 2W36) (33), with an rmsd of 3.0 Å over 143 Ca positions (Figure 4B). 	In the NurA crystal, two L-shaped chains dimerize in a head-to-tail fashion, via the reciprocal intertwining of helical N- and C-terminal extensions that protrude from the RNAseH domain (Figure 4C). The large surface area buried at the interface between NurA chains (∼2800 Å2/protomer) indicates that this dimeric arrangement reflects a biologically relevant, constitutive interaction. 
PMC3326311	1ZUP	Results	PDBe	False	The large surface area buried at the interface between NurA chains (∼2800 Å2/protomer) indicates that this dimeric arrangement reflects a biologically relevant, constitutive interaction. 	Our conclusion is corroborated further by the presence of a similar dimeric arrangement in the crystal structure of an RNAseH-like fold protein from T. maritima (TM1739; PDB id: 1ZUP). 	Thus, the crystallographic analysis of NurA supports our proposed stoichiometry of six HerA and two NurA subunits in the complex. Figure 4.Crystal structure of NurA.

The reason for these minor differences most likely lies in the slightly different folding of this loop in the murine structure (PDB:2JCQ) determined by Banerji et al. [10] and the human protein (PDB:1UUH) [4] used in the present study. 	Earlier, Peach et al. discovered two clusters of binding residues, one in the link module and another in the C-terminal flanking regions [8]. The former comprises residues R29, K38, and R41.

PMC3498115	1and	Results	PDBe	False	As suggested recently, eukaryotes can be divided into three monophyletic megagroups: unikonts, Archaeplastida+Rhizaria+Chromalveolata, Excavata [28], [29]. 	The phyletic distribution of the long- and short-type TPPPs and that of the partial p25alpha domain containing proteins differs from each other (Table 1and Table S1). 	The most important difference is that the short-type TPPP (and the short type p25alpha domain) is not present in unikonts, i.e., in Opisthokonta and Amoebozoa. It is also missing in T. trahens, an Apusomonadida suggested recently as a sister group to Opisthokonta [45].

(A) The residue conservation among H3 HA human isolates is mapped onto a surface representation of H3N2 A/Hong Kong/1/68 HA trimer [PDB ID: 1HGD (38)]. 	The quality score (Q-score) at every position in the protein sequence, which is a measure of residue conservation, was obtained from a multiple sequence alignment of H3 HA sequences (n = 3169) and binned. The HA stem is well conserved within a subtype. 
PMC4481277	1HGD	Results	PDBe	False	In fact, extensive conformational rearrangement of the HA stem at low pH disrupts the epitope of HA stem-directed bnAbs. 	We analyzed the interaction network within H3 HA [H3N2 A/Hong Kong/1/68, PDB ID: 1HGD (38)] using PREDBURASA, as described previously (46), to identify HA stem fragments defined by stable structural breakpoints. 	During HA protein minimization, we performed iterative calculations to identify residue fragments: 191-461, 2901-3211, and 442-1132 (included in H3HA10) within the stem domain having minimalistic interactions with the rest of HA (Figure 1B). Residues from HA1 and HA2 subunits are distinguished by subscripts 1 or 2 respectively. 
PMC4006915	1EGF	Methods	PDBe	False	Truncated SREC-I constructs were generated as follows: the amino-terminal domain including the signal peptide was amplified with SREC-I sense primer and SREC-SP-antisense (5′-GACTCTCGAG TTGATCCTTC TGCCTCCAGC CTG-3′). 	The C-terminal domain was sequentially truncated by PCR amplification using SREC-I antisense primer together with the different sense primers SREC-I-1EGF (5′-GACTCTCGAG TCCGCTGCCC GGCCCAGTAC TG-3′), SREC-I-2EGF (5′-GACTCTCGAG TTCCCGTGCG CCTGCGGCCC CC-3′), SREC-I-4EGF (5′-GACTCTCGAG CTGCCCTGCC CGGCAGGCAG CC-3′) or SREC-I-5EGF (5′-GACTCTCGAG GGACCCCTGC CCCACTGGTA CC-3′), respectively. 	The resulting PCR fragments were cloned into pGEM-T easy TA-vector system. DNA fragments containing either the signal peptide or truncated versions of SREC-I were prepared by restriction with BglII/XhoI or XhoI/EcoRI, respectively and were ligated into pEGFP-N1. 
PMC4141757	2L34	Methods	PDBe	False	This force field was improved for the polar interaction. 	The coordinates for the DAP12 dimer TM and NKG2C TM were obtained from NMR structures PDB: 2L34 and PDB: 2L35 respectively [12]. 	The assigned backbone particle for glycine (Gly) residues in the TM segments of the helices changed to atom type Na as the Na-Na pairwise interaction is semiattractive as described in the work by Psachoulia et al. [23] on GpA TM homodimerization and Chng et al. [24] on the integrins TM hetero-dimerization. This alteration is to mimic the interaction for GxxxG motif in the helices association, as the Gly backbones are exposed. 
PMC4141757	2L34	Results	PDBe	False	Coarse-Grained Simulation of Self-Assembly of DAP12-NKG2C TM Heterotrimer 	The initial structures of the DAP12 TM dimer (PDB: 2L34) and the NKG2C TM (PDB: 2L35) were obtained from the NMR structure, and subsequently placed into a preformed DPPC bilayer with a backbone distance of approximately 55 Å between the dimer and NKG2C. 	Such a significant separation between the helices ruled out an effect of inter-helix interactions at the beginning of the simulation, as the distance was much larger than the cutoff distance for electrostatic and van der Waals interactions. Three independent simulations were run for 3 µs with different sets of starting velocities.

Polar residues Asps (red) and Thrs (pink) in DAP12 dimer and Lys (cyan) in the NKG2C TM are labeled. All other side chains are omitted for clarity. 
PMC4141757	2L35	Discussion	PDBe	False	Examining greater detail of the complex structure from AT-MD simulations, the resulting structure of DAP12-NKG2C trimer showed significant similarities and differences with the available NMR structure. 	Instead of facing the membrane hydrophobic core in NMR structure (PDB: 2L35) which is energetically unfavorable, both side chains of Asps in DAP12 oriented toward the interface of the trimer complex. 	To decrease electrostatic repulsion between both Asps of the DAP12 dimer, both chains of DAP12 dimer shifted away and moved slightly vertical to facilitate the formation of two salt bridges between both Asps and Lys. These two stable salt bridges were further proven from the distances between each DAP12 Asp and NKG2C Lys, which were equally as close to approximately 0.5 nm and lower than the distance between both Asps of the DAP12 dimer. 
PMC5856746	3OGK	Results	PDBe	False	To rationalise the observed generally detrimental impact of variation of CMA to L-Ile (and the majority of other amino acids), we compared the docking of 1 and 16 (Fig. 4). 	Docking calculations were performed against the binding site of subunit B from PDB51 structure 3OGK50, using the programme Glide52,53 in “standard precision” mode. 	In this approach, the receptor was treated as rigid, while ligands were docked with full conformational flexibility, including sampling of ring conformations, and an additional energy penalty was included to discourage formation of non-planar amide bonds. Following the initial docking, the five highest-scoring poses for each ligand were identified using the Glide “docking score”, a metric that accounts for both the ligand-receptor molecular mechanics interaction energy and the ligand strain energy: these five poses were then subjected to a full force-field minimisation, with the resulting, minimised, poses re-scored and only the single highest-scoring docked pose for each ligand retained for analysis.

PMC3531626	1v4s	Results	PDBe	False	In the crystal structures of human and yeast hexokinases, the hydroxyl group of this conserved Thr interacts with the α-phosphate of ATP [21,23,24], and a Thr→Met substitution in hGK is inferred to eliminate this important contact (see the in silico studies below). 	According to the coordinates of the closed (Glc-bound) conformation of WT hGK [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID 1v4s], the T228M mutation is predicted to be destabilizing, as measured by the free energy of thermal unfolding (ΔΔG = −4.07 kcal·mol−1) and the free energy of folding (ΔΔG = 0.85 kcal·mol−1). 	However, the far-UV CD spectrum was very similar, if not identical, to that of WT hGK (Fig. S1), and no significant differences in the apparent Tm values (on thermal unfolding) of WT hGK (Fig. 1) and the mutant protein (data not shown) were observed. 
PMC3531626	1v4t	Results	PDBe	False	In silico dynamic and conformational effects of ATP binding 	In the MD simulations, the starting crystal structure (PDB ID 1v4t) of the ligand-free super-open conformation was modified to include the 23 missing residues (Glu157–Asn179) in a surface loop structure (see Experimental procedures). 	The Cα rmsd value for the modelled structure and the crystal structure was ∼ 2.3 Å when the Glu157–Asn179 loop residues were not included. From the computed B-factor values (Figs 5A and S2B), the region that fluctuates the most is Glu157–Asn179, consistent with the observed disorder in the crystal structure. 
PMC3531626	1v4t	Methods	PDBe	False	Modelling of the hGK apoenzyme in the super-open conformation 	The initial coordinates of the hGK apoenzyme were taken from the X-ray crystal structure solved at 3.4 Å resolution (PDB ID 1v4t) [31]. 	As the coordinates of a highly flexible loop structure, comprising residues Glu157–Asn179, were not fully resolved, we refined this crystal structure computationally. Initial coordinates for the 23 missing amino acids were taken from the structure of the binary glucose–hGK complex (PDB ID 1v4s) [including a GK activator (GKA) (compound A)] [31]. 
PMC3531626	1v4s	Methods	PDBe	False	As the coordinates of a highly flexible loop structure, comprising residues Glu157–Asn179, were not fully resolved, we refined this crystal structure computationally. 	Initial coordinates for the 23 missing amino acids were taken from the structure of the binary glucose–hGK complex (PDB ID 1v4s) [including a GK activator (GKA) (compound A)] [31]. 	The dihedral angle of the peptide bond of Gly170 was adjusted so that the terminal amino acids were in an optimal position for filling the gap in the apoenzyme. Insertion of the missing residues was followed by energy minimization and 3-ns MD simulation (allowing only the inserted residues to move). 
PMC3531626	1v4s	Methods	PDBe	False	Structure modelling and MD simulations 	The binary hGK–Glc complex (PDB ID 1v4s) [including a GKA (compound A)] was structurally aligned with the modelled structure of the complete hGK apoenzyme by applying the combinatorial extension method as implemented in the ce software [49]. 	Coordinates for glucose were extracted from the binary complex, and saved together with the hGK apoenzyme coordinates to construct an initial model of glucose bound to the super-open conformation. Furthermore, the coordinates of human hexokinase type I in complex with AMP-PNP (PDB ID 1qha) were aligned with our model to build the initial model for ATP-bound super-open hGK, and with the coordinates of the binary complex with Glc (PDB ID 1v4s) to generate starting coordinates for the ternary complex. 
PMC3531626	1qha	Methods	PDBe	False	Coordinates for glucose were extracted from the binary complex, and saved together with the hGK apoenzyme coordinates to construct an initial model of glucose bound to the super-open conformation. 	Furthermore, the coordinates of human hexokinase type I in complex with AMP-PNP (PDB ID 1qha) were aligned with our model to build the initial model for ATP-bound super-open hGK, and with the coordinates of the binary complex with Glc (PDB ID 1v4s) to generate starting coordinates for the ternary complex. 	These procedures provided us with the following four structural models: model 1, hGK super-open conformation (including coordinates for the Glu157–Asn179 loop); model 2, hGK super-open conformation with inserted Glc; model 3, hGK super-open conformation with inserted ATP; and model 4, hGK ternary complex with Glc and ATP. Coordinates for all four models were relaxed by MD simulation in explicit water. 
PMC3531626	1v4t	Methods	PDBe	False	Each job was distributed over 32 CPUs, and the average computation time was 11.5 h·ns−1. 	By use of the crystal structure of the super-open (PDB ID 1v4t) and the closed (Glc and GKA-bound) (PDB ID 1v4s) forms, two structure-based methods were used for the estimation of the free energy of thermal unfolding [51] and the folding free energy [52] of hGK mutants. 	The dyndom program [30] was used to determine dynamic domains and connecting residues involved in hinge bending motions on binding of Glc and ATP to the super-open conformation of hGK. Structural images were generated with pymol, version 1.0 [53]. icm-pro [54] was used to analyse the resulting complexes after MD simulations and to calculate the contact area of residues interacting with Glc and ATP presented in Table S1. 
PMC6278250	3OU6	Methods	PDBe	False	Structures that displayed ambiguous electron density for the ligands were omitted from the survey. 	For the structure of the DhpI phosphonate O-methyltransferase (accession code 3OU6.pdb), the AdoMet molecules were remodeled in the electron density maps using the real space refinement and geometry tools in Coot. 	The remodeled AdoMet coordinates were then used to measure the tetrel bond geometries (Table 1). Finally, in cases where two or more structures of a given methyltransferase possess the same tetrel bond donor, such as interactions involving water molecules and the COMT/AdoMet/DNC/Mg2+ complexes, only the highest resolution structure of the wild type enzyme is reported in Table 1. 
PMC6056861	2HB0	Results	PDBe	False	Epitope mapping of lead anti-CfaE HuMAbs. 	To define the antibody-binding epitope, putative antibody-antigen interaction models were established based on a previously resolved CfaE structure (PDB ID 2HB0) and the lead HuMAb sequences using an antibody modeling program, BioLuminate (Schrodinger). 	This software suite develops models of antibody structures from their sequences, followed by computational docking to identify high-confidence antibody-antigen complex models. Based on these models, the software identified potential residues critical for the binding interaction. 
PMC6056861	2HB0	Discussion	PDBe	False	Mutations of the arginine residues result in a complete loss of binding activity of ETEC to host cells (18). 	Putative antibody-antigen interaction models were established utilizing the sequences of CfaE (PDB ID 2HB0) and the anti-CfaE HuMAbs with the aid of an antibody modeling program (BioLuminate; Schrödinger). 	A set of residues predicted to be important for the binding interaction based on the top-ranked model were selected for experimental alanine scanning and were confirmed to be energetically critical using ELISA. HuMAbs 68-51 and 68-97, the antibodies with the highest in vitro functional activity, were found to bind directly to Arg67 (part of the putative receptor binding domain). 
PMC5879690	2D0T	Article	PDBe	False	(Compound 1 is BMS-978587, 2 is BMS-986205, and 3 is BMS-116.) Both inhibitors bound in a manner that displaced the heme cofactor, with each occupying different, although overlapping, space in the vacated heme pocket (Figs. S4 and S5). 	Remarkably, the overall structure of IDO1 bound to each inhibitor was largely unperturbed compared with a heme-containing IDO1 structure (0.61 and 0.44 Å rmsd from 2D0T for cocrystal structures with 1 and 3, respectively). 	The carboxylate of 1 forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone amide of Ala-264 and with His-346, which ordinarily coordinates with the heme iron on the proximal side. Binding of 1 also led to a shift in the flexible loop made of residues 260–265, an event previously observed with the binding of phenylimidazole (40). 
PMC2118261	2EYR	Methods	PDBe	False	Water molecules were included in the model if they were within hydrogen-bonding distance to chemically reasonable groups, appeared in F o − F c maps contoured at 3.5σ, and had a B-factor of <60 Å2.

The TCR with the best fit over CD1d/α-GalCer was LC13 (PDB code: 1MI5) and so the Cα domain of LC13 was used to superpose NKT12 in the final CD1d–α-GalCer–NKT12 model. 	NKT12 was adjusted manually using the program “O” to promote a better fit for our proposed model. Online supplemental material. 
PMC5390498	3Man	Article	PDBe	False	It is important to note that not all glycoproteins require the calnexin cycle to fold correctly. 	The Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 glycan exists in a dynamic equilibrium between two structures, a major and a minor conformer for the Glcα1–3Manα linkage [56]. 	Modelling of the binding of Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 to calnexin suggests that it is the minor conformer that is recognised by calnexin. This may be one of the mechanisms for controlling the rate of recruitment of proteins into the calnexin/calreticulin chaperone system and enabling proteins that do not use this particular quality control mechanism for folding to bypass the system. 
PMC5395157	2QAR	Introduction	PDBe	False	This mutated form (V80E) offers attractive features that can be exploited for use as a crystallization chaperone, and it has previously been demonstrated that TelSAM is indeed a promising crystallization chaperone [34]. 	These previous experiments demonstrated that: (1) TelSAM protein fusions did not hinder protein expression or folding, and a number of crystals were obtained, (2) The pH trigger worked as expected, and importantly (3) the tandem repeat of two TelSAM domains adopted the intended structure (PDB code 2QAR). 	Specifically, the fusion of two TelSAM domains maintained the helical polymeric nature with fewer units for each repeat turn. Thus, instead of 60° degrees rotation per unit, 120° degrees rotation per unit was obtained, and the 65 screw symmetry was transformed into 32 screw symmetry. 
PMC5395157	2FU4	Introduction	PDBe	False	The N-terminal domain of FUR (n-FUR; residues 1 to 83) was shown to be monomeric in solution, and yet formed dimers in the crystal structure [40]. 	These n-FUR dimers were mediated by cadmium ions (PDB code: 2FU4). 	Therefore, the fusion of TTT with n-FUR would be expected to be soluble at high pH and in the absence of cadmium. A flexible linker was used to connect the n-FUR domain to TTT, in order to allow the n-FUR domain to sample many orientations and select a favorable position without restricting the orientation of the 2-fold axis (Fig 1B). 
PMC5395157	1JI7	Methods	PDBe	False	The data was processed to 2.3 Å using the program HKL2000 [41]. 	Phases were obtained by molecular replacement with the program Phaser [42] using TelSAM and the n-FUR domain as models (pdb codes 1JI7 and 2FU4, respectively). 	All four domains were found by Phaser [42] (S1 File and S2 File). Model building and structural comparisons were performed using COOT [43], and refinement was carried out in Refmac [44]. 
PMC5395157	1JI7	Results	PDBe	False	The structures of the TelSAM domains are also similar to the previously determined structures. 	Superposition of the TelSAM domains onto the A chain of the original TelSAM structure (pdb code 1JI7) generates the following Cα RMSD values: 0.73 Å for chain A, 0.49 Å for chain B, and 0.33 Å for chain C. The RMSD values for n-FUR domain compared to the A and B chains of the previously determined structure of n-FUR (pdb code 2FU4) are 0.88 Å, and 0.95 Å, respectively. 	The largest change for the n-FUR domain is observed at the loop consisting of residues 72–78 as shown in Fig 6. 
PMC5395157	1JI7	Results	PDBe	False	The organization of the 3TelSAM portion of the fusion achieved the expected structure, an oligomer with 180° degree rotation per unit that forms a 21 screw axis, which can also be described as one dimensional crystals or fibers. 	The observed structure for the TelSAM oligomer in this structure is similar to the original TelSAM oligomeric structure (PDB code 1JI7). 	A repeat distance of 54.8 Å is observed in this structure vs. 52.7 Å in the original TelSAM structure. The average interface surface area per monomer between the TelSAM domains is 622.8 Å2 in this structure vs. 624.8 Å2 in the original structure. 
PMC5395157	1JI7	Results	PDBe	False	In our structure, there is one molecule in the asymmetric unit, which contains three TelSAM domains. 	Similarly, three TelSAM molecules were present in the asymmetric unit in the original TelSAM structure (pdb code 1JI7). 	If the three TelSAM domains from the original structure are treated as a single molecule and compared to our structure, an overall Cα RMSD of 1.59 Å is obtained. These results indicate structural similarities between these two structures, regarding the TelSAM monomers as well as the TelSAM oligomers. 
PMC5395157	2FU4	Results	PDBe	False		The n-FUR domain attained the desired 2-fold symmetry, although not the packing interactions previously observed (PDB code: 2FU4). 	However, since the crystals were obtained in the absence of cadmium, it was apparent that the likelihood of obtaining the previously observed dimer [40] was low, and it was unclear which orientation the n-FUR domain would adopt. It is likely that the flexibility of the loops allowed the n-FUR domain to sample a variety of packing interactions and adopt a favorable orientation leading to crystal growth.

The protein data bank file (PDB: 3WI6). 	The file contains MK-2 enzyme co-crystalized with an inhibitor. All docking procedures were achieved by MOE (Molecular Operating Environment) software 10.2008 provided by chemical computing group, Canada. 
PMC5383913	3WI6	Results	PDBe	False	All the minimizations were performed with MOE until a RMSD gradient of 0.05 kcal mol−1 Å−1 with MMFF94X force field and the partial charges were automatically calculated. 	The protein data bank file (PDB:3WI6) was selected for this purpose. 	The file contains MK-2 enzyme Co-crystalized with a ligand obtained from protein data bank. The enzyme was prepared for docking studies where: (i) Ligand molecule was removed from the enzyme active site. 
PMC5492117	2P16	Discussion	PDBe	False	This complex triggers a signaling cascade, which induces severe complications. 	So, further research is required to understand the interaction between NOACs and their receptors.Fig. 3Active sites of (a) Dabigatran-thrombin (PDB accession: 4YHI) and (b) Apixaban-factor Xa (PDB accession: 2P16).

PMC6479630	3PBL	Results	PDBe	False	Homology Models of Dopamine Receptors D1R-D5R Are Stable 	The ligand-free D2-like homology models were generated using the resolved ligand-bound crystal structures of the D2R (PDBid: 6CM4) [36], D3R (PDBid: 3PBL) [37] and D4R (PDBid: 5WIU) [38] (over 90% identity). 	The 3D crystal structures of DRs are typically incomplete, lacking key regions for intracellular partner coupling such as intracellular loop 3 (ICL3). In contrast, D1-like DRs lack their own templates and therefore, the most suitable template to each DR was selected according to the percentage of similarity obtained upon sequence alignment by BLAST [40] in combination with ClustalOmega [41]. 
PMC6479630	3PBL	Results	PDBe	False	Different authors hypothesized that DRs have a secondary binding pocket (SBP) next to the OBP, which was confirmed by the resolved crystal structures together with computational analyses [37,38,59]. 	Crystal structures of D2R (PDBid: 6CM4) [36] and D3R (PDBid: 3PBL) [37] and computational data suggest that 7.43Tyr is also a crucial amino-acid for interaction in the SBP [17,36,37]. 	2.57Val was shown to form a hydrophobic pocket for antagonists like clozapine and haloperidole [57]. However, since the OBP is widely explored through experimental, computational and crystal structure data, there could be other residues important in the SBP. 
PMC6479630	3PBL	Methods	PDBe	False	The apo-DR models were generated with MODELLER 9.19 (version MODELLER 9.19, released Jul 25th, 2017) (University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA) [93]. 	For D2-like receptors we used their corresponding crystal structures as templates: the D2R complexed with risperidone (PDBid: 6CM4) [36], the D3R complexed with D2R-antagonist eticlopride, (PDBid: 3PBL) [37] or D4R complexed with D2R/D3R-antagonist nemonapride (PDBid: 5WIU) [38]. 	Depending on the sequence similarity obtained with Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST, NCBI, Rockville, MD, USA) [40] and ClustalOmega (EMBL-EBI, Cambridgeshire, UK) [41] and listed in Table 2, either D3R (for the D1R) or D4R (for the D5R) were chosen as template to model the D1-like DRs. Due to the length of the ICL3, this was cut and substituted with two or four alanine residues, for D2- and D1-like receptors.

Mambalgin-1 binding to the ASIC1a channel triggers the movement of the thumb domain, which disrupts the connecting residue pairs in the acidic pocket and results in an expanded pocket. 
PMC5986765	4FZ1	Methods	PDBe	False		The structural modeling for the cASIC1aΔNC–mambalgin-1 complex comprised rigid-body fitting of the cASIC1a extracellular domain and full-length mambalgin-1 extracted from the crystal structures (PDB code: 4FZ1 and 5DU1) into the cryo-EM density, followed by fitting of the thumb domain (residue numbers: 305–323 and 337–359) of cASIC1a in rigid-body refinement against the density map by using COOT54. 	Furthermore, docked as a rigid-body model, Finger II (residue numbers: 23–34) of mambalgin-1 was refined in real space by using COOT, including locating the loop region into density. All the figures were created by UCSF Chimera55 and PyMol. 
PMC5471200	2MTS	Results	PDBe	False	In E. coli, the nucleoid occlusion system prevents the Z ring from assembling on nucleoids, and thus the Z ring is formed between two segregated nucleoids31. 	To determine whether the Z ring-like structures of sfGFP-AtFtsZ2-2MTS localize between two segregated nucleoids in E. coli, we stained the nucleoids of E. coli WM2767 cells with DAPI (Fig. 2D): sfGFP-AtFtsZ2-2MTS formed multiple Z ring-like structures randomly at various positions over the nucleoids, suggesting that nucleoid occlusion did not function in the assembly of sfGFP-AtFtsZ2-2MTS in E. coli cells. 	However, these results indicate that if only anchored to the membrane, AtFtsZ2 per se can form Z ring-like structures in E. coli cells.Figure 2Membrane-tethered FtsZ2 forms multiple Z ring-like structures. (A) Fluorescence images of sfGFP-AtFtsZ2 tagged with 2MTS in E. coli WM1074 strain. 
PMC5471200	2MTS	Results	PDBe	False		(C) Quantification of Z ring-like structures formed by sfGFP-AtFtsZ2 with or without 2MTS in the WM1074 and WM2767 strains. 	The graph shows the percentage of cells containing >1 Z-ring-like structure. The numbers of elongated bacterial cells investigated for the quantification were 212 (WM1074/sfGFP-AtFtsZ2), 123 (WM1074/sfGFP-AtFtsZ2-2MTS), 97 (WM2767/sfGFP-AtFtsZ2), and 41 (WM2767/sfGFP-AtFtsZ2-2MTS). 
PMC5471200	2MTS	Discussion	PDBe	False	These rings are perpendicular to the membrane plane, to some degree, and resemble the Z rings immunostained in elongated bacterial cells of both thermosensitive ftsZ and ftsZ-depletion mutants42. 	Given that the bacterial cell-division machinery correctly localizes at the inter-chromosomal space, the Z ring-like structures of sfGFP-AtFtsZ2-2MTS detected over the bacterial chromosome might not be incorporated into the cell-division machinery of E. coli. 	Collectively, our results indicate that membrane-targeted AtFtsZ2 can assemble into Z ring-like structures as a filament backbone in the absence of EcFtsZ and other chloroplast division-related proteins in our bacterial expression system. The partly slanted AtFtsZ2 rings might be due to the lack of connection to the peptidoglycan machinery45. 
PMC5471200	2MTS	Discussion	PDBe	False	Bacteria feature a peptidoglycan-containing cell wall that provides rigidity to the cell and maintains the shape of each bacterium. 	Because the constricting ring of MTS-tagged AtFtsZ2 expressed in spherical P. pastoris cells has been proposed to slide along the membrane from the middle region to one end of the cell19, we suggest that the cell-wall integrity of E. coli restricts the constriction of Z ring-like structures formed by sfGFP-AtFtsZ2-2MTS in our bacterial system. 	Notably, whereas long filaments of sfGFP-AtFtsZ2 were observed only when endogenous EcFtsZ was present (Figs 1A and 2B), multiple Z ring-like structures of sfGFP-AtFtsZ2-2MTS were formed even in the EcFtsZ-depleted strain (Fig. 2B), which suggests that EcFtsZ exerts a supportive effect particularly on AtFtsZ2 filamentation ability. The long filaments detected in wild-type cells are possibly generated by bundling of EcFtsZ and AtFtsZ2 homopolymers because EcFtsZ cannot heteropolymerize with AtFtsZ219.

The long filaments detected in wild-type cells are possibly generated by bundling of EcFtsZ and AtFtsZ2 homopolymers because EcFtsZ cannot heteropolymerize with AtFtsZ219. To reconstitute the inner membrane assembly complex of the chloroplast division machinery in bacteria, it is critical to introduce other regulatory components into bacterial cells together with AtFtsZ2 and accurately evaluate their functions. 
PMC5471200	2MTS	Discussion	PDBe	False	ARC3 also interacts with AtFtsZ2 in a yeast two-hybrid system, and AtFtsZ2 filament assembly is inhibited in A. thaliana ARC3-overexpressing plants24. 	Consistently, nonbacterial ARC3 expression potently lowered the filament length of sfGFP-AtFtsZ2 and reduced the number of Z ring-like structures formed by sfGFP-AtFtsZ2-2MTS in bacterial cells (Fig. 3). 	Here, the AtFtsZ2 Z ring-like structures were forcibly tethered to the membrane by the MTS, and ARC3 strongly inhibited AtFtsZ2 filamentation, and thus the number of Z ring-like structures formed might have been reduced due to the inhibition of AtFtsZ2 filament assembly by ARC3. Notably, the cells expressing both AtFtsZ2-2MTS and ARC3 were much shorter than those expressing only AtFstZ2-2MTS were. 
PMC5471200	2MTS	Discussion	PDBe	False	In our bacterial system, ARC6 colocalized with AtFtsZ2 and drastically altered its filament morphology, from linear filaments to Z ring-like structures (Fig. 4, see Supplementary Fig. S6B). 	This Z ring-like structure formation and the membrane attachment of AtFtsZ2 strongly depended on the C-terminal ARC6-interacting sequence of AtFtsZ2, which indicates that ARC6-tethered AtFtsZ2 behaves like AtFtsZ2-2MTS, an artificial membrane-targeting protein, and assembles into multiple Z ring-like structures. 	Conversely, the Z ring-like structures formed by AtFtsZ2 and ARC6 in bacterial cells reflect the natural condition of the chloroplast Z ring, which concurrently demonstrates that ARC6 functions as a genuine membrane-anchoring partner of AtFtsZ2. Recently, ARC6 was reported to be capable of stabilizing AtFtsZ2 polymers in yeast cells independently of its Z ring-tethering function25; the stromal region of ARC6 was observed to lower the turnover rate of AtFtsZ2 polymers.

PMC3203607	2V8W	Results	PDBe	False	Using this shorter construct in the presence of the human 4E-BP1 peptide, we obtained diffraction quality crystals and determined the co-crystal structures of Ascaris eIF4E-3 with m2,2,7GTP and m7GTP (Table 3). 	The overall structures of the Ascaris m2,2,7GTP and m7GTP complexes are very similar to each other (RMSD for Cα = 0.31 Å) and to the human eIF4E-m7GTP complex structures (PDB:2V8W, RMSD for Cα = 0.79 Å) (25) (Figure 1A–C and Supplementary Figure S1C). 	The human 4E-BP1 peptide binds to the opposite surface of the protein and forms interactions with Ascaris eIF4E-3 (Figure 1A and B) almost identical to those previously observed in the human eIF4E/4E-BP complex structure (43).

PMC3203607	1XK5	Discussion	PDBe	False	The position of these two residues in the Ascaris eIF4E-3 complex structures (m7GTP or m2,2,7GTP-cap) and their lack of change on binding the two caps (Supplementary Figure S7) suggests they are not likely the key determinants of cap binding specificity. 	The only other trimethylguanosine cap-binding protein whose structure is known is snurportin1 (PDB: 1XK5) (46). 	Snurportin specifically binds the trimethylguanosine cap of snRNAs. The m2,2,7GpppG-cap-binding mechanism for snurportin1 (PDB:1XK5) is different from that observed in Ascaris eIF4E-3 (Supplementary Figure S8). 
PMC3203607	1XK5	Discussion	PDBe	False	Snurportin specifically binds the trimethylguanosine cap of snRNAs. 	The m2,2,7GpppG-cap-binding mechanism for snurportin1 (PDB:1XK5) is different from that observed in Ascaris eIF4E-3 (Supplementary Figure S8). 	The hypermethylated base of the cap is stacked with an aromatic group (Trp107) of snurportin and the second base forms the third residue in a stacked sandwich. Consistent with this structure, snurportin binds a dinucleotide cap (m2,2,7GpppG) with a 10-fold higher affinity than a mononucleotide cap (46).

PMC4086066	2bw3	Article	PDBe	False	Protein families DUF659 and DUF4371 are linked by a marginal homology detected with the profile–profile alignment algorithm FFAS03. 	Both families also show a weak similarity to the catalytic (DNA-binding) domain from hermes DNA transposase (PDB ID: 2bw3), but they currently do not have a functional annotation in the Pfam database. 	PubServer searches seeded with sequences of members of any of these families reveal several publications describing individual proteins as transposases. Based on this information, one can hypothesize that these two protein families most likely consist of DNA-binding domains of transposases.

PMC2847147	1WUJ	Discussion	PDBe	False	In addition, each of the CN− ligands at the iron can potentially form up to two hydrogen bonds, as indicated in Fig. 9, whereas the CO ligand is surrounded by more hydrophobic residues and is thus not hydrogen-bonded. 	It is well known that the environment of such iron ligands greatly affects the redox properties of the central metal [59, 60].Fig. 9Proposed structure of the active site of the [NiFe] hydrogenase from D. vulgaris Miyazaki F in the Ni-SL state (based on the structure of Ni-B; Protein Data Bank entry 1WUJ).

PMC6282759	2px0	Discussion	PDBe	False	Bange et al. (2007) reported that FlhF of B. subtilis forms a stable homodimer structure in the presence of GTP, and that the G domains form a composite active site harboring two GTP molecules. 	Differences in the predicted protein structures of FlhF and FlhF(T368A) are presented, respectively, in Fig. 6A and B, which are based on models of the C. jejuni FlhF protein calculated from the template flagellar biosynthesis protein FlhF‐ 2px0.1 of B. subtilis (Bange et al., 2007). 	Substitution of the threonine residue with alanine prevents the formation of the hydrogen bond between L287 and T368 that tethers two adjacent β‐sheets that flank a returning loop that constitute the G3 domain. The effect of this is likely to destabilize GTP binding, and as a consequence the formation of the functional homodimer. 
PMC2865515	1L2Y	Methods	PDBe	False	BK and AN have no determined secondary structure and all of the calculations started with an all-trans backbone and side-chain conformation. 	Instead, the Trp-cage initial structure was obtained by a 20-ns MD simulation in aqueous solution at ambient conditions based on the NMR structure number 1 deposited in the protein data bank (PDB code: 1L2Y) [78] (see Text S1). 	The most probable protonation state in water [78] was chosen. For the chosen set of protonation sites, all of the charge states which feature more than one protomer were taken into account.

The allosteric mechanisms of PDZ2 have been the subject of a number of studies with various residues identified as key allosteric residues.[42, 47, 61] Initial crystal structures for the unbound and bound states with RA-GEF2 peptide (EQVSAV) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with IDs 3LNX and 3LNY, respectively.[82] PDZ2 structures in both 3LNX and 3LNY contain 94 residues.

In Fig. 7, we have utilized the crystal structure coordinates of the Env trimer (PDB - 4NCO) to highlight the interaction between the gp120 C1, C5, and ecto-gp41 domains (residues 1–126). 	For this model, the bnAb PGT122 is hidden, viral membrane would be on top, and CD4/CCR5 would engage at the bottom of each view (Fig. 7a). The Env trimer “core” containing the close association between C1, C5, and ecto-gp41 domains of each gp120 subunit is shown by turning the structure 90° clockwise (Fig. 7b) and by being stripped of all other gp120 residues (Fig. 7c).

This figure is derived from the recent 4.7 Å crystal structure of a soluble, cleaved BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 trimer in complex with a potent bnAb, PGT122 [37] (PDB - 4NCO). 	The interaction between the gp120 C1, C5, and ecto-gp41 domains is highlighted. For this model, the bnAb PGT122 is hidden, viral membrane would be on top, and CD4/CCR5 would engage at the bottom of each view.

The overall locations of domains, including the ufd, are generally similar in structures of human Aos1-Uba2-MgATP (also called Sae1-Sae2-MgATP, 1Y8Q.pdb), Aos1-Uba2-Sumo-MgATP (1Y8R.pdb), and Aos1-Uba2-Sumo∼AMSN (a chemical modification mimicking Sumo C-terminal adenylation, 3KYC.pdb) [19], [20]. 	The ufd is also in a similar relative orientation in a recent structure of human Aos1-Uba2∼Sumo∼AVSN, which mimics the tetrahedral intermediate during Uba2's catalytic cysteine's attack on the C-terminally adenylated Sumo (3KYD.pdb), so only the comparison to Aos1-Uba2-Sumo∼AMSN is shown in  Figure 4A .

Initial models for the complex were obtained by performing molecular replacement in the P1 space group using PHASER [54], after searching for 4 copies of the structure of yeast Ubc9 (2GJD.pdb, Chain A) [40] and of a polyAla model of human Uba2 residues 449–546 from 1Y8Q.pdb, Chain C [19]. 	One of the 4 complexes from this solution was subsequently used as a search model to find two Uba2ufd–Ubc9 complexes per asymmetric unit in P21. The model was built using Coot [55] and refined using TLS parameters in REFMAC [56].

Molecular docking was carried out using Glide module[25] to find out the possible binding conformations and it also provides information to understand the interactions of LOX receptor-antagonist. The protein was minimized by applying an OPLS-2005 force field and progressively weaker restraints were applied only to nonhydrogen atoms, for Glide calculations. 
PMC4668001	2G4M	Introduction	PDBe	True	Structural details of the insulin molecule. 	(A) The structure of the insulin (PDB ID: 2G4M). 	A-Chain (orange); B-chain N-terminal (residues F1–G8) (red), B-chain α-helix (residues S9–C19) (black), B-chain C-terminal (residues G20–T30) (blue). The colored spheres represent the Cα atoms of the first and last residues of the A and B-chains. (B) The new ribbon representation shows the hydrophobic core of insulin, comprising the residues F24, L15, Y26, L11, V12, G8 (side chains shown in cyan), I2A and V3A (side chains shown in green). 
PMC4668001	2G4M	Methods	PDBe	False		In the MD simulations, we used a crystal structure of insulin with a resolution of 1.8 Å (PDB ID: 2G4M [29]). 	All simulations were constructed using the VMD software following the same protocol. The structure of insulin was solvated with approximately 3500 water molecules. 
PMC4668001	2G4M	Introduction	PDBe	True	The first five MD simulations have a duration of 120 ns, while the sixth one 90 ns. 	The RMSDs are given with respect to the crystal structure 2G4M. 	
PMC4668001	2G4M	Results	PDBe	False	Visual inspection of the long MD simulations of WT insulin shows that it stays predominantly in the closed conformation and the BC-CT makes only occasional excursions away from the B-chain α-helix. 	The MD simulations of insulin in the closed state were validated by comparing with the corresponding crystal structure 2G4M. 	As shown in Table 1, the average distances between the Cα atoms of BC-CT and B-chain α-helix agree with the experimental values within 1 Å. We note that the fluctuations in distances increase from F24 to T30, which points to an effective interaction that diminishes with the distance from the hinge towards the C-terminal. As discussed in Fig 1B, the side chains of F24 and Y26 contribute to the formation of the hydrophobic core, which is responsible for maintaining insulin in the closed state. Table 2 lists the strongest hydrophobic interactions involving the F24 and Y26 side chains and compares the average distances obtained from the MD simulations with the experimental values. 
PMC2658887	1B6C	Methods	PDBe	False		The crystal structure of the kinase domain of the type I TGF-beta receptor (PDB code 1B6C) in complex with FKBP12 [9] was used as a template to model ACVR1. 	The alignment was performed with the program ICM [17] and used for homology modelling of the native ACVR1 sequence using the same software. The resulting model was then energy minimised and side-chain movements were allowed to resolve clashes. 
PMC2658887	1B6C	Methods	PDBe	False	To date there are no available crystal structures for the kinase domain of ACVR1. 	To understand the structural implications of the new mutations, we built homology models of the native and mutated ACVR1 kinase domains using the closest available structure of the TGF-beta receptor (PDB code 1B6C). 	Importantly, this TGF-beta receptor domain shares the same mechanism of regulation and is highly similar in sequence to ACVR1 (66% sequence identity) with no insertion or deletions in the aligned sequence. Structural models must be interpreted carefully as disease mutations can alter the wild-type structure. 
PMC5105669	4K70	Methods	PDBe	False	Template-based modeling of the first 570 amino acids of the HSV-1 UL37 protein was conducted by homology modeling with Clustal Omega (40) and Modeler (41). 	The X-ray crystal structure of PRV UL37 (PDB code 4K70) (38) was used as the modeling template. 	The amino acid sequence of the HSV-1 UL37 protein (NCBI RefSeq accession no. YP_009137112.1) was used for a multiple-sequence alignment (MSA) between 20 different strains of alphaherpesviruses, including HSV-2 and PRV. The MSA was constructed with the Clustal Omega sequence profile alignment (40) server provided by the Max Planck Institute (http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/clustalw/). 
PMC5521548	3TUP	Introduction	PDBe	False	Such global repositioning of the domains is tRNA modulated and governed by long range electrostatic interactions.20, 21 Two basic conformations for HsmtPheRS, have revealed themselves: a “closed” inactive unbound state and an “open” active state upon tRNA binding.19 A transition, however, between two basic conformations, happens through the various intermediate (probably short‐live) conformations. 	Transitions from the active “open” (A) to inactive “closed” (B) conformations of HsmtPheRS upon complex formation with tRNAPhe are shown with the tRNAPhe molecule depicted by “worm” representation.12, 18 PDB ID of the HsmtPheRS complexed with tRNAPhe is 3TUP. 	To explore the effects of mutations on the functional activity of HsmtPheRS in vitro, we performed steady‐state kinetic measurements for both the Phe activation reactions and tRNAPhe aminoacylation of WT and mutant enzymes. To gain an insight into the problem we solved the crystal structures of four HsmtPheRS mutants.

By contrast, Tau phosphorylated at the KXGS motifs inside the repeat domain (epitope 12E8, pSer262 + pSer356) was increased in MB-treated animals (Figure 6).

PMC4425867	1200000000	Supplementary material	PDBe	False	Expression of Tau4RDΔK280 in N2a cells is induced by addition of doxycycline (1 μg/ml) (Tet-on system) as shown by the pan-Tau antibody K9JA. 	Monomeric and oligomeric Tau is phosphorylated at KXGS motifs inside the repeat domain as shown by Ab 12E8 (epitope pSer262, pSer356). 	Incubation of N2a cells with increasing concentrations of MB (25nM, 50nM or 100nM) for 4 days results in a dose-dependent increase of oligomeric Tau species and a subsequent decrease of monomeric Tau4RDΔK280. Monomeric Tau includes the entire Tau repeat domain as well as truncated fragments (F2, F3). 
PMC4005737	2B4C	Methods	PDBe	False	Three-dimensional mapping and contact maps 	The core structure used for mapping the positive selected residues corresponds to the X-ray structure of CD4-bound JR-FL gp120 (Protein Data Bank [PDB] ID: 2B4C) [45]. 	This structure was chosen because it provides the spatial representation of V3, and is therefore useful for the identification of the PS residues in V3 (besides those in C3 and C4) in the appropriate structural context. Moreover, the chosen structure derives from a strain that has the same co-receptor usage as the majority of the isolates hereby characterized.

The MACV GP-1 structure was previously published (PDB accession number 2WFO [48]) and residues forming contacts with human TfR1 were determined with the PISA EBI server [80] using PDB accession number 3KAS [49].

PMC4431211	2DCF	Methods	PDBe	False	The indoor control fields consist of the 3D and 2D control fields (2DCF and 3DCF) and the tree-axis turntables, as shown in Figure 5a. 	A total of 400 high-accuracy control points are located in the various planes in the 3DCF, while a kind of rigid structure located at the top of the optical platform (OP) constitutes the 2DCF, as shown in Figure 5b,c. 	Using the forward intersection and indirect elevation methods [30], all the points in the 3DCF and 2DCF are surveyed by 2'-transit (i.e., the accuracy is 2'). The precision of the control points can be assessed according to the precision of the transit, survey distance and other aspects [30]. 
PMC4226559	3J35	Methods	PDBe	False	Steric and electrostatic analysis of the interaction of PLA2-CB with the lipid bilayer of the DENV envelope 	The DENV external structural model was obtained from RCSB Protein Data Bank under the PDB ID: 3J35 [39]. 	This model was developed by Zhang et al. [40] by electron microscopy analysis and reflects the structure of DENV under physiological temperature (37°C), in accordance with the experiments conducted in this work. We used this electron microscopy structure as a model to reconstruct a more refined version of the virus structure, fitting 180 high-resolution copies of DENV-2 E protein (PDB ID: 1OAN) [41].

We used this electron microscopy structure as a model to reconstruct a more refined version of the virus structure, fitting 180 high-resolution copies of DENV-2 E protein (PDB ID: 1OAN) [41]. 	The DENV membrane patch used to reproduce the 3-fold pore environment in the electrostatic analyses was assembled with the CHARMM-GUI program [42] and further thermalized with the GROMACS Molecular Dynamics package [43]; the lipid composition follows that described by Zhang et al.

PMC4226559	2QOG	Methods	PDBe	False	The DENV membrane patch used to reproduce the 3-fold pore environment in the electrostatic analyses was assembled with the CHARMM-GUI program [42] and further thermalized with the GROMACS Molecular Dynamics package [43]; the lipid composition follows that described by Zhang et al. [44]. 	The resolved PLA2-CB crystal structure was obtained under PDB ID: 2QOG [45]. 	Because this model is built as a tetramer, we extracted one monomer (including the Ca2+ ion) with software Visual Molecular Dynamics – VMD [46], completing the few missing atoms from residues Trp31 and Pro74 with the aid of the PyMol program [47], and finally performed an adjustment with a potential energy minimization of the side chains with the GROMACS Molecular Dynamics package [43] using the IBM BlueGene/P supercomputer hosted at Rice University. For the all-atom MD with the explicit solvent [TIP3P water model [48] constrained by the SETTLE algorithm [49]], we used the CHARMM36 force-field [50] adapted to GROMACS by Piggot and colleagues, 2012 [51], with the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) treatment for the electrostatic interactions among the atoms, with a cut-off of non-bonded interactions of 1.0 nm. 
PMC2745878	1lia	Methods	PDBe	False	An averaged helical template similar to that described in Terwilliger (2001 ▶) was used to identify helical segments in a map. 	This template consists of the average electron density calculated from a collection of α-helical segments six amino acids in length (from phycoerythrin; PDB code 1lia; Chang et al., 1996 ▶; Berman et al., 2000 ▶), all superimposed on a standard α-helical segment (from myoglobin; PDB code 1a6m; Vojtechovsky et al., 1999 ▶; Berman et al., 2000 ▶). 	The template included all points within 4 Å of a main-chain or Cβ atom in the standard segment. The template was calculated at a resolution of 3 Å. An averaged β-strand template was constructed in the same fashion, except that the segments used in the template were four amino acids long. 
PMC2745878	1bav	Methods	PDBe	False	In this way, a short helical segment that is identified can potentially be extended in either direction. 	A second library consisted of 17 β-strand segments from four to nine amino acids long from chain A of carboxypeptidase A (PDB code 1bav; Massova et al., 1996 ▶; Berman et al., 2000 ▶), superimposed on the standard β-strand fragment in the same way as for the helical segments. 	The third and fourth libraries consisted of segments of protein structure three amino acids in length chosen to represent all three-amino-acid segments in a set of refined protein structures [chosen arbitrarily from non-redundant PDB files (Hobohm et al., 1993 ▶) with R factors of 20% or lower and resolution 1.8 Å or better]. The two libraries differed in that one contained all main-chain and Cβ atoms of a tripeptide and the other contained the Cα, C and O of one residue plus the following two full residues. 
PMC6465985	3red	Results	PDBe	False	In such cases, it is better not to build trees because the electron density is usually relatively poor and carbohydrates were sometimes built into the density of the missing main chain. 	In 14 cases, the built carbohydrate residues seemed correct but the sequence may be wrong; 10 of these 14 cases were found in PDB entry 3red (C. 	
PMC6465985	1mql	Discussion	PDBe	False	At present, we have only dealt with links from asparagine to the first carbohydrate residue in the glycosylation tree. 	This may be extended to also generate links between two carbohydrate residues further in the chain, which would potentially improve the refinement of glycosylation trees such as in PDB entry 1mql (Ha et al., 2003 ▸; Fig. 4 ▸). 	However, automatically generating such links leads to new problems since unlinked carbohydrate residues are often too far away from one another. If multiple LINK records are then generated to pull them together, this leads to incorrect conformations and to bonds that are too long.

After flipping the side chain of AsnA24, four carbohydrate residues can be built at this position; there is also partial density for a fifth mannose, but this was not built. 
PMC6465985	3d12	Figure	PDBe	True	After flipping the side chain of AsnA24, four carbohydrate residues can be built at this position; there is also partial density for a fifth mannose, but this was not built. 	Middle: glycosylation-tree rebuilding at AsnA529 in PDB entry 3d12 (Xu et al., 2008 ▸). 	The seven carbohydrate moieties in the PDB entry (and indicated in the figure) are carbohydrate residues that are not commonly found in N-glycosylation, which can now be replaced automatically with the correct residues. It may be possible that the wrong residue names have arisen as an unwanted side effect from PDB remediation efforts (Henrick et al., 2008 ▸).

Glycosylation tree at AsnG165 in PDB entry 1mql. 	The LINK records between the different carbohydrate residues are missing, causing the carbohydrate residues to be pushed apart owing to van der Waals restraints. This is exacerbated by the leaving ‘O1’ atoms that were not removed when the carbohydrate tree was built.

The structure of β-CD was extracted from a crystal structure from the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 1z0n) while HP-β-CD was built by adding hydroxypropyl to β-CD. 	The three-dimensional (3D) structure of CDs were generated using ChemBio3D Ultra 12.0 (CambridgeSoft, Cambridge, MA, USA) program and then optimized with semi empirical (PM3) energy minimization.

PMC3957475	1ATP	Results	PDBe	True	Interactions between the HRD motif residues to both ASCH Glu217 and P+1 loop Thr223 residues, including communication between the αEF Glu230 to the C-lobe Arg303, lock the typically flexible activation segment in place, and this creates a platform for substrate binding. 	Modelling of the substrate peptide (grey ribbon) and ATP-MgCl2 (pink stick and ball) from the PKA structure (PDB code 1ATP) into GAK suggests a suitable pocket for accommodation of a substrate peptide for phosphorylation. 	
PMC3957475	1ATP	Results	PDBe	False	The latter provides a cross communication between the activation segment and the C-lobe in an active state [36]. 	Superimposition of the PKA–ATP–peptide complex (PDB code 1ATP) revealed that a docking groove created within the active site of GAK would be suitable to accommodate a peptide substrate (Figure 3D), which therefore suggests that this conformation of the activation segment may serve as an active conformation of the enzyme to enable peptide binding. 	However, the tight interaction of NbGAK_1 with the upper lobe induces structural changes that distort slightly the catalytic spine alignment and the upper lobe itself, which also affects the conserved salt bridge between Lys69 and αC Glu85 increasing the optimal distance of 3 Å seen in the GAK–NbGAK_4 structure to a distance of 4 Å (Supplementary Figure S5A at http://www.biochemj.org/bj/459/bj4590059add.htm). To assess the effect of the bound Nbs on the activity of GAK, we performed in vitro kinase assays using histone H1 as a substrate [37] (Figure 4A).

The natural S1P agonist was docked into the S1P1 receptor using the Autodock Vina tool42. All docking solutions were visually inspected and the poses in which the zwitterionic head-group interacts with N1012.60, R1203.28 and E1213.29 in a similar way as the co-crystalized ML056 antagonist were energy minimized.

In parallel, an “active” conformation of S1P1 was modeled from the crystal structure of a nanobody-stabilized active state of the β2-adrenergic receptor (PDB id 3P0G)23, by changing the conformation of the intracellular part of the TM helices of S1P1 (Ala1303.38 – Trp1684.50, Ser2165.53 – Ile2666.45, Ser3047.46 – Leu330CTerm) for the active conformation of β2- (Ala1193.38 – Trp1584.50, Ile2145.53 – Thr2836.45, Ser3197.46 – Leu342CTerm) (see Supplementary Fig. S2 for details). 	Modeller 9.12 was used to build homology models of “active” S1P2 (33% of sequence identity and 47% of sequence similarity), S1P4 (26% and 41%) and S1P5 (29% and 43%) subtypes using the constructed structure of “active” S1P1 as a template.

In order to obtain the position of palmitate, the structure of rat carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (PDB ID: 4EP9, 2.03 Å) was structurally superimposed to a CPT1C molecular model with PYMOL (PyMOL), resulting in 1.106 Å of RMSD. The final structure of CPT1C in complex with CoA, carnitine and palmitate was energy minimized.

PMC4265395	1LDG	Methods	PDBe	False	In addition, the partial charges were calculated by single-point energy calculations using the RM1 method [36]. 	The crystallographic structures of PfLDH and HssLDH were downloaded from the Protein Data Bank [37] under the codes 1LDG (resolution 1.74 Å and R factor = 0.197) and 1IOZ (resolution 2.10 Å and R factor = 0.179), respectively. 	The program Molegro Virtual Docker® (MVD) [38] was used for the docking studies, and the methodology used was validated by re-docking. To observe possible interactions of the ligands with the solvent present in the crystal, 35 water molecules from a cavity approximately 10 Å in size were considered for the calculations with PfLDH, whereas 54 molecules were considered for the calculations with HssLDH. 
PMC5519036	2WHO	Results	PDBe	False	In some preliminary regular MD simulations at lower salt content, the inter-monomers twist angle was significantly reduced (see Methods section and S9 Fig). 	However, the inter-monomer twist angles in the DF/HRE-MD simulations were consistent with the twist angles observed in the available crystal structures of 14-3-3ζ dimers (~180 ± 3° calculated from the pdb entries 2WHO and 1A4O) and yielded a better agreement with SAXS measurements (S14 Fig). 	
PMC5519036	2WH0	Methods	PDBe	False	Generated starting coordinates 	The starting coordinates of the presented 14-3-3ζ models were generated based on the same crystal structure (pdb code: 2WH0) in order to prevent structural changes due to different protein starting structures. 	The crystal structure 2WH0 represents the dimeric 14-3-3ζ in complex with protein kinase C ε peptide fragments [8] (p1h, p1t). The structure of the C-RAF proto oncogene peptide fragments [9] (p2h, p2t) bound to 14-3-3ζ was taken from the structure of their co-crystal (pdb code: 4FJ3), after aligning the 14-3-3ζ dimer structures with 2WH0.

The missing parts of the 14-3-3ζ protein, including the C-terminal tail, were added using Modeller version 9v8 [21]. The phosphopeptide structure was energy minimized in vacuum to avoid clashes with the 2WH0 protein atoms.

The phosphopeptide structure was energy minimized in vacuum to avoid clashes with the 2WH0 protein atoms. 	The 14-3-3ζ dimer model without ligands was constructed based on the 2WH0 crystal structure where all peptide atoms were removed. The sequence of the complete peptides, as well as the head and tail fragments are indicated in Fig 1.

The_SAXS curves were calculated using the software Crysol (1), and compared to the experimental SAXS curve (exp) after ensemble averaging.

PMC6429233	4MR7	Results	PDBe	False	Structure-based pharmacophore models (e-Pharmacophores) for an agonist-induced VFT conformation (Figure 2A) and antagonist-induced VFT conformation (Figure 2B) were generated using the Phase program [35]. 	A library of 441 unique fragments were mapped to the binding pocket of the antagonist-induced (inactive) VFT conformation (PDB ID: 4MR7) and the agonist-induced (active) VFT conformation (PDB ID: 4MS4). 	Mapping the fragment library in the inactive VFT conformation identified an aromatic feature in LB2 close to hydrophobic- and aromatic residues (Tyr250 and Trp278), together with a hydrogen bond donor and a hydrogen bond acceptor feature (Figure 2B and Figure 3). In LB1, one hydrogen bond donor, one hydrogen bond acceptor and one negative charged feature were identified. 
PMC6429233	4MS4	Results	PDBe	False	Docking of Active GABAB-R Compounds 	The dataset of 55 GABAB-R active compounds were docked in both agonist (PDB ID: 4MS4) and antagonist (PDB ID: 4MR7) induced VFT conformation. 	The Cα Root Mean Square deviation (RMSD) between these conformations was 7.0 Å, with largest differences in loop regions. The overall RMSD of residues within 5 Å of the co-crystalized ligands was 2.1 Å. Superimposition showed that the active conformation had a more closed VFT than the inactive conformation (Figure 2). 
PMC6429233	4MS3	Methods	PDBe	False		Two crystal structure complexes of GABAB-R VFT with agonists (PDB IDs: 4MS3, 4MS4) and six with antagonists (PDB IDs: 4MR7, 4MR8, 4MR9, 4MS1, 4MRM, 4MQF) are present in the PDB-database. 	The PBD ID 4MR7 in complex with the antagonist CGP54626 with a resolution of 2.15 Å, and the PDB ID 4MS4 in complex with the agonist baclofen with a resolution of 1.9 Å were used for the structure-based studies. They were selected to represent the active agonist and inactive antagonist-induced VFT structures due to the resolution. 
PMC6429233	4MS4	Methods	PDBe	False	Two crystal structure complexes of GABAB-R VFT with agonists (PDB IDs: 4MS3, 4MS4) and six with antagonists (PDB IDs: 4MR7, 4MR8, 4MR9, 4MS1, 4MRM, 4MQF) are present in the PDB-database. 	The PBD ID 4MR7 in complex with the antagonist CGP54626 with a resolution of 2.15 Å, and the PDB ID 4MS4 in complex with the agonist baclofen with a resolution of 1.9 Å were used for the structure-based studies. 	They were selected to represent the active agonist and inactive antagonist-induced VFT structures due to the resolution. The structures were pre-processed in Schrödinger Protein Preparation wizard with default settings; Hydrogen bonds were assigned with a PROPKA pH of 7. 
PMC6429233	4MS4	Methods	PDBe	False	The docking was performed with the Glide program of the Schrödinger suit [63]. 	One grid map was generated per selected crystal structures, 4MS4 and 4MR7, by selecting the co-crystalized ligand as the centroid of the grid box. 	However, the grid size was increased by changing the inner box diameter from 10 Å to 15 Å such that larger compounds than the co-crystallized ligands could be docked. The remaining settings for the grid generation were kept at default values. 
PMC6429233	4MR7	Methods	PDBe	False	Two of the high affinity antagonists were found to be false negatives as they were not retrieved by the pharmacophore mapping and therefor excluded from the test set, resulting in totally eight compounds in the test set. 	The training and test sets of agonists and antagonists were docked into their respective crystal structures (PDB ID: 4MR7 for antagonists and 4MS4 for agonists) [65] before a Truncated Newton minimization sampling was performed with the maximum number of sampling steps set to 1000 (default settings). 	The flexible region of the receptor included the amino acids in the binding pocket. A similar sampling minimization procedure was also performed for the unbound ligand and receptor.

Fully flexible ligand docking was performed with Glide 5.0 (Schrodinger, LLC, Portland, OR). The protein was prepared for grid generation and subsequent docking using the Protein Preparation Wizard tool from FirstDiscovery suite. 
PMC5835904	3T7U	Methods	PDBe	False	Modeling templates were identified in the Protein Data Bank (Berman et al., 2002) using the profile-profile alignment program Phyre2 (Kelley et al., 2015). 	The initial homology model was build based on the ARM domain structure of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein from human (PDB code: 3T7U). 	The model structure was further refined using the YASARA energy minimization server to increase the model accuracy (Krieger et al., 2002). The quality of final structure model was validated using PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1996).

PMC3990513	3OE0	Methods	PDBe	False	A chimeric template receptor was assembled making use of the structural alignment of the X-ray structures available from GPCR-ModSim. 	The chimeric template consisted mainly of hCXCR4 in complex with a cyclic peptide antagonist [40] (PDB entry 3OE0), but with some poorly defined intracellular parts extracted from two alternative templates: the intracellular loop 1 and the N-terminal end of TM6 from the hCXCR4 structure in complex with a small antagonist [40] (PDB entry 3ODU) while TM8 and the C-terminal end of TM7 were adopted from the hA2AR in complex with ZM241385 [41] (PDB entry 3EML). 	This chimeric structure was used as template for homology modeling of the hY1 receptor using the program Modeller 9.9 [19]. The hY1-hCXCR4 sequence alignment was manually refined in the longer loop regions and the N-terminus was discarded from hY1 modeling due to lack of sequence similarity. 
PMC4215857	3NSG	Methods	PDBe	False	The 3D model of OmpD was constructed using Modeller 9.12 [32]. 	The structures of OmpF from Salmonella Typhi (PDB: 3NSG) and E. coli (PDB: 2ZFG), and OmpC from E. coli (PDB: 2J1N) and Salmonella Typhi (PDB: 3UU2) were used as three-dimensional templates. 	The STAMP algorithm was used to obtain a reference multiple alignment by 3D-structure comparison [33].

PMC5811088	2WM4	Introduction	PDBe	False		Fig. 1 displays the structure of a typical P450 active site, namely the one belonging to the CYP124 isozyme as taken from the ; 2WM4 protein databank (pdb) file.5 As shown in Fig. 1 the substrate (tyramine) is located in a cleft nearby the heme, the substrate binding pocket, which is in a tight orientation with stabilizing hydrogen bonding interactions by several residues. 	The vacant sixth coordination site of iron is the position where molecular oxygen will bind during the catalytic cycle. The process includes two reduction and two protonation steps to synthesize the active species of P450 called Compound I (Cpd I).6 Cpd I is highly reactive and therefore difficult to study experimentally, however, a few reports on its spectroscopic properties have appeared in the literature.7 
PMC3709119	3iay	Article	PDBe	False	How do POLE and POLD1 mutations cause tumorigenesis? 	The most common somatic and germline mutations in POLE and POLD1 have been mapped onto a hybrid structure of yeast DNA polymerase (3iay) and T4 polymerase (Figure 3). 	The residues equivalent to the two germline mutations (POLE p.Leu424Val and POLD1 p.Ser478Asn) pack together at the interface between two helices that form the base of the exonuclease active site. Mutations are predicted to distort the packing of the helices; this will in turn be propagated to the active site, affecting nuclease activity 2.

Mutant amino acids are shown in red (POLE) or blue (POLD1). The key mutations generally cluster around the active site (D275) close to the ssDNA, an exception being V411 which lies some distance away and may act through affecting the positions of other residues closer to the active site. 
PMC4156330	1N8Z	Methods	PDBe	False	Comparison of structurally conserved motifs with the epitopes of HER2's antibodies based on the crystal 3D structure 	The crystal structure of the extracellular domain of the human HER2 complexed with trastuzumab Fab (PDB ID: 1N8Z) and the structure of HER2-pertuzumab complex (PDB ID: 1S78) were obtained from NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/structure/?term=HER2). 	Using Cn3D software, the structurally conserved fragments of ECD HER2 were superposed and labeled on the two crystal structures. Furthermore, as supplementary reference to our prediction, FoldX (http://foldx.crg.es/) were introduced with in silico mutagenesis 'repair module', which allowed to predict the amino acids involved in the binding of HER2 to the antibodies by alanine mutation based on 'force field' statistical considerations [26]. 
PMC3241652	2E9T	Results	PDBe	False	Here, the distortion of unbound RNA allows for finding only poorly scored solutions of ‘acceptable’ quality. 	Also, as binding is generally tighter than in previous cases, even small change in protein structure (RMSD of 0.8 Å for 2E9T) gives unfavorable score for the hit found. 	In both cases, docking of two unbound partners was unsuccessful. The remaining complex (Figure 9, 1K8W) does not belong to the above classification. 
PMC4117766	1zev	Article	PDBe	False		The earliest crystallographic study of a trinucleotide repeat targeted the structure of an oligomer comprising six CUG repeats (PDB code 1zev) (62). 	The authors found that the RNA is double-helical, having overall characteristics of the A-form, in which the C-G and G-C base pairs have U-U ‘mismatches’ in between (Figure 1A). The non-canonical pairing seemed not to distort the backbone from the A-helix. 
PMC4117766	3g1p	Article	PDBe	False	Closer observations of the inter-strand interactions, in particular the details of the non-canonical base-pairing and the solvent structure, were prevented by an apparent superposition of molecules in the crystal lattice. 	A different study revealed duplexes of G(CUG)2C at a resolution of 1.23 Å (Figure 1B, PDB code 3g1p) (63). 	This RNA was also in the A-form with the helical twist in the typical range of 32–34°. The crystal lattice comprised three duplexes, crystallographically independent but with similar structures, stacked end-to-end to form pseudo-infinite helices. 
PMC4117766	3g1p	Figure	PDBe	True	Surfaces especially liable to interact with the solvent through H-bonding are indicated with arcs. 	Representative N-N pairs with the 2Fo-Fc electron density, contoured at 1σ level, are shown (right) based on PDB entries 3g1p, 3nj6, 3r1c, 4e59, respectively. 	
PMC4117766	3gm7	Article	PDBe	False	The paper also includes a new analysis of the data obtained by Mooers et al. (62). 	After detwinning the diffraction intensities, the structure of the [(CUG)6]2 duplex (PDB code 3gm7) corresponds closely with the structure of the shorter duplexes. 	
PMC4117766	3szx	Article	PDBe	False	Another study of a crystal structure containing CUG repeats reported a wider range of conformations of the U-U pairs, including arrangements with zero, one or two H-bonds (67). 	Two crystal forms were reported of a double-stranded construct containing three CUG repeats and 5′UU dangling ends (Figure 1C, D; PDB codes 3szx, 3syw). 	In both crystal forms, the central CUGs had the uracil rings symmetrically opposed and apparently too far apart to form any H-bonds. In the flanking repeats, the two structures differed. 
PMC4117766	4E+048	Article	PDBe	False	A crystal structure of G(CUG)6C 20-mers forming blunt-ended double helices was described recently (Figure 1E) (68). 	The crystal lattice contained two distinct duplexes of which one was located on a crystallographic 2-fold axis (PDB code 4e48). 	Thus, the structure contained nine distinct double-helical CUG repeats. The authors took the opportunity to compare the nine U-U pairs, analyse the spread of conformations and thus gain insight into the dynamics of such pairing. 
PMC4117766	4fnj	Article	PDBe	False	The authors concluded that ‘generally speaking, the U-U pairs just follow the requirements of the system’. 	The most recent report regarding the CUG series presents the crystal structure of an RNA construct containing a tandem GAAA tetraloop and its receptor that form the tip and the upper part of a hairpin, respectively, while the lower part of the stem is a double-helical segment of two CUG repeats (Figure 1F, PDB code 4fnj) (69). 	The combination of the tetraloop with the receptor facilitated crystallisation, which enabled the examination of yet another instance of two consecutive CUG repeats. They formed a helix whose geometry also corresponded to the A-form. 
PMC4117766	3nj6	Article	PDBe	False	Two crystal forms of (GGCAGCAGCC)2 have been reported (70). 	One of the structures was solved at atomic resolution (0.95 Å) and contained a duplex with the two strands related by crystallographic symmetry (Figure 1G, PDB code 3nj6). 	The other structure was analysed at medium resolution (1.9 Å) and contained three crystallographically independent duplexes (PDB code 3nj7). All duplexes were closely superposable and possessed general characteristics of the A-form. 
PMC4117766	3nj7	Article	PDBe	False	One of the structures was solved at atomic resolution (0.95 Å) and contained a duplex with the two strands related by crystallographic symmetry (Figure 1G, PDB code 3nj6). 	The other structure was analysed at medium resolution (1.9 Å) and contained three crystallographically independent duplexes (PDB code 3nj7). 	All duplexes were closely superposable and possessed general characteristics of the A-form. The A-A pairs, embedded between the canonical C-G and G-C pairs, had both residues in the anti conformation (Figure 2B). 
PMC4117766	4j50	Article	PDBe	False	The middle A-A pair had both adenosines in the anti conformation and the two adenine rings were modelled as being symmetrically opposed with the N1 atoms and the C2H2 groups in unlikely close contact. 	Examination of the electron density (see Appendix), calculated on the basis of structure factors deposited by the authors in the PDB (accession code 4j50), indicates disorder, which could be modelled as two alternative conformations of the A-A pair. 	In each of the conformations, one adenine would be at more of an incline than the other, so that C2H2 would be opposite N1 and a hydrogen bond could form between them, similar to the structures reported before (70). Uninterpreted electron density in the major groove near the A-A pair could indicate a sulphate ion interacting with the exo-amino groups, like in the previous paper. 
PMC4117766	3r1c	Article	PDBe	False	Three crystal structures of short CGG-containing oligomers have been published (Figure 1I-K) (72). 	A duplex of G(CGG)2C crystallized with a remarkable 18 distinct duplexes in the unit cell, all arranged in the typical end-to-end manner, in semi-infinite columns (PDB code 3r1c). 	The other two crystal structures contained guanosine residues brominated at position 8 (PDB codes 3r1d and 3r1e). All helices had the A-form, with some local deviations. 
PMC4117766	3r1d	Article	PDBe	False	A duplex of G(CGG)2C crystallized with a remarkable 18 distinct duplexes in the unit cell, all arranged in the typical end-to-end manner, in semi-infinite columns (PDB code 3r1c). 	The other two crystal structures contained guanosine residues brominated at position 8 (PDB codes 3r1d and 3r1e). 	All helices had the A-form, with some local deviations. In all G-G pairs, one guanosine was syn and the other was anti, with two hydrogen bonds between the Watson-Crick edge of G(anti) and the Hoogsteen edge of G(syn): O6···N1H and N7···N2H (Figure 2C). 
PMC4117766	3js2	Article	PDBe	False	Another paper described an RNA duplex containing three consecutive CGG repeats with flanking sequences and 5′-UU overhangs (Figure 1L) (73). 	Overall, the structure of the CGG repeats is similar to that described above (72), with G(syn)-G(anti) pairs and unusual torsion angles of the G(syn) residues, resulting in a local unwinding of the helix (PDB code 3js2). 	The authors noted that the resultant widening of the major groove and the base-pair inclination near the G-G pairs resembled the A′-form of RNA. They also noted an interesting difference from the structures of other triplet repeats: the lack of ordered ions near the G-G pairs, even though several cations and sulphate anions were present in the crystallisation medium. 
PMC4117766	4E+059	Article	PDBe	False	The oligomers formed duplexes in the crystal lattice, and again, the RNA has the A-form, but pairing of the strands was unexpected. 	In the unmodified oligomer, the strands slipped in the 5′ direction (PDB code 4e59), whereas in the LNA-containing oligomer, there was a slippage in the 3′ direction (PDB code 4e58). 	In both cases, the result was to reduce the number of C-C pairs from the expected two, if no slippage had occurred, to one. Nevertheless, three instances of double-stranded CCG triplets were observed: one for unmodified RNA and two in crystallographically independent LNA-containing duplexes. 
PMC4117766	2l8c	Article	PDBe	False	The authors noted the presence of canonical C-G pairs and observed resonances consistent with an A-form helix with a C3′-endo sugar pucker and an anti conformation of the glycosidic torsion angle. 	Recent solution NMR work on a single CUG with flanking sequences, to stabilize the duplex form, was also consistent with an A-form geometry with a 3C′-endo sugar pucker (PDB codes 2l8c, 2l8u and 2l8w) (76). 	The line broadening and temperature profile of the spectrum indicated a structurally dynamic U-U pair. When the NMR model was subjected to molecular dynamics simulation, the U-U pair was found to adopt conformations with zero, one or two hydrogen bonds, of which the most stable was the structure with one H-bond. 
PMC4117766	1noq	Article	PDBe	False	Only one three-dimensional structure has been published of DNA containing CNG repeats (78). 	The solution structure of d(CCGCCG)2 was solved using NMR (PDB code 1noq). 	The double helix contained only G-C and C-G pairs. The C-C pairs were eliminated by strand slippage, which resulted in dangling cytosine residues at the 5′ site of each strand. 
PMC4117766	3d2s	Discussion	PDBe	False	The model shows the protein interacting with a short single-stranded RNA, in particular with the GC step in its sequence. 	Inspection of the atomic coordinates and the electron density calculated using the structure factors deposited with the PDB (code 3d2s) reveals unexplained degradation of the RNA. 	From a crystallographer's perspective, it reveals a puzzling, nearly perfect match between pairs of protein molecules and the associated RNA chains, which are related by a translation of half a unit cell along the crystallographic a-axis. Further studies are clearly necessary to elucidate the interactions of CNG repeats with their protein partners.

Previous QM/MM study has suggested a hydroxide ion connecting two zinc cofactors for the hydrolysis of antibiotics and therefore been included in our previous model (Thomas et al., 2011; Zheng and Xu, 2013). Overall, the zinc ions are coordinated with residues (OH−, His120, His122, Asp123), and with residues (OH−, His189, Cys208, His250), respectively.

PMC6255897	3Q6X	Results	PDBe	False	Outcome of virtual screening 	Our docking protocol was firstly used to predict the binding mode of hydrolysed ampicillin to the NDM-1, in comparison with crystal structure (PDB 3Q6X, Zhang and Hao, 2011). 	At first, our MM docking calculations give 21 conformations based on the score of protein-ligand interaction energies less than 10.00 kcal/mol and overlay with the MCSS minima as described in Method section Molecular Mechanical Virtual Screening. Using the GPU-accelerated QM refinement, these conformations were further optimized in the complex with NDM-1.

Left panel is NDM-1 without bridged hydroxide ion (PDB 4EXS, King et al., 2012) and Right Panel is NDM-1 in which a hydroxide ion is located between two Zinc ions (PDB 3Q6X, Zhang and Hao, 2011). 	Figures were prepared using Gaussview (Dennington et al., 2016). 
PMC6255897	3Q6X	Conclusion	PDBe	False	Our calculations predict potential inhibitors different from the previous docking study in which Isomargololone and Nimbolide were estimated to be the inhibitors of NDM-1 (Thakur et al., 2013). 	The discrepancy could be due to the factors that they used the crystal structure of NDM-1 (PDB 3Q6X, Zhang and Hao, 2011) as target without the bridged hydroxide ion and employed empirical docking and scoring function (Goodsell et al., 1996; Morris et al., 1998) only to estimate the binding affinities of the compounds. 	From our QM calculations, MOs of the QM region shows that the HOMO with the bridged OH− between zinc ions has electron cloud delocalized over the Zn-OH-Zn cluster, while the LUMOs are similar with electron cloud concentrated at Zn2, independent of the hydroxide ion. As a result, the inhibitors of antibiotics resistance against the NDM-1 will be of conjugate nature, by binding over the Zn-OH-Zn, such as Curcumin, Catechin, and Feruclic acid (Figure 3).

MT bound structure was generated by overlapping the MH of Ncd on the single-headed kinesin (KIF1A) bound structure on tubulin (PDB ID 1IAO). 	We used 13-protofilament structure [57] to illustrate MT bound Ncd structure. Structure-based potential

We overlapped chain A of 1CZ7 onto chain K of 1IA0 and αβ tubulin dimer of 1IA0 onto terminal αβ tubulin dimer of the tubular MT structure. This leads to the MT bound state of Ncd.

For example, Athe_2347 contains Pfam domain PF12679, which functions as an ABC-2 family transporter. 	This protein was detected primarily during growth on xylose but was also significantly more abundant on all of the simple growth substrates. Similarly, Athe_2368, which contains Pfam domain PF09822 that functions as an ABC-type uncharacterized transporter, was significantly more abundant during growth on both complex and C5 substrates.

PMC5013595	PF00041	Results	Pfam	False	Because the CD spectra of these two forms are also virtually identical, we believe that deglycosylation does not influence the secondary structure of IFNγR2. 	Although the CD spectra of IFNγR2 and IFNγR1 differ considerably (Černý et al., 2015 ▸), both proteins belong to the same fold of the fibronectin type III domain family (Pfam PF00041). 	Besides deglycosylation by the endoglycosidases, we designated asparagine-to-glutamine mutants to decrease the level of glycosylation. We prepared a fully mutated IFNγR2 variant bearing N56Q, N110Q, N137Q and N231Q mutations and single-point mutants N110Q, N137Q and N231Q, respectively. 
PMC5013595	PF00041	Results	Pfam	False	Data-collection and refinement parameters are shown in Table 1 ▸. The extracellular part of the IFNγR2 molecule consists of two domains (Fig. 2 ▸), the N-terminal D1 domain of UniProt residues 28–133 and the C-terminal D2 domain of residues 144–247. 	Both domains belong to the immuno­globulin fold with fibronectin type III topology, forming β-sandwiches (Pfam PF00041). 	The inter-domain torsion angle is approximately 120°, similar to those of IFNγR1 (Thiel et al., 2000 ▸; Walter et al., 1995 ▸) and human tissue factor (Harlos et al., 1994 ▸); the D1–D2 torsion angle is defined in Supplementary Table S3. The D1 domain is composed of three β-strands stacked on a layer of four β-strands, and the D2 domain is created by four β-strands arranged against four other β-strands; both domains are connected by a short linker (residues 134–143 in IFNγR2) comprising a short helix that is also found in IFNγR1, human tissue factor and other receptors. 
PMC5630949	PF01549	Results	Pfam	False	ShK is a 35-residue peptide sequence that was first discovered in the sea anemone Stichodactyla helianthus and can block voltage-gated potassium channels (Castaneda et al. 1995). 	Through Pfam domain/motif screening, we identified in the transcriptome of P. variabilis one transcript containing the Stichodactyla toxin (ShK) domain (Pfam ID: PF01549). 	BLASTp and HMMER validations resulted in 29% identities and an expected accuracy of 0.97 using the HMM profile of the family domain. The predicted P. variabilis toxin-like is located in the clade of the toxic ShK peptides (fig. 2B) and the ProBiS result of the modeled structure of the putative P. variabilis ShK-like peptide showed that the protein aurelin (PDB ID: 2LG4) was the second best match based on Z scores (supplementary file S1, Supplementary Material online). 
PMC5630949	PF00087	Results	Pfam	False		One translated P. variabilis transcript shared proper sequence similarity with the snake venom TFT Toxin_1 domain region (Pfam ID: PF00087). 	This domain displays the closest similarity with the snake toxin sequence TFT MALT0070C (UniProt ID: F5CPE6) from the venom gland of Micrurus altirostris (Correa-Netto et al. 2011). The TFTs encompass a large family of toxic polypeptides from snake venom; these polypeptides are mainly monomeric and are characterized by the archetypical three β-strand loops constrained by four disulfide bonds, spatially resembling fingers protruding from a core. 
PMC5630949	PF00059	Results	Pfam	False		Two contigs with a putative protein product with a C-type lectin domain (Pfam ID: PF00059) were found in the P. variabilis transcriptome. 	C-type lectins in venom are associated with hemagglutination, inflammatory response, and hemostasis. Two main toxin groups containing C-type lectin domain comprise the true venom lectin and the snake C-type lectin (snaclec) families. 
PMC5630949	PF00341	Results	Pfam	False		The P. variabilis transcriptome contains one predicted sequence similar to that of the snake venom VEGF domain (VEGF-F) (Pfam ID: PF00341) of the snake toxin barietin (UniProt ID: C0K3N1) (Yamazaki et al. 2009). 	Although distinct, the predicted P. variabilis toxin-like polypeptide displays close phylogenetic relationship with sequences in snake venom VEGF toxin clade, compared to other non-toxic VEGF domains (fig. 3B). The multiple sequence alignment (supplementary fig. 
PMC5630949	PF00014	Results	Pfam	False	In sea anemones, homologs of Kunitz-type protease inhibitors are classified as type II toxins that are used for defense by protecting organisms from endogenous proteases and causing paralysis in prey by blocking several voltage-dependent potassium ion channel subtypes. 	Despite the fact that all venom Kunitz-type protease inhibitors are constituted of a single Kunitz/Bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) domain (Pfam ID: PF00014), they together form several distinct clades. 	The putative P. variabilis Kunitz-domain precursor splits in the clade of the sea snail Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor conotoxins (fig. 4A). The amino acid sequences shares 45% identity with a conserved cysteine framework of type IX (C-C-C-C-C-C) (supplementary fig.

PMC5148889	PF14214	Methods	Pfam	False	We used custom Python scripts and manual curation to determine the final domain architecture of individual proteins: in case of overlapping domain predictions (mostly PIF1 domains that also matched AAA domains), we kept the domain with the highest score (PIF1), or, in cases in which predictions likely correspond to the same domain, we merged overlapping regions that also overlapped in a similar fashion (e.g. no inversions) in the hmm model. 	In further analyses, we only include protein sequences that contain a Rep and a Hel domain (PF14214 and PF05970). 	We use hmmsearch from the hmmer3 package [67] with PF14214 and PF05970 to scan all Pezizomycotina proteomes in our dataset (Additional file 8: Table S8) for proteins that contain both these domains. We constructed two different multiple sequence alignments for this set of proteins.

PMC5097440	R-HSA-556833	Results	Reactome	False		To test the performance and identify optimal parameters of MSEA, we performed simulation tests based on three cholesterol GWAS of varying sample sizes (a Finnish study of 8330 individuals [24], the Framingham Heart Study with 7572 participants [25], and GLGC with 100,184 people [26]) and a set of known causal lipid homeostasis genes from the Reactome pathway R-HSA-556833, “Metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins”. 	We resampled genes from this pathway into positive control signals of different magnitudes, and generated negative control signals from the gene pool excluding known cholesterol genes. This procedure was repeated 100 times, and performance was evaluated as sensitivity, specificity and positive likelihood ratio, as described in Methods. 
PMC5097440	R-HSA-556833	Results	Reactome	False	This difference likely explains the better reproducibility of wKDA compared to the unweighted KDA.Fig. 5Performance comparison between wKDA and the unweighted key driver analysis. 	Two empirical subnetworks (Lipid I & II) were obtained from a previous publication [23], and a canonical metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins pathway was obtained from the Reactome database (R-HSA-556833). 	The methods were tested by projecting the three functional subnetworks onto two independent adipose networks (a–c) and two independent liver regulatory networks (d–f). The adipose and liver networks were constructed from a collection of Bayesian tissue-specific network models (Additional file 1: Table S3). 
PMC5097440	R-HSA-556833	Methods	Reactome	False	To determine a suitable combination of parameters and to compare performance of different methods, we simulated true positives and true negatives. 	True positive signals related to cholesterol and lipid metabolism were collected from the Reactome pathway R-HSA-556833, “the metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins”. 	These genes were grouped into 300 positive control pathways, including 100 with size 25, 100 with size 100, 100 with size 250, respectively. Simultaneously, 300 negative control pathways with the same size distribution as the positive control pathways were generated by randomly selecting genes from the non-cholesterol gene pool consists of 8633 genes from the pathway database of Reactome [29], BioCarta (http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Pathways/BioCarta_Pathways) and KEGG [30].

PMC3650022	NM_173654.1	Discussion	RefSeq	False	We show that transfection of this EOGT cDNA causes O-GlcNAcylation of Drosphila N, Dl and Ser EGF repeats; it also requires a conserved DXD motif for optimal activity, and it is primarily responsible for the transfer of O-GlcNAc to high molecular weight proteins, including Dp, in Drosophila larvae. 	Another cDNA in Genbank (NM_173654.1; [21]) lacks an internal segment that contains the DYD motif, and is therefore predicted to have low or no activity. In vivo, the human EOGT cDNA fully rescued homozygotes of a new P-element excision mutation of eogt (eogtex10). 	Both eogt RNAi knock-down and mutant clones exhibited blistered wing and vortex phenotypes, similar to the vortex class of dp mutants (dpv). The hallmark of the removal of eogt in the posterior wing in en>eogtIR flies was the temperature-dependent development of blisters, with essentially 100% frequency at 27°C (Table 1 and Fig. 5; [11]). 
PMC4800764	NG_012892.1	Case study	RefSeq	False	The entire coding region and adjacent intronic segments of SLC5A2 were screened for mutations by the direct sequencing of PCR products.

PMC5766055	NR_027457	Results	RefSeq	False	For further research and for the validation of the availability of selecting these lncRNAs as markers, in vitro experiments were conducted. 	SVneo cells were transfected with the synthesized interfering oligonucleotide sequences si-NR_027457, si-AF085938, si-G36948, and si-AK002210 or with the corresponding control siRNA. 	As the results showed, the expression of all 4 lncRNAs in SVneo cells transfected with siRNAs was dramatically decreased compared with the control groups transfected with the negative control (si-NC) (Figure 3A). The results of the MTT assay showed that the proliferation rate of si-NR_027457- and si-AF085938-transfected cells was significantly inhibited, which suggests that the silencing of NR_027457 and AF085938 suppressed the proliferation of SVneo cells. 
PMC3081804	NM_002335	Introduction	RefSeq	False		Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) (GenBank: NM_002335) is a co-receptor of the canonical wingless and Int1 (Wnt) signaling pathway [1]. 	The canonical Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway regulates multiple biologic events including proliferation, apoptosis, and development [2,3]. In the absence of the Wnt protein or other pathway activators, a protein destruction complex consisting of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), Axin, glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), and casein kinase 1 (CK1) forms in the cytoplasm. 
PMC5456266	NM_002046	Methods	RefSeq	False	Primer sets for CXCR2 (assay ID: Hs01891184) were from Applied Biosystems.

(Cowdria) ruminantium sequence (GenBank accession U03776) (60) (Table 4). 	In both sampling areas, these were detected in Am. variegatum, Amblyomma gemma, and Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi tick pools (Table 5) from livestock and dogs (Tables 2, 3 and 6). 
PMC4945026	NM_145123.4	Results	RefSeq	False	By nested amplification using two gene-specific primers, the PCR products displayed two main bands in both mouse brain and articular cartilage tissue at sizes of ~800 and 300 bp, respectively (S1 Fig). 	Sequencing indicated that both bands matched mus. musculus cartilage acidic protein 1 (Crtac1) (NCBI reference sequence: NM_145123.4), and were homologous to human CRTAC1B (S1 and S2 Figs). 	The difference in length of the two bands lies in the length of the 3’ UTR without affecting the coding sequence. Instead, difference in the 3’UTR may reflect alternative cleavage and polyadenylation at the 3’ end of mouse Crtac1 mRNA, which may affect the mRNA localization, translation and degradation [31, 32]. 
PMC4945026	NM_145123.4	Supplementary material	RefSeq	False	Comparison of the sequence of the Crtac1 3′ RACE products generated in S1 Fig with that of exons 14 and 15 of mouse Crtac1 mRNA from NCBI. 	The sequence of the long (A) and short (B) bands map to exon 15 of mouse Crtac1 (NCBI Reference Sequence: NM_145123.4). 	The sequence in A and B represents exons 14 and 15 (underlined) of mouse Crtac1 mRNA. The blue sequence is the GSP2 for RACE, which was also used for sequencing the products.

PMC6174280	NM_002490.5	Article	RefSeq	False	Until now, no consensus on the clinically relevant transcripts has been reached, but Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data and in-house RNA-seq data19 support ENST00000602404.5 as the predominant isoform, and RNA expression data specifically correlate with the 5′ UTR of ENST00000602404.5 (Figure S2). 	These data have led ENST00000602404.5 to now be associated with the revised accession number GenBank: NM_002490.5. 	In order to further characterize the functional consequence of the subjects’ NDUFA6 variants, we undertook functional investigations with fibroblast cell lines from each subject for whom tissues were available (S1–S3). High-resolution respirometry of subject fibroblasts was performed with the Oroboros 2k platform as described previously20 and revealed a remarkable impairment of intact cell respiration in subject 1.

PMC5711916	NR_038221	Discussion	RefSeq	False	The potential target genes were TLR6, NOD2, HLA-DQB and IL6ST, suggesting that NR_038221 might affect the pathological process during TB infection by influencing signal transduction between immune cells and the intracellular signalling pathway. 	Our previous study verified six miRNAs as potential biomarkers for pulmonary TB, including hsa-miR-3786, of which the mature sequence hsa-miR-378a-3p was among the 368 miRNAs that associated with NR_038221, indicating that NR_038221 and hsa-miR-378a-3p might play a similar function during the pathological process of pulmonary TB. 	In summary, we identified four differentially expressed lncRNAs in plasma of TB patients that may influence the activation of T cells. These lncRNAs could affect signal transduction between cells, thus influencing the pathological process of TB. 
PMC5314723	NM_000520.4	Abstract	RefSeq	False	This study assesses the reliability of EA in comparison with HEXA sequence analysis in non-AJ populations. Methods: Five hundred eight Hispanic and African American patients (516 samples) had EA of their leukocytes performed and 12 of these patients who tested positive by EA (“carriers”) had subsequent HEXA gene sequencing performed. Results: Of the 508 patients, 25 (4.9%) were EA positive and 40 (7.9%) were inconclusive. 	Of the 12 patients who were sequenced, 11 did not carry a pathogenic variant and one carried a likely deleterious mutation (NM_000520.4(HEXA):c.1510C>T). Conclusions: High inconclusive rates and poor correlation between positive/inconclusive enzyme results and identification of pathogenic mutations suggest that ethnic-specific recalibration of reference ranges for EA may be necessary. 	Alternatively, HEXA gene sequencing could be performed.

PMC3973589	NC_007880.1	Introduction	RefSeq	False	In some bacterial systems, feoA and feoC genes may be located in different regions of the bacterial chromosome and the feoC gene may even be absent [27]. 	The F. tularensis strain LVS only encodes the feoA (FTL_0660) and feoB (FTL_0133) orthologs, which are unlinked and map to different regions of the F. tularensis chromosome (NCBI Reference sequence NC_007880.1). 	A signature-tagged mutagenesis screen of a transposon mutant library revealed that fslA and feoB were each individually required for mouse lung infection by LVS [38]. A LVS ΔfeoB mutant was also recently reported to have reduced virulence in an intranasal mouse infection model [39].

PMC3307708	NM_001004762	Results	RefSeq	False	Out of all measured gene expressions, that of the Cyp1a1 gene was changed the most – its expression was negligible in the intestines of mice that did not express functional TLR2 (22-fold reduction compared to WT animals). 	Of note, the expression of mRNA for phospholipase A2 [IVC cytosolic, calcium-independent - Pla2g4c, as assayed by probes targeting the sequences NM_001004762 (RefSeq) and AK145339 (Genbank)], was significantly increased in the intestine as a result of the loss of functional TLR2. 	In the consequent intervention study, we investigated whether feeding with BaP induces expression of intestinal mRNAs for CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1 as well as concentrations of CYP 1A1/CYP1A2 protein in TLR2−/− mice and in wild-type animals. After the end of the feeding period (21 days), regulation of mRNA production for CYP1 was measured by qRT-PCR. 
PMC2805710	NM_005029	Methods	RefSeq	False	The obtained sequence was submitted under accession FN432136 to the EMBL nucleotide database. 	The human reference PITX3 mRNA (GenBank: NM_005029) was used as query in cross-species BLAST searches identifying corresponding bovine EST entries (GenBank: EG705801, EG707045, EG707660). 	Initially, the putative ovine genomic structure was determined by alignment of bovine PITX3 EST and human PITX3 mRNA to the determined ovine genomic sequence using Spidey [51]. Later, the exact ovine genomic structure was determined using the experimentally derived ovine mRNA sequences.

PMC4440712	NM_014751.5	Results	RefSeq	False	Luciferase promoter assay using a promoter region containing a fragment of -276 to -13 bp has previously been described to confer highest Mtss1 expression. 	The indicated nucleotide position -276 to -13bp is related to the 5´end of annotated Mtss1 mRNA sequence with the accession number (NM_014751.5) [21]. 	Our data demonstrate that MTSS1 promoter activity was significantly higher in human t(8;21) positive AML cells (Kasumi-1) when compared to various AML1-ETO negative cell lines (Fig 4D). This suggests that the AML1-ETO fusion molecule is a positive regulator of MTSS1.

PMC5827396	XM_008012845.1	Results	RefSeq	False	Indeed, the whole-genome sequence of Vero cells is incomplete, and so far, there is no documentation of a HER2 homologue in this cell line. 	Nonetheless, Vero cells were isolated from an African green monkey (Chlorocebus sp.), and the sequence of the Chlorocebus genome contains the HER2 homologue (Chlorocebus sabaeus; RefSeq accession number XM_008012845.1) with 98% identity with the human HER2. 	We conclude from these results that the four insertion sites tested were all suitable for insertion in that the generated recombinants were viable, implying that gB carried out the fusogenic function. More importantly, the inserted GCN4 peptide mediated infection through the GCN4R, i.e., it was suitably located in gB not only to prevent any detrimental effect on gB function but also to contribute to its entry function, i.e., to the GCN4R-dependent infection and consequent gB activation.

Primers specific for PDE2A2 yielded a doublet by PCR (Fig. 1B), which was shown by sequence analysis to include a lower band derived from PDE2A2 (GenBank NM_001143839.3) and an upper band corresponding to the non-coding transcript variant 4 of PDE2A (GenBank NR_026572.2) with an additional 62 bp compared with PDE2A2 (data not shown). 	Western blot analysis showed a single band (~105 kDa) corresponding to PDE2A2 (Fig. 1C). Sequencing of PDE2A2 in PMP cells 
PMC3621658	NR_026572.2	Discussion	RefSeq	False	PDE2A2 and PDE2A3 are associated with the membrane (4), and mouse PDE2A2 is present in mitochondria (23). 	In the present study, the expression of PDE2A2 and a non-coding RNA (GenBank NR_026572.2), of which the RT-PCR product was 62 bp longer than that of PDE2A2, was detected in PMP cells. 	This was confirmed by western blot analysis of PMP cell extracts, which showed an approximately 105 kDa band corresponding to the PDE2A2 protein. The size of this protein is comparable to that (102 kDa) of a protein isolated from HUVECs (24).

These loci include: rs10218843 (P = 3.04×10−7) and rs11265461 (P = 1.94×10−7) are adjacent to signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 1 (SLAMF1); rs4699030 (P = 1.94×10−6) and rs230529 (P = 1.74×10−7) are located in the gene nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 1 (NFKB1); and rs13049286 (P = 3.05×10−5) and rs3827219 (P = 1.66×10−5) fall in receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 4 (RIPK4). 	One isolated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs739617 (P = 3.87×10−5) was also identified to be associated with TRS. The -94delATTG allele (rs28362691) located in the promoter region of NFKB1 was identified by resequencing and was found to associate with TRS (P = 4.85×10−6). 
PMC3313922	rs739617	Abstract	RefSNP	False	These loci include: rs10218843 (P = 3.04×10−7) and rs11265461 (P = 1.94×10−7) are adjacent to signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 1 (SLAMF1); rs4699030 (P = 1.94×10−6) and rs230529 (P = 1.74×10−7) are located in the gene nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 1 (NFKB1); and rs13049286 (P = 3.05×10−5) and rs3827219 (P = 1.66×10−5) fall in receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 4 (RIPK4).

The -94delATTG allele (rs28362691) located in the promoter region of NFKB1 was identified by resequencing and was found to associate with TRS (P = 4.85×10−6). The promoter assay demonstrated that the -94delATTG allele had a significant lower promoter activity than the -94insATTG allele in the SH-SY5Y cells. 
PMC3313922	rs28362691	Abstract	RefSNP	False	One isolated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs739617 (P = 3.87×10−5) was also identified to be associated with TRS. 	The -94delATTG allele (rs28362691) located in the promoter region of NFKB1 was identified by resequencing and was found to associate with TRS (P = 4.85×10−6). 	The promoter assay demonstrated that the -94delATTG allele had a significant lower promoter activity than the -94insATTG allele in the SH-SY5Y cells. This study suggests that rs28362691 in NFKB1 might be involved in the development of TRS. 
PMC3313922	rs10218843	Results	RefSNP	False	Of the 14 SNPs showing suggestive association in the initial analysis, 7SNPs remain suggestively associated with TRS after joint analysis (Table 2). 	These SNPs are: rs10218843 (P joint = 3.04×10−7) and rs11265461 (P joint = 1.94×10−7), which both are located in SLAMF1; rs230529 (P joint = 1.47×10−7) and rs4699030 (P joint = 1.94×10−6) are located in NFKB1; rs739617 (P joint = 3.87×10−5) is in DOCK4; rs13049268 (P joint = 3.05×10−5) and rs3827219 (P joint = 1.66×10−5) which are located in RIPK4. 	Testing in schizophrenic patients The top SNPs showing suggestive significance were then tested in an independent cohort of 1982 schizophrenic patients whose responses to antipsychotic treatments were not determined and additional 2000 controls. 
PMC3313922	rs13049286	Discussion	RefSNP	False		Two SNPs, rs13049286 and rs3827219 are both located in RIPK4. 	The expression of RIPK4 is well distributed, including the brain, and found to interact with PKC-delta [47]. This gene is important in sensing cellular stress, such as infection, inflammation, cellular differentiation programs and DNA damage. 
PMC3313922	rs28362691	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Thus, these suggest abnormal inflammatory response could lead to TRS. 	One common variant rs28362691 (-94ins/delATTG) identified from resequencing NFKB1 was found to associate with TRS. 	This SNP is located in 19 base pairs upstream of a functional κB binding site [57]. The promoter assay showed that the NFKB1 promoter with the -94delATTG allele had a lower promoter activity in SH-SY5Y cells in comparison with the -94insATTG allele. 
PMC3313922	rs2074127	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Other genetic loci identified in association with TRS in this study suggests genes involved in neuronal development (DOCK4 [58]). 	A recent study conducted in the Jewish population also identified a SNP (rs2074127) in DOCK4 associated with schizophrenia [59] however, this SNP is not in LD with the DOCK4 SNPs reported in this study (Supplementary Figure S4). 	Its role in the development of TRS remains to be elucidated. We also compared our results with previous genetic studies showing associations with TRS (such as variants in CYP3A4 [60], CYP3A5 [60], DRD3 [60], HTR2A [61], HTR3A [62]), none of the variants or their nearby SNPs had a P value lower than 10−5 in this study. 
PMC3313922	rs461409	Supplementary material	RefSNP	False	Refined regional association plots for the five singleton SNPs with suggestive association. 	For each of the SNP (A) rs461409, (B) rs123533497, (C) rs9314462, (D) rs9646303, and (E) rs11673496, the −log10 P values for the trend test from Affymetrix SNP 6.0 Array in 522 cases and 806 controls are plotted as red diamond according to their genomic position (NCBI Build 36.3). 	The SNPs with the strongest signal are represented as blue diamonds. The recombination rates (right y- axis) based on the Chinese HapMap population is plotted as green lines to reflect the local LD structure around the significant SNPs. 
PMC5681741	rs9923304	Methods	RefSNP	False	Our overall hypothesis is that carrying specific MMP alleles increases degradation of the collagen fibrils at the resin–dentin-bonded interfaces, which leads to clinical failure of composite restorations. 	We studied 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms in four genes (Table 3): MMP2 (rs9923304, rs2285053, rs243865, rs2287074, rs243847, rs11639960, rs2241145, rs243832), MMP3 (rs650108, rs520540, rs639752, rs679620, rs522616, rs520540), MMP8 (rs3765620, rs17099443), and MMP9 (rs17576, rs2272766, rs13925, rs2236416). 	These genetic variants were selected due to their known functional activity, gene location, and allele frequency (16–19). Genotyping data for the 92 individuals selected as cases and 92 individuals used as comparison were commensurate with genotyping data obtained previously from distinct individuals from the Pittsburgh area drawn for studies of different phenotypes [formation of periapical lesion related to deep caries lesions in dentin (16); chronic periodontitis (18)] and we concluded these samples we selected were not under the influence of undetected population substructure. 
PMC5681741	rs639752	Results	RefSNP	False	The MMP2 rs2287074 (p = 0.01), rs243847 (p = 0.05), and rs2241145 (p = 0.01) variants also showed association with failure of composite restorations. 	One variant in MMP3 (rs639752) had a p-value borderline of the nominal alpha of 0.05 (p = 0.06). 	The distribution of all other genetic variants was not statistically and significantly different. 
PMC5681741	rs9923304	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Matrix metalloproteinase 2, also known as gelatinase A, is a membrane-bound protein that is important for extracellular matrix turnover, preferentially cleaving collagen types IV, V, VII, and XI and gelatin (29). 	The MMP2 variant rs9923304 was found to be associated with formation of a periapical lesion when there is deep carious lesions in dentin (16). 	The underlying mechanism for this finding is possibly the same that explains the association of this genetic variant in MMP2 and failures of direct resin composite restorations of the present study. MMP2 gelatinolytic activity probably occurs both in partially demineralized dentin at the bottom of caries lesions and at the surface treated with either etch-and-rinse or self-etch adhesives. 
PMC4428701	rs12979860	Methods	RefSNP	False	We selected rs8099917, which was previously reported as the predictive factor of SVR by IFN-based therapies in Japan [29, 30], to determine IL28B SNP. 	This SNP is located within the same haplotype block as rs12979860, reported by Ge et al. [31], and are associated with each other [30]. 	TT at rs8099917 is advantageous and defined as major, whereas TG or GG is minor. 
PMC4428701	rs8099917	Results	RefSNP	False	Thus, we attempted to identify whether any correlation with other known predictive factors exist, including IL28B polymorphism [30, 31], ISDR amino acid mutations [24, 32, 36], and core protein substitution at aa70 or aa91 [33]. 	Of fifty-three patients with genotype 1 infection included in this study, IL28B SNPs at rs8099917, mutation numbers of ISDR on NS5A (aa2209-aa2248) and core protein mutation at aa70 or aa91 were determined. 	In this cohort, NKG2D expression on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes showed no difference when stratified by IL28B SNPs (major vs. minor) or ISDR mutation numbers (≤1 vs. ≥2). However, a significant difference when stratified by core protein determination at aa70 and aa91 (double wild-type or not, Fig 3) was noticed. 
PMC4428701	rs8099917	Results	RefSNP	True	Differential NKG2D expression on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes from chronic genotype 1 infection is associated with core protein aa substitutions. 	Cases of HCV genotype 1 infection were determined for the IL28B SNP polymorphism at rs8099917, mutation numbers of ISDR on NS5A (aa2209-aa2248) and core protein substitution at aa70 or aa91 before treatment. 	NKG2D expression on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes was compared between IL28B genotype major (TT at rs8099917, n = 35) or minor (TG or GG, n = 18), ISDR mutation numbers ≤1 (n = 34) or ≥2 (= 19), aa70 substituted (subs, n = 17) or wild type (n = 36), aa91 substituted (n = 19) or wild type (n = 34), double wild type (DWT, n = 25) at aa70 and aa91 or non-double wild type (nDWT, n = 27). Data show mean ± SD. **P < 0.01.

PMC3108997	rs10900296	Abstract	RefSNP	False	HOXB5 and NKX2-1 form a protein complex and mediate RET expression in a synergistic manner. 	HSCR associated SNPs at the NKX2-1 binding site (-5G>A rs10900296; -1A>C rs10900297), which reduce NKX2-1 binding, abolish the synergistic trans-activation of RET by HOXB5 and NKX2-1. 	In contrast to the synergistic activation of RET with NKX2-1, HOXB5 cooperates in an additive manner with SOX10, PAX3 and PHOX2B in trans-activation of RET promoter. Taken together, our data suggests that HOXB5 in coordination with other transcription factors mediates RET expression. 
PMC3108997	rs10900296	Abstract	RefSNP	False	NKX2-1 binds at the region overlapping with the transcription start site, and mediates RET transcription [13]. 	HSCR associated SNPs at the NKX2-1 binding site (-5G>A rs10900296; -1A>C rs10900297) reduce NKX2-1 binding and trans-activation of RET [13], [14], [18], [29]–[31]. 	These promoter SNPs have no direct effect on HOXB5 trans-activation activity, but abolish the synergistic interaction between HOXB5 and NKX2-1 on RET transcription, indicating that binding of NKX2-1 to the promoter is required for HOXB5 and NKX2-1 to work synergistically in mediating RET expression. NKX2-1 is a developmentally regulated homeodomain transcription factor [32], and possesses two transcriptional activation domains that interacts with other proteins to regulate target gene transcription [33]. 
PMC5790512	rs2294008	Abstract	RefSNP	False		SNP rs2294008 in Prostate Stem Cell Antigen (PSCA) and decreased PSCA expression are associated with gastric cancer. 	The objective of this study is to investigate the role of rs2294008 and PSCA expression in the gastritis-gastric cancer carcinogenic pathway. We conducted a case-control association study of H. pylori-infected gastritis and gastric cancer. 
PMC5790512	rs2294008	Discussion	RefSNP	False	We conducted a case-control association study of H. pylori-infected gastritis and gastric cancer. 	rs2294008 was associated with the progression to chronic active gastritis (P = 9.4 × 10–5; odds ratio = 3.88, TT + TC vs CC genotype), but not with H. pylori infection per se nor with the progression from active gastritis to gastric cancer. 	
PMC5790512	rs2294008	Abstract	RefSNP	False	In addition, H. pylori infection causes various diseases such as gastroduodenal ulcers and MALT lymphoma. 	Previous genome-wide association studies have revealed the association of SNP rs2294008 in Prostate Stem Cell Antigen (PSCA) with two H. pylori related diseases, gastric cancer and duodenal ulcer [10, 11]. 	The C allele of rs2294008 increases duodenal ulcer risk and the T allele increases gastric cancer and chronic atrophic gastritis risk [12], while rs2294008 was not associated with H. pylori susceptibility [13], suggesting the important role of this variation in clinical outcomes after H. pylori infection. rs2294008 was associated with PSCA mRNA expression in normal gastric tissues and gastric cancer.

Although the gastric cancer-risk T allele is associated with a higher expression of PSCA mRNA, PSCA expression in gastric cancer tissues decreases. 
PMC5790512	rs2294008	Discussion	RefSNP	False	The C allele of rs2294008 increases duodenal ulcer risk and the T allele increases gastric cancer and chronic atrophic gastritis risk [12], while rs2294008 was not associated with H. pylori susceptibility [13], suggesting the important role of this variation in clinical outcomes after H. pylori infection. 	rs2294008 was associated with PSCA mRNA expression in normal gastric tissues and gastric cancer. 	Although the gastric cancer-risk T allele is associated with a higher expression of PSCA mRNA, PSCA expression in gastric cancer tissues decreases. Therefore, the role of PSCA in gastric carcinogenesis remains largely unknown [10, 14]. 
PMC5790512	rs2294008	Results	RefSNP	False	The characteristics of the participants are summarized in Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1. 	The role of the SNP rs2294008 in the gastritis-gastric cancer carcinogenic pathway 	To investigate the role of the PSCA variation in gastric cancer and precancerous conditions, we genotyped rs2294008 using DNA from patients at different disease stages (Table 2). As previously reported [10, 12, 13, 16], the T allele of rs2294008 was significantly associated with gastric cancer risk when we used H. pylori-negative individuals as a control (P = 4.5 × 10−6; OR = 1.37).

Then, we examined the impact of rs2294008 on the gastritis-gastric cancer carcinogenic pathway. There was no significant difference in the allelic frequency between H. pylori-carriers and H. pylori-negative controls (P = 0.15; OR = 1.14), indicating that rs2294008 is not associated with susceptibility to H. pylori infection. 
PMC5790512	rs2294008	Results	RefSNP	True		Scheme of SNP rs2294008 contribution to the diseases related with H. pylori infection including gastritis, gastric cancer, and duodenal ulcer 	
PMC5790512	rs2294008	Results	RefSNP	False	These results indicated that individuals with the TT or the TC genotype are susceptible to the progression to severe gastritis after H. pylori-infection and consequently have a high risk for gastric cancer. 	The association of the PSCA expression with SNP rs2294008, H. pylori infection, and the severity of gastritis 	Next, we evaluated PSCA mRNA in the background gastric mucosa of the incisura angularis at different disease stages. PSCA expression in H. pylori-infected patients (n = 280) was significantly lower than that in H. pylori-negative controls (n = 28) (Figure 2A, P = 5.1 × 10−8), but PSCA expression was not associated with gastritis stage (Figure 2A, P = 0.28). Moreover, PSCA expression increased after H. pylori eradication in 133 paired samples (Figure 2B, P < 1 × 10−11). 
PMC5790512	rs2294008	Results	RefSNP	False	Then, we analyzed the correlation of rs2294008 with PSCA expression. 	rs2294008 was significantly associated with PSCA expression at all disease stages (Figure 3A–3D, Supplementary Figure 2A–3D, P = 1.8 × 10−4 in H. pylori-negative, 1.3 × 10−12 in H. pylori-infected, 3.6 × 10−8 in mild gastritis, and 8.2 × 10−6 in severe gastritis). 	Consistent with our results, Sung et al. [14] reported that PSCA expression was associated with rs2294008 in gastric cancer tissues and non-tumor mucosa from gastric cancer patients. These results indicated that the T allele is associated with higher PSCA expression regardless of H. pylori infection status or disease stage. 
PMC5790512	rs2294008	Results	RefSNP	True	The P value was calculated by a Wilcoxon signed rank test. 	The association of SNP rs2294008 with PSCA expression 	Box-plots with medians for PSCA expression normalized to ACTB in biopsy samples of gastric mucosa. The P values were calculated by a Kruskal-Wallis test. 
PMC5790512	rs2294008	Discussion	RefSNP	False	However, decreased PSCA expression was documented in gastric cancer, gallbladder cancer, and head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma, representing the complexity of PSCA function and PSCA regulation in various tissues [10–13, 16, 18–22]. 	Fu et al. [23] reported that the T allele of rs2294008 was associated with higher PSCA expression in both bladder cancers and in normal tissues. 	Because PSCA is upregulated in bladder cancer tissue and T allele carriers are associated with higher PSCA expression, the T allele is associated with a higher bladder cancer risk. However, the role of PSCA in gastric cancer development is not well understood, since PSCA expression was suppressed in gastric cancer tissues while the risk T allele is associated with higher PSCA expression. 
PMC5790512	rs2294008	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Here, we identified the novel roles of a host genetic factor and bacterial infection in the regulation of PSCA expression in H. pylori induced active gastritis. 	rs2294008 was associated with disease progression to severe gastritis after H. pylori infection, but not with the development of gastric cancer after severe gastritis. 	In addition, a subgroup analysis using SNP genotypes revealed that only T allele carriers showed decreased PSCA expression in the progression from mild gastritis to severe gastritis. Here, we found that the CC genotype is associated with a low risk for progression to severe gastritis, which is consistent with our previous report that demonstrated an increased risk for duodenal ulcers in CC genotypes (Figure 1) [11, 24]. 
PMC5790512	rs2294008	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Long form of cell surface PSCA protein encoded by T allele was shown to promote cell proliferation [22, 25], while short cytosolic PSCA proteins associated with the C allele are rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin proteasomal pathway [11]. 	Therefore, C allele of rs2294008 is associated with low PSCA expression at mRNA and protein level. H. pylori infection has a strong impact among T allele carriers, because H. pylori infection remarkably suppress PSCA expression which is highly expressed in normal gastric mucosal tissues without H. pylori infection. 	In contrast, subjects with the CC genotype are unlikely to be affected by H. pylori infection because they express PSCA mRNA and protein at very low level regardless of H. pylori infection. Interestingly, individuals with a nonsense SNP (rs138377917[A]) of PSCA that lack functional PSCA protein is associated with a low risk for gastric cancer [26]. 
PMC5790512	rs138377917	Discussion	RefSNP	False	In contrast, subjects with the CC genotype are unlikely to be affected by H. pylori infection because they express PSCA mRNA and protein at very low level regardless of H. pylori infection. 	Interestingly, individuals with a nonsense SNP (rs138377917[A]) of PSCA that lack functional PSCA protein is associated with a low risk for gastric cancer [26]. 	These lines of evidence clearly demonstrate that genotypes related with loss of functional PSCA (C allele of rs2294008 and A allele of rs138377917) are associated with a reduced risk for gastric cancer. There are some limitations in this study because only endoscopy-based Japanese patients were analyzed.

In addition, we did not examine CagA of H. pylori, but almost all Japanese H. pylori have CagA proteins and 95% of them are the East-Asia-type [1]. 
PMC3434304	rs1876828	Abstract	RefSNP	False	Inhaled corticosteroids are the most commonly used controller medications prescribed for asthma. 	Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs1876828 in CRHR1 and rs37973 in GLCCI1, have previously been associated with corticosteroid efficacy. 	We studied data from four existing clinical trials of asthmatics who received inhaled corticosteroids and had lung function measured by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) before and after the period of such treatment. We combined the two SNPs rs37973 and rs1876828 into a predictive test of FEV1 change using a Bayesian model, which identified patients with good or poor steroid response (highest or lowest quartile, respectively) with predictive performance of 65.7% (p = 0.039 vs. random) area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve in the training population and 65.9% (p = 0.025 vs. random) in the test population.

These findings show that two genetic variants can be combined into a predictive test that achieves similar accuracy and superior replicability compared with single SNP predictors. 
PMC3434304	rs1876828	Introduction	RefSNP	False	However, such tests have proven difficult to develop. 	Two SNPs have demonstrated association with ICS response in asthma patients, rs1876828 in the corticotrophin releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1) gene, and rs37973 in the glucocorticoid induced transcript 1 (GLCCI1) gene. 	
PMC3434304	rs37973	Methods	RefSNP	False	We used this dataset for replication of our original result obtained in SOCS/SLIC. 	The SNP rs37973 was genotyped using Taqman (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in SOCS/SLIC and LOCCS, where the average completion rate exceeded 98%. 	The rs1876828 SNP was genotyped using Sequonom (Sequenom, San Diego, CA) in SOCS/SLIC (completion > 96.8%) and LOCCS (completion > 99.6%). In the IMPACT trial, genotype data was obtained from DbGaP (The database of Genotypes and Phenotypes, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap), where results of Affymetrix 6.0 Array assays are available. 
PMC3434304	rs1876828	Methods	RefSNP	False	Both SNPs are absent on this platform, and accordingly were imputed in IMPACT using the Markov Chain Haplotyping program (MaCH)(18), based on 1000 Human Genomes Project(19) data. 	We used maximum posterior genotype dosage, called to the nearest genotype, with both SNPs having high-confidence imputation (r2 = .901 for rs1876828 and r2 = .986 for rs37973). 	
PMC3434304	rs37973	Results	RefSNP	False	Since the interaction of these two SNPs has not been investigated in any dataset or previous study, the LOCCS/IMPACT dataset represents an important replication of the interaction of these SNPs in a predictive model. 	To guide our predictive model selection process, we computed a test of the interactions of the SNPs rs37973 and rs1876828 with baseline FEV1 change using Bayes Factors. 	This resulted in a significant categorical association of rs1876828 (p < 0.008, permutation test) and a linear (additive) association of rs37973 approaching significance (p < 0.051, permutation test) in the SOCS/SLIC dataset. We therefore assumed a model where rs37973 has a linear effect on the outcome and rs1876828 has a categorical effect.

We therefore assumed a model where rs37973 has a linear effect on the outcome and rs1876828 has a categorical effect. 	We combined these SNPs into a Bayesian network that can accommodate both linear and categorical effects, known as a Conditional Gaussian Bayesian Network. Bayesian networks are a modeling tool that have been used to predict outcomes in various diseases, including atherosclerosis(27), stroke(28), and bronchodilator response in asthmatics.(13) 
PMC3434304	rs1867828	Results	RefSNP	False		No significant genotype effects were found for rs1867828. 	With big effects for rs37973 genotypes, particularly in LOCCS/IMPACT, we tried predicting FEV1 change with just this one SNP. In this case we predicted reasonably in LOCCS/IMPACT, with AUC of 66% in adjusted FEV1 on highest and lowest quartiles (p = 0.026). 
PMC3434304	rs37973	Results	RefSNP	False	The same trend was observed in LOCCS/IMPACT, but did not reach statistical significance (AUC 70%, p = 0.131). 	Considering only rs1876828 homozygotes increased the allelic odds ratios for the major allele of rs37973 in SOCS/SLIC for proclivity to highest-quartile FEV1 change vs. lowest-quartile FEV1 change (odds ratio 4.3, p = 0.029); and we observed a slight increase in LOCCS/IMPACT (odds ratio 3.0, p = 0.048; compared with unstratified allelic odds ratio in LOCCS/IMPACT of 2.4, discussed above). 	While rs37973 showed a strong linear effect in LOCCS/IMPACT and a weaker effect in SOCS/SLIC, to build a model that robustly predicts FEV1 change across datasets, the additional effect modification of rs1876828 was needed. It is this effect modification that is embodied in the conditional Gaussian Bayesian network, and this effect modification that lead to the robust prediction of that model.

PMC3434304	rs37973	Discussion	RefSNP	False	We found that two genetic variants can be combined into a predictive test that achieves reasonable accuracy and similar replicability. 	We found that the SNPs, rs37973 in GLCCI1 and rs1876828 in CRHR1, can distinguish individuals who are very good responders to ICS therapy from very poor responders with an accuracy of 65.7% AUC in SOCS/SLIC (p = 0.039) and of 65.9% AUC in LOCCS/IMPACT (p = 0.025). 	Furthermore, a two-SNP model had replicated accuracy above random in both datasets, while neither SNP alone achieved this (AUC 63%, p = 0.114 for rs37973; and AUC 54%, p ~= 0.9 for rs1876828), owing to the SNPs’ nonlinear interaction. Because activation of CRHR1 triggers the release of cortisol, it was theorized that decrease in function or expression of CRHR1 would therefore lead to diminished natural steroid levels, and thus patients in this category may exhibit an increased response to administered corticosteroids compared with wildtype patients.(4) Such a simple arrangement was not observed in our present study.

However, it is worth noting that the SNP under investigation here, rs1876828, is in linkage disequilibrium with a major inversion polymorphism on chromosome 17, which measures 900kb and encompasses the entire CRHR1 gene.(29) It has been argued that this inversion itself is the main driver of CRHR1 association with steroid response,(30) although the exact mechanism of this is unknown.

The glucocorticoids induced transcript 1 (GLCCI1), located at chromosome 7p21.3, is comparatively unstudied. The GLCCI1 SNP rs37973 has recently been shown to be associated with steroid response in asthmatics.(5) This study contained functional validation suggesting that rs37973 was an expression-SNP for GLCCI1, where the minor allele at rs37973 was associated with decreases of GLCCI1 expression.(5)

However, this has not so far been replicated in an independent population. 
PMC3434304	rs1876828	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Additionally, our results are dependent on the populations that were used to build the models; these were white adult asthma patients with mild or moderate asthma. 	The results may not generalize to children or other ethnic groups where the haplotypes and patterns of linkage disequilibrium mean that the rs1876828 SNP may not indicate who has the CRHR1 inversion (for example: a different CRHR1 SNP was implicated for ICS response in a Korean population).(6) It may be that a dearth of homozygous individuals at rs1876828 leads to our unusual nonlinear effect observed in effect modification of rs37973 by rs1876828. 	Our predictive model answers the question clinicians have long asked of gene-association studies: given these associated SNPs, what can be done with them? We have shown that even just two SNPs can be combined into a model that achieves predictive accuracy that is statistically better than chance on separate populations. 
PMC6519033	rs10622653	Results	RefSNP	False	We first tested our algorithm on a 103 kb region on human chromosome 21. 	Therefore, we sampled the region between SNPs rs10622653 and rs2299784, a region in the human genome in which recombination was characterized at high resolution by sperm typing (Tiemann‐Boege, Calabrese, Cochran, Sokol, & Arnheim, 2006). 	Taking data from The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium (2015), we randomly chose 25 individuals for each of five subpopulations from five European regions (TSI, FIN, IBS, GBR, CEU). We reformatted files from vcf‐ to fasta‐format with the R packages (Knaus & Grünwald, 2017; Paradis, Claude, & Strimmer, 2004) using two sequences per (diploid) sample and the reference sequence 80.37 (GRCH37) from The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium (2015). 
PMC4746781	rs6136	Results	RefSNP	False	In addition, polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor have been proposed as early clinical predictors of the development of a more aggressive form of cachexia in cancer patients [165]. 	Furthermore, the 1082G allele in the IL-10 promoter [166] and the C allele of the rs6136 polymorphism in the P-selectin gene have been validated as pro-cachectic genotypes [167]. 	These findings point towards the close relationship between the innate immune system and cancer cachexia. However, genome-wide studies are currently lacking, and the role of genetic predisposition has not yet been fully clarified [168]. 
PMC4716748	rs2619681	Abstract	RefSNP	False	The variant rs1801320G>C showed no significant differences in the frequencies of the genotypes and alleles in the patients and the control groups. 	The CC genotype and C allele frequency of rs2619681 (C>T) variant were significantly (P=0.012) higher in cancer patients, whereas the T allele showed a protective effect against cancer development. 	The frequencies of the three single-nucleotide polymorphisms did not differ in cancer patients with different tumor grades and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status (+ or −). However, the genotype frequency of rs1801320 (135G>C) differed in the patients with estrogen receptor (ER)+ and ER−, where CC genotype showed a significantly higher prevalence in the females with ER− who were suffering from breast cancer.

In the Saudi females, rs1801320 did not show an association with risk of breast cancer. Taken together, the results suggest that RAD51 rs1801321 polymorphism may be involved in the etiology of breast cancer in the Saudi females; however, further studies are necessary to confirm this relation. 
PMC4716748	rs1801320	Introduction	RefSNP	False		To the best of our knowledge, since no studies have been reported on the association between SNPs in RAD51 and susceptibility to breast cancer development in Saudi females, we initiated this study on three SNPs in RAD51 [rs1801320 (G>C), rs1801321 (G>T), and rs2619681 (C>T)] in a group of Saudi breast cancer patients and compared the results with normal healthy controls. 	This article presents our findings and shows a close relation between the susceptibility to breast cancer development and some of the polymorphic sites in RAD51. 
PMC4716748	rs1801321	Methods	RefSNP	False	Three SNPs in RAD51 were selected and genotyped. 	Two SNPs [rs1801321 (G>T) and rs2619681 (C>T)] were analyzed using TaqMan allelic discrimination assay and one, rs1801320 (G>C), was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) (designed using PRIMER3). 	RFLP primers were validated by sequencing the PCR products. For TaqMan genotyping assay, the primers and probe mixture were purchased directly through the assays-on-demand service of Thermo Fisher Scientific. 
PMC4716748	rs1801321	Results	RefSNP	False	The genotype and allele frequencies of the three SNPs investigated in the breast cancer patients and the controls are presented in Table 3. 	For rs1801321G>T, the majority of breast cancer patients were homozygous for the wild-type G allele and a strong relation was observed between rs1801321 polymorphism and breast cancer susceptibility. 	The GG genotype and G allele were strongly associated with an elevated risk of breast cancer in the Saudi population with P<0.0001. The mutant T, on the other hand, seems to provide protection against breast cancer development since the frequency of the TT and GT genotype was significantly lower in the patients compared to the controls (P<0.0001). 
PMC4716748	rs2619681	Results	RefSNP	False	However, the frequency of rs1801320 (135G>C) differed in the ER+ and ER−, where the CC genotype was significantly higher in the ER− breast cancer females. 	Finally, the allele frequency of C allele of rs2619681 C>T was significantly higher in the ER+ and PR+ breast cancer patients compared to that of the ER− and PR− patients. 	The results of rs2619681 C>T in the PR+ and ER+ breast cancer patients in comparison to those of the PR− and ER− breast cancer patients are presented in Table 5. 
PMC4716748	rs1801320	Discussion	RefSNP	False	In breast cancer patients, the studies also revealed contradictory results and showed both association and no association.7,8,18 This led to meta-analyses of the previous studies by different groups of researchers, and again, there were contradictions.19 These differences to some extent were related to the type of breast cancer, ie, sporadic or familial, and were due to different BRCA1 and 2 statuses of the patients. 	Since results of the previous studies were inconclusive, a recent extensive meta-analysis was conducted to determine the associations between RAD51 gene polymorphisms (rs1801320 135G>C and rs1801321 172G>T) and risk of cancer.33 This meta-analysis was performed on 54 published case–control studies. 	Among them, 42 studies with 19,142 cases and 20,363 controls were for rs1801320 135G>C polymorphism and 12 studies with 6,646 cases and 6,783 controls for rs1801321 172G>T polymorphism. The overall results showed that for 135G>C (rs1801320) polymorphism, the pooled results indicate significantly increased risk for overall cancers, especially breast cancer, while for rs1801321 172G>T (rs1801321) polymorphism, this meta-analysis showed a decreased cancer risk in head and neck cancers.

Despite the conclusive results of the comprehensive meta-analyses, our study presents another contradictory finding in Saudi breast cancer patients.

PMC5735770	rs58542926	Abstract	RefSNP	False	The participants were evaluated based on medical consultation, blood tests, and liver biopsies conducted before specific antiviral therapies were applied. 	The associations between the rs738409 PNPLA3 gene polymorphism and steatosis and advanced fibrosis were tested under a recessive inheritance model using logistic regression analysis, including age, gender, BMI, ethnicity/color, HOMA-IR, alcohol intake, HCV genotype 3, and the rs58542926 TM6SF2 gene polymorphism as covariates. 	
PMC5735770	rs58542926	Methods	RefSNP	False	The images were recorded to digital files. 	Regarding the rs58542926 polymorphism (C>T) of the TM6SF2 gene, samples were subjected to a real-time PCR using the system “TaqMan genotyping assay”, dbSNP rs58542926 assay C_89463510_10, #4351379 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) on a StepOnePlus™ (96-well) Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). 	The assay was standardized in a final volume of 25 μL: 12.5 μL of TaqMan MasterMix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), 0.63 μL of Genotyping Assay 40X (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), 0.63 μL of ultrapure water (Promega, Fitchburg, Wisconsin, USA), and 11.25 μL of genomic DNA. The cycling was as follows: 95°C for 10 minutes, followed by 50 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds and 60°C for 1 minute, and finally, 60°C for 1 minute. 
PMC5735770	rs738409	Methods	RefSNP	False	Genetic inheritance model 	The role of the polymorphism rs738409 of the PNPLA3 gene on steatosis and fibrosis was investigated using the recessive genetic inheritance model, comparing patients with the homozygous G allele (GG genotype) with patients with one or no copy of the G allele (CG or CC). 	The model of recessive genetic inheritance was chosen, based on previous results of studies on the association between genotypes of polymorphism rs738409 PNPLA3 and fibrosis in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and Hepatitis C performed by other authors [7, 14]. In addition, in order to better understand the risk associated with the rs738409 polymorphism of the PNPLA3 gene, we compared, as an additional analysis, patients with the G allele (CG+GG) and patients with the genotype CC (dominant model) and patients with GG genotype and patients with genotype CC (additive model).

Finally, as a secondary objective, we evaluated the role of the gene TM6SF2 E167K variant in the occurrence of the same outcomes. 
PMC5735770	rs58542926	Abstract	RefSNP	False	As a secondary objective, we evaluated the role of the TM6SF2 gene E167K variant in the occurrence of the same outcomes. 	The associations between the rs738409 PNPLA3 gene polymorphism and steatosis and advanced fibrosis were tested using logistic regression analysis, including age, gender, BMI, ethnicity/color, HOMA-IR, alcohol intake, HCV genotype 3, and the rs58542926 TM6SF2 gene polymorphism as covariates. 	The effect on advanced fibrosis was evaluated by comparing patients with no fibrosis, mild fibrosis, or moderate fibrosis (F0-F1-F2) with those with severe fibrosis or cirrhosis (F3-F4). The presence of steatosis was studied as a qualitative variable (< 5% versus ≥ 5%). 
PMC5735770	rs738409	Results	RefSNP	False	The most frequent GG genotype of the PNPLA3 gene was found in white Brazilians (35.4%), followed by pardo (23.3%) and black (19.1%) Brazilians. 	Thus, the highest frequency of the PNPLA3 allele G was found in white Brazilians (45.6%), followed by black (35.7%) and pardo (34.9%) Brazilians; details of the clinical characteristics stratified by ethnicity and genotype polymorphism at rs738409 PNPLA3 are shown in Additional file 1. 	
PMC5735770	rs738409	Results	RefSNP	False		After adjusting for age, gender, BMI, HOMA-IR, ethnicity/color, alcohol use, HCV genotype 3, and TM6SF2 genotypes, the association between PNPLA3 rs738409 GG genotype and advanced fibrosis remained significant in the recessive model (p=0.01) (Table 2). 	The gene TM6SF2 E167K variant (genotype CT) was also associated advanced fibrosis (p=0.00). When analyzing the data, using the dominant and additive genetic inheritance model, we observed that patients with the GG genotype presented a higher risk of steatosis than patients with the CC genotype (p= 0.03, additive model) (Additional file 2). 
PMC5735770	rs738409	Discussion	RefSNP	False	The mechanism by which the E167K variant influences the severity of fibrosis is not known. 	In our study, rs58542926 TM6SF2 polymorphism was associated with advanced fibrosis independent of factors known to be associated with fibrosis, including the rs738409 PNPLA3 polymorphism. 	The highest frequency of the PNPLA3 allele G was found in white Brazilians (45.6%), followed by black (35.7%) and pardo (34.9%) Brazilians. The prevalence of the GG genotype found in the study (32.4%) was higher than those found in European (2.2% to 12%) [7, 30–32] and Japanese studies (17.7% to 21.2%) [33–36]. 
PMC5735770	rs738409	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Many Brazilians who define themselves as white may present African or Amerindian ancestors [38, 39], since in Brazil, individuals define themselves as white, black, or pardo based on skin color rather than on ancestry [11, 38, 39]. 	The mixture of ethnicities, even in patients who are considered white or black, could explain, at least in part, the different prevalence rates of the G allele of the rs738409 PNPLA3 gene polymorphism found in our study, although we could not locate the ethnic source of that difference. 	Our study has limitations. The participants were recruited from a single tertiary care center linked to the university, limiting the number of participants in the study. 
PMC5735770	rs58542926	Discussion	RefSNP	False	In addition, the interpretation of our findings is also limited by the lack of a comparison group (e.g., patients with chronic liver disease of other etiologies or healthy volunteers) to help contextualize the events and characteristics present in patients with HCV. 	Finally, despite these limitations, the data obtained should be added to the extant evidence regarding the roles that the rs738409 polymorphism of the PNPLA3 gene and the rs58542926 polymorphism of the TM6SF2 gene play in hepatic steatosis and advanced fibrosis among individuals with chronic hepatitis C. In addition, this study examined Brazilian patients, who (to the best of our knowledge) have not yet been studied from this perspective. 	
PMC5735770	rs738409	Conclusion	RefSNP	False	Associations between the rs738409 polymorphism PNPLA3 gene genotype GG and hepatic steatosis and advanced fibrosis were observed among Brazilian patients with chronic HCV. 	In addition, we found that the rs58542926 polymorphism of the TM6SF2 gene is associated with advanced liver fibrosis independent of rs738409 polymorphism of the PNPLA3 gene. 	Further studies are needed with comparison groups and larger numbers of patients to clarify the influence of the rs738409 polymorphism of the PNPLA3 gene and the rs58542926 polymorphism of the TM6SF2 gene (genotype CT) on hepatic steatosis and degree of fibrosis among individuals diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C.

These clinical data will need to be validated in independent, larger cohorts; however, in support of miR-146a being relevant in human alloimmunity, the amount in peripheral blood may prove to be a useful GVHD biomarker (43, 45).

The distributions of the genotypes for STAT3 rs744166 were 9.1% (TT), 42.6% (TC), and 48.3% (CC) in the cases and 36.4% (TT), 48.3% (TC), and 15.3% (CC) in control subjects (P = 0.01).

Additionally, STAT3 rs744166 showed a statistically significant association in further logistic regression analysis. Compared to the TT genotype carriers, the TC genotype (adjusted OR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.39–0.92, and P = 0.020) and CC genotype (adjusted OR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.21–0.80, and P = 0.009) carriers were both less frequent among cases than controls, suggesting a dominant effect of the C allele. 
PMC4017712	rs2293152	Results	RefSNP	False	Overall, C carriers (either TC or CC) were associated with a lower GC risk when compared to those carrying the TT genotype (adjusted OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.37–0.83, and P = 0.004). 	Conversely, the genotype and allele frequencies of locus rs2293152 did not show a significant difference between GC cases and controls. 	
PMC4017712	rs744166	Results	RefSNP	False		Stratified Analysis of STAT3 Polymorphism rs744166 and GC Risk 	We further evaluated the association between genotypes of these two selected SNPs of STAT3 and GC risk by stratified subgroups of age, sex, smoking status, drinking consumption, and family history of cancer, assuming a dominant genetic model (Table 3). Stratified analysis revealed that a decreased risk of GC was associated with the rs744166 TC+CC genotypes among subjects 60 years of age and older (adjusted OR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.26–0.90, and P = 0.021), but not in subjects less than 60 years old. 
PMC4017712	rs744166	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Based on previous studies, our case-control study detected the effect of STAT3 rs2293152 and rs744166 gene polymorphisms on GC. 	In our study, we found that subjects with the minor C allele of rs744166 had a decreased risk of developing GC compared to the common genotype in a Chinese population. 	However, we did not find any significant association between the rs2293152 gene polymorphism and risk of GC. Recently, increasing evidence shows that polymorphisms of the STAT3 gene are associated with various diseases [21, 31–33]. 
PMC4017712	rs744166	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Recently, increasing evidence shows that polymorphisms of the STAT3 gene are associated with various diseases [21, 31–33]. 	In a large German cohort study, a significant association was observed between the minor allele of STAT3 rs744166 and Crohn's disease (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.688–0.998, and P = 0.04) [31]. 	Similarly, Danoy et al. identified STAT3 rs744166 as a susceptible loci of ankylosing spondylitis (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.77–0.91, and P = 2.6 × 10−5) in a population of white European ancestry from the UK, USA, Canada, and Australia [34]. Moreover, Jiang et al. reported that the minor allele of rs744166 significantly decreased the risk of nonsmall cell lung cancer in a Chinese population [20].

Moreover, Jiang et al. reported that the minor allele of rs744166 significantly decreased the risk of nonsmall cell lung cancer in a Chinese population [20]. 	These findings on the rs744166 C allele and the decreased risk of GC in the present study are consistent with reported results. However, the results of our study on rs2293152 show variation from previous research. 
PMC4017712	rs744166	Discussion	RefSNP	False	These differences could potentially be the result of varying environmental backgrounds, ethnic groups, and sample sizes. 	Furthermore, our present study revealed a decreased effect with the C allele of rs744166 in subgroups of males, smokers, and drinkers. 	Stratified analysis suggested that the association between the C allele of rs744166 and the risk of GC was more profound in males than females. A previous study reported that noncardia cancer was more common in males than females by a ratio of approximately 2 : 1, and gastric cardia cancer had a ratio of nearly 4.1 : 1 in a Chinese population [35].

A previous study reported that noncardia cancer was more common in males than females by a ratio of approximately 2 : 1, and gastric cardia cancer had a ratio of nearly 4.1 : 1 in a Chinese population [35]. Our data suggests that STAT3 polymorphism may play an important role in males with GC. 
PMC4017712	rs744166	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Meanwhile, for drinking, previous reports suggested that alcohol consumption is one of the risk factors of GC as well [38, 39]. 	In our present study, it is also suggested that the influence of the C allele of rs744166 on GC was more critical in subgroups of smokers and drinkers. 	The underlying mechanism involved in the association between STAT3 and smoking and drinking is not clear. It is likely that smoking and drinking might significantly induce STAT3 expression, and it is possible that the C allele of rs744166 leads to a higher basal expression level of STAT3 under unnormal circumstances.

Therefore, the subjects carrying the C allele of rs744166 might not have decreased GC risk under normal conditions but might have a reduced risk when exposed to tobacco and alcohol that might induce STAT3 expression in response. Interestingly, we found that the influence of C allele of rs744166 disappeared in the subjects with family history, although it existed in all study subjects.

Positive family history was reported as a strong and consistent risk factor for GC due to the combination result of a number of alleles [40, 41].

Therefore, the decreased risk effect of rs744166 in subjects with family history may be overwhelmed by the role of familial aggregation, which may partly contribute to the results we observed. 
PMC4017712	rs744166	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Epidemiologic studies have found that fruits are associated with a decreased risk of GC [44]. 	In this study, we found a significant combination effect between fresh fruit consumption and the C allele of rs744166 in decreasing the risk of GC. 	Meanwhile, lifestyle choices such as long-term irregular eating habits and the methods of storing food may also be important factors for GC in this Chinese population. To our knowledge, this is the first study to be concerned with the interaction between the STAT3 gene polymorphisms and environmental factors for the risk of GC; further studies are needed to confirm this phenomena and a mechanistic explanation for our findings needs to be explored. 
PMC4017712	rs744166	Discussion	RefSNP	False	These related issues will need to be addressed in our future studies. 	In conclusion, our data provided the first evidence that the C allele of STAT3 rs744166 is associated with decreased GC risk in a Chinese population. 	The minor C allele of rs744166 may correlate with STAT3 expression and thus exert a protective effect on GC development. Additional large-scale, well-designed studies that include environmental factors are required to further validate the role of STAT3 gene polymorphisms in GC risk.

PMC3604173	rs10802996	Discussion	RefSNP	False	The relevance of these findings to our study may be substantial; indeed, since fibroids rarely develop into malignant tumors and eventually will shrink sometime prior to menopause or afterwards, delayed DNA damage-induced apoptosis would be an attractive model for the pathogenesis of UL. 	Several non-synonymous SNPs and non-coding SNPs in the gene promoter including rs10802996, a SNP associated with cervical cancer [38], and in the 3′ UTR sequences to downstream of EXO1 showed significant associations with the risk of UL and the 4-level tumor growth outcome. 	Two other genes of potential relevance to tumor growth, MAP1LC3C (microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 gamma) and PLD5 (phospholipase D family, member 5) colocalize to chromosome 1q43. MAP1LC3C encodes an ortholog of the yeast autophagosome protein Atg8 [39], which is essential for autophagy. Both oncogenesis and tumor survival are influenced by perturbations of the molecular machinery that controls autophagy.

PMC3170315	rs3804099	Abstract	RefSNP	False	Analysis of 7 SNPs in TLR2, 7 SNPs in TLR3 and 8 SNPs in TLR4 showed statistically significant differences in distribution of inferred haplotypes between cases and controls. 	No individual polymorphism was associated with disease susceptibility except for the observed tendency for TLR2-rs3804099 (odds ratio OR  = 1.15, 95% CI 0.99–1.34, p = 0.07) and TLR4-rs2149356 (OR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.73–1.00, p = 0.06). 	Both polymorphisms were part of the haplotypes associated with risk modulation. An improved overall survival (Hazard ratio HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.32–0.88) and survival following metastasis (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.34–0.91) were observed in carriers of the variant allele (D299G) of TLR4-rs4986790.

An improved overall survival (Hazard ratio HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.32–0.88) and survival following metastasis (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.34–0.91) were observed in carriers of the variant allele (D299G) of TLR4-rs4986790. 	In addition various TLR2, TLR4 and TLR5 haplotypes were associated with increased overall survival. Our results point to a novel association between TLR gene variants and haplotypes with melanoma survival. 
PMC3170315	rs3923647	Results	RefSNP	False	Genotype distributions of all polymorphisms in controls did not show statistically significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. 	Out of 47TLR SNPs analyzed by Sequenom mass spectrometry TLR1-rs3923647 and TLR1-rs5743613, TLR2-rs5743704 and -rs5743708, TLR4-rs11536869 and -rs11536897 and TLR6-rs5743815 had minor allele frequencies <0.05; no carrier of variant allele for TLR9-rs5743846 was detected. 	In total, the genotyping results of 47 SNPs represent 99 polymorphisms in the selected TLR genes. 
PMC3170315	rs3804099	Results	RefSNP	False	We did not observe any differences in the distribution of allele and genotype frequencies between melanoma cases and controls (Table S1, online only). 	The variant allele for TLR2-rs3804099 was associated with an increased risk (OR = 1.15, 95% CI 0.99–1.34, p = 0.07) and for TLR4-rs2149356 with a decreased risk (OR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.73–1.00, p = 0.06) of melanoma.

The haplotype includes the minor allele of TLR2-rs2149356 that associated individually with a protective effect.

PMC3170315	rs4986790	Results	RefSNP	False	Differences in survival according to genotype were investigated based on 622 patients with melanoma of the skin with known primary at first diagnosis without detectable metastasis (stage I/II) (339 males and 283 females out of 763 patients in total). 	The OS from primary diagnosis was better in carriers of the minor allele (n = 81) of the TLR4-rs4986790 polymorphism than among non-carriers (n = 536). 	The median OS in carriers was 18.1 years (95% CI 12.1–24.4) compared to 11.0 years (95% CI 9.5–12.9) in non-carriers (log-rank p = 0.005, Figure 1A and Table 2). Cox regression adjusted for age, gender and Breslow thickness showed a decreased survival with a HR of 0.53, 95% CI 0.32–0.88, p = 0.01, Table 2) for carriers of the minor allele. 
PMC3170315	rs3804100	Results	RefSNP	False	The TLR4-rs4986790 polymorphism did not associate with time from primary diagnosis to first metastasis (Table 2). 	Carriers of the variant allele of TLR2-rs3804100 (TC/CC) also showed a reduced OS (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.29–1.05, p = 0.07). 	Adjustment for any therapy at any clinical stage did not show an effect (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.27–1.01, p = 0.05).

Among 13 patients with rs4986790 = AG and rs3804100 = TC/CC, no death was observed ten years after diagnosis. The survival heterogeneity among the four categories of individuals resulted in a probability value from the log-rank test of 0.01, which increased to 0.03 after inclusion of age, gender and Breslow thickness in a subsequent Cox regression. 
PMC3170315	rs4986790	Discussion	RefSNP	False	We assumed that genetic polymorphisms in various TLRs were functional and influenced melanoma susceptibility and disease outcome. 	Our data showed that melanoma patients carrying the variant allele for the rs4986790 polymorphism in the TLR4 gene were associated with a prolonged OS. 	The increase in survival was confined to the period after the detection of a first metastasis, which implied that the effect of the polymorphism might possibly modulated dependent on therapy or alternatively by biological processes associated with melanoma cell migration and/or invasion. The patients in stage IV melanoma in most instances received a chemotherapy containing DTIC/temozolomide and interferons, which is known for long time not having any clinical effect on overall survival of the entire metastatic melanoma population [14], [15]. 
PMC3170315	rs4986790	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Further patient-based and functional studies, will be required to confirm the correlation between polymorphisms and survival. 	It is also worth noting that colon cancer patients carrying the minor allele of TLR4-rs4986790 exhibited worse progression free survival and OS after treatment with chemotherapy [19]. 	On the other hand, a comprehensive Swedish study on 20 TLR signaling pathway genes found significant association between two polymorphisms with prostate cancer mortality that did not include TLR4-rs4986790 [20]. Thus, even if modulated HMGB-1 signaling might be due to the effects of TLR4-rs4986790, the outcome in terms of OS is difficult to predict as the TLR ligation can have pleiotropic effects on cellular differentiation and growth.

The variant alleles of the two polymorphisms showed a tendency towards association with susceptibility but not strong enough to rule out a chance finding.

The variant allele of TLR4-rs2149356, exhibited association with decreased risk of melanoma that was not statistically significant. 	However, the haplotype containing the same variant allele was associated with statistically significant decreased risk. TLR4-rs2149356 is located in intron 2 of the gene and is linked with four other polymorphisms at the locus. One of which is located in intron 1 (rs1927911) and three (rs10116253, rs2737190, rs1927914) in the 5′end of the gene.

PMC5988145	rs662799	Introduction	RefSNP	False	More importantly, the study has examined the association between the APOA5 rs2075291 SNP and CAD. 	Therefore, in the present study, we chose two common SNPs, rs662799 and rs651821, and SNP rs2075291, which has not been described in a northeastern Chinese population and performed a case–control study to evaluate (1) whether APOA5 polymorphisms rs662799, rs651821, rs2075291 and their haplotypes are associated with CAD in a northeastern Chinese population and (2) whether TG acted as a mediator of the associations of the APOA5 polymorphisms with CAD using a mediation model.

Here, ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’ and ‘cr’ are used to represent the coefficients in the mediation analysis model. The number of APOA5 rs651821 G alleles positively correlated with CAD (c=0.9029, p<0.001). 
PMC5988145	rs662799	Discussion	RefSNP	False		Our case–control study including Chinese subjects revealed that SNPs rs662799 and rs651821 were significantly associated with an increased risk of CAD that was accompanied by elevated plasma TG levels after adjusting for age, gender, BMI, smoking status, drinking status, SBP and DBP. 	The C allele frequency of APOA5 rs662799 (30%) observed here was similar to frequencies observed in previously studies of Japanese17 and Chinese subjects7 18 19 but was much higher than the frequency reported for Caucasian populations (10%).

PMC5988145	rs651821	Results	RefSNP	False	Researchers have not clearly determined whether the increased risk of CAD is due to the function of APOA5 per se or mediated by changes in the atherogenic lipid profile. 	Hence, we used a mediation model to examine whether TG levels acted as a mediator of the associations of the APOA5 rs651821 and rs662799 polymorphisms with CAD. 	TG levels were a significant mediator in this model. The mediation model was used for the first time to analyse the associations between APOA5 polymorphisms, TG levels and CAD. 
PMC5988145	rs662799	Conclusion	RefSNP	False		In conclusion, APOA5 SNPs rs662799 and rs651821 were significantly associated with an increased risk of CAD and accompanied by elevated plasma TG levels. 	According to the results of the mediation analysis, the effects of rs662799 and rs651821 on CAD were mediated by TG levels. 
PMC5721696	rs9989419	Abstract	RefSNP	False	CETP variants that had associations with lipid profiles in previous studies were extracted for drawing of the linkage disequilibrium (LD) plot. 	Among CETP variants, the rs9989419 best represented this genome wide association signal across all populations, based on LD r2 estimates from 1000 genomes references. 	In the 23 found eligible studies (clinical trials and observational), the TaqIB and I405V polymorphisms were the two most intensively studied. Two studies reported the effect of interaction between rs3764261 and diet on lipid levels. 
PMC5721696	rs3764261	Introduction	RefSNP	False		In a Chinese population optimum LD was reported for two groups of SNPs: rs3764261 and rs12149545; rs711752 and 708,272; also there was high LD for rs5882 and rs1801706 [24]. 	Strong significant associations were reported between CETP rs1532624 and HDL-C levels in Europeans and Mexicans, the P-values of which increased after adjustment of diet and physical activity in the model, indicating that this genetic effect may be mediated by environmental factors [14, 25]. Also some studies have reported that dietary habits might interact with these genetic variations in relation to dyslipidemia [6, 23, 26].

Among CETP variants reported to be associated with lipid levels, the SNP rs9989419 had best represented this genome wide association signal across all populations based on LD r2 estimates from 1000 genome references Of the 23 full text articles and the one abstract found eligible, 16 studies were interventional (Table 2), and eight studies were observational (Tables 3-4); all of the studies assessed the genotype distribution for each CETP SNP and found them to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

Among CETP variants reported to be associated with lipid levels, the SNP rs9989419 had best represented this genome wide association signal across all populations based on LD r2 estimates from 1000 genome references 	Of the 23 full text articles and the one abstract found eligible, 16 studies were interventional (Table 2), and eight studies were observational (Tables 3-4); all of the studies assessed the genotype distribution for each CETP SNP and found them to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The subjects included in these studies consisted mostly of adult individuals (only one study included prepubertal children [33] but comprised different risk groups, including healthy [6, 7, 21, 26, 34–41], obese and overweight [22], hypercholesterolemic [33, 42–45], familial hypercholesterolemic [46], diabetic, and high CVD risk subjects [30, 47, 48]. 
PMC5721696	rs3764261	Results	RefSNP	False	These studies were conducted in several different countries, including New Zealand [23, 26, 39, 41], Israel [6, 22], the United States [7, 38, 42, 49], Europe [30, 33, 35, 40, 46–48, 50], China [34, 51], Brazil [43, 44], Japan [21], Iran [36], and Canada [37, 45]. 	The studies examined the effects of the following individual or combinations of polymorphisms: Taq1B (17 studies), I405V (7 studies), rs3764261 (2 studies), C > T/In9 (one study), and rs183130 (1 study). 	In the context of genetic variation of CETP and dietary interactions, the TaqIB and then I405V polymorphisms were the two most intensively studied. 
PMC5721696	rs3764261	Results	RefSNP	False		Sixteen intervention studies examined four of SNPs of the CETP gene: Taq1B (10 studies), I405V (6 studies), rs3764261 (2 studies), C > T/In9 (1 study). 	Eleven studies examined the effects of dietary fatty acids and the Mediterranean (Med) diet intervention on the relation of CETP variations and metabolic traits; other studies examined the effects of dietary interventions with kiwifruit and plant sterols on lipid profiles. The duration of the interventions varied from 6 days to 2 years (Table 2). 
PMC5721696	rs5882	Results	RefSNP	False	Moderate alcohol consumption was associated with decreased risk of CHD in individuals homozygous for the B2 genotype of the Taq1B polymorphism [49, 50], while subjects with high alcohol intake, homozygous for the B2 genotype showed a greater risk of CHD compared with non-drinkers [35]. 	Four studies examined the relationship between CETP SNPs rs5882 and rs708272 and dietary fat. 	In studies by Nettleton et al. and Corella et al., no significant interaction was found [38, 48], whereas a cohort study of diabetic men found a strong association between CETP TaqIB and high intakes of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), saturated fatty acids (SFA), animal fat, and total fat on plasma HDL-C levels (P values for the interaction effects = 0.04, 0.02, 0.02, and 0.003, respectively), an association which became stronger with increasing fat intake [42]. In a cross-sectional study that examined the effects of I405V polymorphisms, subjects with the IV genotype had higher TC than other genotypes when consuming higher fat intake [7]. 
PMC5721696	rs5882	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Three clinical trial studies found consistent results, i.e. the response in lipid profiles to plant sterol consumption may be influenced by a common genetic variant in CETP [40, 43, 45]. 	A potential genetic basis for the inter-individual variability in lipid profile responses to plant sterol consumption was found, with individuals having the G/G variant for rs5882 showing reductions in TG [45], total cholesterol, and LDL-C [43] concentrations. 	Interestingly, the same genotype was previously found to be associated with reduced CETP mass and activity [43, 53]. Furthermore, the CETP I405V polymorphism may affect responses of lipids and lipoproteins to changes in the dietary ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids (P:S).

PMC5519609	rs55807605	Results	RefSNP	False		After gene screening, we focused on three rare SNPs, rs55807605 (CFH c.2509 G > A), rs61737525 (CFHR3 c.424 C > T) and rs57960694 (CFHR5 c.434 G > A), which were simultaneously detected in four cases (case 1, case 2, case 3 and case 4). 	All of them were sporadic cases and diagnosed with aHUS, G3GN, DDD and MPGN I, respectively (Supplementary Table S5). The patients with aHUS and C3GN presented a low level of C3, while the other two patients were in the normal range during the disease period.

Haplotype-association analysis further revealed that the ATA haplotype of the three minor alleles (A at rs55807605, T at rs61737525, and A at rs57960694) was significantly associated with increased risk (P = 0.029; OR, 6.72; 95% CI, 1.22–36.99) (Table 2). 	This haplotype was described completely by the allele T at rs61737525, but its haplotypic P value did increase with statistical significance compared with the single-allele analysis of rs61737525.

PMC5519609	rs61737525	Results	RefSNP	False	Steady-state response of CFHR3Arg142Cy (Fig. 4B) for C3b was fitted to steady-state affinity measurement, and the KD of CFHR3Arg142Cys − C3b was 1.8 × 10−5 M (Fig. 4C). 	The arg142Cys substitution induced a decrease of approximately two orders of magnitude in the C3b-binding affinity.Figure 4The CFHR3 T risk allele of rs61737525 results decreased binding affinity to C3b and a weaker fluid-phase cofactor activity. 	C3b was immobilized to a CM5 chip using standard amine coupling. Duplicate injections of CFHR3WT and CFHR3Arg142Cys were performed (concentrations of 10–300 ug/ml) in 10 mM Hepes-buffered saline with 3 mM ENTA and 0.05% (vol/vol) surfactant p20. 
PMC5519609	rs61737525	Results	RefSNP	False	Recent evidence shows that mutations and sequence variations of important regulators of AP cause a variety of kidney diseases in the form of aHUS and C3G, including DDD, C3GN, and MPGN I11, 20–22. 	In the present study, we simultaneously identified three rare SNPs, rs55807605 (CFH c.2509 G > A), rs61737525 (CFHR3 c.424 C > T), and rs57960694 (CFHR5 c.434 G > A), in four sporadic cases with different phenotypes of these diseases. 	They were all nonsynonymous mutations and rs55807605 was previously reported in a Japanese patient with aHUS, without definite clinical significance and functional studies23. All these SNPs were located in the genes of members of the complement factor H family where FHRs act around or in concert with the central AP regulator complement factor H (CFH). 
PMC5519609	rs55807605	Discussion	RefSNP	False	With available databases, 15 common SNPs separated by 272.6 kb in the CFH gene cluster were adequately covered by strong linkage disequilibrium (LD). 	The three SNPs, rs55807605, rs61737525 and rs5796069, are also in perfect LD according to our research group observations and those of public cohorts. 	Two haplotypes were identified in the CFH gene cluster region (GCG and ATA). Besides, multiple independent large genomic duplications within the gene cluster, also known as low-copy repeats, make it highly prone to genomic rearrangements through gene conversion and non-allelic homologous recombination. 
PMC5519609	rs61737525	Results	RefSNP	False	It indicates a close genetic link of mutation and alleles of CFH/CFHR genes, meaning they are inherited together. 	Haplotype-association analysis further revealed that ATA (A at rs55807605, T at rs61737525, and A at rs57960694) is significantly associated with increased risk (P = 0.029; OR, 6.72; 95% CI, 1.22–36.99). 	Moreover, the allele T of SNP rs61737525 can be as a marker for the risk haplotype, with an OR of 4.21 (CI = 1.12–15.84 P = 0.036). It demonstrated that rs61737525 (CFHR3 c.424 C > T) might be a leading pathogenic variant in this risk locus.

Moreover, the allele T of SNP rs61737525 can be as a marker for the risk haplotype, with an OR of 4.21 (CI = 1.12–15.84 P = 0.036). 	It demonstrated that rs61737525 (CFHR3 c.424 C > T) might be a leading pathogenic variant in this risk locus. Because the majority of risk variations in complement genes lack experimental verification, the potential pathogenic effect is difficult to be confirmed. 
PMC5519609	rs61737525	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Rs55807605, rs61737525 and rs57960694 are all located in contiguous regions with similar origins and functions, which may directly contribute to the impaired complement function, and rs61737525, a cysteine at amino acid 142, leads to decreased binding to C3b and cofactor activity compared with wild-type CFHR3 protein in which arginine is at this position. 	However, we could not rule out whether the other two SNPs add to such dysfunction or they are genetically linked with rs61737525 without biological function. 	It is also problematic whether this haplotype is genetically linked with another risk-related one and only slightly enhances disease susceptibility. To summarize, our study firstly reports the case of a shared genetic background within the CFH gene cluster among aHUS, DDD, C3GN and MPGNI. 
PMC5519609	rs61737525	Discussion	RefSNP	False	To summarize, our study firstly reports the case of a shared genetic background within the CFH gene cluster among aHUS, DDD, C3GN and MPGNI. 	The leading pathogenic variation in this risk haplotype ATA is CFHR3 p.Arg142Cys (rs61737525), which impairs its C3b-binding properties and cofactor activity in the fluid phase. 	Expanding our knowledge on the genetics, tissue expression and physiological functions of the CFHR proteins will be of great value to the understanding of these severe anomalies, and hopefully—to more beneficial treatment of AP abnormalities.

Sequences for the primers whose positions are shown in Fig. 2A are given in Supplemental Table S4. 
PMC3386241	rs2910164	Results	RefSNP	False	The distribution of miRNA SNP genotypes are described in Table 2. 	In our healthy controls, miRNA polymorphisms (rs2910164, rs11614913, and rs3746444) conformed to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, except for rs2292832 (p<0.001). 	We used logistic regression model to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (AORs). After adjusting age, smoking status, alcohol intake and betel nut chewing habits, we found that miRNA499 CC genotypes exhibited significantly (p<0.05) higher risks of 4.52−(95% CI = 1.24–16.48) of having OSCC compared to the corresponding wild-type (WT) homozygotes.

PMC5650161	rs1800088	Abstract	RefSNP	False		The natural variant C491T (rs1800088) in ADRB2 gene substitutes Threonine to Isoleucine at 164th position in β2AR and results in receptor sequestration and altered binding of agonists. 	Present investigation pursues to identify the effect of T164I variation on function and structure of β2AR through systematic computational approaches. The study, in addition, addresses altered binding of salbutamol in T164I variant through molecular dynamic simulations. 
PMC5650161	rs1800088	Introduction	RefSNP	False	In addition, recombinant expression and site-directed mutagenesis investigations have shown significant impact on receptor function leading to altered response to β2 agonists [33]. 	Interestingly, major evidence associating ADRB2 variants with functioning of the receptor comes from C→T base exchange (rs1800088) at the 491 position in ADRB2 gene that substitutes Threonine to Isoleucine at 164th position in the β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR). 	The consequence of variation is observed as diminished ligand-receptor interactions followed by depressed coupling of β2AR to adenylcyclases wherein dose-response binding curve shifts to right indicating the low affinity of the agonists to the T164I variant [34]. In addition, pioneering studies by Strader et al in 1989 suggested that Threonine to Isoleucine substitution in β2AR significantly decreases spontaneous toggling to the activated state and reduces agonist stabilized activation resulting in declined capacity of the receptor to interact with β2 agonists [35]. 
PMC5650161	rs1800088	Methods	RefSNP	False	Determination of vulnerability, functional and structural consequences of variation 	The vulnerability of SNP (rs1800088) C→T in the ADRB2 gene (T164I) was evaluated with mutation assessor modules viz, SIFT [39], Polyphen 2 [40]. 	SIFT—a vector based method calculates tolerance index (score ranging from 0 to 1) for a particular residue substitution based on structural and functional parameters using multiple sequence alignments against homologous amino acid sequences. PolyPhen 2 is also a vector based method that calculates the pathogenic potential of nsSNPS that considers comparison of sequences, 3D protein structures and residue contacts, returning results as PSIC score (higher PSIC score reflects higher the functional effect on protein and vice versa). 
PMC5434012	rs2134655	Abstract	RefSNP	False	Following data quality control, we analysed 22 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on 12 candidate genes. 	The single-SNP analysis showed that the dominant minor allele of rs2134655 on DRD3 increases alcoholism susceptibility; the dominant minor allele of rs1439047 on NTRK2 delays the alcoholism onset age, but the additive minor allele of rs172677 on GRIN2B and the dominant minor allele of rs63319 on ALDH1A1 advance the alcoholism onset age; and the dominant minor allele of rs1079597 on DRD2 shortens the onset age range. 	Similarly, multiple-SNPs analysis revealed joint effects of rs2134655, rs172677 and rs1079597, with an adjustment for habitual smoking. This study provides a more comprehensive understanding of the genetics of alcoholism than previous case–control studies.

PMC5434012	rs728293	Results	RefSNP	False	LD and LD blocks of the remaining 28 SNPs on 13 candidate genes were plotted using Haploview24 (Fig. 2). 	Several SNPs were in complete LD with other SNPs in the same LD block; therefore, we eliminated the SNPs having a lower GCR, namely rs728293, rs1079598, rs1079596, rs1386483, and rs985934. 	We performed the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test in the unaffected group by using Haploview. The SNPs rs728293 and rs956412 on GABRB1 violated the HWE with p values of 0.029 and 0.032, respectively.

The SNPs rs728293 and rs956412 on GABRB1 violated the HWE with p values of 0.029 and 0.032, respectively. 	The other SNPs fitted the HWE. The elimination of rs728293 and rs956412 resulted in the exclusion of GABRB1 in this study. 
PMC5434012	rs172677	Results	RefSNP	False	By using the same strategy, we also studied the effect of habitual smoking effect on the development of alcoholism. 	Fitting the mixture regression model to each of the 22 studied SNPs (Supplementary Table S2), we identified that rs172677 and rs1439047 belonged to the aforementioned category (a), rs2134655 belonged to category (b), and rs63319 and rs1079597 belonged to category (c) showed some significant effects on alcoholism. 	By contrast, the genotypes of the remaining 17 SNPs belonging to category (d) showed nonsignificant effects on alcoholism. The regression results and event curves of genotype analysis corresponding to all five significant SNPs are presented in Table 1(A) and Fig. 1 with the following details. 
PMC5434012	rs172677	Results	RefSNP	False	With an equal probability of susceptibility but different conditional age-of-onset distributions 	The logistic regression submodel estimates that three genotypes of rs172677 have the same probability of alcoholism susceptibility (0.378). 	By contrast, the negative and positive parameter estimates of −0.31 and 0.28, respectively, in the location regression part of rs172677 with Aa as the referent genotype indicates that susceptible subjects with genotypes aa and AA tend to have an earlier and later age of onset of alcoholism, respectively (p = 0.107 vs 0.087). A similar magnitude of these two estimated location parameters suggests an additive effect of allele a on the age of onset of alcoholism. 
PMC5434012	rs172677	Results	RefSNP	False	By fitting the mixture regression with the additive model of the location regression part, we confirmed the additive effect of allele a with significance (p = 0.006). 	This analysis affirms that the three genotypes of rs172677 have an equal probability of alcoholism susceptibility; however, susceptible subjects with the harmful additive allele a would have an earlier age of onset of alcoholism. 	By using the additive model, the median onset age of susceptible subjects with genotypes aa, Aa, and AA were estimated to be 20.7, 27.8, and 37.3 years, respectively. Three genotypes of rs1439047 were merged into two subgroups, Aa + aa and AA, to represent the dominant model for allele a. These two subgroups showed the same estimated probability of alcoholism susceptibility (0.369).

Three genotypes of rs1439047 were merged into two subgroups, Aa + aa and AA, to represent the dominant model for allele a. These two subgroups showed the same estimated probability of alcoholism susceptibility (0.369). 	Compared with the referent genotype AA, the positive estimate 0.52 of the location difference for genotype Aa + aa in the AFT log-logistic model indicated that susceptible subjects with allele a of rs1439047 would have a later age of onset of alcoholism (p < 0.001), whereas the corresponding estimated scale difference of 0.74 indicated a larger age range (p = 0.093). These results showed that the dominant allele a had a preventive effect on delaying the age of onset of alcoholism by 13.2 (=32.7–19.5) years of the median onset age in susceptible subjects despite its susceptibility to alcoholism being the same as that in genotype AA.

The likelihood ratio test with p < 0.001 demonstrates a much better fitting of the gene–environment model than of the three-SNPs model. Because of the high proportion of habitual smokers and only four alcoholism cases of 19 nonhabitual smokers with sparse events in SNP strata, we plotted Fig. 3 corresponding to the three SNPs in the 46 habitual smokers and omitted nonhabitual smokers from the figure because they contributed at most one alcoholism event in each stratum.

Considering the minor-allele carriers as risky revealed that GRIN2B (rs172677) highly overlaps with the habitual smoking status. 	In addition, smokers who carried the risky allele on GRIN2B tended to have an early alcoholism onset than those on DRD3 (rs2134655).

PMC5434012	rs2134655	Discussion	RefSNP	False	The results revealed that rs172677, rs1439047, rs63319, and rs1079597, but not rs2134655, had an equal probability of alcoholism susceptibility among genotypes. 	The merged genotype Aa + aa of rs2134655 was associated with a risk of alcoholism compared with genotype AA (p = 0.027). 	For each SNP, the conventional logistic regression analysis yielded the same conclusions as did the mixture regression analysis; in brief, the regression coefficient estimates in both conventional logistic model and logistic susceptibility submodel of the logistic-AFT mixture model are very close to each other. However, the logistic-AFT mixture model provided different interpretations in correctly combining susceptible and nonsusceptible subpopulations, with detailed information on the alcoholism onset age of susceptible subjects by using a flexible time-to-event model with location and scale regression parts. 
PMC5434012	rs172677	Discussion	RefSNP	False	To demonstrate the inadequacy of Cox PH model11 for the analysis of alcoholism in the COGA data, we also manipulated univariate Cox PH analysis for each identified SNP as shown in right panel of Supplementary Table S4. 	The results revealed the same alcoholism age-of-onset distributions among the genotypes of rs172677, rs1439047, rs63319 and rs1079597, respectively, and the only significant effect on alcoholism identified by the Cox PH model due to the dominant allele a of rs2134655 versus genotype AA with a hazard ratio of 2.45 (p = 0.034). 	These results from the Cox PH model contradicted the Kaplan-Meier curves20 in Fig. 1 since the PH assumption implies that the event curves cannot be crossing. The Cox PH model is sensitive to detect the difference of onset ages between genotypes of rs2134655 on DRD3 since the corresponding overall event curves are not crossing; however, the mixture model presents novel interpretations that genotypes of rs2134655 cause different probabilities of susceptibility to alcoholism, but with the same onset-age distribution for the susceptible cases.

The crossing patterns emerging in overall or conditional genotype-specific event curves for the other four SNPs lead to non-PH models which may be well fitted by the location-scale cure mixture model12.

On the basis of this general model, we identified rs2134655 on DRD3 with unequal probabilities of alcoholism susceptibility (p = 0.027). 	Importantly, we are the first to report SNPs associated with unequal age-of-onset distributions for susceptible cases to alcoholism [rs172677 on GRIN2B (p = 0.013), rs1439047 on NTRK2 (p = 0.005), rs63319 on ALDH1A1 (p = 0.033), and rs1079597 on DRD2 (p = 0.028)]. On the basis of single gene analyses of alcoholism, we conducted pathway analysis that revealed that the alcoholism pathway is associated with DRD2, GRIN2B, and NTRK2 and the cocaine addiction pathway is associated with DRD2 and GRIN2B. DRD2 is involved in behavior rewarding and its dysfunction leads to aberrant substance-seeking behavior17.

Our identified TaqI B (rs1079597) polymorphism on DRD2 had a higher allele frequency of B1 (i.e., minor allele a in this study) in a Caucasian severe alcoholic group than in nonalcoholic and less severe alcoholic groups37. GRIN2B is a glutamate-gated ion channel38 involved in memory and learning, and mutations in GRIN2B result in a severe neurodevelopmental phenotype with mental retardation39. 
PMC5434012	rs157864	Methods	RefSNP	False	In the model selection procedure for each SNP, because of the limited sample size, we first separated the SNPs into two subgroups: one is with an extremely rare alcoholism event (≤1) in any genotype and the other is with >1 alcoholism events in all genotypes. 	SNPs of the extremely rare alcoholism event group corresponding to genotype aa include the following: (i) no-event subgroup in seven SNPs, namely rs157864, rs1157122, rs387661, rs1079597, rs1386493, rs1386492, and rs1838158 (with the last SNP having only two genotypes, AA and Aa), and (ii) one-event subgroup in three SNPs, namely rs1111418, rs927544, and rs2134655 (with only one subject having genotype aa of the last SNP and developing alcoholism. 	In these cases, we merged genotypes aa and Aa for appropriately handling sparse data in SNP analysis. In brief, we used a dummy variable to code aa = Aa = 1 and AA = 0 in the fitting of the mixture regression model. 
PMC5434012	rs172677	Methods	RefSNP	False	We performed simple regression on individual SNPs, first by using Aa as the reference genotype in the logistic, location, and scale regression parts. 	When the regression result shows two significant dummy variables of genotypes, it supports a general model with three genotypes (refer to the case of rs172677 in Fig. 1). 	Alternatively, for the remaining individual SNPs, we merged data of two genotypes whose event curves were closer among the three genotypes and subsequently estimated dominant or recessive effects by using the two subgroups based on the merged genotypes. As shown in the flow chart (Supplementary Figure S3), we performed the likelihood ratio tests for fitted general, dominant, and recessive coding schemes compared with the null model in the mixture regression with different degrees of freedom.

Most widely studied polymorphisms of ESRα involve PvuII (rs2234693) and XbaI (rs9340799). 	These are found in the intron 1 and divided by only 46 bp. The PvuII (T397C) polymorphism occurs due to T/C transition in first intron, while the XbaI (G351A) polymorphism is caused by a G/A transition located 50 base pairs downstream of the PvuII polymorphic site (Keene et al., 2008[11]; Pollak et al., 2004[23]; Shearman et al., 2004[29]).

Several sequence variants of the ESRβ gene have also been identified which include 2 silent G/A polymorphisms, RsaI (rs1256049) and AluI (rs4986938) (Rosenkranz et al., 1998[25]). 	The expression of both these receptors has been recorded in testis and epididymis (O'Donnell et al., 2001[20]). In human testis, ERα and ERβ have also been found in ejaculated spermatozoa (Durkee et al., 1998[6]; Lambard et al., 2004[13]). 
PMC4822082	rs1256049	Introduction	RefSNP	False	In males ESR1 XbaI polymorphism was suggested to have an effect on azoospermia or idiopathic severe oligospermia while in women ESR1 PvuII strongly affected pregnancy rate after in vitro fertilization (IVF) (Kukuvitis et al., 2002[12]). PvuII polymorphism is also reported to be associated with predisposition to endometriosis (Hsieh et al., 2007[10]) and controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH)/ pregnancy outcome of IVF. 	Association of RsaI polymorphism (rs1256049) with male infertility has been established in Caucasian patients. 	It is located in exon 5 of ERβ (Aschim et al., 2005[1]). Several studies have been performed to estimate the distribution of various ESR1 gene polymorphisms and their association with female and male infertility.

In this meta-analysis, Seshadri and colleagues confirmed associations with APOE, CLU, PICALM, and CR1 and identified two new Alzheimer's risk loci: Myc box-dependent-interacting protein 1 (BIN1) and a marker (rs597668) near the EXOC3L2/BLOC1S3/MARK4 gene cluster. 	It is interesting that BIN1 showed a nonsignificant trend for association in the previous studies by Harold et al. and Lambert et al. The significant signal for BIN1 in the meta-analysis after a nonsignificant trend for association in the two initial GWAS studies was a clear indication of the tremendous sample sizes that are required to detect Alzheimer's risk genes outside of APOE. Current studies underway through the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) will ultimately evaluate over 60,000 participants including more than 30,000 Alzheimer's cases, roughly twice the size of the previous largest effort by Seshadri et al. [58].

Moreover, and again using the previous strategy of examining postmortem human tissue expression, in human studies revealing an association with a SNP potentially altering NRXN3 gene splicing (rs8019381, located 23 bp from splicing site 5) and alcohol dependence, individuals with the addiction-associated rs8019381 T allele showed significantly lower levels of transmembrane NRXN3 isoforms [108]. 	There is also potential evidence for a relationship of NRXN3 markers to addiction endophenotypes, including impulsivity [109]. As stated previously, NRXNs and NLGNs have important actions on both pre- and postsynaptic scaffolding and affect synaptic plasticity.

PMC5181623	rs4925386	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Finally, we have shown that genetic variants in genomic risk regions for CRC can affect the DNAm level in healthy colon tissue and that overall DNAm sites within a risk region have similar overall heritability to DNAm sites outwith an identified risk region. 	In conjunction, we have replicated the previous finding that the CRC risk SNP rs4925386 effects DNAm level at cg15193198 and cg24112000. 	We showed that when rs4925386 is excluded the regional genetic variation sufficiently captures the causal variation in the DNAm level tagged by rs4925386. Moreover, rs4925386 alone does not capture all the genetic variance contributing to variation of cg24112000 and cg15193198 that is captured by the regional heritability approach. 
PMC4936837	rs2279343	Abstract	RefSNP	False		We genotyped CYP2B6SNPs rs2279343, rs3745274, and rs3211371 by restriction fragment polymorphism (RFLP) after PCR amplification in a cohort of 73 pediatric RMS patients treated with CPA-based first line treatment. 	We then analyzed the association between those genotypes and survival outcome of RMS. 
PMC4936837	rs2279343	Abstract	RefSNP	False	There was no association between rs3745274, rs3211371 genotypes and survival outcomes of RMS. 	However, the carriers of at least one mutant allele CYP2B6rs2279343 had significantly longer event-free survival (p-value = 0.03). 	
PMC4936837	rs2279343	Introduction	RefSNP	False	Our hypothesis is that SNPs in CYP2B6 might affect the functionality of this enzyme in activating CPA, which could be reflected on the response to treatment. 	Based on such considerations, we conducted this study to investigate the prevalence of 3 CYP2B6 common functional SNPs rs2279343 (A785G, CYP2B6*4, exon 5, K262R), rs3745274 (G516T, CYP2B6*9, exon 4, Q172H), and rs3211371 (C1459T, CYP2B6*5, exon 9, R487C) in our cohort of Egyptian pediatric RMS patients. 	Our aim was to examine the possible influence of CYP2B6 polymorphism on the chemotherapy treatment response, and survival outcomes in RMS. 
PMC4936837	rs3745274	Methods	RefSNP	False		Genotyping for CYP2B6 SNPs rs3745274 in exon 4 (G516T), rs2279343 in exon 5 (A785G), and rs3211371 in exon 9 (C1459T) was performed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) after polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. 	All PCR amplifications were carried out in similar standard protocol conditions [10]. Slight modifications were done, for rs3745274 the annealing temperature was 56°C and the extension step was reduced to 40 s while, for rs3211371, a prolonged extension step of 1 min 30 s and the annealing temperature was 65°C. 
PMC4936837	rs2279343	Results	RefSNP	False	In our cohort, 63% carried rs2279343 (50.7% as heterozygous and 12.3% as mutant homozygous), 45.2% had rs3745274 (37% as heterozygous and 8.2% as mutant homozygous) and 5.5% had rs3211371 mutations (4.1% as heterozygous and 1.4% as mutant homozygous). 	The frequency of having the minor mutant allele whether homozygous or heterozygous was 0.38, 0.27 and 0.03 for rs2279343, rs3745274, and rs3211371, respectively. 	PCR-RFLP was validated by sequencing as shown in (Fig 1). 
PMC4936837	rs2279343	Results	RefSNP	False	The survival data showed that 3-years EFS after VAC chemotherapy was 53.1%. Table 4 summarizes the association of CYP2B6 SNPs with the objective response and the survival outcome. 	Carriers of at least one mutant allele rs2279343 (n = 46/73) when compared to wild-type homozygotes, showed a significant association with the clinical objective response (p-value = 0.01), and a significantly longer EFS (p-value = 0.03) (Fig 3), but there was no discernable effect on the OS (p-value = 0.48). 	On the other hand, there was no observed association between neither rs3745274 nor rs3211371 with any of the study end points. 
PMC4936837	rs3745274	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Based on this, rather than choosing a “genome association study approach” with complex data analysis, our study design was based on a “candidate SNP approach” to examine particular SNPs in CPA activation pathway that are thought to influence response to treatment. 	We have selected 3 common functional SNPs (rs3745274, rs2279343, and rs3211371) found in CYP2B6 exons 4, 5, and 9, respectively. 	They were carefully selected based on evidence that they are common in Caucasians [10], they cause changes in CYP2B6 coding that would affect CYP2B6 enzyme expression or activity and are associated with a change in CPA activation and metabolism [24,26]. Our hypothesis is that the pharmacological activity of CPA could be altered by the functionality of CYP2B6 which might be reflected on the treatment response. 
PMC4936837	rs2279343	Discussion	RefSNP	False	The main finding in our study was that in RMS patients treated with VAC as the first line of treatment, there was an association between CYP2B6rs2279343 (carrying G mutant allele) and response to CPA-based treatment. 	Patients who carried at least one mutant allele CYP2B6rs2279343 (n = 46/73), had better objective clinical response compared to the homozygous wild allele carriers (p-value = 0.01). 	Also, our results demonstrate that this group of patients who carried at least one mutant allele in CYP2B6rs2279343 (G allele), had a significant longer EFS (p-value = 0.034) but not OS (p-value = 0.48) compared to those carrying the homozygous wild allele (A allele). Our results have provided evidence for the involvement of CYP2B6rs2279343 in the response of RMS patients to CPA-based treatment.

Our results have provided evidence for the involvement of CYP2B6rs2279343 in the response of RMS patients to CPA-based treatment. This is in accordance with a previous study that identified a strong functional impact of rs2279343 on enhancing the catalytic activation of CPA into 4-OH-CPA and a tendency to reduce protein expression [8]. 
PMC4936837	rs2279343	Discussion	RefSNP	False	This is in accordance with a previous study that identified a strong functional impact of rs2279343 on enhancing the catalytic activation of CPA into 4-OH-CPA and a tendency to reduce protein expression [8]. 	In contrast to several studies which associated variants including CYP2B6rs2279343 with lower CPA hydroxylation or with poor response [17,29]. 	Raccor et al. found that CYP2B6rs2279343 genotype caused 50% reduction in 4-OH-CPA formation yet the sample size was too small to draw a reliable conclusion. In addition, they noted that carrying rs2279343 alone or rs3745274 alone displayed a reduction in intrinsic CPA clearance compared with the wild type [30]. 
PMC4936837	rs2279343	Discussion	RefSNP	False	In this context, our hypothesis generated in this study is that patients carrying CYP2B6rs2279343 (heterozygous or mutant homonozygous genotypes) have a predicted rapid metabolic phenotype; consequently, maintaining an increased CPA activation to 4-OH-CPA, while patients with the wild-genotype will have a higher ratio of CPA to 4-OH-CPA in plasma. 	Thus, carriers of at least one mutant allele CYP2B6rs2279343 have a higher success rate for RMS therapy with CPA. 	In summary, our results provide a picture of the role of CYP2B6 polymorphisms in RMS. Our data suggests that pretreatment evaluation of CYP2B6rs2279343 may explain some inter-individual differences in treatment response. 
PMC4198831	rs3751082	Article	RefSNP	False	Wang and colleagues[35] studied the genes related to dopamine metabolism and found that the combined action of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the intron of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 3B1 (ALDH3B1) genes were associated with an increased susceptibility to paranoid schizophrenia and with the P300 latency in both patients and healthy individuals. 	In a study of 540 patients with paranoid schizophrenia and 660 healthy individuals they found that the rs4633-T allele of COMT was associated with susceptibility to paranoid schizophrenia, hallucinations and delayed P300 latency in individuals who had the rs3751082-A allele of the ALDH3B1 gene but not in individuals carrying the rs3751082 G/G allele of the ALDH3B1 gene.[35] 	The effect of different types of interventions on P300 Wang and colleagues[36] assessed changes in P300 latency and amplitude during the course of treatment in patients with schizophrenia and in patients with depression.

PMC5179106	rs75932628	Introduction	RefSNP	False	Most AD patients have sporadic late-onset disease, and are free from rare mutations in known causal AD genes (APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2) [3]. 	Sporadic AD is associated with multiple genetic variations of small effect (e.g., most GWAS loci) or moderate effect (e.g., APOE-ε4 [17] and TREM2 rs75932628 T-allele [18, 19]), and could be influenced by other risk factors (e.g., head trauma [20], diabetes [21] and aging [22]). 	The complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors lead to alterations in proteins, metabolites and epigenetic modifications in the brain tissue and/or body fluids of AD patients. The large amount of biological data accumulated to date warrants comprehensive investigation to better understand AD pathogenesis and facilitate the process of anti-AD drug repositioning.

The aim of our study was to investigate the role of TGF-β1 gene polymorphisms rs1800469 and rs2317130 in susceptibility to acquired AA. 	Via the approach of SNaPshot, we genotyped rs1800469 and rs2317130 in 101 patients with acquired AA and 165 controls.

Our results indicated that TGF-β1 gene polymorphisms might be involved in the munity of acquired AA in a Chinese population. This initial analysis provides valuable clues for further study of TGF-β1 pathway genes in acquired AA. 
PMC5288442	rs1800469	Abstract	RefSNP	False	To our knowledge, there exist few studies attempting to clarify the association between TGF-β1 SNPs and acquired AA [12]. 	Thus, our study aims to investigate the role of TGF-β1 gene polymorphisms rs1800469 and rs2317130 in susceptibility to acquired AA in a Chinese population.

Finally, in the present study, two tSNPs (rs1800469 and rs2317130) were selected. 	The genotype was done using the SNaPshot genotyping approach (Nanjing Biohelper tech center). For confirmation of the genotype, approximately 10% of samples were randomly selected for repeat analysis, and the results were 100% concordant. 
PMC5288442	rs1800469	Methods	RefSNP	False	Nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was used for analyzing the distribution differences of age between the cases and controls. 	Chi-square (χ2) test was used to estimate the distribution differences of gender as well as each genotype of rs1800469 and rs2317130 between the two groups. 	Unconditional multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to obtain crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for risk of acquired AA and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with adjustment for diagnosis age and gender.

PMC5288442	rs2317130	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Our study showed that the C to T variation of rs1800469 was associated with lower risk for acquired AA, especially in the SAA/vSAA patients. 	On the contrary, the TT genotype of rs2317130 showed increasing risk only in the SAA/vSAA patients compared to CC. 	To sum up, our results highlight that TGF-β1 polymorphisms may play a role in the risk of acquired AA. Past studies have shown that the level of TGF-β1 has a relationship with acquired AA incidence. 
PMC5726834	rs4244285	Methods	RefSNP	False	A ratio between 1.5-1.8 was considered as acceptable for polymerase chain reaction amplification. 	Polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR–RELPs) for the CYP2C19 loss-of-function (LOF) alleles on 2 polymorphic positions, *2 (681G4A, rs4244285) and *3 (636G4A, rs4986893), were performed as previously described method.9,10 The primers of CYP2C19 *2 and *3 were designed, and fast-digest restriction enzymes SmaI and BamHI for CYP2C19 *2 and *3 were used.

As complement factor H (CFH) was regarded as one of the most important genetic risk factors, the single nucleotide polymorphism rs1061170 of CFH was assessed. 	It was found that the distribution of high-risk genotypes (YH/HH) and low-risk genotypes (YY) was matched between the case and control groups (P=0.596). An exon-based array (the Affymetrix Human Exon ST 1.0 array) was obtained for the microarray analysis. 
PMC6365564	rs1051730	Methods	RefSNP	False	By doing so, we identified three major studies of interest for the phenotype “smoking” (in CPD)31–33, and one study for “alcohol consumption”34. 	Within the three publications relevant to smoking, the SNP rs1051730 was identified as the top SNP for smoking quantity in CPD; ten additional SNPs also showed significant association with CDP. 	For alcohol, the number of candidate SNPs was 14. From the overall set of 25 SNPs, we included those meeting the following conditions: Small difference of MAF (≤3%) between the reference population (1000Genomes CEU) and the current 1000BRAINS study, no strong linkage disequilibrium (<0.8) to other selected SNPs of this phenotype, and high imputation quality (median info score = 99.5%), as well as no deviation from HWE (p > 0.05) in the subsample of 1000BRAINS. 
PMC5895380	rs4646903	Introduction	RefSNP	False	Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified in the CYP1A1 gene, all of which were localized on chromosome 15q22.[7] Such polymorphisms were considered playing an important role in determining individual susceptibility to many cancers, involving cervical cancer. 	Among these polymorphisms, the most commonly studied is the MspI polymorphism (2A, m1, T3801C, or rs4646903), which is located in the 3′’ noncoding region of the CYP1A1 gene. 	Another commonly studied polymorphism is Ile462Val (2C, m2, or rs1048943), which gives rise to an amino acid transition in exon 7. The underlying biochemical hypothesis explaining the effect of the 2 variants is that both of them may influence mRNA expression or mRNA stability of the gene, resulting in a highly inducible activity of the enzyme.[8,9]

PMC5696326	rs6971	Article	RefSNP	False	Since then, several newer second-generation tracers have emerged for use with either carbon-11 or fluor-18 labeling, boasting an improved pharmacokinetic profile and an up to 80-fold higher specific binding as demonstrated by animal blocking studies (54). 	Second-generation tracers radiolabeled with 18-F, which has a longer half-life, have made this technique available for nuclear imaging centers without cyclotron, although their use is complicated by the existence of a polymorphism (rs6971) in humans that occurs in 30% of the European population. 	Therefore, genotyping of study subjects at this locus is essential to allow interpretation of TSPO PET studies, by stratifying between genetic groups and exclusion of low-affinity subjects. As a meta-analysis is lacking for this specific research domain, the results of the existing studies are summarized in Table 2. 
PMC2758211	rs9914357	Methods	RefSNP	False	Haplotypes were determined by DNA sequence analysis of CMS patients and relatives. 	Gene frequency for the G or C nucleotide at SNP rs9914357 was determined by DNA sequencing of 100 control chromosomes. 	SNPs with minor allele frequency >25% (CEPH) were selected. Data from screening over 100 suspected CMS cases of Northern European origin that did not have CHRNE mutations gave similar allele frequencies to the CEPH population. 
PMC2758211	rs1053754	Results	RefSNP	False		To investigate the possibility that εR311Q and ε1369delG may be derived from original founder mutations we analysed a cluster of four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs1053754, rs8834, rs7774, rs9914357, that are located within the 3′ untranslated region of CHRNE. 	Haplotypes for patients and family members for the four SNPs were determined (Table 2; Fig. 1b). In all cases mutation ε1369delG associated with the haplotype T A T G at the four SNPs (P = 0.001) and mutation R311Q with SNP haplotype G A G C (P = 0.00006).Table 2Analysis of SNPs clustered in 3′ untranslated region of CHRNE in Dutch patients with AChR deficiency syndrome 
PMC2758211	rs1053754	Discussion	RefSNP	False	At Oxford the ε1369delG and εR311Q mutations have not been identified in patients with CMS from other ethnic origins, but ε1369delG has been reported in a patient from Northern Germany [10]. 	The common occurrence of ε1369delG and εR311Q, and their strict association with the respective CHRNE SNP haplotypes (rs1053754-rs8834-rs7774-rs9914357: T A T G and G A G C) strongly suggests a founder for each of these mutations originating in North Western Europe, possibly in Holland. 	Most CMS with severe endplate AChR deficiency result from recessive mutations in AChR ε-subunit gene, or the gene encoding rapsyn. The mutations in the ε-subunit are found along the length of the gene, and result in frameshifts or nonsense codons that truncate the subunit polypeptide chain, or loss of residues essential for AChR assembly or function. 
PMC3061299	rs1642785	Article	RefSNP	False	Subjects genotyped were whites from the US Twelve tag-SNPs were genotyped and several inheritance models evaluated. 	The recessive inheritance model suggested that rs1642785 (IVS+38C>G) and rs1042522 (Ex4+119C>G, Pro72Arg) were associated with osteosarcoma risk. 	However, these genotypes were quite rare and this study, like those described above, was limited by its small sample size. In a different study of the p53 pathway, Toffoli et al. genotyped the Pro72Arg (rs1042522, Ex4+119C>G) SNP in TP53 and the MDM2 -309 promoter SNP (rs2279744, T>G) in 201 osteosarcoma cases and 250 controls from Italy [98].

The Pro72Arg SNP in TP53 has been associated with risk of several cancers, including lung and breast cancer (reviewed in [121]). In addition, the presence of the 72Arg allele was correlated with earlier age of cancer onset in individuals with LFS [122]. 
PMC3061299	rs998075	Article	RefSNP	False	Common SNPs in 13 growth-related genes were also evaluated as candidate risk modifiers in the BDISO. 	Of the 52 SNPs evaluated, two correlated SNPs in insulin-like growth factor receptor 2 (IGF2R, rs998075 and rs998074) were associated with increased risk of osteosarcoma (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.29–3.24) [62]. 	One of those SNPs, rs998075 (Ex16+88G>A), resulted in loss of methylation in a CpG island but the impact of this alteration on IGF2R protein function is not known. As noted above, the IGFs are potential regulators of carcinogenesis in several cancer types and IGF1 levels have been associated with cancer risk.

PMC3061299	rs896324	Article	RefSNP	False	Associations with the 9 SNPs previously associated with cancer were not noted in this study. 	Overall, seven SNPs were associated with osteosarcoma; the strongest result was noted for SNP, rs896324 (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.13–2.69). 	These SNPs are in slightly different locations than the SNPs associated with other cancers. The details of 8q24 are still being explored, but a long-range regulator of the MYC proto-oncogene may be present in this region [126]. 
PMC3804582	rs863582	Abstract	RefSNP	False	In this study, we performed a case-control study of 1,048 incident lung cancer cases and 1,048 age- and sex frequency-matched cancer-free controls in a Chinese population to investigate the role of MUC4 gene polymorphism in lung cancer etiology. 	We identified nine SNPs that were significantly associated with increased lung cancer risk (P = 0.0425 for rs863582, 0.0333 for rs842226, 0.0294 for rs842225, 0.0010 for rs2550236, 0.0149 for rs2688515, 0.0191 for rs 2641773, 0.0058 for rs3096337, 0.0077 for rs859769, and 0.0059 for rs842461 in an additive model). 	Consistent with these single-locus analysis results, the haplotype analyses revealed an adverse effect of the haplotype “GGC” of rs3096337, rs859769, and rs842461 on lung cancer. Both the haplotype and diplotype “CTGAGC” of rs863582, rs842226, rs2550236, rs842225, and rs2688515 had an adverse effect on lung cancer, which is also consistent with the single-locus analysis.

PMC3804582	rs863582	Methods	RefSNP	False	To identify SNPs that were related to lung cancer, we first selected 296 of MUC4 SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) > 5% from both dbSNP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP, accessed 9/9/2012 and HapMap databases [Han Chinese]) (File S1 ), and genotyped them in a small subset of samples from 300 randomly selected pairs of case and control subjects from 1048 pairs on an Illumina high-throughput genotyping platform (Genome Analyzer IIx, Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). 	Out of this group, we identified nine SNPs (rs863582, rs842226, rs842225, rs2550236, rs2688515, 2641773, rs3096337, rs859769, and rs842461) that exhibited significant frequency differences between cases and controls (data not shown). 	Genotype frequencies of SNPs can be influenced by sample sizes [31]. To minimize the bias due to small sample size, we next conducted direct sequencing for the whole set of 1,048 pairs of case and control samples using the ABI PRISM 7500 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) to confirm the above genotyping results (Table 1 ). The results from the two platforms were found to be 100% concordant; therefore, we provided association results from the entire set of 1048 pairs in this paper.

Notably, the “GGC” haplotype harbored the rs3096337 G allele and the rs842461 C allele, and these two alleles were both associated with significantly increased lung cancer risk in the single-locus analysis. 	Furthermore, the stratified analyses revealed that lung cancer risk was further increased among heavy smokers carrying the haplotype “GGC” (adjusted OR = 1.60 and 95% CI = 1.19-2.15).

Gene-smoking interaction analysis As summarized in Table 5 , we first classified cumulative smoking dose as a discrete variable (nonsmokers, light smokers, and heavy smokers) to avoid the issue of potential participant misclassification for smoking exposure. 
PMC3804582	rs863582	Results	RefSNP	False	When we considered nonsmokers with TT or TC/CC as the reference group in the joint-effects model, heavy smokers with the same genotypes had the greatest risk for lung cancer (OR = 1.73 and 95% CI = 1.27-2.36; OR = 2.50 and 95% CI = 1.85-3.39), suggesting that it is a major risk factor for lung cancer. 	The genotype-smoking interaction model revealed significant multiplicative interaction between the rs863582 polymorphism (TC/CC versus TT) and trichotomized cumulative smoking dose (P < 0.0001). 	We also observed a consistent and robust result when considering smoking as continuous cumulative smoking dose (square root of pack-years) (P < 0.0001).

PMC3804582	rs2550236	Abstract	RefSNP	False	Consistent with the results of single-locus analysis, the haplotype analyses revealed an adverse effect of the haplotype “GGC” of rs3096337, rs859769, and rs842461 on lung cancer.

Moreover, we observed a statistically significant interaction for rs863582 and rs842461 with cigarette smoking when tested as either a discrete or continuous variable. These findings support our hypothesis that MUC4 polymorphisms and their interaction with smoking may contribute to lung cancer etiology. 
PMC3804582	rs863582	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Accumulating evidence suggests that MUC4 might also be a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker for other malignancies, such as ductal carcinoma[40–42]. 	We first of all found that the two tagSNPs, rs842461and rs863582 were associated with lung cancer risk. 	In the single-locus association analysis, variant genotypes of these two SNPs exhibited a significantly increased risk of lung cancer individually, even after 10,000 permutations. Moreover, we found “GGC” was accounted for a 60% increase in lung cancer risk among heavy smokers, which was consistent with the effect of variant rs842461 genotypes among the same subgroup, suggesting that the adverse effect of “GGC” was indeed driven by the rs842461 C allele and the rs3096337 G allele.

These two SNPs were both located in haplotype block 2, which showed a significant and consistent association with lung cancer risk. Notably, block 2 corresponds to intron 1. 
PMC3804582	rs863582	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Interestingly, the variant genotypes had no effect in nonsmokers or light smokers but were risk factors among heavy smokers compared with their respective wild-type genotypes. 	For example, heavy smoking (≥20 pack-years) alone only conferred a 1.58-fold increased lung cancer risk for rs863582, but the effect of heavy smoking with the same genotypes was almost 1.73- or 2.50-fold when TT or TC/CC genotype was used as the respective reference in the joint-effects model, indicating a risk-enhancing relationship between smoking and rs863582 genotype variants. 	Consistent with these results, the rs842461 variant genotype analyses also revealed almost identical change tendencies. The underlying mechanism involved in the interaction between MUC4 and smoking is not clear. 
PMC3804582	rs3096337	Discussion	RefSNP	False	A large number of biologically active molecules, such as cytokines, bacterial products, growth factors, differentiation agents, and other factors (e.g., tobacco smoke) have been found to regulate MUC4 expression in vitro and/or in vivo in various cell types [43–46]. 	Therefore, it is likely that smoking might significantly induce MUC4 expression, and it is possible that the variant allele G of rs3096337 or C of rs842461 also leads to a higher basal expression level of MUC4 under normal circumstances. 	As MUC4 acts as a tumor promoter for lung cancer, the variant allele G of rs3096337 or C of rs842461 exerts a greater adverse effect than that of the wild-type allele among heavy smokers. Therefore, the subjects carrying the rs3096337 variant G or rs842461 variant C may have not have increased lung cancer risk under normal conditions but do have an elevated risk when the G or C allele is in strong LD with a variant allele of another gene (e.g., growth factor genes) that may induce MUC4 expression in response to heavy smoking.

Finally, it is interesting to note that independent genome-wide association studies report an association between SNPs in the 9p21 locus with a risk for coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction risk [68]. This interval contains no annotated genes and is not associated with established CHD risk factors, such as plasma lipoproteins, hypertension or diabetes.

With respect to the GHRL rs26311 polymorphism, binary logistic regression analyses adjusted by gender and age revealed that subjects carrying the rs26311 GC genotype (but not the CC genotype) experienced an increased risk of LC compared with those carrying the GG genotype (OR = 1.671, 95% CI = 1.013–2.757, P = 0.044). 	Similarly, a significant increased risk of LC was found in dominant model GC+CC vs. GG (OR = 1.674, 95% CI = 1.040–2.696, P = 0.034).

The results indicated that there was no significant difference between rs26311 polymorphism and LC risk when compared with CHB patients (C vs. G: OR = 0.781, 95% CI = 0.544–1.120, P = 0.178; GC vs. GG: OR = 0.721, 95% CI = 0.401–1.296, P = 0.275; CC vs. GG: OR = 1.144, 95% CI = 0.588–2.226, P = 0.691; GC+CC vs. GG: OR = 0.693, 95% CI = 0.399–1.202, P = 0.192). Association of GHRL gene polymorphisms with the risk of HBV-related diseases according to gender 
PMC4658098	rs26311	Results	RefSNP	False	Association of GHRL gene polymorphisms with the risk of HBV-related diseases according to gender 	In our stratified analysis of GHRL polymorphisms and risk of HBV-related diseases based on gender, no significant differences in the genotype and allele frequencies of rs26311, rs27647, and rs696217 among groups were observed. 	In the binary logistic regression analyses adjusted by age, we found that males who carried the rs26311 C allele were correlated with an increased risk of LC compared to the G allele (OR = 1.416, 95% CI = 1.017–1.972, P = 0.040). Similarly, male subjects carrying the rs26311 combined GC+CC genotypes were at increased risk of LC (OR = 1.729, 95% CI = 1.019–2.933, P = 0.042) (S1 Table). 
PMC4658098	rs34911341	Results	RefSNP	False	Given that the GHRL genetic background may be distinct in different populations, the genotype and allele frequencies of the four SNPs in our control group were further compared to those different ethnicities’ healthy controls from the Haplotype Map (HapMap) project (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/). 	There was lack of HapMap data from HCB (Han Chinese in Beijing), JPT (Japanese in Tokyo), CEU (Utah residents with northern and western European ancestry) and YRI (Yoruba in Ibadan) populations of the SNP rs34911341. 	Thus, we only compared the genotype and allele frequencies of controls for rs26311, rs27647, and rs696217 polymorphisms with the above populations from the HapMap database. The data list in Table 4 indicates that the distributions of rs26311, rs27647, and rs696217 in our control group were similar to those in the HCB and JPT populations, but significantly different from those in CEU and YRI populations.

For the rs26311 and rs696217 polymorphisms, the frequencies of genotype GG and allele G in CEU and YRI populations are significantly higher than frequencies in the healthy controls in the present study. 
PMC4658098	rs26311	Results	RefSNP	False	Haplotype analysis of the GHRL gene polymorphisms and LC risk 	Haplotype analyses were performed in the patients with LC and healthy controls using SHEsis software, and seven possible haplotype frequencies of GHRL rs26311, rs27647, and rs696217 are presented in Table 5. 	Overall, linkage disequilibrium was not obviously observed between the alleles. The GTG haplotype is the most common haplotype and accounted for 41.6% in healthy controls, whereas the haplotype with the highest frequency in the LC group was CTG, which accounted for 35.8% of the total among the seven haplotypes.

Similar significant results were also found when compared difference of serum GHRL values in two groups among the individuals with the same genotype of the rs26311 polymorphism. 	However, when considering the possible difference of GHRL levels among three different genotypes in the same group, no significant differences were observed, indicating that serum GHRL levels were not associated with the rs26311 polymorphism.

PMC4658098	rs26312	Discussion	RefSNP	False	The first influence between GHRL rs26312, rs27647, rs26802, rs34911341, rs696217, and rs4684677 polymorphisms and liver fibrosis risk was reported by Moreno et al in 2010 [17]. 	They contained 284 chronic hepatitis C Spanish patients, and found that GHRL SNPs rs26312 and rs27647 influenced the progression of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Another study assessed the relationship of progression of HCC with the GHRL rs27647, rs34911341, and rs696217 polymorphisms in 40 Egyptian patients with chronic hepatitis C, 39 patients with HCV-related HCC, and 40 healthy subjects [26]. 	The findings of these researchers showed that the GHRL rs34911341 A allele was associated with HCC risk in patients with hepatitis C. Nonetheless, these studies were both performed with a small sample size and only focused on patients with HCV-related diseases. The present study included a relatively large total number of subjects (176 CHB patients, 106 LC patients, 151 HCC patients, and 167 healthy controls) and explored the interaction between GHRL rs26311, rs27647, rs696217 and rs34911341 polymorphisms and risk of HBV-related diseases. 
PMC4658098	rs26311	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Males who carried the rs26311 C allele and the combined GC+CC genotypes in the GHRL gene were at significantly higher risk for LC. 	Significant differences were not observed in genotype and allele distributions of GHRL rs26311 in females. 	This gender effect may be due to the possible role of the larger total number of subjects in the male LC group (n = 88) than in the female LC group (n = 18). On the other hand, different types of diets (such as meat and vegetable intake) or lifestyles (such as tobacco and alcohol abuse) or gene–gene and gene–environment interactions between male and female subjects may also play a role.

In order to validate the association of the rs17125944 polymorphism with LOAD risk in the northern Han Chinese, we recruited a case–control study of 2338 Han Chinese subjects (984 cases and 1354 age- and gender-matched controls). Our results demonstrated that there was no significant association between the rs17125944 polymorphism and LOAD (genotype: P = 0.953; allele: P = 0.975).

Our results demonstrated that there was no significant association between the rs17125944 polymorphism and LOAD (genotype: P = 0.953; allele: P = 0.975). 	Furthermore, no significant differences were observed in alleles and genotypes distribution after stratification by apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 and multivariate logistic regression analysis.

As a new susceptibility locus, rs17125944 reached genome-wide significance in the combined discovery and replication analysis [6]. 	Then three studies have replicated the association of rs17125944 polymorphism with the risk for LOAD. Ruiz et al. validated the association in Spanish [13], and Xiao et al. verified the association in Southern Han Chinese [14]; however, Jiao et al. failed to replicate the association of rs17125944 polymorphism with LOAD in another Chinese population [15]. 
PMC5129912	rs17125944	Results	RefSNP	False	Distributions of genotypes in AD patients and control subjects were in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P > 0.05). 	The allele and genotype distributions of rs17125944 in cases and controls were showed in Table 2. 	And there were no significant differences between patients of LOAD and control participants (genotype P = 0.953; allele P = 0.975, OR = 0.998, 95% CI = 0.868-1.146). Then we stratified these data through the presence/absence of the APOE ε4. 
PMC5129912	rs17125944	Results	RefSNP	False	However, no significance was observed in both subjects with APOEε4 allele (genotype: P = 0.398; allele: P = 0.377, OR = 1.151, 95% CI = 0.842-1.572) and without the APOE ε4 allele (genotype: P = 0.395; allele: P = 0.586, OR = 0.957, 95% CI = 0.816-1.122). 	Furthermore, by multivariate logistic regression, there was also no association between the rs17125944 polymorphism and LOAD (dominant model: P = 0.766, OR = 0.974, 95% CI = 0.822-1.156; additive model: P = 0.937, OR = 0.994, 95% CI = 0.863-1.146; recessive model: P = 0.647, OR = 1.094, 95% CI = 0.746-1.603) after adjusting for age, gender, and the APOE ε4 allele carrier status (Table 3). 	
PMC5129912	rs17125944	Discussion	RefSNP	False	It suggests that FERMT2 might play a role in the pathological process of AD through Tau-mediated neuronal injury. 	In 2013, a meta-analysis of 74 046 samples reported by the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Disease Project (IGAP) firstly found the susceptibility loci rs17125944 in FERMT2 gene for LOAD [6]. 	Different from the effect in the population of Caucasian, our current study showed no association of LOAD risk with the rs17125944 polymorphism in a northern Han Chinese population. Furthermore, the meta-analysis of related studies showed that rs17125944 polymorphism has no association with LOAD in Chinese. 
PMC5129912	rs17125944	Discussion	RefSNP	False	First of all, different genetic backgrounds between Han Chinese and European ancestry may lead to the opposite results. 	There is significant difference on the minor allele frequency (MAF) of rs17125944 between Chinese and Caucasians. 	The MAF of rs17125944 is 24% in Chinese, while the MAF of rs17125944 is 8.0% in Caucasians based on the dbSNP database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP). Meanwhile, multiple genes and environmental factors and gene-environment interactions may affect LOAD risk [2]. 
PMC3953547	rs2229268	Abstract	RefSNP	False	A recent genome-wide association study revealed that there is an association between serum uric acid (SUA) levels and rs2544390, a common variant in low-density lipoprotein-related protein 2 (LRP2/Megalin) gene. 	Two other variants of LRP2, rs2229268 and rs3755166, are also found to have associations with dyslipidemia and Alzheimer’s disease, respectively, which also could have a relationship with SUA in human. 	Although no studies report that LRP2 transports urate, LRP2 is a multi-ligand receptor and expresses in many tissues including kidney, suggesting a direct and/or indirect relationship with gout. In the present study, we investigated the association between gout and these variants of LRP2 with 741 clinically diagnosed male gout patients and 1,302 controls. 
PMC3953547	rs2544390	Abstract	RefSNP	False	In the present study, we investigated the association between gout and these variants of LRP2 with 741 clinically diagnosed male gout patients and 1,302 controls. 	As a result, the three common LRP2 variants, rs2544390, rs2229268 and rs3755166, showed no association with gout (P = 0.76, 0.55, and 0.22, respectively). 	Our study is the first to reveal that an SUA-related gene LRP2 is not involved in gout susceptibility. 
PMC3953547	rs2544390	Methods	RefSNP	False	Genotyping of rs2544390, rs2229268, and rs3755166 in LRP2 gene was performed by an allelic discrimination assay (Custom Taqman MGB, Applied Biosystems) with a LightCycler 480 (Roche Diagnostics) [7]. 	To confirm their genotypes, more than 25 samples were subjected to direct sequencing with the following primers: for rs2544390, forward 5′-CTGTCTGAGACCATGACACAG-3′ and reverse, 5′-CCTCACCTGTCATTGTCTTG-3′; for 2229268, forward 5′-TCCGTTCAACTTTCAGACAG-3′ and reverse 5′-TTCCCAACTTTCTCAGGTTAC-3′; for 3755166, forward 5′-GTGTAAGGCCACTTGTGC-3′ and reverse 5′-GAAATGGACGAGGAGGAAAG-3′. 	DNA sequencing analysis was performed with a 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) [8]. The software R (version 3.0.2) (http://www.r-project.org/) with package GenABEL was used for the calculation of linkage disequilibrium (r2).

The call rates for rs2544390, rs3755166, and rs2229268 were 98.2, 98.1, and 99.5 %, respectively. P values for Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium of these SNPs were 0.039, 0.095, and 0.134. P values that suggested mistyping were not obtained. The minor allele frequencies (MAFs) for the three LRP2 variants were more than 0.27 in both case and control groups, indicating these SNPs are very common in both these groups.

PMC3953547	rs2544390	Results	RefSNP	False		Our study demonstrated that the three LRP2 variants, rs2544390, rs2229268, and rs3755166, had no association with gout. 	Recent GWAS of SUA [9, 10] identified several genes including GLUT9/SLC2A9 and ABCG2/BCRP, which have been revealed to have associations with urate disorders such as renal hypouricemia [11, 12] and gout [13, 14]. Recent reports also show the significance of transporter genes such as ABCG2 [15, 16], NPT1/SLC17A1 [17], MCT9/SLC16A9 [18], and OAT4/SLC22A11 [19], for the pathogenesis of gout. LRP2 was first reported to have the association with SUA in the GWAS by Kamatani et al. [1]. 
PMC3953547	rs2229268	Discussion	RefSNP	False	LRP2 is originally found as a member of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family and has been suggested to mediate endocytosis of LDL. 	Indeed, Mii et al. [2] reported that one variant of LRP2, rs2229268, has an association with serum LDL levels in humans, indicating the direct association between LRP2 and LDL. 	Since dyslipidemia is known as a risk to increase the insulin resistance, rs2229268 seems to have an association with SUA variation. Otherwise, LRP2 could be associated with SUA variation through the endocytosis of urate-binding proteins. 
PMC5955186	rs35761398	Results	RefSNP	False	We found a significant difference between genotypic and allelic distributions of the Q63R polymorphism between the inpatients and outpatients. 	The R allele, a common allele of rs35761398, showed a lower frequency for hospitalized infants compared with controls (OR = 0.630, 95% CI: 0.408–0.0973; p = 0.037)-this mean that the common allele reduced the risk of hospitalization. 	Interestingly, a significant overrepresentation of the QQ genotype and the Q allele was observed in the hospitalized patients compared with controls (OR = 3.275, 95% CI: 1.221–8.705; p = 0.019 and OR = 1.586, 95% CI: 1.027–2.449; p = 0.037 respectively). The relative odds ratio suggested that the risk of hospitalization was more than three-fold in children with the QQ genotype.

PMC5955186	rs35761398	Methods	RefSNP	False	Genomic DNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal swab samples using a DNA extraction kit following manufacturers' instructions (Roche, Germany). 	All samples were genotyped for the CNR2 rs35761398 variant, which changes the second and third adenosine at codon 63 (CAA) to guanosine (CGG) leading to the missense variant Q63R in the first intracellular signaling loop of the encoded CB2 protein. 	The genotypes of Q63R variation were determined by using a TaqMan assay with commercial probes (Thermo Fisher, USA). Both PCR and post-PCR allelic discrimination was performed on an ABI PRISM 7900 system (Applied Biosystems, USA). 
PMC4260784	rs2395029	Results	RefSNP	False	After correction for multiple testing, no association between ARSSS and human SNPs or HLA class I types was found. 	In particular, the SNPs tagging HLA-B*5701 (rs2395029) and HLA-C expression levels (rs9264942), which are the strongest genetic predictors of HIV-1 control [41], did not discriminate between patients with high or low ARSSS.

N=206 subjects (n=114 having participated in Level 1; and n=92 new subjects recruited through advertisements) were successfully genotyped for ATP6V1B2 rs1106634 and interviewed for Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and lifetime depression, provided information about gender, age and neuroticism, and carried out both cognitive tasks. 	
PMC5314132	rs1106634	Methods	RefSNP	False	We used PLINK v1.07 (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/purcell/plink/) to calculate Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and to build regression models in Level 1. 	Logistic regression equations were run on lifetime depression, and linear regressions on BSI depression score, in additive, dominant and recessive models, with ATP6V1B2 rs1106634, population (Budapest or Manchester), gender and age as predictors. 	Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold was P⩽0.0083 for these six analyses.

Similar multivariate models, but without rs1106634, were used to gain residuals for the task performance variables in order to visualize the genetic effect on them in the figures. 	Quanto (http://biostats.usc.edu/Quanto.html) was used to calculate the power of the main six tests, giving the Bonferroni-corrected P⩽0.0083 as type I error rate. Power to detect main genetic effects on lifetime depression is moderate or low: assuming an odds ratio (OR) of 1.2 and a population prevalence of 15% for lifetime depression, the power in our sample is 50.31% in a log-additive, 29.98% in a dominant and 5.79% in a recessive model.

PMC5314132	rs1106634	Discussion	RefSNP	False	The main finding of our study is supporting the role of the ATP6V1B2 rs1106634 A allele, implicated in depression GWAS-s with a suggestive significance, as a risk allele for lifetime but not current depression suggesting a role in the long-term development of affective illness. 	This finding is further underlined by the association of this SNP with neuroticism, a well-established risk factor of depression, while the fact that neuroticism only partially mediated the association between rs1106634 and depression indicates a differential involvement of rs1106634 in these two phenomena. 	Our results also show that the effect of rs1106634 on lifetime risk of depression may be due to the association of the A allele with hippocampal dysfunction, thought to play a central role in the development of depression. We must also mention that while rs1106634 was implicated in several GWAS-s in psychiatric patients, it was not among the 15 genetic loci identified in major depression in a most recent study using an extremely large cohort with less intensive phenotyping approach using self-reported lifetime depression,10 the same phenotype as used in our study.

PMC5651267	rs2476601	Article	RefSNP	False	Even here, the problem is magnified by the fact that some of the most highly associated risk genes beyond the HLA [e.g., protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22)] have a low minor allele frequency, even among T1D subjects. 	For North American and European T1D subjects, the frequency of individuals with homozygosity for the risk variant of PTPN22 (1858T at rs2476601) ranges from 0.6 to 3.7% (33). 	Moreover, genes associated with T1D risk encode proteins that cluster within biological processes and/or pathways, posing a considerable challenge when analyzing the impact of a given risk variant. Currently, 57 genomic regions that are defined by 104 SNPs [some SNPs identify the same linkage disequilibrium block] are significantly associated with T1D according to immunobase.org. 
PMC5651267	rs3184504	Article	RefSNP	False	As a specific example of immune signaling pathway cross-talk, we consider one gene that encodes a protein with known effects on cytokine receptor signaling. SH2B3 encodes a protein phosphatase Lnk that regulates Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling. 	The risk variant of SH2B3 (T at rs3184504) encodes a modified Lnk protein where arginine at amino acid 262 is replaced by tryptophan (R262W). 	Lnk is a regulator of Jak2 signaling in myeloid cells (36–38), and the T1D risk SNP for SH2B3/Lnk is associated with altered expression of key elements of IFNγ signaling including signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) (39). Furthermore, the target of Lnk, Jak2, is a cytosolic protein that transduces signals from a variety of cytokine receptors including IL-6, IL-13, G-CSF, IL-12, IL-23, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), EPO, IL-3, and IL-5 (40, 41). 
PMC5651267	rs2476601	Article	RefSNP	False	PTPN22, commonly associated with modifying receptor signaling in T and B cells, is also reported to alter the way that DCs respond to danger signals such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide by modulating TRAF3 signaling and T1-IFN production (85). 	In lupus, the risk variant of PTPN22 tagged by rs2476601, the same variant that is associated with T1D (Table 1), is associated with altered TLR7-induced T1-IFN production (86). 	A major counter-regulator of IFN signaling is the regulatory cytokine IL-10. Indeed, IL-10 is so potent for protection of host cells from CTL-mediated killing that many DNA viruses have evolved viral homologs of IL-10 to protect them from antiviral immunity (87). 
PMC5651267	rs3024504	Article	RefSNP	False	Indeed, IL-10 is so potent for protection of host cells from CTL-mediated killing that many DNA viruses have evolved viral homologs of IL-10 to protect them from antiviral immunity (87). 	The T1D risk locus defined by the SNPs rs3024504 and rs3024493 includes IL10 (Table 1). 	A protective role for IL-10 in murine T1D has been established through transgenic NOD mice that over-express IL-10 or where exogenous administration of recombinant IL-10, plasmid DNA encoding IL-10, or cells expressing IL-10 have been used (88–90). Moreover, in vitro, IL-10 protects human islets from the cytotoxic effects of inflammatory cytokines (91). 
PMC4118603	rs2032582	Article	RefSNP	False	In order to produce accurate personalized recommendations, the focus should be placed on the relationship between a variant and its related gene, drug(s) and phenotype(s). 	For example, let us suppose that a patient with bipolar disorder receives a genetic test that has the potential to determine an A/C genotype for the variant rs2032582, which corresponds to the 7 : 87160618 nucleotide position of the ABCB1 gene. How can this information be translated into clinical knowledge? 	The medical professional should be well aware that although the majority (70–80%) of patients with bipolar disorder respond well to lithium, a significant proportion will present with patterns of partial or non-responsiveness. Before prescribing this drug, the physician enters the patient's encrypted genotype data into the proposed PGx assistant, which then identifies that the specific variant is related to lithium response.

Yee et al. found a SNP in the GSTM1-GSTM5 locus, rs3754446, associated with an almost twofold shorter disease-free survival in two cohorts of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients treated with chemotherapy-based autologous HCT. 	Despite replicating in both cohorts (p = .001 and p = .028), the finding was not significant after correction for multiple testing [10]. The authors found similar relationships with rs4148405 in ABCC3, although while passing multiple testing correction in cohort 1 (p < 10e−06), it did not replicate in cohort 2.

Figure 1 shows BMI differences for rs10891319 and rs11205591 polymorphisms in each independent population and as a whole.

PMC6377525	rs11205591	Results	RefSNP	False		We studied additive effects for all these SNPs and an additive effect for rs11205591 and rs10891319 SNPs was found in the whole sample: patients carrying GG/AA combination presented significant lower BMI (figure 2A) and lower obesity risk (figure 2B) than patients carrying CC-CG/AG GG genotypes (data are expressed as rs11205591 genotype/rs10891319 genotype). 	
PMC6377525	rs11205591	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Despite differences in age, sex, BMI and obesity prevalence between the three samples, a similar trend was found considering them individually, while rs10891319 showed the strongest in the whole sample. 	Furthermore, an additive interaction was observed between these two SNPs, with a maximal BMI difference of 1.4 kg/m2 found between genotypes (CC-GG/AA GG vs GG/AA carriers, expressed as rs11205591/rs10891319 genotype carriers). 	In agreement with these findings, significant differences in obesity risk were also found.

PMC3286457	rs6596140	Abstract	RefSNP	False	To identify genes influencing hypertension and blood pressure, we conducted a combined linkage and association study using over 500,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in 328 individuals comprising 111 hypertensive probands and their siblings. 	Using a family-based association test, we found an association with SNPs on chromosome 5q31.1 (rs6596140; P<9×10−8) for hypertension. 	One candidate gene, PDC, was replicated, with rs3817586 on 1q31.1 attaining P = 2.5×10−4 and 2.9×10−5 in the within-family tests for DBP and MAP, respectively. We also identified regions of significant linkage for systolic and diastolic blood pressure on chromosomes 2q22 and 5p13, respectively. 
PMC3286457	rs1605685	Abstract	RefSNP	False	We also identified regions of significant linkage for systolic and diastolic blood pressure on chromosomes 2q22 and 5p13, respectively. 	Further family-based association analysis of the linkage peak on chromosome 5 yielded a significant association (rs1605685, P<7×10−5) for DBP. 	This is the first combined linkage and association study of hypertension and its related quantitative traits with Chinese ancestry. The associations reported here account for the action of common variants whereas the discovery of linkage regions may point to novel targets for rare variant screening. 
PMC3286457	rs6596140	Results	RefSNP	False	The whole-genome association scan for hypertension (disease status) and corresponding quantile-quantile (QQ) plot of observed p-values against those expected under the null hypothesis are presented in Figure S1. 	For the dichotomous variable of hypertension, four independent signals were found with P≤10−5, with one SNP (rs6596140) attaining P<10−7 (Table S1). 	The location of this SNP (5q31.1), marked by a strong recombination hotspot, is far away from any annotated genes, and the nearest gene is follistatin-like 4 (FSTL4) (>70 kb away) (Figure 1). FSTL4, a member of the follistatin gene family of TGF-beta superfamily inhibitors, is widely expressed in neurons, cardiac muscle cells, smooth muscle cells and intestinal epithelium [29]. If the associated SNP is truly associated, it may play a role in regulating this gene, or tagging another SNP having such a role. 
PMC3286457	rs6596140	Results	RefSNP	False	The observation that each SNP shows stronger association with one trait or another could reflect sampling variation or true differences in the underlying biological basis of the blood pressure traits. 	For the nine SNPs that were significant in continuous trait analysis, two markers (rs6596140 and rs6596142, r 2 = 0.84) were associated with hypertension status, with P<9×10−8 and <6×10−6, respectively. 	Five other markers (rs4463623, rs4434808, rs1387343, rs12930697, rs1550823) had moderate P values around .002 to .0004. The other two markers (rs9325113, rs2075514) showed no association. 
PMC3286457	rs3817586	Results	RefSNP	False	In total, this involved examining 101 SNPs. 	One SNP in PDC on 1q31.1 was significantly associated after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing of 101 SNPs, with rs3817586 (tagging rs11812050, r 2 = 0.95) attaining P = 2.5×10−4 and 2.9×10−5 in the within-family tests for DBP and MAP, respectively. 	Nonetheless, when examining the QQ plot of these tests (Figure S5), there were only small deviations from what is expected under the null hypothesis, suggesting a lack of power. Phosducin (Pdc), which was identified in retina and brain as a 33-kDa protein and binds to the βγ subunits of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins [37], [38], is a potential candidate gene for retinitis pigmentosa [39]. 
PMC3286457	rs6596140	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Our linkage analysis revealed two novel regions of linkage for DBP, 5p13.1 and 5p13.2, formally achieving genome-wide significance, and also one novel region for SBP, 2q22.3 (LOD = 3.01). 	Our association analysis has identified a significant variant (rs6596140) for hypertension and also detected effects of relatively common alleles with modest P values for quantitative traits. 	The region of association (Figure 1) is limited to a 3-kb region flanked by strong recombination hotspots, which are surrounded by multiple non-coding sequences but no known genes. FSTL4, which is a key modulator in muscle development, was specified as nominally associated with increased risk of stroke in a cardiovascular health study [51]. It is possible that the nearby associated SNP we detected plays a regulatory role for FSTL4. 
PMC3286457	rs1605685	Discussion	RefSNP	False	There is limited overlap between the regions of strongest linkage and association. 	However, further assessment of SNP association under the linkage peak on chromosome 5 did yield a significant variant, rs1605685, after correcting for multiple testing of the 808 SNPs under the peak. 	Both linkage and association analysis provide useful, but different forms of information in identifying genetic contributions to complex traits. Linkage analyses are used with family data to find broad genomic regions that contain putative disease loci, while association analyses can identify much smaller regions, either a causal variant or one which is in linkage disequilibrium with such a disease-causing locus. 
PMC3387002	rs9299	Results	RefSNP	False	SNP-1010A/G is Located within miRNA-7 Binding Site in HOXB5 3′-UTR 	We found SNP rs9299 (1010 A/G) is located within the 3′-UTR of the HOXB5 gene using the NCBI SNP database. 	HOXB5 was also predicted to be one of the target genes of miRNA-7 according to 3 of the different systemic bioinformatics software that we used, and the SNP (1010 A/G) was located within the miRNA-7 binding site (Figure 3A). 
PMC3387002	rs9642880	Discussion	RefSNP	False	In recent years, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have given us a deeper insight into the mechanisms related to genomic changes in various cancers. 	Chang et al. identified several susceptibility loci in human bladder cancer, including rs9642880 (nearest gene: MYC), rs710521 (nearest gene: TP63), and rs2294008 (nearest gene: PSCA) among others [26]. 	The involvement of miRNAs in human cancer has been discovered recently. In a previous study, we reported that miRNA-143 and miRNA-125b act as tumor suppressors in human bladder cancer by binding to the oncogenes RAS and E2F3 respectively [15], [16]. 
PMC3387002	rs9299	Discussion	RefSNP	False	These polymorphisms may not only affect gene expression, but could also have a relationship with clinical features of cancer or even with the prognosis of cancer. 	In future studies, we intend to source many more bladder cancer cases and use them to carry out a longer-term study to discover whether or not this SNP (rs9299) could be a good prognostic and prognosis factor for bladder cancer. 	In summary, in this study we showed for the first time that the HOXB5 gene may act as an oncogene in human bladder cancer. We found that a SNP (1010A/G) within the miR-7 binding site of HOXB5 3′-UTR affects HOXB5 expression and this SNP may be correlated with bladder tumorigenesis and the risk of high grade and high stage human bladder cancers. 
PMC2077927	rs2274700	Abstract	RefSNP	False	CFH is associated with early/intermediate and advanced AMD in both familial and sporadic cases. 	In our populations, the CFH SNP, rs2274700, is most strongly associated with AMD and when incorporated into a haplotype with the Y402H SNP and rs1061147, the strongest association is observed (p<10−9). 	
PMC2077927	rs1061170	Introduction	RefSNP	False	In the last few years, considerable advances have been made in identifying AMD susceptibility genes, in particular those implicated in the development of advanced disease. 	The association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CFH (Y402H, C1277T, rs1061170)[3]–[7] and LOC387715 (A69S, rs10490924)[8]–[11] and HTRA1 genes[12] with advanced AMD susceptibility have now been replicated in a number of independent studies. 	Furthermore, there is now evidence that specific SNP haplotypes within the chromosomal loci of these genes confer increased risk of CNV development or appear relatively protective.[13], [14] Other genes have been implicated in AMD development, including complement component 2 (CF2) and factor B (BF),[15] toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4),[16] and potentially a sequence variant in hemicentin-1 (HMCN-1)[17], [18] which resides close to the CFH locus on 1q.

This best combination comprised the following 3 SNPs: rs1061147, rs1061170, rs2274700 (p<0.0002, Table 2). 	Two nucleotide combinations of this 3-SNP haplotype were significantly associated with AMD status: rs1061147 ‘A’, rs1061170 ‘C’, rs2274700 ‘C’ and rs1061147 ‘C’, rs1061170 ‘T’, rs2274700 ‘T’. The other rs1061147, rs1061170, rs2274700 haplotype ‘C T C’ was not associated with AMD.

The other rs1061147, rs1061170, rs2274700 haplotype ‘C T C’ was not associated with AMD. We then investigated whether these haplotypes were associated with AMD development in the AREDS and case-control populations and found similar results (Table 3). 
PMC2077927	rs1061170	Discussion	RefSNP	False	For the first time, we report this association in families in whom there is increased susceptibility among relatives to develop the condition. 	The prevalence of the risk allele ‘C’ for the coding SNP rs1061170 (Y402H) present in exon 9 of the gene in cases of advanced AMD is broadly comparable to that previously reported in sporadic case-control populations[3], [4] and in the other 2 cohorts evaluated in this study.[12] Similarly, the odds ratio of having advanced AMD, based on the number of ‘C’ alleles present, was also comparable to previous studies. 	We chose the 7 SNPs to be genotyped based upon those previously shown to be associated with AMD at the CFH gene locus: rs529825, rs3766404, rs1061147, rs800292, rs1061170, rs203674 and rs2274700.[4] A backward step-wise selection method and the FBAT were chosen because multi-SNP effects are allowed that are not additive. If a forward selection method is used, those SNPs that have the largest additive effect are most likely to be in the model.

If a forward selection method is used, those SNPs that have the largest additive effect are most likely to be in the model. If 2 SNPs have a non-additive effect but no large marginal effects, it would be impossible to detect them using forward selection. 
PMC2077927	rs1061170	Results	RefSNP	False	Only if a SNP has a combined influence with SNPs that already have a large effect will it be detected by forward selection. 	Using backward step-wise selection, we identified a 3-SNP haplotype comprising rs1061147 ‘A’, rs1061170 ‘C’, rs2274700 ‘C’ as the most strongly associated with AMD in our familial AMD cohort. 	Analyses performed in our other 2 populations comprising sporadic cases and controls and the AREDS cohorts confirmed this association.

PMC2077927	rs1410996	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Using stepwise logistic regression, even after conditioning for each of the SNPs, the authors found that both remained strongly associated with disease. 	In our study, we did not genotype for the rs1410996 SNP. 	However, our 3-SNP disease-associated haplotype does comprise the Y402H sequence change. In summary, our 3-SNP haplotype is a good ‘fit’ for those previously described. 
PMC2077927	rs2274700	Discussion	RefSNP	False	These populations can be considered to reflect the full diversity of AMD patients: those with familial susceptibility to the condition and 2 case-control populations, one of which was followed for more than 10 years as part of a nationwide clinical trial. 	We have confirmed the association between the Y402H CFH mutation and advanced AMD finding however the strongest association with another SNP within the gene, rs2274700 in agreement with two other studies[13], [14]. 	In addition, we have found that these two SNPs, when part of a 3-SNP haplotype confer considerably increased odds of AMD development compared with the SNPs assessed singly. Our data also makes a case for CFH to have a role in drusen formation and progression as well as the development of late complications, such as choroidal neovascularization or geographic atrophy. 
PMC2077927	rs2274700	Results	RefSNP	False		Seven SNPs in and around the CFH gene locus were chosen: rs3766404, rs529825, rs1061147, rs800292, rs1061170, rs203674 and rs2274700. 	Genotyping was performed using Sanger sequencing at Prevention Genetics (3700 Downwind Drive, Marshfield, Wisconsin, USA) and at the Broad Institute Center for Genotyping and Analysis, Cambridge, MA, USA. 
PMC2077927	rs1061170	Methods	RefSNP	False		To estimate SNP frequencies and determine if the frequencies differed between affected and unaffected individuals in the pedigrees, the Family Based Association Test (FBAT) was used.[26] Adjusted unconditional logistic regression was used to determine the relationship between the CFH rs1061170 genotype and other CFH SNPs and AMD status in the other 2 populations. 	Additionally, a test for trend related to the number of risk alleles (0, 1, 2) was calculated. 
PMC3646821	rs45445295	Results	RefSNP	False	Interestingly, this was the only variation of the whole exome that resulted absent in dbSNP137. 	We also refined the interval: the SNP rs45445295 at the SMO gene at position 128,845,555 was present in some affected members (V-8, VI-60, V-14, VI-11, V-25, V-12), but it was absent in other affected members (VI-57, VI-27, VI-56) and in all non-affected individuals. 	Therefore, the linked region associated with disease locus was ∼1.1 Mb smaller (126,287,140-128,845,555) than that reported by Palenzuela [11]. 
PMC3646821	rs12539741	Discussion	RefSNP	False	The variant modifies the true stop codon and encode for two elongated proteins of 15 and 95 amino acids. 	Interestingly, one flanking SNP (rs12539741 at 128,596,805) has been identified in association with others in the region as a susceptibility locus for primary biliary cirrhosis [33]. 	Considering that the affected family members may share a ∼2.6 Mb-region on chromosome 7q32, there is the possibility that any other rare heterozygous variant could co-segregate in cis with the true LGMD1F mutation. Thus, we searched in a large collection of patients independent TNPO3 disease-associated variations. 
PMC5579000	rs228697	Results	RefSNP	False	PER3 Mutations are Associated with Eveningness and Increased Trait Anxiety 	In our study, the PER3 single nucleotide polymorphism (rs228697) is significantly associated with diurnal preference and anxiety. 	The frequency of the G allele is higher in evening-types (Fig. 1A; OR = 2.8, 95% CI = 0.347-22.610) and the distribution of GG homozygotes is significantly higher in extreme evening types (Fig. 1B; χ2 = 29.20, n = 1, p < 0.001). The average MEQ score is lower (greater propensity for eveningness) in individuals homozygous for GG than for other individuals (Fig. 1C; t = 7.415, df = 308, p = 0.016). 
PMC5579000	rs228697	Results	RefSNP	False	In this population, individuals with at least one G allele are more anxious, on average, than other individuals (Fig. 1D; F(2,305) = 3.195, p = 0.042). 	Evening-types are significantly more anxious than morning-types (M ET = 43.5, M MT = 38.5; t = 8.2, df = 380, p < 0.001).Figure 1Associations of the PER3 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP rs228697) with circadian chronotype and anxiety. 	(A) Frequencies of C and G alleles in morning-type (n = 48), intermediates (n = 159), and evening-type (n = 103) self-reported chronotypes. The frequency of the C allele is lower in evening-types (OR = 17.86, 95% CI = 0.99–321.61, p = 0.05). 
PMC5579000	rs57875989	Results	RefSNP	False	Our model, as explained below, predicts that altered binding at this site for G alleles results in a 2–6% longer circadian period (i.e., 25-hour period), supporting the prior link between period length and eveningness in a Japanese population11 as well as the association between eveningness, anxiety, and genotype in the present study. 	The PER3 length polymorphism (rs57875989) is also significantly associated with diurnal preference and anxiety. 	The frequency of the 4-repeat allele is higher in evening-types and lower in morning-types (Fig. 2A; OR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.280-0.975, z = 2.04, p = 0.042). PER3 5,5 homozygotes are significantly less frequent among evening-types (Fig. 2B; χ2 = 5.71, df = 1, p = 0.017), and PER3 4,4 homozygotes are significantly less frequent among morning types (χ2 = 40.9, df = 1, p < 0.001). PER3 4,4 homozygotes are five times more likely to be intermediates or evening-types than morning-types. 
PMC3708281	rs2270132	Methods	RefSNP	False	We obtained a list of SNPs in the RAD51 and BLM genes from the public domain of the National Center for Biotechnology Information the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms database (NCBI dbSNP) at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp. 	For this study we chose the c.-61 G>T (rs1801321) and g.38922G>C (rs4417527) polymorphisms of the RAD51 gene and the g.96267 A>C (rs2270132) and g.85394 A>G (rs2380165) polymorphisms of the BLM gene with a minor allele frequency (MAF) 0.467, 0.109, 0.376 and 0.333 in European population, respectively (submitter population ID: HapMap-CEU for all; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp). 	Primers were designed according to the published nucleotide sequence in ENSEMBL database (RAD51 gene ID: ENSG00000051180 and BLM gene ID: ENSG00000197299) and using Primer3 software for c.-61 G>T, g.38922 G>C, g.96267 A>C SNPs (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/) and Web-based allele-specific primer software for g.85394 SNP (http://bioinfo.biotec.or.th/WASP). 
PMC3708281	rs2380165	Discussion	RefSNP	False	On the other hand, our results disagree with those of Ding et al. in the case of the genotype the C/C of the g.38922 C>G polymorphism of the RAD51 gene (Table 3). 	It was shown that the polymorphic variant of the BLM gene − rs2380165 and the variants of the RAD51 gene – rs4417527 and rs2412546 were associated with breast cancer risk [26]. 	Moreover, not only the intronic polymorphisms located within the region encoding the helicase domain of BLM but also these within the RAD51-interaction domain-encoding region showed an interaction with RAD51 polymorphisms in determining breast cancer susceptibility. Recently, it was also shown that the domains responsible for RAD51 partnership coincide with the domains responsible for the binding of ssDNA, BLM100–214 and BLM1317–1367 [29]. 
PMC5396189	rs1042927	Abstract	RefSNP	False	To build respective clinical-pharmacogenetic models, pharmacogenetic scores were assigned by rounding regression coefficients. 	Gemcitabine/cisplatin model was based on training group of 71 patients and included CRP, histological type, performance status, RRM1 rs1042927, ERCC2 rs13181, ERCC1 rs3212986, and XRCC1 rs25487. 	Patients with higher score had shorter progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (P < 0.001). This model’s sensitivity was 0.615 and specificity 0.812. 
PMC5396189	rs2236225	Abstract	RefSNP	False	In independent validation group of 66 patients the sensitivity and specificity were 0.667 and 0.641, respectively. 	Pemetrexed/cisplatin model was based on 57 patients and included CRP, MTHFD1 rs2236225, and ABCC2 rs2273697. 	Patients with higher score had worse response and shorter PFS (P < 0.001). This model’s sensitivity was 0.750 and specificity 0.607. 
PMC5396189	rs2236225	Results	RefSNP	False	Pemetrexed/cisplatin clinical-pharmacogenetic model 	In this model CRP below 23 mg/l, MTHFD1 rs2236225 GG genotype and ABCC2 rs2273697 GA + AA genotypes were associated with better response rate or PFS. 	The final clinical-pharmacogenetic model had values ranging between 0 and 3.9 (Table 2). Also for this treatment regimen, the clinical-pharmacogenetic model improved predictive value as compared to the clinical model that included only CRP. 
PMC5396189	rs13181	Abstract	RefSNP	False	Based on the developed clinical-pharmacogenetic models for pemetrexed/cisplatin or gemcitabine/cisplatin chemotherapy outcomes we have proposed an algorithm that allows genotype-based treatment recommendations in MM patients. 	Our gemcitabine/cisplatin clinical-pharmacogenetic model included CRP level, histological type, performance status and four SNPs: RRM1 rs1042927, ERCC2 rs13181, ERCC1 rs3212986, and XRCC1 rs25487. 	The model was developed based on results of our previous studies111213 as we were not aware of any studies investigating the influence of SNPs on outcome of gemcitabine/cisplatin treatment in MM, while ERCC1, RRM1, ERCC2 and XRCC1 were consistently identified as prediction factors in pancreatic or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)2021. Patients with higher scores had significantly shorter PFS and OS. 
PMC5396189	rs2236225	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Although this difference represents a limitation of our study, we confirmed the predictive value of the model with PPV of 0.800 in the training and 0.735 in the validation group even in patients with shorter survival. 	Our pemetrexed/cisplatin clinical-pharmacogenetic model included two SNPs, MTHFD1 rs2236225 and ABCC2 rs2273697, and CRP level. 	Other clinical characteristics included in the gemcitabine/cisplatin model were not as important in pemetrexed-treated patients. Patients with higher scores in the final model had significantly shorter PFS and OS, as well as worse response rate, especially if patients had all the markers associated with worse outcome. 
PMC3046811	rs2267735	Article	RefSNP	False	Using logistic regression, we examined whether each SNP was associated with PTSD diagnosis in this cohort of highly traumatized urban civilian subjects (n = 798)11,12,23, in total, or stratified by gender (females: n = 503; males: n = 295). 	Only the ADCYAP1R1 receptor SNP rs2267735 (p = 0.0002 in females; NS in males) remained significant after experiment-wide multiple correction for sex and 44 independent tests (Figure 2A–B and Suppl. 	
PMC3046811	rs2267735	Article	RefSNP	False	To further examine ADCYAP1R1 rs2267735 SNP associations with continuous PTSD symptom levels in females, we analyzed both an additive and a dominant model with total PTSD symptoms and symptom subscales using the combined samples (Fig 3B – E). 	The ‘CC’ allele was most robustly associated with total PTSD symptoms and among subscales, hyperarousal symptoms were the most strongly associated with rs2267735. 	Notably, even after controlling for childhood trauma history and adult trauma, age and race, (which slightly reduces total N due to missing data) the rs2267735 ‘CC’ allele was associated with higher levels of PTSD hyperarousal symptoms compared to ‘G’ carriers in women (p = 0.0008, Fig 3E), but not men (p=0.51). We repeated the above analyses with Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) symptoms and history of lifetime substance abuse, and found no associations with these measures and rs2267735 (Suppl. 
PMC3046811	rs2267735	Article	RefSNP	False	Notably, females with the ‘CC’ genotype were significantly less able to discriminate CS+ from CS− signals (Figure 3F, sex by genotype interaction, p<0.05, and ‘CC’ vs ‘G’ carriers in females, p<0.05). 	We next examined whether a difference in dark-enhanced startle, a measure of increased anxiety in humans that is similar to light-enhanced startle in rodents26–28, was differentially associated with rs2267735. 	Again, we found that females, but not males, with the ‘CC’ genotype showed significantly more startle in the dark compared to the light (Fig 3G, males, N=35, p=0.71; females, N=53, p=0.02). Together, these data suggest that the ADCYAP1R1 rs2267735 SNP may be relatively specific in its association with PTSD psychological and physiological phenotypes. 
PMC3046811	rs2267735	Article	RefSNP	False	These data suggest that ADCYAP1R1 is regulated, in part, through epigenetic mechanisms that contribute to differential function of the PAC1 receptor in PTSD. 	To examine the potential relationship of genotype and brain mRNA expression as described previously29, we utilized a brain mRNA expression data set30 to test whether ADCYAP1R1 rs2267735 is associated with differential gene expression. 	We first examined whether cortical ADCYAP1R1 and ADCYAP1 mRNA levels were correlated. As shown in Fig 4C, these mRNA levels were significantly inversely correlated (r = −0.219, p < 0.001, including males and females), suggesting that brain levels of PACAP peptide and PAC1 mRNA are tightly regulated.

PMC2719086	rs3024660	Results	RefSNP	False	The same block structure was much weaker in the results from lasso shown in Figure 11I. 	For example, Figures 11J–L show that SNPs rs3024660 (row 22) and rs3024622 (row 18) on the upstream of SNP Q551R are associated with the same block of traits as SNP Q551R, generating an interesting new hypothesis that these two SNPs as well as SNP Q551R might be jointly associated with the same subset of traits for lung physiology. 	Although the single-marker/single-trait analyses also found these two SNPs reasonably significant ( of SNP rs3024660 in the range of  and , and SNP rs3024622 in the range of  and  across the traits for lung physiology), the results were more noisy with many positives for SNPs in LD such as SNPs in rows 20–24. Also, this block structure shared by these two SNPs and SNP Q551R was not obvious in the results of the other multivariate regression methods that analyzed each trait separately.

Also, this block structure shared by these two SNPs and SNP Q551R was not obvious in the results of the other multivariate regression methods that analyzed each trait separately. In order to see how the threshold  for creating the QTN affects the results, we fit lasso and our methods in the GFlasso family for different values of , and summarized the results in Table 1. 
PMC2719086	rs3024660	Results	RefSNP	False	In summary, the GFlasso methods identified the previously known causal SNP (SNP Q551R) as significantly associated with the lung physiology traits, while maintaining an overall sparse pattern in estimated regression coefficients to reduce false positives. 	The property of the GFlasso estimates having a block structure for a SNP jointly associated with a set of correlated traits led to an interesting new hypothesis that two additional SNPs (rs3024660 and rs3024622) on the upstream of SNP Q551R may be jointly influencing the same set of traits on lung physiology as SNP Q551R, which may be validated in a future follow-up study. 	
PMC4469006	rs322236	Discussion	RefSNP	False	The name pleiotrophin is widely accepted nowadays and reflects the plethora of functions it exerts in different tissues and cell lines. 	Two SNPs (rs322236 and rs3959914) within the first intron of the gene encoding PTN have been associated with volumetric bone mass density (25). 	Polymorphisms in the PTN gene promoter have been also mentioned to affect bone density and might be implicated in osteoporosis (26). PTN acts via various receptors (reviewed in (27)), like the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase β/ζ ανβ3integrin, nucleolin, N-syndecan, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase. 
PMC2997744	rs670	Methods	RefSNP	False	Genotyping was performed through a contractual agreement with Millennium Pharmaceuticals. 	The apoA1 (75G>A) polymorphism (refSNP ID rs670) was typed using the TaqMan method.14 TaqMan assays were validated by retesting 10% of samples using melting curve analysis (Light Cycler, Roche Diagnostics) based on G-nucleobase quenching using a 5′-FAM labeled probe (cagccccggccctgttg) spanning the polymorphic locus, in which the A variant results in a base pair mismatch. 	The frequency of the A allele in our population (0.28) was consistent with previously published reports, and the population was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with respect to this polymorphism. 
PMC5032117	rs13414223	Abstract	RefSNP	False	Both Pearson’s χ2 test and haplotype analysis were used to evaluate whether variants or their haplotypes were associated with PD in this cohort. 	The only statistically significant differences in genotypic and allelic frequencies between the patients and the controls were in the DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C10 gene (DNAJC10) variant rs13414223 (P = 0.004 and 0.002, respectively; odds ratio = 0.652, 95% confidence interval: 0.496–0.857). 	No other variants or haplotypes exhibited any significant differences between these two groups (all corrected P > 0.05). Our findings indicate that the variant rs13414223 in the DNAJC10 gene, a paralog of PD-related genes DNAJC6 and DNAJC13, may play a protective role in PD.

PMC5032117	rs13414223	Results	RefSNP	False	Associations between the variants and PD were assessed. 	After Bonferroni correction, statistically significant difference between the PD patients and control groups was only observed in the genotypic distribution of the DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C10 gene (DNAJC10) variant rs13414223 (χ2 = 11.109, P = 0.004, corrected P = 0.012).

PMC5032117	rs13414223	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Three DNAJ family genes have been implicated in familial neurodegenerative disorders, including the DNAJC6 gene in autosomal recessive PD (PARK19), the DNAJC13 gene in autosomal dominant late-onset PD (PARK21), and the DNAJC5 gene in autosomal dominant adult-onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis2223242526. 	This study found that only DNAJC10 gene variant rs13414223 was related to decreased PD risk. 	The DNAJC10 gene (MIM 607987), which is mapped to chromosome 2q32.1, contains 24 exons and spans ~64 kb, is a paralog of two known PD-related genes, DNAJC6 and DNAJC13232527. It encodes a ~91 kDa endoplasmic reticulum (ER) co-chaperone with 793 amino acids, also known as ERdj5, or JPDI, which is a type III DnaJ protein. 
PMC5032117	rs13414223	Discussion	RefSNP	False	This is consistent with the hypothesized association between PD and the DNAJC10 gene. 	In this study, the variant rs13414223 in the DNAJC10 gene had a protective role against PD development. 	Given that this study did not cover either single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a minor allele frequency of less than 5% or non-single base substitution variants, other genetic variants such as low-frequency variants, complex variants, non-coding variants involving in the genetic or epigenetic regulatory region, and synergistic or antagonistic effects should be further investigated to evaluate their roles in PD development in Han Chinese populations19373839. In summary, the variant rs13414223 in the DNAJC10 gene may exert a protective role against PD in Han Chinese.

PMC4573320	rs6102059	Methods	RefSNP	False	We prioritized genetic variants by applying a score integrating (i) GWAS for lipid genes and obesity (p-value), (ii) gene expression data from adipocytes, (iii) minor allele frequency and effect size, (iv) verification in replication analyses,. 	Based on these criteria, we selected six variants rs6102059 (MAFB), rs4420638 (APOE), rs599839 (SORT1), rs3846663 (HMGCR), rs174570 (FADS2) and rs3812316 (MLXIPL). 	We excluded well-known SNPs in genes like LDL-receptor because we were interested in new candidate genes influencing blood lipid levels. Cis-eQTL effects of SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with our variants were observed for SORT1 [18–20], HMGCR [21] and FADS2 [21–23]. 
PMC4573320	rs4420638	Results	RefSNP	False	Both top models of HDL-C contain no genetic factors but age and BMI SDS as co-variables. 	The third most probable model includes the dominant part of rs4420638 (APOE). 	
PMC4573320	rs3812316	Results	RefSNP	False	The top models of TG contain age and BMI SDS, too. 	Additionally, the second best model includes the dominant part of rs3812316 (MLXIPL). 	Various different models are plausible for LDL-C: The recessive parts of SNP rs599839 (SORT1) and rs4420638 (APOE) and BMI SDS contribute to the top 5 models of LDL-C. In less probable models for LDL-C, combinations of the recessive and dominant parts of rs599839 and rs4420638, age and BMI SDS occur.

The impact of each co-variable independent of a certain model can be assessed by interpreting the inclusion probabilities for co-variables (Fig 2). 
PMC4573320	rs174570	Discussion	RefSNP	False	We, therefore, verified that the six variants considered were not associated with the degree of obesity in the children prior to evaluation of associations with lipid traits. 	Of the six selected SNPs located in or near the genes FADS2 (rs174570), MAFB (rs6102059), HMGCR (rs3846663), MLXIPL (rs3812316), APOE/C1/C4/C2 (rs4420638) and CELSR2/PSRC1/SORT1 (rs599839), we observed a strong impact of rs599839 (SORT1) and rs4420638 (APOE) on circulating LDL-C levels independent of the degree of obesity in conventional linear regression analyses adjusting for age, sex and BMI SDS. 	This was confirmed by our Bayesian model analysis suggesting causality of these two variants on LDL-C. Bayesian analysis also revealed that effects of rs4420638 (APOE) on HDL-C, rs3846663 (HMGCR) and rs6102059 (MAFB) on LDL-C as well as rs3812316 (MLXIPL) on TG cannot be ruled out. 
PMC4573320	rs4420638	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Still, these variants should be considered as candidates requiring further investigations. 	The APOE-SNP rs4420638 is located on chromosome 19 in a cluster with APOC1, APOC4 and APOC2. 	The SNP rs599839 is located on chromosome 1, close to the genes CELSR2, PSRC1 and SORT1. Multiple other studies investigated SNPs in or near the APOE and SORT1 genes. 
PMC4573320	rs599839	Discussion	RefSNP	False	The APOE-SNP rs4420638 is located on chromosome 19 in a cluster with APOC1, APOC4 and APOC2. 	The SNP rs599839 is located on chromosome 1, close to the genes CELSR2, PSRC1 and SORT1. 	Multiple other studies investigated SNPs in or near the APOE and SORT1 genes. Rs4420638 and rs599839 showed replicable associations with lipid levels (mostly LDL-C) in Caucasian and non-Caucasian population cohorts and meta-analyses [7, 9, 15, 35]. 
PMC4573320	rs3846663	Discussion	RefSNP	False	In our Central European sample we observed no convincing association of rs6102059 with TC and LDL-C levels but we can also not completely rule out an effect based on our Bayesian analysis. 	The intronic SNP rs3846663 in HMGCR was reported to be significantly associated with LDL-C levels in a cohort of 19,840 subjects [8]. 	These findings were replicated in several populations (Kosrean islands inhabitants (n = 2,346) with an even larger effect size compared to Kathiresan et al [8] and Japanese [38] or Scottish [39]. Our results did not reach significance again possibly due to our limited sample size, but by trend, are in line with the above mentioned studies. 
PMC4573320	rs3812316	Discussion	RefSNP	False	In our study, standard linear regression analysis did not reveal any significant association. 	Nevertheless our results show lower triglyceride levels in homozygous SNP-carriers with rs3812316/GG genotype (CC: 1.13 mmol/l; GG: 0.69 mmol/l adjusted for age, sex and BMI SDS) in agreement with the above mentioned observations. 	The effects that were seen in our analysis indicate a protective function for minor allele carriers concerning triglyceride levels in children, even in the presence of obesity [16]. Again, Bayesian model analysis supports this finding since in contrast to HDL-C and LDL-C, an effect of rs3812316 to TG cannot be excluded.

Again, Bayesian model analysis supports this finding since in contrast to HDL-C and LDL-C, an effect of rs3812316 to TG cannot be excluded. 	A limitation of our study is the relatively small sample size since recruitment of volunteers is more challenging for childhood cohorts. Children are a population much less affected by chronic diseases or medication. 
PMC5527299	rs6489956	Abstract	RefSNP	False	The relationship between TBX5 3′UTR variants and CHD susceptibility was examined in 1 177 CHD patients and 990 healthy controls in two independent case–control studies. 	Variant rs6489956 C>T was found to be associated with increased CHD susceptibility in both cohorts. 	The combined CHD risk for the CT and TT genotype carriers was 1.83 times higher than that of CC genotype, while the risk for CT or TT genotype was 1.94 times and 2.31 times higher than that of CC carriers, respectively. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analysis showed that T allele carriers exhibited reduced TBX5 mRNA and protein levels in CHDs tissues. 
PMC5527299	rs6489956	Abstract	RefSNP	False	The assays in zebrafish model were in support of the interaction of miR-9/30a and TBX5 3′UTR (C and T allele). 	We concluded that TBX5 3′UTR variant rs6489956 increased susceptibility of CHD in the Han Chinese population because it changes the binding affinity of two target miRNAs that specifically mediate TBX5 expression. 	
PMC5527299	rs6489956	Introduction	RefSNP	False	Our previous study demonstrated that miR-10a and miR-10b significantly repressed TBX5 protein levels by targeting its 3′UTR [23]. 	In present study, we detected a common variant, rs6489956, in the TBX5 3′UTR that significantly increases CHD risk in a Han Chinese cohort composed of 1 177 CHD patients and 990 healthy controls. 	We further investigated the molecular mechanism underlying that TBX5 3′UTR variants influence risk for CHD susceptibility. 
PMC5527299	rs6489956	Results	RefSNP	False		TBX5 3′UTR variant rs6489956 significantly increased CHD susceptibility in Han Chinese 	In our study, a total of ten variants in TBX5 3′UTR were identified. Among them, four variants had minor allele frequency (MAF) >0.05 and were chosen for genotyping in 288 cases and controls of the Shandong group. 
PMC5527299	rs6489956	Results	RefSNP	False	Among them, four variants had minor allele frequency (MAF) >0.05 and were chosen for genotyping in 288 cases and controls of the Shandong group. 	Among them, the prevalence of variant rs6489956 (c.* 1101C>T) was significantly different between the CHDs and the control subjects. 	This variant was then selected for further validation in the other two independent case–control cohorts (Supplementary Table S3). As the homozygous TT genotype was very rare, we applied the dominant model of inheritance to enhance the statistical power of the study, which combined homozygous TT alleles with heterozygous CT alleles to compare with the wild-type CC alleles in the association studies. 
PMC5527299	rs6489956	Results	RefSNP	False	Logistic regression analyses demonstrated heterozygote CT and homozygote TT subjects had a significantly increased risk of CHD compared with those with the wild-type CC allele in a study of 905 CHDs and 606 controls in the Shandong group (odds ratio (OR)=2.33, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.70–3.19, P=1.65×10−7), as well as 272 CHDs and 384 controls in the Shanghai cohort (OR=1.75, 95% CI=1.24–2.46, P=0.0013). 	The combination of these two independent studies showed a 1.83-fold increased CHD risk when the dominant model is used for TBX5 rs6489956 (P=3.62×10−8) in a total number of 1 177 CHDs patients and 990 controls (Table 1), with an adjusted OR of 1.94 (95% CI=1.52–2.47, P=8.21×10−8) and 2.31 (95% CI=1.01–5.30, P=0.033) for the CT and TT genotypes, respectively. 	Therefore, The variant rs6489956 was significantly associated with an increased risk of CHD in two cohorts separately and together. Similarly, the allele analysis showed that carriers of the susceptible T allele exhibited a higher risk of CHD than carriers of the C allele in both cohorts, resulting in a 1.86-fold combined higher susceptibility of CHD (95%CI=1.50–2.30, P=2.01×10−8). 
PMC5527299	rs6489956	Results	RefSNP	False	The combination of these two independent studies showed a 1.83-fold increased CHD risk when the dominant model is used for TBX5 rs6489956 (P=3.62×10−8) in a total number of 1 177 CHDs patients and 990 controls (Table 1), with an adjusted OR of 1.94 (95% CI=1.52–2.47, P=8.21×10−8) and 2.31 (95% CI=1.01–5.30, P=0.033) for the CT and TT genotypes, respectively.

All genotype frequencies were in accordance with the Hardy-Weinberg expectation among the control subjects (P>0.05). 
PMC5527299	rs6489956	Results	RefSNP	False	Consistent with the reduction in mRNA expression, TBX5 protein level in the CT genotype was reduced by 72.9% compared with the CC genotype (0.27±0.19 vs 1.0±0.57, P=0.0037) (Figure 1b). 	Although this study measured TBX5 mRNA and protein levels in heart tissue samples from subjects who have already been born, which might be different from embryonic TBX5 levels, our results demonstrated that TBX5 transcription and translation levels were correlated with the variant rs6489956 genotypes. 	Altered TBX5 mRNA expression associated with the variant rs6489956 was further confirmed by in vitro luciferase assays in different cell lines. Consistent with the tissue sample results, the plasmid containing the mutant-T allele showed a 26%, 28% and 31% reduction in luciferase activity when compared with the wild-type C allele in HEK 293T, HCM and H9C2 cells, respectively (P<0.01) (Figure 1c).

Therefore, both in vivo and in vitro experimental evidence clearly supports the hypothesis that the TBX5 c.*1101C>T variant affected the transcription of TBX5. 
PMC5527299	rs6489956	Results	RefSNP	False	miR-9 and miR-30a inhibited TBX5 expression by interacting with the TBX5 c.*1101C>T variant 	In the flanking region of the TBX5 3′UTR variant rs6489956, there are 16 software-predicted miRNAs including five upstream miRNAs, seven downstream miRNAs and four on-site miRNAs (Figure 2a). 	It was found that only 2 out of these 16 miRNAs, namely, miR-9 and miR-30a, can cause a significant disparity in the expression of the two allelic reporters in HEK 293T cells co-transfected with the psiCHECK-C/T plasmid (Figure 2b). The endogenous expression of miR-9 and miR-30a was detected in all of the 30 human cardiac samples (Figure 3a). 
PMC5527299	rs6489956	Results	RefSNP	False	We also observed that miR-30a binds to TBX5 mRNA carrying the T allele with a higher affinity compared with that of the C allele (5.10×10−7 moll−1[M] vs 1.23×10−6 m) (Figure 2e). 	For the upstream miR-9, although the variant rs6489956 appears not to directly affect miR-9 binding (Supplementary Figure S1), it might impair the miRNAs complex that interacts with the TBX5 motif containing variant rs6489956, as previously described [25]. 	The specific inhibition of miR-9 and miR-30a for TBX5 caused by the 3′ UTR variant c.*1101C>T was demonstrated by a psiCHECK luciferase reporter assay as well as the rescue experiments from miRNA inhibitors. The luciferase gene expression of psiCHECK-C and psiCHECK-T were both inhibited in a linear manner with increased miRNAs concentration, and the miRNAs displayed a more pronounced inhibition effect on psiCHECK-T (Figure 2c). 
PMC5527299	rs6489956	Results	RefSNP	False	Therefore, the mechanisms by which miR-9 and miR-30a regulate TBX5 were confirmed both in vitro and in vivo. 	TBX5 3′UTR variant rs6489956 interacted with miR-30a or miR-9 in zebrafish 	In order to test the interaction effect of TBX5 3′UTR variant and miR-30a or miR-9 in vivo, we explored their function on heart development using zebrafish model system. We set up 11 groups for microinjection and did imaging analysis at 48 h post fertilization (hpf): wild-type (WT) control, standard MO control (5 ng), tbx5 MO (5 ng), tbx5 MO (2.5 ng), tbx5 MO (0.5 ng), MO (5 ng)+C allele mRNA (100 pg), MO (5 ng)+T allele mRNA (100 pg), MO (5 ng)+C allele mRNA (100 pg)+hsa-mi9 (100 pg), MO (5 ng)+T allele mRNA (100 pg)+hsa-miR-9 (100 pg), MO (5 ng)+C allele mRNA (100 pg)+hsa-miR-30a (100 pg) and MO (5 ng)+T allele mRNA (100 pg)+hsa-miR-30a (100 pg). 
PMC5527299	rs6489956	Discussion	RefSNP	False	In this study, we investigated all common SNPs in the TBX5 3′UTR region and focused on the potential functional variant that we thought might modulate TBX5 expression by its interaction with miRNAs. 	The functional variant TBX5 c.*1101C>T (rs6489956) was found to significantly increase CHD risk in Han Chinese by interacting with miR-30a and miR-9 (OR=1.83. 	95% CI=1.48–2.28, P=3.62×10−8 in the dominant model). Although we first postulated that a functional variant in the TBX5 3′UTR may increase the risk of CHD, a recent study indirectly supported our findings by reporting that a TBX5 enhancer variant causes isolated congenital heart disease [22]. 
PMC5527299	rs7312625	Discussion	RefSNP	False	While severe loss-of-function mutations in TBX5 coding regions led to both heart and forelimb phenotypes, non-coding variants were associated with compartmentalized phenotypes, which might reflect the differing sensitivities of the impacted tissues to the altered TBX5 expression level. 	This contention is supported by the fact that the TBX5 intronic variant rs7312625 was reported to be associated with altered PR intervals (intervals between P wave and R wave in electrocardiogram). 	In African Americans, and intronic variant rs3825214 was shown to reduce lone atrial fibrillation risk in Han Chinese [39, 40]. The tissue-specific regulation of different non-coding regions could be one possible explanation.

In African Americans, and intronic variant rs3825214 was shown to reduce lone atrial fibrillation risk in Han Chinese [39, 40]. 	The tissue-specific regulation of different non-coding regions could be one possible explanation. In both embryonic and adult human heart tissues, TBX5 expression can be observed throughout the epicardium and myocardium, including the free walls and septa of all four cardiac chambers, while its expression in the endocardium is limited to the left ventricle [41]. 
PMC5527299	rs6489956	Discussion	RefSNP	False	In our study of sporadic CHD cases, we observed that rs6489956 is correlated with a series of cardiac abnormalities; septal defects were statistically most common (n=830, P=9.70×10−6). 	Additionally, we speculated that the failure to detect any correlation between variant rs6489956 and APVR and outflow tract malformation susceptibility might be due to the limited and insufficient sample size. 	Both in vivo and in vitro assays on the function of variant rs6489956 indicated that the T allele led to reduction in TBX5 gene expression. We further identified two miRNAs, miR-9 and miR-30a, that interacted with this variant.

We further identified two miRNAs, miR-9 and miR-30a, that interacted with this variant. This is not surprising, because miRNAs are predicted to function in the post-transcriptional regulation of nearly one third of all human genes [45]. 
PMC5527299	rs6489956	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Therefore, future investigations on the interaction of CHD-associated regulatory variants in the master transcription factors and its target miRNAs will open a door for the improved CHD diagnosis and therapy. 	In summary, our study demonstrated a significant effect of TBX5 3′UTR variant rs6489956 on the increased susceptibility of CHD in two independent Han Chinese populations. 	It was well known that both Tbx5 overexpression and insufficiency result in heart defects in developing embryos. In view of the decreased TBX5 mRNA levels detected in the heart tissues of CHD patients with the CT and TT genotypes, the individuals with the T allele are susceptible to develop CHD due to the TXB5 deficiency.

PMC5976520	rs1137101	Introduction	RefSNP	False	Clostridium difficile is the most common cause of hospital-acquired infections in the U.S.1 and is ranked in the top 3 urgent public health threats by the CDC (www.cdc.gov)2. 	Host genetic factors can alter the risk of acquiring C. difficile: a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the interleukin-8 gene increases susceptibility to C. difficile colitis3, and we have previously shown that a non-synonymous SNP, rs1137101, on the extra cellular domain of leptin receptor (LEPR) increases the risk of C. difficile diagnosis4. 	We found that individuals homozygous for the derived allele G, which encodes for Arginine (R) at position 223 (RR genotype) were at a higher risk of being diagnosed with CDI (odds ratio 3.03), as compared to individuals either homozygous or heterozygous for the ancestral allele A, which encodes for Glutamine (Q, QQ or QR genotype) at the same position4. Q223R is a common SNP in humans with a mean allelic frequency of ∼50% in European-Americans and 40-60% in African-Americans (http://hgdp.uchicago.edu). 
PMC4391582	rs7412	Methods	RefSNP	False	Upon completion of blood fractionation, samples were aliquoted and immediately stored in liquid nitrogen until required for analysis. 	DNA was isolated from whole blood using a QIAamp DNA Blood Midi Kit (Qiagen, Chadstone Centre, Australia) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and APOE genotype was determined through either PCR amplification and restriction enzyme digestions, as previously described [25], or through TaqMan genotyping assays (Life Technologies, Mulgrave, Australia) for rs7412 (Assay ID: C____904973_10) and rs429358 (Assay ID: C_3084793_20). 	For TaqMan assays, PCRs and real-time fluorescence measurements were carried out on a ViiA 7 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Mulgrave, Australia) using the TaqMan GTXpress Master Mix (Life Technologies) methodology per the manufacturer’s instructions.

PMC6293323	rs13178594	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Interestingly, we found that GABA-associated genes, GABRB2 and NSF, are within susceptibility loci for FTLD. 	Two marginal risk variants (P-value = 7.24 × 10−3 for rs13178594 and P-value = 9.14 × 10−3 for rs194072) were also mapped to GABRB2 in the GWAS for PSP risk68. 	Of note, the haplotype block constituted by genetic susceptibility loci of FTLD mapped to NSF, or MAPT H1 haplotype69, is a significant GWAS hit shared with FTD, PSP, CBD, and Parkinson disease53,68,70. Our results also indicate that the iPSC model of MAPT p.R406W has some correlation with PSP, implicating the ability of the iPSC model of MAPT p.R406W to capture disease mechanisms related to other primary tauopathies. 
PMC5056901	rs1801274	Abstract	RefSNP	False	In this study, we aimed to replicate the SNPs that were recently discovered in the GWAS; these SNPs have not been validated in Koreans or have only been replicated in Koreans with an insufficient sample size to conclude any association. 	For this, we selected five SNPs (rs1801274 in FCGR2A and rs2286672 in PLD2, rs887369 in CXorf21, rs9782955 in LYST, and rs3794060 in NADSYN1). 	Through the replication study with 656 cases and 622 controls, rs1801274 in FCGR2A was found to be significantly associated with SLE in Koreans (odds ratio, 1.26, 95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 1.50; p = 0.01 in allelic model). This association was also significant in two other models (dominant and recessive). 
PMC5056901	rs1801274	Methods	RefSNP	False		In this study, we selected five SNPs (rs1801274 in FCGR2A locus, rs2286672 in PLD2 locus, rs887369 in CXorf21 locus, rs9782955 in LYST, and rs3794060 in NADSYN1) that were identified to be associated with SLE from a previous GWAS [12] but have not been tested in a Korean population. 	Five SNPs were genotyped using the TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) for allelic discrimination. TaqMan polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and fluorescence measurements were performed using a ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using a 384-well plate according to the manufacturer's instructions. 
PMC5056901	rs2286672	Methods	RefSNP	False	Seven of the 43 SNPs were not replicated in the Korean population, and five of them showed a minor allele frequency above 5% in the East Asian population (Supplementary Table 1). 	Therefore, we selected the five SNPs for a replication study in Koreans (rs1801274 in FCGR2A locus, rs2286672 in PLD2 locus, rs887369 in CXorf21 locus, rs9782955 in LYST, and rs3794060 in NADSYN1) (Table 1). 	Three of them were nonsynonymous, and the other two were intronic SNPs. 
PMC5056901	rs1801274	Results	RefSNP	False	We performed an association analysis with three different genetic models: allelic, dominant, and recessive (Table 3).

PMC5056901	rs887369	Methods	RefSNP	False	Its high heritability and relatively higher risks in siblings suggest a genetic contribution to the risk of SLE [2122]. 	In this study, we aimed to replicate five SNPs that were discovered in Caucasians [12] but not replicated in Koreans (rs2286672 in PLD2 locus, rs887369 in CXorf21 locus, rs9782955 in LYST, and rs3794060 in NADSYN1) or replicated in Koreans (rs1801274 in FCGR2A locus) with insufficient sample size to conclude any association. 	Through a replication study with 656 cases and 622 controls, rs1801274 in FCGR2A was found to be significantly associated with SLE in Koreans. However, the other four candidate SNPs were not replicated in Koreans. 
PMC5056901	rs1801274	Discussion	RefSNP	False	However, the other four candidate SNPs were not replicated in Koreans. 	The risk allele (G) of rs1801274 in FCGR2A is a missense variant that changes a histidine to arginine [23]. 	The human Fcγ receptor (FCGR) gene family (FCGR2A, FCGR2B, and FCGR2C) is located on chromosome 1q23, and it is considered to be associated with the susceptibility to SLE [2324]. Functionally, human Fcγ receptor is involved in anti-inflammatory regulation of immune responses. 
PMC5056901	rs1801274	Discussion	RefSNP	False	However, the association was hard to conclude because of the lack of power due to the limited small sample size (73 to 300 patients). 	In conclusion, in this study, we performed a replication study of five SNPs, previously known to be associated with SLE but not replicated in Koreans, with a relatively large amount of samples, demonstrating that rs1801274 in FCGR2A shows a nominally significant association with SLE, but the other four SNPs appear to have no association in the Korean population. 	Our result is supportive that FCGR polymorphisms may play important roles in the susceptibility to SLE in diverse populations, including Koreans. 
PMC5960887	rs2228570	Abstract	RefSNP	False	There is not a great deal of information regarding the association of these SNPs with TB risk in the Kazakh population. 	The four most commonly investigated VDR polymorphisms in association with different diseases, including susceptibility to tuberculosis, are located in exon 2 (rs2228570 or FokI), intron 8 (rs1544410 or BsmI and rs7975232 or ApaI), and exon 9 (rs731236 or TaqI). 	The aim of our study was to determine whether these four VDR gene single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with TB and whether they were a risk for the development of TB in the Kazakh Population in Almaty city and Almaty area. 
PMC6399342	rs72755233	Results	RefSNP	False		The two most significantly associated SNPs in the GWAS, rs72755233 (OR = 1.18, p = 2.3 × 10−15) and rs62621197 (OR = 1.31, p = 7.5 × 10−14), are missense variants in ADAMTS17 and ADAMTS10, respectively (Fig. 2). 	In order to annotate and map the associated non-coding variants to known and predicted regulatory elements, we used FUMA25. Across several of the loci there was strong evidence of functionality: 30 out of 422 genome-wide significant variants had a combined annotation-dependent depletion (CADD) score >12.37, the threshold suggested for deleterious SNPs26. 
PMC6399342	rs3791679	Results	RefSNP	False	Across several of the loci there was strong evidence of functionality: 30 out of 422 genome-wide significant variants had a combined annotation-dependent depletion (CADD) score >12.37, the threshold suggested for deleterious SNPs26. 	This included the two missense variants above and rs3791679, the fourth most significantly associated SNP (OR = 1.11, p = 2.0 × 10−12), which resides in an enhancer region of EFEMP127. 	A further 3 out of 428 genome-wide significant SNPs had a RegulomeDB score of 2b, which is likely to affect protein binding (Supplementary Data 2).Fig. 2Regional association plots for three GWAS loci and the expression of target genes from RNA-Seq. a Chromosome 15q26.3 (the site of missense variant in ADAMTS17). b Chromosome 19p13.2 (the site of missense variant in ADAMTS10). c Chromosome 2p16.1 (the site of intronic variant in EFEMP1). SNP position is shown on the x-axis, and the strength of association on the y-axis. 
PMC6399342	rs72755233	Results	RefSNP	False	Notably, measures of height were significantly negatively correlated with CTS (rg = -0.217, p = 3.7 × 10−9 for “Height_2010” and rg = -0.223, p = 2.1 × 10−6 for “Extreme height”) (Supplementary Table 7). 	Consistent with this negative genetic correlation between height and CTS, the four most significantly associated SNPs in this GWAS (rs72755233, rs62621197, rs1863190, and rs3791679) have been previously identified as GWAS loci for height35–37. 	For all but rs1863190, the risk allele for CTS was associated with a lower height in the previous reports. We therefore hypothesised that CTS cases would be shorter than controls within the UK Biobank cohort. 
PMC6399342	rs3791679	Discussion	RefSNP	False	This suggests the intriguing hypothesis that variation in ADAMTS17 may impede the neural recovery following carpal tunnel treatment and deserves further study. 	The fourth most significantly associated SNP in the GWAS, rs3791679, resides in an enhancer region of EFEMP127 (EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1) and has a CADD score of 14.94, suggesting that it is a plausible causal variant at this locus. 	
PMC6399342	rs12406439	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Variants at the EFEMP1 locus have been associated with adult height36, inguinal hernia53, and various cancers54; EFEMP1 knockout mice demonstrated disruption or reduction in elastic fibres in their connective tissues55. 	Similarly, our top GWAS hit at 1p21.1 is a variant approximately 0.1 Mb downstream of COL11A1 (rs12406439, p = 1.1 × 10−8, OR = 1.05), the only protein-coding gene within 0.5 Mb of this SNP (Supplementary Fig. 7). COL11A1 encodes α1(XI), one of the three chains that constitute the triple helix in type XI collagen56. 	Type XI collagen has been implicated in a range of musculoskeletal conditions, including lumbar disc herniation57, Achilles tendinopathy58, and CTS59. In the latter study, homozygotes of the T allele at rs3753841 (a missense mutation) in COL11A1 were found to be significantly over-represented in CTS patients vs controls. 
PMC6399342	rs3753841	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Type XI collagen has been implicated in a range of musculoskeletal conditions, including lumbar disc herniation57, Achilles tendinopathy58, and CTS59. 	In the latter study, homozygotes of the T allele at rs3753841 (a missense mutation) in COL11A1 were found to be significantly over-represented in CTS patients vs controls. 	rs3753841 is approximately 140 kb from our top SNP at this locus (rs12406439), and the two SNPs are in moderate linkage disequilibrium (r2 = 0.69; 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3, GBR (British in England and Scotland) data). In fact, rs3753841 is a genotyped SNP in the UK Biobank array, and its p value in our association study was 5.4 × 10−5, which is suggestive of association with CTS.

In fact, rs3753841 is a genotyped SNP in the UK Biobank array, and its p value in our association study was 5.4 × 10−5, which is suggestive of association with CTS. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that COL11A1, like EFEMP1, is another candidate connective tissue gene, the abnormal expression or function of which contributes to the aetiology of CTS. 
PMC6399342	rs3791679	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Thus, aberrations in elastic and connective tissue components in the extracellular matrix are likely to contribute to this pathophysiological process, and this theory was supported by our gene-based enrichment analysis. 	We hypothesise that the risk allele at rs3791679 might lead to the overexpression of EFEMP1 in synovium and may contribute to increased tethering and impaired gliding of the median nerve, thus predisposing it to shear stress and subsequent fibrosis. 	Interestingly, miR-338-5p has recently been shown to inhibit the synthesis of EFEMP1 by directly binding to the EFEMP1 mRNA 3′-UTR region in glioblastoma-derived cells66, illustrating the potential of this pathway as a modifiable therapeutic target. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) plays a critical role in the regulation of extracellular matrix gene expression67, and several previous studies have reported the role played by TGF-β and the TGF-β/Smad signalling pathway in the development of SSCT fibrosis in CTS68,69, including the finding that the inhibition of TGF-β1 in SSCT fibroblasts from CTS patients resulted in the down-regulation of several fibrosis-related genes and the inhibition of Smad activity68. 
PMC6399342	rs7517682	Methods	RefSNP	False	Hence, the weighted median approach is more robust to violation of the InSIDE assumption than MR-Egger85. 	We also performed a sensitivity analysis by repeating the above three analyses by excluding 5/601 SNPs that were genome-wide significant in both the height and CTS GWAS (or was a proxy SNP in high LD), which are as follows: rs7517682, rs6751657, rs3791679, rs17181956, and rs6955948. 	A SNP that appeared asymmetrical on the funnel plot (rs724016) was removed as a further sensitivity analysis in a leave-one-out analysis, and this had no material effect on the MR estimate (Fig. 3c, d).

PMC4452511	rs204926	Abstract	RefSNP	False	In addition, 16 haplotypes in four separate genes were significantly different between case and control groups at an unadjusted P value < 0.05, 11 of which were located in LMO1. 	A major haplotype, ATC, containing rs204926, rs110420, and rs110419, conferred a significant increase in risk for NB (OR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.41–2.36, adjusted P < 0.001). 	The major finding of our study was obtained for risk alleles within the LMO1 gene. Our data suggest that genetic variants in LMO1 are associated with increased NB risk in Chinese children. 
PMC4452511	rs204926	Results	RefSNP	False	Of these, 23 SNPs in four genes showed case-control differences of allelic frequencies at an unadjusted P value < 0.05.

PMC4452511	rs2290451	Results	RefSNP	False	Analyses using a two-sided χ 2 test indicated that the frequencies of 16 haplotypes in four genes showed significant differences between the case and control groups (unadjusted P <0.05, S4 Table). 	After Bonferroni adjustment, only two haplotypes were observed to be significantly different between cases and controls: GCGCT (rs2290451, rs4758053, rs110419, rs110420, and rs204926) and ATGGG (rs4758051, rs7109806, rs11041815, rs12576570, and rs10840002), both in LMO1. 	The GCGCT haplotype contained the statistically significant risk SNP rs204926 (S1 Fig). In order to reveal whether the joint effects existed in the block containing rs204926, we further analyzed the linkage disequilibrium and haplotype for SNPs only in that block.

In order to reveal whether the joint effects existed in the block containing rs204926, we further analyzed the linkage disequilibrium and haplotype for SNPs only in that block. As shown in S1 Fig, perfect LD (D′ = 1) was observed between several pairs of SNPs, but the r 2 is low (< 0.4). 
PMC4452511	rs204926	Results	RefSNP	False	High LDs were found in rs204926, rs110420, and rs110419 (D′ > 0.97, r 2 > 0.59). 	A major haplotype ATC (66.0%) of the combination of rs204926, rs110420, and rs110419 showed a significant increase in risk for NB (OR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.41–2.36, P < 0.001, Table 4), while another haplotype GCT (23.9%) of the combination of the three SNPs showed a significant decrease in risk for NB (OR = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.28–0.51, P < 0.001, Table 4). 	
PMC4452511	rs4758051	Discussion	RefSNP	False	A recent study by Wang et al. has identified LMO1 as a neuroblastoma oncogene [10]. 	That study used four cohorts and identified five significant SNPs associated with NB, namely rs4758051 (G allele; OR = 1.30, P = 6.94 × 10–11), rs10840002 (A allele; OR = 1.24, P = 4.03 × 10–7), rs110419 (G allele; OR = 0.74, P = 1.35 × 10–13), rs204938 (C allele; OR = 1.20, P = 1.79 × 10–6), and rs110420 (C allele; OR = 0.74, P = 1.35 × 10–13). 	The above-mentioned SNPs were all genotyped in our study. Among these SNPs, only rs110419 (G allele; OR = 0.62, P = 0.004), rs110420 (C allele; OR = 0.61, P = 0.003), and rs204938 (C allele; OR = 1.67, P = 0.008) were significantly associated with NB risk at the two-sided P < 0.05 level after adjustment for gender and age; none remained significant after correction for multiple comparisons. 
PMC4452511	rs110419	Discussion	RefSNP	False	The above-mentioned SNPs were all genotyped in our study. 	Among these SNPs, only rs110419 (G allele; OR = 0.62, P = 0.004), rs110420 (C allele; OR = 0.61, P = 0.003), and rs204938 (C allele; OR = 1.67, P = 0.008) were significantly associated with NB risk at the two-sided P < 0.05 level after adjustment for gender and age; none remained significant after correction for multiple comparisons. 	The trends of previous studies and our study are similar, but the exact results vary for several reasons. First, the 244 patients and 305 controls might not represent all of the NB patients and controls in China due to the limited sample size and sample collection location. 
PMC4452511	rs110419	Discussion	RefSNP	False		In consideration of the important role of LMO1 in the nervous system development, it is possible that the above risk alleles (A of rs110419, T of rs110420, and C of rs204926) and haplotype (ATC) would lead to increased LMO1 expression, and thus higher risk of NB in Chinese children. 	Of interest is the fact that we observed a trend toward significance for two SNPs in the HSD17B12 gene, namely rs10838184 and rs11037575 (Fig 1, Table 3). The HSD17B12 gene encodes human 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 12, an enzyme involved in lipid metabolism [25].

The HSD17B12 gene encodes human 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 12, an enzyme involved in lipid metabolism [25]. Previous studies revealed that HSD17B12 could be a prognosis marker for several human cancers [26–28]. 
PMC4452511	rs11037575	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Previous studies revealed that HSD17B12 could be a prognosis marker for several human cancers [26–28]. 	A recent study by Nguyễn et al. showed that SNPs in HSD17B12 were associated with low-risk NBs, and rs11037575 was the most significant SNP in the HSD17B12 gene [11]. 	The most significant finding in our study was for rs10838184, presenting in moderate LD with rs11037575 (D′ = 1, r 2 = 0.49). Our results indicated that the HSD17B12 gene might be a risk gene for NB patients in China. 
PMC4452511	rs6435862	Discussion	RefSNP	False	These results suggested lincRNA might be related to NB risk, which should be confirmed by further study with a larger sample size and possible functional experiments. 	Moreover, previous genetic association analysis of clinical NB phenotypes showed that other SNPs at other genes such as rs6435862 and rs7585356 at BARD1 conferred an increased risk for NB in Caucasian and African patients [7, 8]. 	In our study, only one SNP in LMO1 showed a statistically significant association with NB risk. We hypothesize that this lack of association to the other SNPs is due to ethnic differences between the Chinese population and the other populations as well as insufficient statistical power because of the limited sample size. 
PMC3092928	rs17632542	Abstract	RefSNP	False	Genotypes were imputed for 197 and 312 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from HapMap2 and the 1000 Genome Project, respectively. 	The most significant association with PrCa was with a previously unidentified SNP, rs17632542 (combined P = 3.9 × 10−22). 	This association was confirmed by direct genotyping in three stages of the UK/Australian GWAS, involving 10,405 cases and 10,681 controls (combined P = 1.9 × 10−34). rs17632542 is also shown to be associated with PSA levels and it is a non-synonymous coding SNP (Ile179Thr) in KLK3. 
PMC3092928	rs2735839	Introduction	RefSNP	False	We previously conducted a GWAS in two stages and identified SNPs in seven regions associated with PrCa risk (Eeles et al. 2008). 	One of these SNPs, rs2735839 on 19q13.3, lies within an LD block of 34 kb, containing the kallikrein genes, KLK3 and KLK2 (combined stage 1 and 2 P = 2.3 × 10−17). 	This SNP was also shown to be associated with serum PSA level; however, an association with PrCa has been demonstrated using samples not ascertained by PSA screening, suggesting that the association is not solely due to selection of cases with elevated PSA and controls with a low PSA level (Ahn et al. 2008). KLK3 encodes prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a member of the kallikrein family of serine proteases. 
PMC3092928	rs2735839	Introduction	RefSNP	False	For this reason, PSA is extensively used as a biomarker to screen for and monitor treatment of PrCa. 	The association with rs2735839 implies that one or more variants in the KLK3 region, correlated with rs2735839, are directly associated with PrCa risk. 	In an attempt to identify such variants, we performed a comprehensive analysis of SNPs across the region, using a combination of imputation and further genotyping. 
PMC3092928	rs2735839	Methods	RefSNP	False		To evaluate associations with PrCa for SNPs not included in genotyping arrays used in the GWAS, we defined a 34 kb LD region that included all SNPs in the region correlated with the original best hit, rs2735839, at r2 > 0.1 according to the HapMap Phase II CEU dataset. 	We then identified all SNPs in the interval from the HapMap Phase II as well as SNPs identified through sequencing of European (CEU) samples in the 1000 Genomes study at a frequency of at least 2%. Genotypes for these SNPs in stages 1 and 2 of the UK/Australian GWAS, and the CGEMS study, were then imputed using MACH 1.0 (http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/MACH/) and 50 rounds of imputation. 
PMC3092928	rs17632542	Methods	RefSNP	False		SNP rs17632542 was genotyped for stages 1 and 2 samples by the 5′-endonuclease assay (Taqman™) using the ABIPrism 7900HT sequence detection system according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 	Primers and probes were supplied by Applied Biosystems (http://www.appliedbiosystems.com/) as Assays-By-Design™. The Stage 3 genotyping was done using an Illumina Golden Gate Assay (http://www.illumina.com). 
PMC3092928	rs2735839	Results	RefSNP	False		We defined a 34-kb region on 19q13.3 based on HapMap phase II CEU data that included all SNPs correlated with rs2735839, the most strongly associated SNP in the GWAS, at r2 > 0.1. 	In this region, we identified 197 SNPs in HapMap2 and 312 SNPs in the 1000 Genomes Project. Genotypes for these SNPs were imputed for subjects in stages 1 and 2 of the UK/Australian GWAS and CGEMS. 
PMC3092928	rs17632542	Results	RefSNP	False	Based on the combined results, we identified 35 SNPs associated with PrCa at P < 10−7. 	The most statistically significant associated SNPs were rs17632542 and rs62113212 (P = 3.0 × 10−24 and P = 2.2 × 10−24, respectively, Supplementary Table 2). 	These two SNPs were strongly correlated with one another (r2 = 0.99 in HapMap CEU and r2 = 0.75 in 1000 Genomes, Supplementary Table 3); neither of these SNPs was genotyped in the original GWAS.

To determine whether there are additional SNPs in the region, other than rs17632542, that are independently associated with PrCa, we used two different analytical approaches. 	First, we used stepwise logistic regression analyses of 7 SNPs in this region that were genotyped in all stages and were significant at P < 10−7.

In a multiple regression analysis, rs2735839 was marginally significantly associated with PSA levels, after adjusting for rs17632542 (P = 0.06).

PMC3092928	rs17632542	Results	RefSNP	False	Taken together, the above results suggest that observed associations with both PrCa and PSA level are largely driven by rs17632542 or rs62113212. 	These SNPs are intragenic to KLK3: rs17632542 is a non-synonymous SNP in exon 4 resulting in an Ile179Thr substitution, while rs62113212 is intronic and lies in a sequence region with no enhancer or splice effect function (Fig. 1). 	However, based on the TFSEARCH database, http://www.cbrc.jp/research/db/TFSEARCH.html, rs62113212 changes the scores for the binding of the octamer factor 1 (Oct-1) transcription factor. Although we cannot rule out rs62113212 as the directly associated variant and it remains possible that another correlated variant was missed by the resequencing in the 1000 genomes dataset, rs17632542 appears to be the most plausible functional variant.

Based on the previous structural studies, 3D modeling and X-ray crystallography of PSA and other kallikreins, Ile179 is not part of the active catalytic site (Villoutreix et al. 1994). However, when we carried out multiple molecular dynamic simulations in explicit solvent, we found that the solvated threonine (Thr) variant consistently achieved lower energy levels compared with the isoleucine (Ile) variant (−3,532 ± 54 kcal/mol compared with −3,053 ± 41 kcal/mol), suggesting superior stability in solution. 
PMC3092928	rs17632542	Results	RefSNP	False	There is still some potential for confounding due to opportunistic PSA testing or testing as part of the diagnostic process. 	The newly identified SNP, rs17632542, exhibits a more significant association with PrCa than the previous tag SNP and studies of this SNP in men who have prostate biopsy as the primary PrCa screen, irrespective of PSA levels, could determine whether this SNP is causally related to PrCa risk independent of PSA. 	Given its stronger effect on PrCa risk, inclusion of rs17632542 in place of rs2735839 in risk prediction models will improve discrimination in such models. As this variant is predicted to introduce changes in the stability of the protein and might have a role in pre-mRNA processing of alternative transcripts; it is a good candidate variant for further functional investigation of the underpinnings of the GWAS signal in this region with respect to PrCa risk. 
PMC4268493	rs1800693	Abstract	RefSNP	False	We have investigated a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the TNFRSF1A gene, that encodes TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), which was discovered through GWAS to be associated with multiple sclerosis (MS)3,4, but not with other autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA)5, psoriasis6 and Crohn’s disease7. 	By analyzing MS GWAS3,4 data in conjunction with the 1000 Genomes Project data8 we provide genetic evidence that strongly implicates this SNP, rs1800693, as the causal variant in the TNFRSF1A region. 	We further substantiate this through functional studies showing that the MS risk allele directs expression of a novel, soluble form of TNFR1 that can block TNF. Importantly, TNF blocking drugs can promote onset or exacerbation of MS9-11, but they have proven highly efficacious in the treatment of autoimmune diseases for which there is no association with rs1800693. 
PMC4268493	rs1800693	Article	RefSNP	False	To assess whether this SNP is mainly driving the association we examined the haplotype structure across the region in 379 individuals of European ancestry using whole genome sequence from the 1000 Genomes Project8 and we performed statistical imputation into a UK cohort of 1,853 MS patients and 5,174 controls4. 	Among genotyped SNPs the strongest signal is seen at rs1800693 and the variants in strongest association with this SNP were also genotyped in the study. 	Statistical imputation12 revealed no other variant with stronger association to MS within the region, including the previously reported3 nonsynonymous SNP rs4149584 (Supplementary Fig. 1), and analysis of association after controlling for the effect of rs1800693 removed almost all of the signal (Fig. 1a). These observations all support variation at rs1800693 as being primarily responsible for the MS association in the TNFRSF1A region.

These observations all support variation at rs1800693 as being primarily responsible for the MS association in the TNFRSF1A region. To further substantiate the causality of rs1800693, we next sought to investigate the functional consequences of the variation at this SNP. 
PMC4268493	rs1800693	Methods	RefSNP	False	Under the assumption of a single associated variant in the region, the Bayes factor for a variant is a proportional (under weak assumptions) to the posterior probability that it is driving the association. 	The conditional analysis was performed in the same way, including the genotype at rs1800693 as an additional covariate (with an additive effect). 	
PMC4268493	rs1800693	Methods	RefSNP	False	At this significance threshold we obtained >90% power to detect the differences observed with our sample size. 	The percentage of TNFR1_Δ6 transcript level variation accounted for by genotype at rs1800693 was estimated by least-squares regression analysis at 67, 52 and 55% for the CD14+ monocytes, polymorphonuclear cells and CD3+ T cells, respectively. 	Linear regression analysis was used to quantify the correlation in TNFR1_Δ6 transcript levels between the different immune cell subsets. For all regression analyses there was no significant departure from linearity (P>0.05) as determined using a runs test. 
PMC3393726	rs6903608	Introduction	RefSNP	False	This association was confirmed in 934 Scandinavian and English cHL patients in a study by Hjalgrim et al [17]. 	In two recently performed genome wide association studies (GWAS) in cHL patients, the most significantly associated SNP (rs6903608) was located within the HLA class II region [18], [19]. 	In the present study, we performed an extensive screening of the HLA class I and II genes to investigate possible associations of HLA alleles in the total, the EBV+, and the EBV− cHL (sub)populations. Furthermore, we intended to establish whether specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) positions in the HLA genes that might be shared by multiple HLA alleles are responsible for the observed genetic associations rather than specific HLA alleles. 
PMC3393726	rs6903608	Methods	RefSNP	False	Only those haplotypes with a frequency of >1% (in patients plus controls) were considered to be relevant in the analysis. 	Our patient cohort was used in the replication series of the recently published GWAS that identified the HLA class II SNP rs6903608 as a highly significant susceptibility marker for cHL [18,18]. 	We now compared the SNP alleles (C and T) with the HLA typing data to investigate their linkage disequilibrium (LD). Combined HLA typing and SNP data were available for 278 cHL patients. 
PMC3393726	rs6903608	Methods	RefSNP	False	Combined HLA typing and SNP data were available for 278 cHL patients. 	Two-marker haplotypes of the SNP rs6903608 and the HLA typing were constructed per gene using PHASE v2.1 [24], [25]. 	Frequencies of HLA typing among haplotypes with a C allele and a T allele at rs6903608 were compared per HLA typing using the Chi-square test. For each phenotype and PCR-SSOP a test was performed, hence a correction for multiple testing was required.

Frequencies of HLA typing among haplotypes with a C allele and a T allele at rs6903608 were compared per HLA typing using the Chi-square test. 	For each phenotype and PCR-SSOP a test was performed, hence a correction for multiple testing was required. Because LD exists between the PCR-SSOPs and between the HLA phenotypes, and because the HLA-phenotypes are derived from the PCR-SSOPs, a Bonferroni test for 401 PCR-SSOPs and 74 HLA phenotypes would be too conservative. 
PMC3393726	rs6903609	Discussion	RefSNP	False	To explore associations of the T and C alleles with certain HLA alleles, we compared the SNP data of our cohort to the HLA typing data and observed a significant LD with 15 HLA alleles (Table 6). 	Three of the 15 HLA alleles that were in strong LD with rs6903609, i.e. HLA-DR2, HLA-DR5 and HLA-DR7 were significantly associated with cHL in both the HLA allele and phenotype frequency analysis. 	HLA-DR4 was only significant in the phenotype analysis. The C-allele was frequently observed together with HLA-DR2 or HLA-DR5, i.e. 71.4% (48.5%+22.9%), while either HLA-DR allele was observed only in 4.1% in combination with the T-allele.

For accurate replication of template, Q5® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase was used (NEB, cat. no. M0492S) and PCR products (size 80 bp) were digested with BsaHI restriction enzyme (NEB, cat. no. R0556S), which digests only templates without examined SNPs (the presence of either rs141193530 but also rs41268753 will abolish the restriction site 5’-GRCGYC-3′). 	The digested PCR products were resolved in 2.5–3% High Resolution Agarose (EurX, Poland, cat. no. E0302–50) gels, stained with SimplySafe™ (EurX, Poland, cat. no. E4600–01) and visualized with G:Box (Syngene). The digested PCR product of each sample was compared to the same amount of non-digested product. 
PMC5755140	rs41268753	Methods	RefSNP	False		To specify exact single nucleotide polymorphism in selected DNA samples, a pyrosequencing assay was designed to measure the relative quantification of nucleotide incorporation at the SNP sites: rs41268753 (C/T) and rs141193530 (C/G). 	PCR amplification primers for the genomic DNA templates were as follows: Fw_5’–biotinylated–CTTCAGGGGCAATGAGACGAC–3′ and Rv_5’–GCACATTGGGGATGAACAGC–3′, with primer annealing at 65 °C. The biotinylated PCR products (80 bp) were subject to pyrosequencing using internal pyrosequencing primer 5’-ATTGGGGATGAACAGCAC–3′. 
PMC5755140	rs55927162	Results	RefSNP	False	Single nucleotide changes may contribute towards the risk of cancer development through their biological consequences. 	SNPs in the region upstream of the GRHL3 gene (rs55927162 and rs56256719) may possibly affect binding of transcription factors to potential enhancers or other regulatory elements. 	However, our bioinformatic analyses revealed that these SNPs do not significantly alter known transcription factors binding motifs provided in the JASPAR database [23]. SNPs in intronic regions of GRHL2 and GRHL3 genes (rs151171718 and rs548650) may potentially affect splicing of the primary transcripts.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the coding region of GRHL3 gene Two non-synonymous SNPs occur with significantly altered frequencies in our NMSC patient cohort: rs141193530 in exon 11 of the GRHL3 gene, which causes P455A amino acid residue substitution, and rs151326764 in alternative exon 16 of the GRHL3 gene, which causes R573H substitution (Table 1).

We employed PROVEAN (Protein Variation Effect Analyzer) v1.1 [29] to assess whether the presence of these SNPs may affect protein function. This analysis predicted that the R573H substitution is either “neutral” (PROVEAN prediction) or “tolerated” (SIFT prediction). 
PMC5755140	rs141193530	Results	RefSNP	False	We employed two algorithms to search for exonic splicing enhancers (ESE). 	RESCUE-ESE [30] did not detect any potential ESEs that would overlap with the location of SNP rs141193530 or rs151326764. 	ESEfinder3.0 [31] predicted some changes in binding of serine and arginine rich splicing factors (SRSF) to the region containing SNP rs141193530, which were: loss of one SRSF5 potential binding site and creation of a novel SRSF2 potential binding site. However, given multiple caveats of ESEfinder algorithm [31] it is difficult to ascertain whether these changes may influence pre-mRNA processing.

Interestingly, SNP rs141193530 was reported in a recent publication describing variants of the GRHL3 gene in patients with nonsyndromic cleft lip with/without cleft palate (nsCL/P) as well as nonsyndromic cleft palate only [32]. 	The authors’ analyses concluded that this variant is either “tolerated” or “benign”. We re-analyzed frequency data provided by the authors in Additional file 1: Table S3 [32] using appropriate statistical methods [25]. 
PMC5755140	rs141193530	Results	RefSNP	False	Similarly, we observed increased frequency of this variant for NMSC patients (Table 2), what may indicate some effect of this single nucleotide change on GRHL3 functioning and increased risk of disease.Table 2Single Marker Association in NMSC patients (n = 209) compared to different reference groupsagenotypes GG/CG/CCbposition according to GRCh37/hg19 genome build 	To further investigate whether this SNP is likely to be associated with NMSC occurrence, we carried out genotyping of SNP rs141193530 in a replication cohort, which included 176 additional patients with NMSC (Additional file 1: Table S3). 	The results are presented in Table 2. 
PMC5755140	rs141193530	Discussion	RefSNP	False	It is still a matter of debate whether rare or common variants are more likely to contribute to disease risk [38], hence we decided to include both types of alleles in our further analyses. 	Non-synonymous SNP rs141193530 is located in exon 11 of the GRHL3 gene and it introduces P455A amino acid residue substitution in the encoded GRHL3 protein. 	It seems likely that the presence of this SNP may be indeed deleterious for the functioning of the GRHL3 gene, as this polymorphism is associated with two very different diseases: nsCL/P and NMSC ([32] and present study). However, in both these diseases the GRHL3 gene serves a protective role. 
PMC5755140	rs141193530	Discussion	RefSNP	False	The reason why this SNP may be deleterious is related to the fact that the P455A substitution may nevertheless be damaging for the functioning of GRHL3 protein, despite some predictions to the contrary made by algorithms used by us and other researchers ([32] and present study). 	Alternatively, the presence of SNP rs141193530 may affect processing of the primary transcript, although our bioinformatic analyses did not provide any evidence to support this possibility. 	Thus the precise molecular mechanism responsible for the impact of SNP rs141193530 on the functioning of the GRHL3 gene and/or the encoded GRHL3 protein remains to be elucidated. Akin to the impairment of GRHL3 protein function or defective splicing of GRHL3 pre-mRNA, reduced levels of GRHL gene expression in healthy human epidermis (prior to the development of NMSC) could also increase the risk of NMSC in affected people. 
PMC5755140	rs141193530	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Alternatively, the presence of SNP rs141193530 may affect processing of the primary transcript, although our bioinformatic analyses did not provide any evidence to support this possibility.

Akin to the impairment of GRHL3 protein function or defective splicing of GRHL3 pre-mRNA, reduced levels of GRHL gene expression in healthy human epidermis (prior to the development of NMSC) could also increase the risk of NMSC in affected people. This phenomenon is distinct from the reduction of expression of GRHL1 and GRHL3 genes in tumor samples in comparison with the adjacent healthy epidermis, as reduced Grhl3 mRNA levels were observed in SCC samples in the Grhl3+/+ (wild-type) mice, which did not have any mutations or polymorphisms in the Grhl3 gene [5]. 
PMC6515414	rs2326797	Results	RefSNP	False	Seven variants, all of which were in noncoding DNA, had significant differences between the expected and observed AF. 	Of these, four variants (rs2326797, rs13236623, rs138306877, and rs9347870) were more prevalent in the study sample than the general population, and three variants (rs7861436, rs659494, and rs9273206) were less prevalent. 	For rs7861436 and rs659494, this difference was driven by low AFs in the impaired participants, while for rs9273206, it was driven by low AF in the less impaired participants. Additionally, within the less impaired subgroup, rs364288 had a significantly lower AF and rs2507304 had a significantly higher AF compared to the general population.

Lastly, only three SNPs on the entire X chromosome (rs29079362, rs73483921 and rs29081860) outside of the Chadwick interval have SDP patterns consistent with the Xce alleles. 	Analysis of the Xce candidate interval reveals a set of segmental duplications associated with each functional Xce allele After phenotyping of the additional strains, the minimum candidate interval spans 176 kb and its size and relative position with respect to the Xic does not change in the latest mouse genome assembly (GrCm38/mm10).

In this case-control study, some SNPs in PRM1 (c.49 C>T, c.102 G>T and c.230A>C) and PRM2 (rs545828790, rs115686767, rs201933708, rs2070923 and rs1646022) were investigated in 30 idiopathic infertile men with teratozoospermia (case group) in comparison with 35 fertile men (controls). 	Genotyping of SNPs was undertaken using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-direct sequencing. For PRM1, c.230A>C, as a synonymous polymorphism, was detected in both teratozoo- spermic men (heterozygous n=26, homozygous minor n=1) allele frequency C(48) A(52) and controls (heterozygous n=15, homozygous minor n=4).

However, there were no significant differences in SNPs of PRM1 and PRM2 between the two groups, however, for c.230A>C, the frequency of the CA genotype was significantly higher in infertile men with teratozoospermia (P=0.001). 
PMC6334022	rs1646022	Article	RefSNP	False	Table 3 shows the association of the most frequent genotypes (three SNPs) with seminal characteristics of participants (Table 3). 	Abnormal morphology, as well as sperm apoptosis (TUNEL+), was significantly elevated in the GG genotype compared with other genotypes in rs1646022 and rs2070923 in PRM2. 	However, in PRM1 rs737008, the highest percentage of abnormal morphology, apoptotic sperms, and abnormal motility belonged to the AA genotype. There was no difference between genotypes regarding sperm protamine deficiency and sperm concentrations for all SNPs in PRM1 and PRM2 (Table 4).

We also detected significant associations between the frequencies of GG and CC genotypes of PRM2 rs1646022 and rs2070923 respectively with apoptosis, morphology and total motility. 	Interestingly, these genotypes were the most frequent genotypes in infertile men with taper head spermatozoa.

In our previous study, we reported sperm protamine deficiency, lower rates of normal sperm parameters, and apoptosis in infertile men with idiopathic teratozoospermia compared to the controls. We saw that the concentration of sperm cells was lower in the case group than controls. 
PMC3536639	rs2294008	Abstract	RefSNP	False	A monoclonal antibody against prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) has emerged as a novel cancer therapy currently being tested in clinical trials for prostate and pancreatic cancers, but this treatment is likely to be efficient only in patients with PSCA-expressing tumors. 	The present study demonstrates that a genetic variant (rs2294008) discovered by bladder cancer genome-wide association studies is a strong predictor of PSCA protein expression in bladder tumors, as measured by two-sided multivariable linear regression (P = 6.46×10−11; n = 278). 	The association pattern is similar in non-muscle-invasive tumors, stages Ta (P = 3.10×10−5; n = 173) and T1 (P = 2.64×10−5; n = 60), and muscle-invasive tumors, stages T2 (P =.01; n = 23) and T3/4 (P =.03; n = 22). The study suggests that anti-PSCA immunotherapy might be beneficial for bladder cancer patients with high tumor PSCA expression, which is statistically significantly associated with the presence of CT and TT genotypes of a common genetic variant, rs2294008.

The study suggests that anti-PSCA immunotherapy might be beneficial for bladder cancer patients with high tumor PSCA expression, which is statistically significantly associated with the presence of CT and TT genotypes of a common genetic variant, rs2294008. 	Future clinical studies will be needed to validate PSCA as a therapeutic target for bladder cancer. 
PMC3536639	rs2294008	Article	RefSNP	False	It is anticipated that these findings will help improve understanding of disease mechanisms and lead to novel translational applications. 	Bladder cancer genome-wide association studies identified a single nucleotide polymorphism, rs2294008, within the PSCA gene (2,3). 	PSCA is a cell-surface, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein expressed in various cancers (4–14); however, its biological role in normal and cancer conditions remains unclear. PSCA antibody-based immunotherapy is currently being used in clinical trials for prostate and pancreatic cancers (15–20). 
PMC3536639	rs2294008	Article	RefSNP	False	In this article, we suggest PSCA as a candidate drug target for bladder cancer as well. 	Previously, we found increased PSCA mRNA expression in bladder tumors and, specifically, in the presence of the risk T allele of rs2294008 (21). 	Now we have discovered an additional effect associated with rs2294008—an allelic expression imbalance, which is a deviation from an expected 50%:50% allelic ratio in heterozygous transcribed single nucleotide polymorphisms. We performed RNA sequencing of six normal and six tumor bladder tissues, and validation studies in 14 normal and 13 tumor bladder tissue samples heterozygous for rs2294008 (Figure 1, A–D; Supplementary Methods, available online).

We performed RNA sequencing of six normal and six tumor bladder tissues, and validation studies in 14 normal and 13 tumor bladder tissue samples heterozygous for rs2294008 (Figure 1, A–D; Supplementary Methods, available online). 	We quantified rs2294008 T and C alleles in DNA and cDNA samples and calculated an average tumor:normal (T:N) ratio. In DNA samples the T:N ratio was close to 1.0 and similar for both alleles (Figure 1, D; Supplementary Table 1, available online), suggesting no difference in DNA copy number variation between normal and tumor tissues within the PSCA gene. 
PMC3536639	rs2294008	Article	RefSNP	False	In cDNA of tumors compared with normal tissue, we detected a notable increase of T allele expression (T:N ratio = 1.48; P = 1.26×10−4), accompanied by decrease of C allele expression (T:N ratio = 0.78; P = 1.35×10−2), resulting in an overall difference of T:N ratio for C and T alleles (P = 1.46×10−6) in cDNA but not in DNA from the same samples (Figure 1, D; Supplementary Table 2, available online). 	Importantly, the observed allelic expression imbalance in bladder tumors could result from decreased expression of transcripts with nonrisk C allele and/or from increased expression of transcripts with risk T allele of rs2294008.

Results of AEI measured by a TaqMan allele-specific expression/genotyping assay in DNA and cDNA from 14 normal and 13 tumor bladder tissue samples heterozygous for rs2294008. 	The analysis shows that AEI is detected in cDNA but not DNA samples.

PMC3536639	rs2294008	Article	RefSNP	False	Next, we evaluated the effect of rs2294008 on PSCA protein expression. 	The risk T allele of rs2294008 creates a novel alternative translation start site, extending the leader peptide from 11 to 20 amino acids, which might affect the efficiency of PSCA post-translational processing and cell surface expression. 	To test this hypothesis, we performed fluorescence activated cell sorter analysis in HeLa cells transfected with the allelic PSCA expression constructs (Supplementary Methods, available online). We observed stronger surface PSCA expression in cells transfected with PSCA-T construct compared with those transfected with PSCA-C construct (P = 2.25×10−4) and with a mock-control (P = 2.55×10−4) (Figure 2, A).

Genotype of rs2294008 was strongly associated with PSCA protein expression, as measured by two-sided multivariable linear regression (P = 6.46×10−11) (Figure 2, C; Supplementary Table 3, available online). 	The pattern for rs2294008 association was similar in non-muscle-invasive (stages Ta [P = 3.10×10−5; n = 173] and T1 [P = 2.64×10−5; n = 60]), and muscle-invasive (stages T2 [P =.01; n = 23] and T3/4 [P =.03; n = 22]) tumors (25) (Figure 2, C); this association could not be explained by any other factors (Supplementary Table 4, available online). Stratification by tumor grades (low and high grade) (26) or a stage and grade combination provided similar results (Supplementary Figure 1, B, available online). 
PMC3536639	rs2294008	Article	RefSNP	False	We found that this effect was due to decreased expression of non-risk C allele (P =.02 in CC group and P =.06 in CT group), whereas PSCA expression of risk T allele was not associated with tumor staging (P =.63) (Figure 2, C). 	Together with allelic expression imbalance data in mRNA samples, these results reiterate functional changes on PSCA mRNA and protein expression reflected in both gain of T allele and loss of C allele of rs2294008 in bladder tumors compared with normal tissue and during progression through tumor stages. 	The PSCA function and the mechanism of the anti-PSCA antibody remain unclear. PSCA might be functionally involved in oncogenic development (5,27–32), cause differential immune response (14), or mark some specific cell populations. 
PMC3536639	rs2294008	Article	RefSNP	False	Although there are several reports on genetic association of rs2294008 with bladder, gastric, duodenal, and breast cancers (2,3,14,21,33–40), little data is available for relationships between rs2294008 and PSCA expression in different tissue types (21,39). 	Our study is a unique and detailed investigation of the allele-specific effects of rs2294008 on PSCA mRNA and protein expression in bladder tissue. 	Up to 75% of bladder cancer patients of European descent are estimated to carry the risk rs2294008 CT and TT genotypes. Possibly, if used at early cancer stages (Ta and T1), anti-PSCA immunotherapy might prevent progression to advanced muscle-invasive cancer, a devastating disease that is treated by radical bladder cystectomy together with removal of parts of surrounding organs and lymph nodes to prevent metastasis. 
PMC4698282	rs1905339	Abstract	RefSNP	False	Gene expression analyses were conducted using RNA sequencing level 3 data from The Cancer Genome Atlas for 989 breast tumor samples and 113 matched normal tissue samples.

To determine independent signals within imputed SNPs at STAT3, we ran a stepwise forward multiple logistic regression model including the most significant genotyped SNP rs1905339 and all imputed SNPs, adjusted for study, age and 16 PCs. 	SNP association analyses and case-only analyses were all conducted using SAS 9.3 (Cary, NC, USA). All tests were two-sided.

In addition, data from 183 breast tissues in the GTEx (V6) (2015) publically available online databases were evaluated to obtain information on whether the most interesting variants (rs1905339, rs8074296, rs146170568, chr17:40607850:I and rs77942990) were expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for any gene. 	Also, GTEx was queried to obtain information on whether the five variants were eQTL for STAT3 or PTRF.

The SNPs rs1905339 and rs8074296 were also found to be eQTL for TUBG2 (tubulin, gamma 2) in the GTEx database, the expression of TUBG2 decreased with each variant allele (Online Resources 30 and 31, respectively). TUBG2 encodes γ-tubulin, a protein required for the formation and polar orientation of microtubules in cells. 	It is currently unknown, whether TUBG2 plays a role in breast cancer development or progression. The other two potential susceptibility loci, IL5 and GM-CSF, are both located in a known cytokine gene cluster at 5q31. IL5 encodes interleukin 5, a cytokine secreted by CD4+ T helper 2 cells (Mills 2004; Parker 1993).

In addition, these PDGFRA variants were associated with axial eye length, predicting 0.6% of the normal trait variation (p=5.3×10−4).

A meta-analysis of the results from the present white European sample and the four samples recruited from Singapore by Han et al.

In our white European subjects, SNP rs6554163 located in the PDGFRA high LD region was associated with the risk of corneal astigmatism to a similar degree and in the same direction as that observed in the Asian subjects studied by Fan et al.

In contrast to these results for corneal astigmatism, the rs6554163 genotype did not predict an individual being classified as myopic versus non-myopic (Table 5): Each copy of the minor allele was associated with an OR for myopia of 0.98 (95% CI=0.79 to 1.20; p=0.78).

PMC3566893	rs6554163	Results	RefSNP	False	These are (i) genetic effects that allometrically scale the size of the eye and body, (ii) effects that purely govern eye size, and (iii) effects restricted to determining the dimensions of each individual ocular component. 	The PDGFRA variants studied here have the characteristics of genetic effects in the second group, since (as judged by the inheritance of copies of the minor A allele of SNPs such as rs6554163; Figure 3) they act to reduce corneal curvature (i.e., steepen it) and to reduce axial eye length. 	As visual function is exquisitely dependent on the careful scaling of the eye’s component parts, observing such pleiotropy is not surprising. In terms of identifying genetic variants that influence susceptibility to disorders such as refractive error, variants that affect the expression level or function of PDGFRA would not seem likely candidates given this pleiotropic scaling role. 
PMC3566893	rs6554163	Results	RefSNP	False	In terms of identifying genetic variants that influence susceptibility to disorders such as refractive error, variants that affect the expression level or function of PDGFRA would not seem likely candidates given this pleiotropic scaling role. 	Indeed, subjects’ genotypes for SNP rs6554163 were not associated with the presence/absence of myopia in ALSPAC subjects. 	Thus, PDGFRA variants appear to exert a risk of corneal astigmatism but not spherical refractive error. Corneal curvature tends to increase (flatten) markedly during the first few years of life and then remain relatively stable during the remainder of childhood and early adulthood [38-40].

Genotyping for five HOTTIP tagSNPs (rs3807598, rs17501292, rs2067087, rs17427960, and rs78248039) was performed by applying Kompetitive allele specific PCR (KASP).

PMC6504661	rs1859168	Introduction	RefSNP	False	The association of HOTTIP SNPs with cancer susceptibility or prognosis has been preliminarily explored. 	For instance, patients with the HOTTIP rs5883064 C allele or rs1859168 A allele have an increased risk of lung cancer [22]. 	In addition, the rs1859168 A>C polymorphism may regulate HOTTIP expression and reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer in a Chinese population [23]. To date, however, no investigation has focused on the association between HOTTIP SNPs and CRC. 
PMC6504661	rs2067087	Abstract	RefSNP	False	The selection criteria were: (i) the minor allele frequency (MAF) in CHB was more than 0.05; (ii) linkage disequilibrium (LD) r2 was less than 0.8; and (iii) the P-value for Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was more than 0.05. 	Consequently, five eligible tagSNPs were selected as research targets, including rs3807598, rs17501292, rs2067087, rs17427960, and rs78248039 (Figure 1). 	Potential function prediction was subsequently performed for all selected SNPs using the SNPinfo Web Server (https://snpinfo.niehs.nih.gov). 
PMC6504661	rs78248039	Results	RefSNP	False	Association of HOTTIP SNPs with CRC risk 	Among the five HOTTIP tagSNPs included in the study, the rs78248039 polymorphism failed in genotyping and was excluded from the final analysis. 	The genotype frequency of the other four SNPs in the control group all met HWE (P>0.05). The reference frequency of the healthy population (Beijing Han, China, NCBI database) is presented in Table 1. 
PMC6504661	rs17427960	Abstract	RefSNP	False	The association between each SNP and CRC risk in overall subjects was estimated. 	Three SNPs including rs3807598, rs2067087, and rs17427960 were associated with increased CRC risk other than rs17501292. 	The variant types of rs3807598 (GG vs. CC: P=0.001, OR=1.57, 95% CI=1.21–2.03) and rs2067087 (CC vs. GG: P<0.001, OR=1.70, 95% CI=1.30–2.22) could, respectively, elevate the risk up to 1.57-fold and 1.70-fold when compared with their wild-types. The rs17427960 polymorphism conferred increased CRC risk in all genetic models, the highest ratio reaching 1.74-fold (CA vs. CC: P<0.001, OR=1.74, 95% CI=1.33–2.29, Table 1). 
PMC6504661	rs3807598	Results	RefSNP	False	Three SNPs including rs3807598, rs2067087, and rs17427960 were associated with increased CRC risk other than rs17501292. 	The variant types of rs3807598 (GG vs. CC: P=0.001, OR=1.57, 95% CI=1.21–2.03) and rs2067087 (CC vs. GG: P<0.001, OR=1.70, 95% CI=1.30–2.22) could, respectively, elevate the risk up to 1.57-fold and 1.70-fold when compared with their wild-types. 	The rs17427960 polymorphism conferred increased CRC risk in all genetic models, the highest ratio reaching 1.74-fold (CA vs. CC: P<0.001, OR=1.74, 95% CI=1.33–2.29, Table 1). We further explored the association between each SNP and CRC risk stratified by host characteristics. 
PMC6504661	rs3807598	Results	RefSNP	False	The cumulative effect of three SNPs related to CRC risk was then assessed. 	According to the results shown in Table 1, the best genetic models of each polymorphism were selected to identify their risk genotypes: GG vs. CG+CC for rs3807598; CC vs. GC+GG for rs2067087, and AA+CA vs. CC for rs17427960. 	All individuals were divided into four groups based on the number of risk genotypes they carried (0, 1, 2, and 3), and the significance of the linear trend was then analyzed. It appears that the susceptibility to CRC was significantly enhanced with the increasing number of SNP risk genotypes (Ptrend<0.001, Table 2). 
PMC6504661	rs3807598	Results	RefSNP	False	Haplotype analysis of HOTTIP SNPs for CRC risk 	Haplotype analysis was performed to evaluate the association between haplotypes of the studied SNPs (rs3807598-rs17501292-rs2067087-rs17427960) and CRC risk. 	Four haplotypes were screened and three demonstrated significance. The C-T-C-A and G-T-C-A haplotypes contributed to elevated risk (P=0.047, OR=1.50, 95% CI=1.00–2.26; P<0.001, OR=1.27, 95% CI=1.10–1.45, respectively), while the G-T-G-C haplotype could reduce the risk (P<0.001, OR=0.73, 95% CI=0.64–0.84, Table 3). 
PMC6504661	rs17427960	Results	RefSNP	False	It was shown that only H. pylori infection was significantly associated with CRC risk (smoking: P=0.231, OR=0.88, 95% CI=0.71–1.09; drinking: P=0.638, OR=0.94, 95% CI=0.72–1.22; H. pylori infection: P<0.001, OR=5.69, 95% CI=4.40–7.35); interaction analysis was subsequently performed. 	The AA+CA genotype of rs17427960 was found to negatively interact with drinking (Pinteraction=0.025, OR=0.45, 95% CI=0.22–0.91). 	No polymorphism was observed to interact with smoking or H. pylori infection (P>0.05, Table 4). Association of HOTTIP SNPs with CRC clinicopathological parameters and prognosis 
PMC6504661	rs3807598	Results	RefSNP	False	As a series of important indicators related to CRC prognosis, common clinicopathological parameters were considered in the association study, including TNM stage, macroscopic type, histological type, depth of invasion, growth mode, and lymphatic metastasis. 	One polymorphism, rs3807598, was indicated to be associated with growth mode (CG vs. CC: P=0.026; GG+CG vs. CC: P=0.040, respectively, Supplementary Table S3). 	Before the prognosis study, we estimated the potential effects of some host factors such as epidemiological and clinicopathological characteristics on the OS of CRC patients. It was shown that OS could be affected by TNM stage, macroscopic type, histological type, depth of invasion, growth mode, and lymphatic metastasis (P<0.001). 
PMC6504661	rs3807598	Results	RefSNP	False	The basic information and function prediction results of HOTTIP tagSNPs are shown in Supplementary Table S5. 	Polymorphisms rs3807598, rs17501292, and rs2067087 belonged to the exon region of HOTTIP gene, and rs17427960 was the only intron locus. 	The rs2067087 polymorphism had both a relatively high RegPotention score and Converstion score. Furthermore, all studied SNPs were suggested to be related to transcription factor binding site (TFBS). 
PMC6504661	rs17427960	Discussion	RefSNP	False	In general, the intron sequences of a gene only influence the splicing during transcription and do not exist in a mature lncRNA [32]; however, it is still significantly associated with CRC risk. 	A possible explanation is that the observation regarding disease risk may not be due to the analyzed SNP rs17427960 but another unknown variant in strong LD harbored in HOTTIP or nearby genes [33]. 	In conclusion, HOTTIP rs3807598, rs2067087, and rs17427960 polymorphisms could be predictive biomarkers for CRC susceptibility. However, any hypothesis of a specific mechanism needs to be verified by further investigation. 
PMC6504661	rs17427960	Discussion	RefSNP	False	To identify some potential combination effects that cannot be revealed in univariate analyses, we evaluated the interactions between all the environmental factors and SNP genotypes, although only H. pylori infection was demonstrated to be associated with CRC risk. 	Notably, one of the studied SNPs, rs17427960, was shown to have an antagonistic effect with drinking and their interaction could reduce CRC risk to 0.45-fold, which indicated a potential modification of environmental factors on the biological function of HOTTIP polymorphisms in CRC risk. 	Previous studies have investigated the effect of the interaction between genetic variation and alcohol intake on CRC. For instance, drinkers with a (−/−) or (−/+) rs3830675 genotype in the PTEN gene have the highest CRC risk (OR=2.57) compared with the subjects that never consume alcohol [42]. 
PMC6504661	rs3807598	Discussion	RefSNP	False	In our study, a significant dosage effect was observed in HOTTIP SNPs associated with CRC risk, suggesting the susceptibility to CRC could be enhanced by the increasing number of risk genotypes. 	CRC risk in individuals carrying the GG genotype of rs3807598, CC genotype of rs2067087, and AA+CA genotype of rs17427960 simultaneously could be elevated 1.77-fold, which is higher than any individual polymorphism. 	Furthermore, several haplotypes of rs3807598-rs17501292-rs2067087-rs17427960 were also found to add to the risk. Therefore, better diagnostic efficacy of CRC might be obtained by combining multi-variation in HOTTIP for detection. 
PMC6504661	rs3807598	Discussion	RefSNP	False	CRC risk in individuals carrying the GG genotype of rs3807598, CC genotype of rs2067087, and AA+CA genotype of rs17427960 simultaneously could be elevated 1.77-fold, which is higher than any individual polymorphism. 	Furthermore, several haplotypes of rs3807598-rs17501292-rs2067087-rs17427960 were also found to add to the risk. 	Therefore, better diagnostic efficacy of CRC might be obtained by combining multi-variation in HOTTIP for detection. The role of lncRNA HOTTIP exerted in the clinical outcome of CRC has been preliminarily investigated. 
PMC6504661	rs17501292	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Accordingly, it can be inferred that the functional variants in HOTTIP might be linked to CRC prognosis by affecting its expression. 	One studied SNP, rs17501292, was shown to be associated with improved OS of CRC cases. 	It is located in the exon region of the gene and might influence TFBSs. Considering its relatively high regulatory potential score, this polymorphism might be able to deliver a regulatory function. 
PMC6504661	rs17427960	Abstract	RefSNP	False	In summary, we designed a case–control study to investigate the association of lncRNA HOTTIP tagSNPs with CRC risk and prognosis. 	Three polymorphisms (rs3807598, rs2067087, and rs17427960) were associated with enhanced CRC risk both in overall and stratified analyses with an obvious cumulative effect among each other. 	A few haplotypes of rs3807598-rs17501292-rs2067087-rs17427960 were also associated with the risk. Furthermore, the rs17427960 polymorphism had a two-way interaction with drinking. 
PMC6504661	rs17501292	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Three polymorphisms (rs3807598, rs2067087, and rs17427960) were associated with enhanced CRC risk both in overall and stratified analyses with an obvious cumulative effect among each other.

One polymorphism, rs17501292, could improve the OS of CRC patients with a tumor of ulcerative/invasive type. 
PMC6504661	rs17501292	Conclusion	RefSNP	False	Furthermore, the rs17427960 polymorphism had a two-way interaction with drinking. 	One polymorphism, rs17501292, could improve the OS of CRC patients with a tumor of ulcerative/invasive type. 	These findings suggested HOTTIP SNPs could potentially be predictive biomarkers for CRC risk and prognosis. Our study provides clues for further exploration of novel lncRNA-based genetic biomarkers for the prediction of CRC susceptibility as well as prognosis, and thus possible access to individualized diagnosis and therapy of CRC patients. 
PMC5841830	rs1051730	Article	RefSNP	False	Among smokers however, increasing consumption has been associated with increased body weight. 	To determine whether this contradiction reflects causal processes, Winsløw et al.1 have applied Mendelian randomization (MR) in testing the association of a genetic variant, rs1051730 in CHRNA3, with measures of body weight among 80 342 members of the Copenhagen General Population Study. 	Among smokers, each minor (T) allele carried was associated with an increase of about one cigarette per day, but with a decrease in several measures of body weight, in contrast to the observational results. These results, in line with other recent studies,2–6 suggest that increased tobacco consumption causes reduced body weight, as does smoking itself. 
PMC5841830	rs1051730	Article	RefSNP	False	The question is whether smoking status should be considered as derived from the quantity consumed (one who smokes zero cigarettes per day is a non-smoker, others are smokers, Figure 1 arrow a), or as an exogenous variable whose value constrains the possible consumption (non-smokers must smoke no cigarettes per day, smokers must smoke a positive number, Figure 1 arrow b). 	Under the former, stratifying on smoking status would entail a collider bias, and an association would be seen between genotype and smoking status; but such an association was not observed by Winsløw et al., nor was any association between rs1051730 and known confounders when stratifying on smoking status. 	Thus the data support the view that smoking status is distinct (i.e. has distinct determinants) from tobacco consumption (Figure 1 arrow b). Indeed it seems reasonable that individuals would generally decide whether or not to smoke as a precursor to developing their usual consumption.

PMC5131692	rs17367504	Abstract	RefSNP	False		The minor (G) allele of the intronic SNP rs17367504 in the gene methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) was associated with a protective effect on preeclampsia (odds ratio 0.65, 95% confidence interval 0.53–0.80) in the Norwegian cohort. 	This association did not replicate in an Australian preeclampsia case–control cohort (P = 0.68, odds ratio 1.05, 95% confidence interval 0.83–1.32, minor allele frequency = 0.15). 
PMC5131692	rs17367504	Abstract	RefSNP	False	MTHFR is important for regulating transmethylation processes and is involved in regulation of folate metabolism. 	The G allele of rs17367504 has previously been shown to protect against nongestational hypertension. 	Our study suggests a novel association between this allele and reduced risk for preeclampsia. This is the first study associating the minor (G) allele of a SNP within the MTHFR gene with a protective effect on preeclampsia, and in doing so identifying a possible pleiotropic protective effect on preeclampsia and hypertension.

A possible risk for carriers of the G-allele in the Australian cohort was not supported by the CI. A holistic examination of the associations with preeclampsia of the 122 SNPs previously demonstrating association with BP regulation or inflammation does not indicate that using this selection strategy introduces an overall enrichment for associations with preeclampsia. 
PMC5131692	rs17367504	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Here we have performed a candidate SNP study in a preeclampsia-based cohort with candidates selected at loci previously associated with BP regulation and inflammation in GWAS. 	We identified one intronic SNP, rs17367504, in the MTHFR gene in which the G allele is significantly associated with a protective effect on preeclampsia development in the HUNT cohort, although not in the Australian cohort. 	The rs17367504 SNP is located within the DNase1 hypersensitivity cluster in 125 cell types from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements and in a binding site for 16 transcription factors according to the UCSC Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/, accessed 5 July 2015) [50].

PMC5131692	rs17367504	Discussion	RefSNP	False	The rs17367504 SNP is located within the DNase1 hypersensitivity cluster in 125 cell types from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements and in a binding site for 16 transcription factors according to the UCSC Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/, accessed 5 July 2015) [50]. 	Despite this strong evidence for a regulatory role for this SNP, no significant expression quantitative trait loci were found for rs17367504 in the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project portal (http://gtexportal.org, accessed 5 July 2015) [51]. 	The G-allele of this SNP has repeatedly been associated with lower SBP as well as DBP in different ethnic populations [25,26], but this is the first time this SNP has been associated with preeclampsia. The pleiotropic nature of the MTHFR gene is indicated by more than 2900 publications on the term MTHFR gene. 
PMC5131692	rs17367504	Discussion	RefSNP	False	The similarities in preeclampsia and CVD pathophysiology support a role for MTHFR in preeclampsia, but so far no studies have investigated the functional implications of changes in rs17367504 in preeclampsia or CVD. 	The novel association suggested by our findings in the HUNT cohort, between the BP-associated SNP rs17367504 and preeclampsia, adds to the increasing evidence that the MTHFR gene influences the development of preeclampsia and may point to a central role of the MTHFR gene in the pathophysiology of both preeclampsia and chronic hypertension. 	Genetic studies of MTHFR in relation to development of preeclampsia, hypertensive gestational diseases, or CVD have mainly investigated genetic associations with the separate disorders, not focusing on possible pleiotropic effects on both conditions. The preeclampsia studies conducted to date have largely focused on a missense MTHFR SNP, rs1801133, and a regulatory MTHFR SNP, rs1801131 [38,59] and identified an association between the minor alleles and an increased risk of preeclampsia.

The preeclampsia studies conducted to date have largely focused on a missense MTHFR SNP, rs1801133, and a regulatory MTHFR SNP, rs1801131 [38,59] and identified an association between the minor alleles and an increased risk of preeclampsia. 	The MTHFR SNP associated with preeclampsia in our HUNT cohort, rs17367504, is not in linkage disequilibrium with either of the two SNPs (rs1801133 and rs1801131, r2 < 0.5). Further, a recent study has identified the MTHFR gene promoter to be hypermethylated in placental tissue and maternal blood of preeclamptic women [60]. 
PMC5131692	rs17367504	Discussion	RefSNP	False	The preeclampsia studies conducted to date have largely focused on a missense MTHFR SNP, rs1801133, and a regulatory MTHFR SNP, rs1801131 [38,59] and identified an association between the minor alleles and an increased risk of preeclampsia. 	The MTHFR SNP associated with preeclampsia in our HUNT cohort, rs17367504, is not in linkage disequilibrium with either of the two SNPs (rs1801133 and rs1801131, r2 < 0.5). 	Further, a recent study has identified the MTHFR gene promoter to be hypermethylated in placental tissue and maternal blood of preeclamptic women [60]. Despite the increasing evidence from candidate gene research and other genetic studies, no SNPs in the MTHFR gene did reach genome-wide significance in the two GWAS on preeclampsia reported to date [20,21]. 
PMC5131692	rs17367504	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Indeed, both published GWAS on preeclampsia were unable to replicate their findings in independent cohorts [20,21]. 	To validate the finding identified in the HUNT Study, further replication and functional studies on the SNP rs17367504 are required in new preeclampsia cohorts. 	The minor alleles of the three SNPs that were nominally associated with a protective role against preeclampsia development in our study have previously been associated with BP regulation [25,26,28]. These SNPs are located in or close to the ATP2B1, PAX5, and PLCD3 genes. 
PMC5131692	rs17367504	Discussion	RefSNP	False	This might be one of the reasons why we, in a cohort of this size, are able to identify a significant association between preeclampsia and a genetic locus with an acknowledged link to BP regulation. 	A weakness of the present study is the lack of replication of the link between preeclampsia and the SNP rs17367504 in an independent preeclampsia cohort. 	Although nonsignificant, the G allele in the Australian cohort did not demonstrate a trend toward protection against preeclampsia, as identified in the HUNT cohort. The result could have been strengthened further had the result replicated in an independent preeclampsia cohort. 
PMC5131692	rs17367504	Discussion	RefSNP	False	In summary, we have comprehensively assessed SNPs previously reported to be associated with the phenotypes BP regulation and inflammation for association with preeclampsia. 	Women who carry the G (minor) allele of the intronic MTHFR SNP rs17367504 in the Norwegian HUNT Study are significantly less prone to develop preeclampsia than other women. 	Ours is the first study linking this BP associated MTHFR SNP to preeclampsia, thereby identifying a possible pleiotropic protective effect of the minor allele of this variant on preeclampsia and hypertension. Further genetic and functional studies in other cohorts are required for validation of the association. 
PMC5522236	rs2015	Abstract	RefSNP	False	SIRT2 is a member of sirtuin family and is associated with cell growth in various cancers. 	In this study, we searched for variants in functional region of SIRT2 gene and identify rs2015 and rs2241703 in the 3′UTR with minor allele frequency >0.05 in Chinese Han Beijing population from 1000 Genomes Project. 	We then genotyped these two variants in 842 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and 1,718 healthy controls using Taqman genotyping assay. Association between variants and risk of CRC is calculated using logistic regression adjusted for sex and age. 
PMC5522236	rs2015	Abstract	RefSNP	False	It is suggested that the sequence including rs2015C allele lies within a binding site for the full seed region of hsa-miR-376a-5p. 	Through a systematic interrogate of variants in the functional region of SIRT2 gene, we identified rs2015 was significantly associated with CRC susceptibility, providing new insights into the carcinogenesis of CRC. 	
PMC5522236	rs2015	Results	RefSNP	False	Function of the SNP in the 3′UTR of SIRT2 gene 	In silico analysis using MirSNP showed that the rs2015 lies within a binding site for the full seed region of hsa-miR-376a-5p. 	The C allele matches the predicted hsa-miR-376a-5p seed–binding domain, whereas the A allele represents a mismatch base pairing. 
PMC5522236	rs2015	Discussion	RefSNP	False	In the present study, we explored the association between SNPs with minor allele frequency > 0.05 in Chinese Han Beijing population in the functional region of SIRT2 gene and CRC susceptibility in 842 CRC patients and 1,718 controls. 	Only two SNPs (rs2015 and rs2241703) located in 3′-UTR of SIRT2 gene met our criteria. 	We found the frequency of the CA/AA genotypes of the rs2015 were significantly lower in patients than that in controls. rs2015A was associated with lower CRC risk in males, however, that association were not found for females. 
PMC5522236	rs2015	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Only two SNPs (rs2015 and rs2241703) located in 3′-UTR of SIRT2 gene met our criteria. 	We found the frequency of the CA/AA genotypes of the rs2015 were significantly lower in patients than that in controls. 	rs2015A was associated with lower CRC risk in males, however, that association were not found for females. rs2015 was also associated with CRC risk in older (> 60 years). 
PMC5522236	rs1044129	Discussion	RefSNP	False	A SNP which could alter let-7 microRNA-binding site in the 3′-UTR of KRAS gene predicts response in wild-type KRAS patients with metastatic CRC treated with cetuximab monotherapy [22]. 	One functional variant (rs1044129) in the 3′-UTR of RYR3 may be a potential marker for prognosis in patients following curative surgery for CRC [23]. 	Genetic variants in 3′-UTRs of MTHFR predict CRC susceptibility in Koreans [24]. Although SIRT2 play an important role in the prognosis of cancer, no study has reported that SNPs is associated with cancer. 
PMC5522236	rs10410544	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Although SIRT2 play an important role in the prognosis of cancer, no study has reported that SNPs is associated with cancer. 	However, only one SNP (rs10410544) located in intron region of SIRT2 might be associated with risk of Alzheimer's disease [25–28]. 	Our present study also had some limitations. Despite a relatively large sample size, we only genotyped SNPs having MAFs ≥ 5% in the Han Chinese individuals from Beijing. 
PMC5522236	rs2015	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Functional experiments should be conducted to illustrate the mechanism for the association between the rs2015 in SIRT2 and susceptibility to CRC and validate them in CRC tissue sample. 	In conclusion, through screen SNPs in the functional region of SIRT2 gene, our study showed that rs2015 in the 3′-UTR of the SIRT2 gene is associated with susceptibility to CRC. 	Compared to rs2015C allele, subjects with rs2015A was associated with lower CRC risk in males and older patients with age greater than 60. Further studies should be focus on the validation of this association in larger sample size and explore the mechanism of the function of this SNP. 
PMC5522236	rs2015	Methods	RefSNP	False	We searched for variants in the function region including promoter, 5′-UTR, coding region and 3′UTR of SIRT2 gene with Chinese Han Beijing (CHB) minor allele frequency (MAF)>0.05. 	Two polymorphisms (rs2015 C>A and rs2241703 G>A) in the 3′-UTR of SIRT2 gene were selected for further genotyping. 	Genomic DNA were extracted from 2 ml peripheral blood sample collected from each participant at recruitment. Genotyping were performed using Taqman SNP Genotyping method. 
PMC5158031	rs144751738	Results	RefSNP	False	Moreover, while the amino acid residues 306 to 310 involved in PDE6 activation are preserved in the p.(Cys321*) mutant (Fig 4), it is not clear if PDE6G can still interact with the “nucleotide-free” GNAT1 form [9,10,32]. 	Of note, we carefully checked all heterozygous variants that would have acted as modifier factors for disease severity on other genes (123 genes and WES data) previously associated with retinal dystrophies and did not identify additional probably disease-causing mutations: only an homozygous variant c.3376G>A rs144751738 p.(Ala1126Thr) in RBPP3, predicted to be tolerated, was observed in the affected boy. 	Further functional assays are needed to better document this hypothesis. Indeed, a better knowledge of disease mechanism(s) associated with this rod-specifically expressed protein may also have an impact on future therapies. 
PMC5721653	rs1800497	Introduction	RefSNP	False	The genetic polymorphisms that potentially alter the availability and expression of the dopamine D2 receptor have been known to be associated with both substance and behavioral addictions [12, 13]. 	The Taq1A polymorphism (SNP ID: rs1800497), which is located in exon 8 of ANKK1, adjacent to the terminal codon of the DRD2 (OMIM*126450; gene map locus 11q23.2), is known to alter binding specificity and reduce DRD2 expression in striatum and associated structures. 	A significant number of genetic studies have found the association of the Taq1A polymorphism with substance addiction and impulsivity and psychopathic traits in alcohol dependence [14–16]. The C957T polymorphism (SNP ID: rs1799732), which is located on exon 7 of the DRD2 (gene map locus 11q23), is known to alter DRD2 availability and be associated with alcoholism with higher prevalence of the CC genotype [17, 18].

Genotypes for Taq1A (SNP ID: rs1800497), − 141C Ins/Del (SNP ID: rs1799732), and C957T (SNP ID: rs6277) polymorphic loci were assessed using the TaqMan SNP genotyping assays (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA) on a ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Foster City, CA, USA). 	All genotypes were reported using the allelic discrimination program in QuantStudioTM Real-Time PCR Software v1.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Foster City, CA, USA).

PMC3705092	rs1416733	Discussion	RefSNP	False	In our study, we found a significant association between HSF2 and all-cause mortality. 	The top associated variant, rs1416733, is located 11.7 Kb from the 5′ region of the HSF2 gene on chromosome 6 and is a known cis-eQTL for HSF2 (Zeller et al. 2010). 	Each additional copy of the A allele for SNP rs1416733 increased lifespan with a HR of 0.95 in a meta-analysis of nine independent cohort studies. This effect was consistent in direction in eight out of nine cohorts.

PMC3423429	rs695871	Introduction	RefSNP	False	ATXN2 usually contains a repeat structure with 22 or 23 triplets coding for glutamine and the (CAG)8CAA(CAG)4CAA(CAG)8 sequence; expansion of this domain to a size ≥34 triplets with a pure CAG sequence primarily causes autosomal dominant SCA2 [32], while ATXN2 expansions with CAA interruptions were observed as the cause of Levo-dopa responsive Parkinson’s disease [33]. 	ATXN2 expansions associated with ALS were reported by Corrado et al. to be interrupted by at least one CAA triplet [16], Yu et al. identified ATXN2 expansions in 40 ALS patients to be always interrupted by CAA triplets, and defined a haplotype of two ATXN2 SNPs (rs695871 and rs695872) in common between most cases with 3 CAA interruptions and another haplotype in common between most cases with 1–3 CAA interruptions [34], [35]. 	This study now aims to investigate the association of the ATXN2 chromosomal region with ALS risk in the Turkish population, considering not only the polyQ repeats, but also common SNPs and haplotype patterns. 
PMC3423429	rs2239194	Results	RefSNP	False	Ten of 28 SNPs were excluded due to low HWE and MAF scores. 	In single marker analysis, none of the SNPs within the ATXN2 gene by itself showed any significant association with ALS risk, but a trend towards association was observed for the SNP rs2239194 within the SH2B3 gene (p = 0.063) (Table S2). 	On the other hand, haplotype analysis of the region, using the Haploview program, demonstrated a strong association for a 136 kb 15-SNP haplotype block (including rs2239194), which contains both the ATXN2 and SH2B3 loci. One haplotype (GGGGAAGAGAAGGAC, MAF = 0.149, Fcases = 0.194, Fcontrols = 0.101) had a significant p-value of 0.0057 and correlated with an increased ALS risk (OR: 2.23).

This risk haplotype was observed in heterozygous state in both Turkish ALS patients with ATXN2 expansions, which were part of the GWA genotyping study. 
PMC3423429	rs3184504	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Preliminary studies in the nervous system indicate that SH2B3, expressed in cortical neurons from embryonic stages, competes with the other family members (SH2B1 and SH2B2) and inhibits the NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells reducing the neurite outgrowth of cortical neurons, through binding of its SH2 domain to the NGF receptor and repressing the PI3K pathway [47]. 	Previously, a SNP (rs3184504) in the SH2B3 gene was found associated with multiple sclerosis [48]. 	ATXN2 has similar features with SH2B3 since it contains proline-rich regions that interact with Src Homology 3 domains, it associates with receptor tyrosine kinases and modulates the signaling control of growth [23], [27]. This first analysis of Turkish ALS patients on ATXN2, not only confirmed its role as a risk factor in rare cases with intermediate polyQ expansions, but also revealed novel evidence that SNPs across the ATXN2/SH2B3 genomic locus may modulate risk in a substantial fraction of ALS patients. 
PMC4362394	rs11717195	Results	RefSNP	False	Only four SNPs found in the genes GLIS3, PTPRD, TCF7L2, and TSPAN8; had an association with a P-value less than 0.001. 	The SNPs: rs11717195, rs17301514, rs4299828, rs11063069, and rs10842994 have a P-value less than 0.1, therefore suggested as possible risk genetic variants. 	A total of three SNPs, each pertaining to a different gene, were found to be associated to WHR. These genes were: GCKR (Glucokinase Regulatory Protein), IGF2BP2 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor 2 MRNA Binding Protein 2), and PTPRD (protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor D).

Intensities of controls were normal at each SNP, however, lower intensities at rs9295975 and rs28367780 and a slight increase were seen at rs9265664 (Figure 2c). 	Like HLA-B, at SNPs, rs9866959 and rs7636790, located upstream and downstream of the CNV region, intensities were almost the same.

PMC3537668	rs11190870	Abstract	RefSNP	False	Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is one of the most common spinal deformities found in adolescent populations. 	Recently, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a Japanese population indicated that three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs11190870, rs625039 and rs11598564, all located near the LBX1 gene, may be associated with AIS susceptibility [1]. 	This study suggests a novel AIS predisposition candidate gene and supports the hypothesis that somatosensory functional disorders could contribute to the pathogenesis of AIS. These findings warrant replication in other populations. 
PMC3537668	rs625039	Results	RefSNP	False	First, we conducted a case-control study consisting of 953 Chinese Han individuals from southern China (513 patients and 440 healthy controls), and the three SNPs were all found to be associated with AIS predisposition. 	The ORs were observed as 1.49 (95% CI 1.23–1.80, P = 5.09E-5), 1.70 (95% CI 1.42–2.04, P = 1.17E-8) and 1.52 (95% CI 1.27–1.83, P = 5.54E-6) for rs625039, rs11190870 and rs11598564, respectively. 	Second, a case-only study including a subgroup of AIS patients (N = 234) was performed to determine the effects of these variants on the severity of the condition. However, we did not find any association between these variants and the severity of curvature. 
PMC3537668	rs625039	Abstract	RefSNP	False	Genetic association studies are the means of identifying risk variants in complex traits, and replication studies that confirm their findings in other ethnic groups are quite necessary [4], [31]–[33]. 	Recently, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed in a Japanese population, and three SNPs (rs11190870, rs625039 and rs11598564), all of which were located near the gene LBX1 on chromosome 10q24.31, were reported to be associated with AIS susceptibility [1]. 	Two association studies conducted in Chinese Han population from Hong Kong and Yangtze River region of mainland China replicated the association between AIS and rs1190870 [34], [35], and rs11598564 was among the top 100 SNPs identified in a GWAS conducted in the United States [36]. In order to determine whether rs11190870, rs625039, and rs11598564 are associated with a predisposition to AIS in Chinese Han population of Southern China, we conducted a case-control study involving 513 AIS patients and 440 control subjects.

And the present study had a power of 91%, 91% and 77% for rs625039, rs11190870 and rs11598564 respectively to show the effects reported in the previous GWAS [1]. The linkage disequilibrium coefficient (r2) between rs625039 and rs11190870 was 0.59, and the coefficient between rs11190870 and rs11598564 was 0.70 (Figure S1).

We also evaluated possible confounding factors, such as age and sex using logistic regression, and the adjusted ORs for rs625039, rs11190870 and rs11598564 were 1.60 (95% CI 1.26–2.03), 1.65 (95% CI 1.36–2.01), and 1.51(95% CI 1.24–1.84), respectively (Table S2). No interaction effect between SNP and sex on the risk of AIS was observed (Table S2). 
PMC3537668	rs11598564	Discussion	RefSNP	False	In the case-control study, all three genotyped SNPs were found to be associated with AIS predisposition. 	We also found G, T, and G to be risk alleles for rs11598564, rs11190870, and rs625039, respectively, the same as those reported in the previous Japanese GWAS [1]. 	The association between common variants near LBX1 and AIS predisposition found in Japanese population was successfully replicated in this Chinese Han population. Studies on animal models showed that damage to the sensory area of the spinal cord or posterior rhizotomy could cause scoliosis, indicating that somatosensory dysfunction might play a significant role in AIS [49]–[52]. 
PMC3537668	rs11598564	Discussion	RefSNP	False		Yet further replication studies must be performed in other ethnic groups, since of the SNPs evaluated here, only rs11598564 was among the top 100 SNPs identified in a recent large-scale GWAS conducted in the United States [36]. 	It is also important to note that these three SNPs are all located in the flanking region of LBX1 (rs11190870 and rs11598564 are in the 3′ region, and rs625039 is in the 5′ region). The potential functions of these SNPs are still unclear.

Then we searched these SNPs in the recently published ENCODE database (http://www.regulomedb.org), and observed rs625039 may minimally affect binding of motif Pax-4; rs11190870 may minimally affect binding of 9 motifs (Lhx5, Pbx-1b, Oct-4, Oct-1, Pou2f2, Lhx3, Pou2f3, Arid3a and Octamer), whereas, rs11598564 may not cause any motif change. 	It is also possible that these are just markers of LD, associated with actual disease-causing variants. Functional analysis of these variants and targeted resequencing of the whole LD block must be performed to identify functional variants. 
PMC5732940	rs53576	Abstract	RefSNP	False	Sixteen-month-old human infants (N = 99) and adult Border Collie dogs (N = 71) participated in two tasks designed to test (1) their use of gaze-direction as a cue to locate a hidden object, and (2) their reactions to an aversive social interaction (using the still face task for children and a threatening approach task for dogs). 	Moreover, we obtained DNA samples to analyze associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the OXTR (dogs: −213AG, −94TC, −74CG, rs8679682, children: rs53576, rs1042778, rs2254298) and behavior. 	We found that OXTR genotype was significantly associated with reactions to an aversive social interaction both in dogs and children, confirming the anxiolytic effect of oxytocin in both species. In dogs, the genotypes linked to less fearful behavior were associated also with a higher willingness to follow gaze whereas in children, OXTR gene polymorphisms did not affect gaze following success. 
PMC5732940	rs1042778	Introduction	RefSNP	False	The rs2254298 polymorphisms (in intron 3) in the OXTR have been linked to attachment anxiety (Chen and Johnson, 2012) and depression (Thompson et al., 2011) in certain populations. 	A third SNP, rs1042778 (in exon 4 3′ UTR) has also been linked to the regulation of social interactions, in particular by modulating prosocial behavior (Israel et al., 2009). 	The OXTR SNPs that may account for the variability in the social behavior of dogs are less well known. A few studies have used genetic sequencing to identify loci where significant variations are exhibited between individuals. 
PMC5732940	rs1042778	Methods	RefSNP	False	For both species, we genotyped polymorphisms that had been linked to social behavior in former studies. 	For infants, these were the SNPs rs1042778; rs2254298 and rs53576 (based on Israel et al., 2009; Rodrigues et al., 2009; Chen and Johnson, 2012; for instance). 	For dogs SNPs −213AG; −74CG; −94TC; and rs8679682 were genotyped (Bence et al., 2017). Note that these SNPs, although all in the OXTR gene, are neither structurally nor functionally equal between dogs and humans. 
PMC5732940	rs2254298	Methods	RefSNP	False	OXTR rs53576 and rs2254298 SNPs were genotyped by PCR-RFLP method. 	PCR products were incubated for 3 h at 37°C in a restriction enzyme mixture containing 0.5 U/μl AvaII restriction enzyme (NEB) for rs53576 SNP and 0.5 U/μl DdeI restriction enzyme (NEB) for rs2254298 SNP, 1x BSA and 1x NEB4 buffer. 	rs1042778 SNP was genotyped by allele specific amplification (ASA) using 5′- AGC CAC CCC AAG GAG T-3′ forward and 5′- AGC CAC CCC AAG GAG G-3′ allele specific primers. The PCR products were analyzed by conventional submarine agarose gel electrophoresis (Biocenter, Szeged, Hungary), using 2.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.

The SNP rs1042778 did not have a significant effect on children's choices and none of the control variables (age, sex and experimenter) did so either (all p > 0.283 at removal) (Figure 1). 	Similarly, we did not find any significant main or interaction effects in the analyses on SNP rs2254298 (all p > 0.283 at removal) and SNP rs53576 (all p > 0.283 at removal).

PMC5732940	rs1042778	Results	RefSNP	False	Children—looking at the Experimenter 	Allele variations at rs1042778 had no significant effect on the amount of time children spent looking at the experimenter during the still face phase [F(2) = 0.39; p = 0.679], nor did the analyses yield any significant interaction effects (all p > 0.319). 	Similarly, no main [F(2) = 0.065; p = 0.8] or interaction effects were found involving SNP rs2254298 (all p > 0.15).

Dogs—looking at the owner Rs8679682 had no main effect on the amount of time dogs spent looking back at their owners [F(2) = 0.11; p = 0.896] and there were no significant main effects of the control variables and no significant interactions either (all p > 0.154). 
PMC5732940	rs1042778	Results	RefSNP	False	Children—signs of distress 	The analyses on the effects of SNP rs1042778 yielded no main effect of genotype [F(2) = 1.579; p = 0.216] and no interaction effects involving rs1042778 (all p > 0.102) (Figure 1). 	However, age and sex had marginal effects on the amount of time children exhibited signs of distress [sex: F(1) = 3.781; p = 0.057; age: F(1) = 3.722; p = 0.059] and the interaction between sex and experimenter was significant [F(1, 63) = 4.555; p = 0.038]. The results indicate that younger children exhibited more signs of distress than did older children and boys exhibited more distress than girls [M(girls) = 8.48% of the total duration of the phase; M(boys) = 11.47%]. 
PMC5732940	rs2254298	Results	RefSNP	False	The interaction shows that there was not a considerable difference in the amount of distress signals in the case of girls [M(E1) = 8.069%; M(E2) = 7.934%]; however boys showed more signs of distress when the test was administered by Experimenter 2 [M(E1) = 8.147%; M(E2) = 21.51%]. 	In the analyses involving SNP rs2254298, we replicated the connection between age and distress signals [F(1) = 5.208; p = 0.026], but we found no main effect of genotype [F(2) = 0.477; p = 0.493] and no interaction effects involving rs2254298 (all p > 0.352). 	The rs53576 polymorphism had a significant effect on the amount of distress signals children produced in the still phase period [F(2) = 5.796; p = 0.005], showing that children with the homozygous AA genotype exhibited more distress [M(AA) = 21.52%] than children with the other two genotypes [M(GG) = 7.69%; M(GA) = 7.56%]. There was also a significant interaction effect between experimenter and genotype [F(1, 63) = 5.601; p = 0.006] showing that this difference was mainly attributable to tests administered by Experimenter 2. 
PMC5732940	rs53576	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Also, it has been shown that intranasal administration of oxytocin influences dogs' reaction in the threatening approach task (Hernádi et al., 2015). 	In the corresponding analyses with children, we found that the amount of distress signals produced after the withdrawal of positive social stimulation was significantly modulated by one of the three polymorphisms analyzed (rs53576). 	These results confirm that variation in the oxytocinergic system influences how dogs as well as humans respond to social threat or a socially ambiguous situation (Huber et al., 2005; Hernádi et al., 2015; Kovács et al., 2016) Analyzing participants' behavior in the gaze following task, we found that three out of the four identified polymorphisms (−213AG, −95TC, and −74GC) were connected to whether dogs approached a food location the human experimenter had looked at beforehand. 
PMC5406872	rs2228570	Article	RefSNP	False	Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (=SNPs; more than 5000) have been described for the human VDR gene (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/) and four of them have been intensively studied in relation to T1D susceptibility (Table 1). 	These SNPs were identified by their restriction endonuclease cleavage sites comprising rs10735810, also known as rs2228570 (FokI) T → C change in exon 2, rs1544410 G → A change (BsmI, G = b), rs7975232 T → G change (ApaI, G = a), both in intron 8, and rs731236 T → C change in exon 9 (TaqI, T = T) [16]. 	The rs10735810 (FokI) SNP consists of a T to C substitution eliminating the first start codon (ATG) by generation of an alternative start site (ACG) leading to a differently sized protein. The shorter form (424 aa; C allele or F allele, methionine at the fourth position) is considered to be more active than the long form (427 aa; T allele or f allele, methionine at first position) [17,18].

The SNPs rs1544410 (BsmI), rs7975232 (ApaI) and rs731236 (TaqI) are located at the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of the gene and are without consequences for the VDR protein structure, however, they are strongly linked to a poly(A) microsatellite repeat in the 3′ UTR. 	The poly(A) sequence in the 3′ UTR region of genes regulates gene expression, especially through the modulation of mRNA stability.

The first study from South India examined the distribution of the VDR SNPs (rs7975232 ApaI, rs731236 TaqI and rs1544410 BsmI).

PMC5406872	rs9729	Article	RefSNP	False	Nevertheless, also the “AA” genotype in Taiwanese and a “t” allele in Iranian populations have been suggested as risk conferring [22,60]. 	Accordingly, Ramos-Lopez et al.

The investigators suggest that maternal VDR SNPs enhance a child’s risk for T1D independent of the child’s genotype. The maternal vitamin D status and VDR genotype may hereby regulate in utero development and have an influence on the later T1D risk in conjunction with environmental factors. 
PMC5406872	rs1544410	Article	RefSNP	False	Notably, the different haplotypes associated with T1D as reported by Mcdermott et al. (1997) [19] (bAT), Pani et al. (2000) [21] (BAt) and Garcia et al. (2007) [43] (BAT) indicate a variable genetic predisposition to T1D depending on the ethnic origin. 	This was also shown by Audi et al. (2004) [34] by analyzing the SNP in the start codon of exon 2 (rs10735810 FokI) additional to the rs1544410 (BsmI) SNP in two Spanish populations with different genetic backgrounds (Barcelona and Navarra). 	A combined genotype showed that the homozygous “bbFF” genotype was more prevalent in T1D patients from Barcelona whereas the homozygous “BBFF” genotype was more frequent in Navarra. Another study conducted by San Pedro et al. (2005) included families of Basque origin where a risk-associated four-locus haplotype (fBAt) was identified [36] confirming the same profile (“BAt”) as described by Pani et al. (2000) [21]. 
PMC5406872	rs757343	Article	RefSNP	False	T1D patients carrying the rs10735810 (FokI) SNP with thyroid peroxidase Abs showed an 18-fold risk to develop thyroid dysfunction. 	Additionally, the rarely analyzed SNP rs757343 (Tru9I) showed an overtransmission of the allele G (corresponding to “U”) from parents to affected children as shown by Ramos-Lopez et al. 2006 and Boraska et al. 2008 [38,46]. 	Furthermore, in the study from Gyorffy et al. (2002) the haplotype “bau” was found more frequently in patients than in controls [26]. Furthermore, a variety of VDR allele combinations have been described as T1D protective [21,24,38,48,49,50,63,69,70]. 
PMC5406872	rs7975232	Article	RefSNP	False	Ponsonby et al. (2008) [76] suggest that the association between the VDR SNPs and T1D should be seen as depending on the environment and not being responsible for T1D by itself. 	Therefore, the authors conducted a meta-analysis of 16 case-controlled studies from 19 regions and four additionally analyzed SNPs (rs7975232 ApaI, rs731236 TaqI, rs1544410 BsmI, and rs10735810 FokI) under the aspect of ambient winter UV radiation. 	The study centres were located across a range of latitudes from 33° S to 65° N corresponding to a winter UV radiation range from 1.0 mW/m2 to 133.8 mW/m2. The authors observed that the allele “B” of rs1544410 (BsmI) and the allele “F” of rs10735810 (FokI) were more likely risk factors for T1D under high-winter-UV radiation exposures.

Interestingly, the regional stratification analysis indicates that the rs1544410 (BsmI) “B” allele conferred an enhanced T1D risk in East Asia but the rs10735810 (FokI) allele “F” in the West Asian population. An additional meta-analysis covering the four VDR SNPs in Asian, European and Latino populations concluded that “BAT” was a significant T1D risk factor [81].

Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis on the basis of nine studies comprising 1053 children with T1D (Asian, European and Latino origin) confirmed the “BB”genotype of rs1544410 (BsmI) as risk marker for T1D and also for the “tt” genotype of the rs731236 (TaqI) SNP [83]. 	Liu et al. (2014) focused on the diabetes complications (diabetic nephropathy (DN) and diabetic retinopathy (DR)) and studied four variants of the VDR [82]. Hereby, the rs10735810 (FokI) SNP was associated with nephropathy risk in Caucasian diabetes patients, represented in a dominant model.

The subsequent analysis of a large number of samples from case/control (n = 8517/10,438) and T1D families (n = 1933) in the British population revealed an association between the two SNPs (rs10741657 and rs12794714) with T1D in a combined dataset [57]. 	The next enzyme in the vitamin D cascade, CYP27B1, is coded by a gene situated on chromosome 12p13.1-q13.3. The gene contains nine exons and eight introns and extends over 4.8 kb. 
PMC5406872	rs10877012	Article	RefSNP	False	Mutations in the CYP27B1 gene can lead to an inactive protein unable to bind 25(OH)D3 as found in vitamin D dependent rickets [103]. 	Two SNPs within the CYP27B1 were investigated in relation to T1D, rs10877012 SNP (−1260 C/A) located in the promoter region and the rs4646536 SNP (+2838 C/T) in intron 6. 	We originally observed that allele “C” and genotype “CC” were more frequent in patients with T1D than in controls [90]. Later studies, one from Egypt with 240 subjects and another one with a large collective (population different countries: British, Finland, USA, Norway, Romania) confirmed these findings [91,93]. 
PMC5406872	rs10877012	Article	RefSNP	False	Additionally, Bailey et al. (2007) showed also an association of T1D with the rs4646536 SNP. 	Cooper et al. (2011) confirmed the protective effect of the allele “A” of the rs10877012 SNP [57,91]. 	The last enzyme in the vitamin D cascade, CYP24A1 is capable of hydroxylating both metabolites (25(OH)D3, and 1,25(OH)2D3). However, the preferred substrate is 1,25(OH)2D3. 
PMC5406872	rs6013897	Article	RefSNP	False	Major alterations in the enzymatic activity of CYP24A1 can be due to mutations of the CYP24A1 gene located on chromosome 20p13 (20.5 kb, 12 exons) that cause idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia [105]. 	The CYP24A1 gene was investigated in relation to T1D susceptibility: sixteen tag SNPs for CYP24A1 that were analyzed by Bailey et al. (2007) [91] as well as two further SNPs (rs6013897 and rs2296241) did not show any association with T1D [57,89]. 	This gene is of potential clinical relevance because an undiagnosed CYP24A1 mutation may cause hypercalcemia also in adults if these are exposed to high vitamin D dosages. A further essential component of the vitamin D system is the DBP, also called group-specific component (GC) that belongs to the proteins of the albumin family and transports vitamin D in the circulation.

Among the many characterized DBP variants, two known SNPs in exon 11 were investigated for T1D susceptibility (rs7041 and rs4588). 	While the rs7041 SNP results in a T to G substitution (Aps to Glu in codon 416), rs4588 SNP leads to a C to G substitution (threonine to lysine in codon 420).

Out of these, the rs3740165 SNP was found to be associated with increased T1D risk. The genotype “AA” of the rs3740165 was more prevalent in T1D patients than in control but without correlation neither with 25(OH)D3, nor with 1,25(OH)2D3 concentration.

The genotype “AA” of the rs3740165 was more prevalent in T1D patients than in control but without correlation neither with 25(OH)D3, nor with 1,25(OH)2D3 concentration. 	It has to be pointed out that the SNP does not change the coding sequence in this position (Pro → Pro). Therefore, functional susceptibility may develop by a linked gene variant or a regulatory SNP. 
PMC5406872	rs1544410	Article	RefSNP	False	Furthermore, this trial also showed an improvement of glycemic parameters under vitamin D treatment. 	Patients carrying the genotypes aa, TT and bb (rs7975232 ApaI, rs731236 TaqI and rs1544410 BsmI) were capable of raising their Treg cell number [115]. 	A further study tested in vitro the functional role of the VDR rs10735810 (FokI) SNP in T-helper (CD3+CD4+) from twenty patients with T1D. The stimulation of CD3+CD4+ cells with 25(OH)D3 [62.4 nM] and 1,25(OH)2D3 [1 × 10−8 M] for 72 h revealed a reduced percentage of CD4+ cells isolated from T1D patient carrying “FF”, suggesting a beneficial balance in the T cell compartment [116]. 
PMC5406872	rs731236	Article	RefSNP	False	Remarkably, the 25(OH)D3 treatment (50 ng/mL) for seven days inhibited the differentiation of monocytes into dendritic cells, promoting the formation of intermediate cells (IC). 	The increase of IC under supplementation with 25(OH)D3 was related to the genotypes of two VDR SNPs (rs731236 TaqI and rs1544410 BsmI) and one SNP of the CYP24A1 gene (rs927650), illustrating that the immune effects of vitamin D supplementation can depend on genetic variants of the vitamin D system. 	
PMC4923738	rs356165	Article	RefSNP	False	For example, it has been shown that non-motor features including autonomic signs and cognitive dysfunction are more common in patients with GBA-mutations [26]. 	Similarly, common risk SNPs, such as rs356165 in the 3’-untranslated region of the alpha-synuclein gene have been associated with a higher disease risk, an earlier onset and more rapid progression [33], and the ApoE4 allele is a major determinant for the development of dementia in PD [34]. 	Stratifying the patient population in trials aimed at these different aspects of PD may significantly increase the power of clinical trials. In conclusion, genetic testing in PD will play an increasing role in clinical practice and research. 
PMC4437386	rs2289917	Abstract	RefSNP	False	Male children bearing ≥(GATA)13 repeats showed >3-fold higher risk for cataract (CI95% = 1.43–7.00, P = 0.0043, P c = 0.0086) as compared to female children (OR = 1.19, CI95% = 0.49–2.92, P = 0.70). 	Cases with haplotype—≥(GATA)13 of D2S2944 and “C” allele rs2289917—have a higher risk for pediatric cataract (OR = 2.952, CI95% = 1.595~5.463, P = 0.000453). >(GATA)13  repeats formed energetically more favorable stem-loop structure. Conclusion. 	Intragenic microsatellite repeat expansion in SPAG16 gene increases predisposition to pediatric cataract by probably interfering posttranscriptional events and affecting the expression of adjacent lens transparency gene/s in a gender bias manner. 
PMC4437386	rs2289917	Introduction	RefSNP	False	We hypothesized that the D2S2944 microsatellite may act as an enhancer or repressor to regulate SPAG16 gene expression which in turn impacts gene/s regulating lens transparency in gender specific manner. 	In this study, we investigated the association between variations of the (GATA)n repeats in microsatellite marker D2S2944 in the SPAG16 gene and a tagged SNP-rs2289917, in the promoter of the γ-crystallin Bgene, with childhood cataract. 	
PMC4437386	rs2289917	Methods	RefSNP	False	To elucidate the mechanism by which the microsatellite motif could be involved in regulating the SPAG16 expression, the potential secondary structure/s in the intron 10 of SPAG16A mRNA were predicted using the authentic and minimum free energy (ΔG; kcal/mol) method of MFOLD program (version 3.1) (http://mfold.rit.albany.edu/?q=mfold/RNA-Folding-Form/). 	Haplotype frequencies for pairs of alleles of D2S2944 and rs2289917, as well as χ 2 values for allele associations, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) coefficients D′ were estimated by SHEsis software (http://analysis2.bio-x.cn/myAnalysis.php/). 	
PMC4437386	rs2289917	Results	RefSNP	False	Additionally, genotyping of D2S2944 marker in genomic DNA samples obtained from either of the parents of 5 pediatric simplex cataract cases showed three parents homozygous and one was heterozygous for the longer allele. 	The frequency of the major “C” allele of rs2289917 differed significantly between cases and controls (92% versus 80%, OR=2.989, CI95% = 1.26–7.11, P = 0.0132, data not shown). 	The LD estimation by SHEsis indicated that rs2289917 and D2S2944 were in low LD D′ = 0.273, r 2 = 0.011, P = 0.131. Haplotype analysis showed that the haplotype with “C” allele of rs2289917 and ≥(GATA)13 allele of D2S2944 was more prevalent in pediatric cataract cases versus controls (61% versus 34%, OR = 2.952, CI95% = 1.595~5.463, Fisher's P = 0.000453), Table 3.

Control cohort segregated on the basis of castes showed no differences in longer allele frequency, indicating absence of any effect of population structures. In a replication cohort from western India, that is, Shekhawati region of Rajasthan 16% of healthy adult subjects out of 107 individuals have 13 “GATA” repeats of D2S2944, which is similar to the observed control frequency in the present studied cohort. 
PMC4437386	rs2289917	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Both markers that is, rs2289917 and D2S2944 fall in high LD blocks according to HapMap (D′ = 1, LOD > 2). 	So it is possible that combined effect of risk allele of D2S2944, and rs2289917 is because there may be low LD (as shown by our in silico analysis) between some neighboring SNP and D2S2944 which explicate the association. 	We also observed novel sequence variations in the promoter region of CRYGB gene of pediatric cataract patients, which affected the putative TF binding sites in in silico analysis [4]. Being a WD-repeat protein, SPAG16 is known to interact dynamically and reversibly with TFs.

Gene association studies have linked a polymorphism in the 5-HT 1A regulatory region (rs6295; G-1019C) with receptor levels in the brain and also to increased risk for depression 43– 47. 	The GG genotype at this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is associated with altered levels of 5-HT 1A receptor expression and reduced responsiveness to antidepressant treatment 43, 48. Additionally, clinical studies have revealed antidepressant effects of buspirone and other 5-HT 1A receptor agonists 49, 50. 
PMC5302148	rs6295	Article	RefSNP	False	Other psychiatric disorders have also been linked to the 5-HT 1A receptor, including bipolar disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder 78, 79. 	Additionally, the SNP rs6295 found in the premotor region that is associated with risk for depression is also linked with psychiatric hospitalization, a history of substance abuse, and prior suicide attempts 43. 	Consistent with the studies in depression, the G allele is associated with reduced expression of the 5-HT 1A receptor in the prefrontal cortex and an increased risk for psychiatric outcomes. Interestingly, the effects on receptor expression were also seen in the brain during early human embryonic development, suggesting its potential importance in mediating developmental contributions to adult depression.

We addressed the functional consequences of SNP rs68073206, located at the +5 position of an alternative 5′ splice donor site, and observed its association with male infertility in the subjects with azoospermia, oligoasthenozoospermia and normozoospermia. 	The translation product of splicing variant LHCGR-exon 6A was expressed in the cytoplasm and exhibited no affinity with [125I]-hCG. No dominant negative effect was observed in cells co-expressed with LHCGR-exon 6A and wild-type LHCGR. 
PMC5377329	rs68073206	Abstract	RefSNP	False	However, this polymorphism was significantly associated with testosterone levels in normozoospermic subjects (n = 210). 	In conclusion, SNP rs68073206 in the splicing site of the cryptic exon 6A of the LHCGR gene affect the splicing pattern in the gene, which may play a role in the modulation of the LHCGR sensitivity in the gonads.

To compare hormone levels among the normozoospermic subjects with three genotypes (T/T, T/G, G/G of rs68073206), independent sample T-test was applied. 	SPSS 20.0 statistical software package was used to analyze the data and GraphPad Prism6.0 was used to generate the graphs. The level of statistical significance was considered to be P < 0.05. 
PMC5377329	rs68073206	Results	RefSNP	False	Due to the presence of premature termination codons, variable transcripts with the internal exon 6A, whether 6A-short or 6A-long, produce putatively truncated LHCGR-exon 6A protein with only 209 amino acids, containing of only a part of the extracellular domain and lacking the transmembrane domain (Fig. 1A,B). 	From the potential splicing site prediction and splicing variants detected by RT-PCR, rs68073206 was proved to be located at +5 of the splice donor site downstream of the long transcripts of 6A (Fig. 1A–C). 	The particular location of rs68073206, drove our attention to investigate its physical role in the function of alternatively spliced isoforms derived from exon 6A of LHCGR gene.

PMC5377329	rs4539842	Discussion	RefSNP	False	In a previous study, three SNPs in the exonic region were studied intensively from bioactivity to relationship with disease. 	The common polymorphic variant (insLQ, rs4539842) in exon 1, resulting from the insertion of the amino acids Leu and Glu in the signal peptide, displayed increased hormone sensitivity and plasma membrane expression compared with the wild-type receptor. 	It was found to be associated with the shortening of breast cancer disease-free survival, probably by increasing estrogen exposure in female carriers13. The two other nonsynonymous SNPs, N291S (rs12470652) and N312S (rs2293275), occur in exon 10, with ethnic diversity in allele frequencies.

The N291S LHCGR variant was revealed to alter glycosylation status and to increase receptor sensitivity, but no associations with breast cancer were found, while N312S was more frequent in women with breast cancer than in controls, without significant functional consequence12. Furthermore, N312S was also disclosed to be significantly less frequent in men with maldescended testes than in healthy controls, and the difference was confirmed in infertile men with and without maldescensus14. 
PMC5377329	rs68073206	Discussion	RefSNP	False	In particular, splicing variants were found to be associated with low (del ex2) or high (del ex6) responses to controlled ovarian stimulation with FSH. 	In our study, SNP rs68073206 at splicing site was found to alter the expression ratios of the splicing variants in either granulosa cells or in vitro transfected 293T cells. 	The long transcript (exon 6A-long) was observed to be significantly elevated in the cells with the G/G genotype, which was very low or even undetectable in T/T and T/G genotypes. Moreover, the expression of wild-type LHCGR was also observed to have the increased trend in the G/G genotype, although no significant difference was detected for limited sample size. 
PMC5377329	rs68073206	Discussion	RefSNP	False	It has been suggested that a higher expression of the long transcript (exon 6A-long) might be related to a higher level of wild-type LHCGR, resulting in greater sensitivity to LH levels and secretion of testosterone in Leydig cells. 	However, no association was observed in the polymorphism rs68073206 with azoospermiaor or OAT. 	The regulation imposed by alternative splicing product remains unclear. In vitro functional studies have suggested that the translated product of the alternative spicing of the cryptic exon is not a functional receptor. In a previous study, Kossack et al.1119 deduced that the stop codon in exon 6A triggered non-sense mRNA decay (NMD) of transcripts with the inclusion of exon 6A, and the mutations that occurred in exon 6A changed the expression levels of the different transcripts.

Significant associations were found for proxy SNPs at KCNQ1 [odds ratio (OR) = 1.41, P = 9.91 × 10–16 for rs2237897], CDKN2A/CDKN2B (OR = 1.30, P = 1.34 × 10–10 for rs10811661), CENTD2 (OR = 1.28, P = 9.88 × 10-4 for rs1552224) and SLC30A8 (OR = 1.19, P = 1.43 × 10-5 for rs13266634). 	We further evaluated the cumulative effect on type 2 diabetes of these 4 SNPs, in combination with 5 SNPs at HHEX, CDKAL1, VEGFA and FTO reported previously. Individuals carrying 12 or more risk alleles had a nearly 4-fold increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes compared with those carrying less than 6 risk alleles [adjusted OR = 3.68, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.76–4.91]. 
PMC4294637	rs7756992	Methods	RefSNP	False	As a result, 48 SNPs from 34 genes were selected. 	As 9 SNPs (i.e. rs7756992, rs6931514, rs4712524, rs4712523 in CDKAL1, rs9472138 in VEGFA, rs1111875, rs7923837, rs5015480 in HHEX, rs8050136 in FTO) had been reported in our previous studies[28–30], the other 39 SNPs from 30 genes were included in this study (S1 Table). 	In the discovery stage, 39 SNPs of 1200 type 2 diabetes cases and 1200 controls were genotyped using the TaqMan OpenArray Genotyping System (LifeTechnologies, Carlsbad, USA). DNA samples with standardized concentration were loaded and amplified on 48-sample arrays according to the manufacturer’s manual. 
PMC4294637	rs13266634	Results	RefSNP	False	The 10 suggestive SNPs were further to be genotyped in the replication stage with an additional 1,725 cases and 2,081 controls. 	As shown in Table 2, 6 SNPs (rs13266634 from SLC30A8, rs10811661 from CDKN2A/CDKN2B, rs2237897, rs2237892 and rs2237895 from KCNQ1, rs1552224 from CENTD2) were consistently associated with type 2 diabetes risk, with P values less than 0.05. 	After combining the two stages together, all of the 6 SNPs were significantly associated with type 2 diabetes susceptibility after Bonferroni correction (P < 1.28 × 10−3). As 3 SNPs from KCNQ1 showed statistically significantly associated type 2 diabetes in the study, we used logistic regression to determine the independent effects of these SNPs and found that SNP rs2237897 conferred independent risk for type 2 diabetes, as shown in S3 Table. 
PMC4294637	rs2237897	Results	RefSNP	False	After combining the two stages together, all of the 6 SNPs were significantly associated with type 2 diabetes susceptibility after Bonferroni correction (P < 1.28 × 10−3). 	As 3 SNPs from KCNQ1 showed statistically significantly associated type 2 diabetes in the study, we used logistic regression to determine the independent effects of these SNPs and found that SNP rs2237897 conferred independent risk for type 2 diabetes, as shown in S3 Table. 	To investigate if genes affected type 2 diabetes additively, we examined the joint effect of risk alleles of SNPs. We included the above-mentioned 4 SNPs from 4 genes (i.e. rs13266634 from SLC30A8, rs10811661 from CDKN2A/CDKN2B, rs2237897 from KCNQ1, rs1552224 from CENTD2) and the 5 additional SNPs (i.e. rs7756992 from CDKAL1, rs9472138 from VEGFA, rs1111875, rs7923837 from HHEX, rs8050136 in FTO) that we previously reported [28–30].

All these SNPs showed independently significant association with type 2 diabetes. Thus, a total of 9 SNPs were included to analyze the cumulative effect of genetic factors on type 2 diabetes. 
PMC4294637	rs2237897	Discussion	RefSNP	False		Among the confirmed SNPs in our study, the strongest association with type 2 diabetes was observed for SNP rs2237897 from the KCNQ1gene, as each risk allele increased the odds of type 2 diabetes by 41%. 	Another SNP, rs2237892, which was in moderate LD with rs2237897 in the Chinese population (r2 = 0.67) showed similar effect size. SNP rs2237895 (r2 of 0.24 with rs2237897) also showed a significant but relatively weak association.

The polymorphisms were also found to be associated with increasing fasting glucose and impairment of insulin, according to the homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function [11, 40, 41]. 
PMC4871369	rs1462845	Abstract	RefSNP	False	Building on our previous work, the purpose of this current study was to: evaluate LSAMP SNP-specific hazards for all-cause mortality post-catheterization in a larger cohort of our CAD cases; and, perform additional replication in an independent dataset. 	We examined two LSAMP SNPs—rs1462845 and rs6788787—using CAD case-only Cox proportional hazards regression for additive genetic effects, censored on time-to-all-cause mortality or last follow-up among Caucasian subjects from the Catheterization Genetics Study (CATHGEN; n = 2,224) and the Intermountain Heart Collaborative Study (IMHC; n = 3,008). 	Only after controlling for age, sex, body mass index, histories of smoking, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia and hypertension (HR = 1.11, 95%CI = 1.01–1.22, p = 0.032), rs1462845 conferred significantly increased hazards of all-cause mortality among CAD cases. Even after controlling for multiple covariates, but in only the primary cohort, rs6788787 conferred significantly improved survival (HR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.69–0.92, p = 0.002). 
PMC4871369	rs1462845	Abstract	RefSNP	False	Even after controlling for multiple covariates, but in only the primary cohort, rs6788787 conferred significantly improved survival (HR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.69–0.92, p = 0.002). 	Post-hoc analyses further stratifying by sex and disease severity revealed replicated effects for rs1462845: even after adjusting for aforementioned covariates and coronary interventional procedures, males with severe burden of CAD had significantly amplified hazards of death with the minor variant of rs1462845 in both cohorts (HR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.08–1.55, p = 0.00456; replication HR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.05–1.49, p = 0.013). 	Kaplan-Meier curves revealed unique cohort-specific genotype effects on survival. Additional analyses demonstrated that the homozygous risk genotype (‘A/A’) fully explained the increased hazard in both cohorts.

PMC4871369	rs579459	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Other studies have demonstrated SNP-specific risk for cardiovascular-related death. 	In 2013, investigators of the GRACE Genetics Study [26] evaluated 23 susceptibility loci for CAD and their association with recurrent MI or cardiac death; a variant upstream of ABO (rs579459) was significantly associated in initial and replication analyses with both endpoints in 2,099 acute coronary syndrome patients followed for a median five years. 	In studies of CAD and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ADAM33 was related to both all-cause and cardiovascular-related mortality in 1,390 subjects followed for 18 years [27]. In the MASS-II clinical trial of CAD and preserved left ventricular function, the 9p21 variant rs2383206 was associated with higher incidence of all-cause and cardiac-related mortality in 611 patients with established multi-vessel CAD [28].

In the MASS-II clinical trial of CAD and preserved left ventricular function, the 9p21 variant rs2383206 was associated with higher incidence of all-cause and cardiac-related mortality in 611 patients with established multi-vessel CAD [28]. 	The minor alleles of angiotensinogen (AGT) SNPs rs1926723, rs11122576, and rs6687360, and angiotensin-1 converting enzyme (ACE) SNP rs4267385 were associated with increased mortality in 1,186 coronary patients followed for a median three years [29]. A multitude of genetic variants have been associated with increased odds of greater atherosclerotic disease burden and CAD lesion progression. 
PMC4871369	rs1926723	Discussion	RefSNP	False	In the MASS-II clinical trial of CAD and preserved left ventricular function, the 9p21 variant rs2383206 was associated with higher incidence of all-cause and cardiac-related mortality in 611 patients with established multi-vessel CAD [28]. 	The minor alleles of angiotensinogen (AGT) SNPs rs1926723, rs11122576, and rs6687360, and angiotensin-1 converting enzyme (ACE) SNP rs4267385 were associated with increased mortality in 1,186 coronary patients followed for a median three years [29]. 	A multitude of genetic variants have been associated with increased odds of greater atherosclerotic disease burden and CAD lesion progression. Most notably, having any copy of the T allele for rs7903146 (a common variant in TCF7L2 candidate gene for type 2 diabetes) conferred increased risk of multiple-vessel obstructive lesions, greater burden of atherosclerotic disease, and increased incidence of death among 889 subjects referred for cardiac catheterization and 559 MASS-II trial participants followed prospectively over 5 years [30]. 
PMC4871369	rs7903146	Discussion	RefSNP	False	A multitude of genetic variants have been associated with increased odds of greater atherosclerotic disease burden and CAD lesion progression. 	Most notably, having any copy of the T allele for rs7903146 (a common variant in TCF7L2 candidate gene for type 2 diabetes) conferred increased risk of multiple-vessel obstructive lesions, greater burden of atherosclerotic disease, and increased incidence of death among 889 subjects referred for cardiac catheterization and 559 MASS-II trial participants followed prospectively over 5 years [30]. 	While the authors’ results were most significant in non-diabetics, we note this study because of the sampling approach for at-risk individuals referred for cardiac catheterization that is similar to the CATHGEN and IMHC studies we evaluated. Genotype- and sex-specific variation in mortality has also been described by others. CYP19A1 polymorphism -81371 C>T significantly interacted with sex to predict primary endpoints death, nonfatal MI, and nonfatal stroke among 568 acute coronary syndrome patients and 619 subjects from a randomized, controlled trial of hypertension followed for 3 years [31]. 
PMC4871369	rs6788787	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Missing data on BMI were negligible between both studies (less than 1% missing data in CATHGEN and approximately 2% in IMHC). 	No other variables in the gene and covariate models had missing data, leading us to believe that missing data differences do not contribute to our inability to replicate the rs6788787 variant. 	We did observe a significant amount of missing data in CATHGEN for the ‘intervention’ variables (percentage of missing data for subsequent ICC was 59.7%, PTCA, 62.6%, and CABG, 67.3%). In IMHC, CABG and percutaneous intervention data had less than 1% missing fields; however, IMHC had 100% missing stent data (field not collected). 
PMC4871369	rs1462845	Discussion	RefSNP	False	To specifically characterize evidence of SNP-specific effects on survival in people already diagnosed with CAD, we stratified our analyses by CAD case status [11]. 	In comparison to significant survival curves by genotype among CAD Cases (Figs 1 and 2 for rs1462845; Fig 3 for rs6788787), the control participants have a lack of distinction between survival curves by genotype (Figs 5 and 6). 	We wish to note that the Kaplan-Meier graphs are presented with the same y-axes scales for cases and controls in order to most accurately compare patterns among the survival data. The lack of significance in controls across all genetic and statistical models (Table 4, Figs 5 and 6) suggests that the genetic (SNP) effects on survival are unique to the context of clinically appreciable CAD. 
PMC4871369	rs1462845	Discussion	RefSNP	False		The studied SNPs may not be the causative variants for the associations with increased hazards of death (rs1462845) or improved survival (rs6788787); they may be proxies for other markers in LD. 	Most likely due to lower event rate compared to the adequately-powered CATHGEN dataset, the replication dataset had slightly reduced power for rs1462845 analyses. We had limited power to detect significant hazards in rs6788787 in both cohorts, most likely due to the combination of low minor allele frequency (~15%) and low event rates. 
PMC4871369	rs1462845	Conclusion	RefSNP	False	We set out to characterize survival-variant genetic effects for a priori CAD candidate genes in two existing studies of symptomatic, CAD-diagnosed individuals from two different regions of the U.S. 	Survival probability differed by LSAMP SNP rs1462845; there was replicated SNP-specific risk for all-cause mortality in symptomatic, CAD-diagnosed males with severe burden of CAD. 	Alternatively, improved survival in the context of CAD for rs6788787 was not replicated with IMHC data. We observed disease-severity-, sex-, and cohort-specific survival probability patterns. 
PMC4871369	rs1462845	Conclusion	RefSNP	False	We have observed that variation in one CAD candidate gene—LSAMP—displays differential effects on survival two CAD case-control studies. 	Further, different SNPs within this same gene exert distinct effects on survivorship in established CAD populations; there may be allelic heterogeneity among two LSAMP SNPs: one variant conferred increased (rs1462845) while the other decreased risk for death (rs6788787) in the presence of CAD-diagnosed males with severe burden of coronary disease. 	If not confounded by survival bias, survival-variant genes may lead to improved understanding of the genetic contributions to survivorship in CAD. Identification of risk-factor mediated genetic effects—such as demonstrated here with sex- and disease-severity—may help to explain differential outcomes in patient subsets and may lead to more informed clinical decision-making for CAD patients in the future. 
PMC4871369	rs1462845	Methods	RefSNP	False	The pilot study selected 34 previously-genotyped SNPs that met our quality control metrics for high quality genotyping. 	For the present study, we evaluated two LSAMP SNPs that demonstrated significant hazards of all-cause mortality in our previous pilot study (rs1462845 and rs6788787). 	[11] These LSAMP variants were not in linkage disequilibrium, and were the only two out of seventeen LSAMP SNPs with significant hazards in the pilot which were not in LD [11]. SNP characteristics are presented in Table 6.

PMC4730494	rs1800947	Abstract	RefSNP	False	However, few studies have undertaken a comprehensive examination of SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) of the CRP and TNF-α genes; due to this, we will present a protocol study to evaluate the role of the CRP and TNF-α genes in Mexican individuals. 	Methods/design: we will perform a case-control study to explore the CRP and TNF-α genotype distribution as well as the serum influence of rs1800947, rs1130864, rs2794521 and rs1205 (polymorphisms of the CRP gene) and rs361525, rs1800629, rs1799724, rs1800630, rs1799964 (of the TNF-α gene) in Mexican individuals who present coronary artery disease. 	Ethics and dissemination: a written informed consent will be obtained from all the participating subjects. An article detailing the results of the study will be submitted for publication in an international peer-reviewed journal, in accordance with STROBE criteria. 
PMC4730494	rs1800947	Introduction	RefSNP	False	Studies have reported that polymorphisms within the CRP gene are associated with plasma CRP levels [18,19]. 	The most studied polymorphisms of the CRP gene in association with CAD are the 1059G>C (rs1800947), 1444C>T (rs1130864), 717A>G (rs2794521) and 3872G>A (rs1205) variants [19,20]. 	It has been observed that these four principal variants increase or decrease the CRP serum levels and are rapidly up-regulated by inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, CRP levels are a sensitive indicator of inflammation and a marker of CAD [21,22]. 
PMC4730494	rs1800629	Introduction	RefSNP	False	Genetic variants in the TNF-α promoter region are reported to be associated with the TNF-α serum levels, these levels are correlated with the first-time cardiovascular disease and are also a marker for recurrent coronary events after a previous myocardial infarction [25,26]. 	Numerous polymorphisms of the TNF-α gene have been reported, including 308G>A (rs1800629), 238G>A (rs3615525), 857C>T (rs1799724), 863C>A (rs1800630) and 1031T>C (rs1799964) [27,28]. 	The polymorphisms 308G>A (rs1800629) and 238G>A (rs3615525) are the most studied variants of TNF-α, because several studies have found that patients with the A allele show high levels of TNF-α in serum, modifying the risk of developing CAD [29,30]. However, the association found between CAD and these genes must be validated using larger and independent sample populations, using case-case control studies, in order to prevent spurious associations [31,32] and better understand the incidence of cardiovascular events, a case-control study is contemplated.

PMC4730494	rs1799724	Abstract	RefSNP	False		The present study is designed as a protocol to determine the association between CAD and the polymorphisms of the CRP and TNF-α genes: rs1800947, rs1130864, rs2794521, rs1205 and rs361525, rs1800629, rs1799724, rs1800630, rs1799964, respectively. 	It will also investigate whether any polymorphisms of the CRP and TNF-α genes affects the serum levels of CRP and TNF-α proteins in Mexicans patients with CAD confirmed by angiography. 
PMC4730494	rs1799724	Abstract	RefSNP	False	Also, genomic DNA from leukocyte blood sample will be extracted using a modified version of the protocol by Lahiri et al. [35]. 	The polymorphisms of the CRP and TNF-α genes chosen for the study will be: rs1800947, rs1130864, rs2794521 and rs1205, as well as rs361525, rs1800629, rs1799724, rs1800630, rs1799964, respectively (Table 1). 	These variants will be analyzed using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) end-point method. The final volume of the PCR reaction will be 5μL and will consist of 20 ng genomic DNA, 2.5 Fluorescence Labeling (FL) TaqMan Master Mix and 2.5 FL 20 × Assay. 
PMC4730494	rs1799724	Abstract	RefSNP	False	Moreover, high concentrations of plasma-soluble TNF-α are considered a key feature in cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, CAD and MI [29,41], therefore it is also a marker for recurrent coronary events [42]. 	Due to this evidence we propose to analyze the distribution of the most studied variants of CRP gene (rs1800947, rs1130864, rs2794521 and rs1205) and TNF-α gene (rs361525, rs1800629, rs1799724, rs1800630, rs1799964) in a Mexican population in association with CAD. 	On the other hand, we want to observe the role of the genotype distribution in CRP and TNF-α serum levels, which are considered a marker of CAD. The outcomes of the study will provide new and unique information of the CRP and TNF-α genes participation in CAD, in Mexican individuals. 
PMC6449895	rs17401966	Introduction	RefSNP	False	KIF1B is suspected of playing a role also in the development and progress of HCC: Several reports have focused on the association between KIF1B rs17401966 polymorphism and susceptibility to HCC; however, conclusions of the studies are inconsistent. 	There were two meta-analyses on the associations between KIF1B rs17401966 polymorphism and HCC [6, 7], and a meta-analysis on the associations between KIF1B rs17401966 polymorphism and HBV-related HCC [8], were published in the last 2 years. 	As new papers published in the last 5 years, we have performed a updated meta-analysis to assess the relationship of KIF1B rs17401966 polymorphism and HCC.

Although two meta-analyses on the associations between KIF1B rs17401966 polymorphism and hepatocellular carcinoma [6, 7] and one meta-analyses on the associations between KIF1B rs17401966 polymorphism and HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma have been reported in the last 5 years [8]. 	In 2013, Wang et al. performed a meta-analysis, with a total of 5 studies containing 13 cohorts with 5773 cases and 6404 controls, under the allele model (G vs. A), the co-dominant models (GG vs. AA; GG vs. AG and AG vs. AA), the dominant model (GG + AG vs. AA), and recessive model (GG vs. AG + AA), which suggests the presence of the G allele at rs17401966 of the KIF1B gene may decrease the risk for HCC [6]. In 2014, Zhang et al. performed a meta-analysis, with a total of 15 case-control studies with 7596 HCC cases and 9614 controls.

And a significant association between KIF1B rs17401966 and HCC risk was detected (OR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.72–0.91, P < 0.001) [7]. 
PMC5956920	rs775014444	Case study	RefSNP	False	The variant in FGG, NM_021870.2: c.554del; p. Lys185Argfs*14, is a novel truncating mutation predicted to remove the functional C-terminal region of the protein. 	The missense mutation in TBCD, NM_005993.4: c.1423G > A; p. Ala475Thr, is a known disease-causing mutation (ClinVar, RCV000335816.1; dbSNP, rs775014444). 	Sanger sequencing confirmed homozygosity of both the mutations; parents and unaffected sibling were carriers (Fig. 1g). DNA of the other affected siblings was unavailable for the analysis.Table 1Homozygous areas identified in the proband (Fig. 1a-II.4) and the position of candidate genes 
PMC4924204	rs3812316	Article	RefSNP	False	Later, Ortega-Azorìn and colleagues showed that individual genetic profile could also act synergistically with a dietary pattern in determining beneficial effects. 	In a sample from the PREDIMED trial they observed that a variant (rs3812316) in the MLXIPL gene encoding the carbohydrate response element binding protein and associated with lower serum TG, had cumulative beneficial effects when combined with high adherence to the MED diet [156]. 	Additionally, a dietary pattern was shown to influence the development of CVD also by inducing changes in the individual transcriptomic response of genes involved in cardiovascular risk. In a small subset of subjects from the PREDIMED trial, Castañer and colleagues performed an analysis of multiple genes’ expression profile and observed that MED diet either supplemented with olive oil or mixed nuts induced a variation in the transcriptomic response modulating 12 of the 18 signaling pathways analyzed [157]. 
PMC3290568	rs953696	Results	RefSNP	False	However, for region I, the 1.21±0.17 MY estimate fully agrees with both observed and expected TMRCA from human autosomal genes [34]. 	In addition, the age estimate of the E90 allele (0.24±0.07 MY) suggests a relatively recent arising of the SERPINB11 gene, near the time of origin of moderns humans and long after the appearance of P303, rs953696, and rs953694 alleles (0.88±0.44 MY). 	Nonetheless, when the TMRCA of the full-length SERPINB11 variant was calculated using the decay of haplotype sharing (DHS), a statistical method that exploits the breaking of haplotypes by recombination in succeeding generations, the estimated time of origin was 16,500 years ago, with a minimum estimate of 8,500 years. 
PMC3290568	rs4940595	Discussion	RefSNP	False	More importantly, a significant association can be established between SERPINB11 and a disease trait – as observed by Hancock and colleagues [36] for other SNPs strongly correlated with environmental variables. 	The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium study of patients with Crohn's disease detected a significant association with the X90E polymorphism (rs4940595; p-value 0.00063), as well as a 3% reduction in the frequency of the E90 variant [54]. 	Crohn's disease is a multifactorial inflammatory disease instigated and perpetuated by bacterial infections; it affects mainly ileum and cecum but may involve the entire gastrointestinal tract [55], [56]. Note that SERPINB11 expression has been detected in the respiratory and upper gastrointestinal tract (lung, trachea, pharynx, esophagus, and mouth) and several other organs connected to innate immune functions (tonsil and placenta), which differs greatly from the ubiquitous expression of mouse Serpinb11 [15].

PMC4615179	RF02344	Conclusion	Rfam	False	A comparative target analysis conducted to investigate this question could start from our compilation of cuckoo RNAs. 	Note added in revision: In the most recent release of Rfam, a RNA family model RF02344 has been added. 	Its members overlap with the ones of our cuckoo family. As is current practice in Rfam, the family RF02344 is described as a covariance model, which is inherently limited to a fixed consensus structure. 
PMC4615179	RF02344	Conclusion	Rfam	False	Its members overlap with the ones of our cuckoo family. 	As is current practice in Rfam, the family RF02344 is described as a covariance model, which is inherently limited to a fixed consensus structure. 	It assumes exactly 3 hairpins, and as a consequence, many family members of type HP2 and HP4 are wrongly annotated and some missing. This supports the use of a new, more flexible method (as presented herein) for model construction in the case of significant structural variation. 
PMC6306688	RRID:SCR_004074	Methods	RRID	False	The CatWalk is a system for a quantitative automated assessment of gait. 	It consists of an enclosed walkway, a camera, and recording and analysis software (Noldus/Tracksys Ltd, Nottingham, UK; RRID:SCR_004074). 	Dynamic gait parameters were analyzed on day 2 post-CCI. Each mouse was placed individually in the walkway, which consists of a glass plate (100 × 15 × 0.6 cm) surrounded by two black Plexiglas walls, spaced 8 cm apart. 
PMC6306688	RRID:SCR_014289	Methods	RRID	False	A 100-cm-diameter pool filled with opaque water at 23°C was placed inside a white tent, ensuring light uniformity, with four visible cues hung 10 cm from the pool walls and an 11-cm diameter Plexiglas resting platform submerged 0.5 cm below the water level. 	Swimming performance (e.g., path, distance, speed, and latency) was tracked using software (ANY-maze, Smart; Bioseb, Vitrolles, France; RRID:SCR_014289). 	A learning period of 5 consecutive days (days 13–17 post-injury) and a probe trial on day 6 (day 18 post-injury) were used. During the learning period, each mouse was subjected to four trials a day, in the pool divided into four virtual quadrants. 
PMC6306688	RRID:SCR_014198	Methods	RRID	False	A Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope was used for further characterization (ZENlite software; Zeiss, Cambridge, UK). 	Figures were prepared using Illustrator software (Adobe Illustrator CS6; Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA; RRID:SCR_014198). 	For quantification of microglia morphology, we measured cell size with ImageJ (ImageJ 1.50i; NIH), for a minimum of 20 cells per animal, and 5 animals per group. 
PMC6306688	RRID:AB_2314648	Methods	RRID	False		The primary antibody was removed and the blots were washed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)/Tween and incubated (1 h, room temperature) in horseradish-peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs, West Grove, PA; Cat# 323-005-021 Lot# RRID:AB_2314648).

Optical density was determined using ImageJ software (NIH, RRID:SCR_003070). 	All membranes were also incubated with a mouse polyclonal antibody for β-actin (1:4,000; Sigma-Aldrich; Cat# A5316 Lot# RRID:AB_476743). Protein level was expressed as relative optical density, that is, the optical density of the band revealed by the primary antibody, divided by the optical density of β-actin in the same lane. 
PMC6306688	RRID:SCR_002798	Methods	RRID	False		Statistical analyses were done out using GraphPad Prism software (version 5; RRID:SCR_002798; GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). 	Data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Groups were compared using one- or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by different post-hoc tests for multiple comparisons, and significance level set at p < 0.05. 
PMC6498775	RRID:AB_10618757	Methods	RRID	False	All antibodies were commercially purchased and used for immunochemistry or Western blotting. 	Antibodies against HO1 (RRID:AB_10618757) and HO2 (RRID:AB_11180908) were from Enzo Life Sciences Inc. 	
PMC6498775	RRID:AB_2134495	Methods	RRID	False		Antibodies against myelin basic protein (MBP, RRID:AB_92396), lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1, RRID:AB_2134495), p75 nerve growth factor receptor (p75, RRID:AB_2267254), and nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS1, RRID:AB_2152494) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). 	Anti-Ki67 (RRID:AB_302459) was from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Neurofilament (NF, RRID:AB_94275) and Alexa Fluor 488- and 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (488-, RRID:AB_141607; 594-, RRID:AB_2534105, 141637, 2535795) were from Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY, USA). 
PMC6498775	RRID:SCR_013672	Methods	RRID	False	The immunostained slides were analyzed using a laser confocal microscope (LSM710, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). 	For quantitative analysis, we used Zeiss ZEN digital imaging software (RRID:SCR_013672) accompanied by the LSM 710 microscopy set by same detector gain, amplifier offset, and amplifier gain under a constant laser power in every set of the experiments. 	The intensity was calculated in randomly selected five 300 × 300 μm2 areas from each section using 10 sections from one group which contains at least 3 rats. The quantification of the relative intensity was carried out by counting the relative number of the pixels showing each intensity unit. 
PMC6498775	RRID:SCR_014299	Methods	RRID	False	Blots were then blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with the appropriate antibodies (HRPs, RRID:AB_330924, 2099233). 	Blots were developed an enhanced chemiluminescence system (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) and band intensity was quantified from X-ray films using the scanner and analyzed with the luminescence image analysis system (RRID:SCR_014299; Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). 	
PMC6498775	RRID:SCR_002865	Methods	RRID	False	All statistical analyses were conducted on at least four independent experiments. 	All of the analyses (one-way ANOVA multiple comparison test) were performed using SPSS 21.0 software (RRID:SCR_002865; IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). 	Statistical details are reported in each result and figure legend. 
PMC4831416	RRID:SCR_002798	Methods	RRID	False		Data were analyzed in GraphPad Prism 6.05 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, RRID:SCR_002798). 	The diagrams shown are the summaries of all essays. Experiments were repeated as indicated. 
PMC6377397	RRID:SCR_006119	Methods	RRID	False	A user must, first, choose a target genome from a NanoPipe's list (see further) or upload their own target sequence. 	The next step is the essential part of the pipeline: mapping of sequencing reads to the target using version 946 of the LAST sequence aligner (LAST, RRID:SCR_006119). 	LAST accounts for the MinION-specific sequencing errors, thus it generates highly reliable results. It can determine the rates of insertion, deletion, and each kind of substitution in a type of data (e.g., MinION reads of AT-rich Plasmodium DNA) [23].

PMC6092487	RRID:AB_2636893	Methods	RRID	False	Membranes were blocked in TBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) containing 3% (wt/vol) BSA. 	Primary antibodies used to detect different proteins were the same described for immunoprecipitations and anti-CPT1C (RRID:AB_2636893, Sierra et al., 2008; Pozo et al., 2017). 	Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies diluted in blocking solution, were detected by using WesternBright ECL (Advansta) and exposed to light-sensitive film (Amersham Hyperfilm). 
PMC2817374	Q580H9	Results	UniProt	False	LmjF07.440 and LmjF07.430 Are Functional 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP Dehydratases in Yeast 	The L. major database (http://www.genedb.org/) contains two sequences with a high degree of similarity to T. brucei HTD2 (Q580H9_9TRYP) representing mitochondrial 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase (Figure 1). 	Both LmjF07.0440 and LmjF07.0430 are annotated in this database as maoc family dehydratase-like proteins with very high probability values for being identical to TbHTD2 (BlastP E-scores 1.6e-30 and 5.0e-29, resp.). To predict whether the two Leishmania proteins might reside in mitochondria, three separate algorithms were used to analyze their deduced amino acid sequences: MitoProt (MP), PSORT II (PS), and TargetP (TP). 
PMC2817374	Q580H9	Figure	UniProt	True	Active site residues of human mitochondrial dehydratase D62 and H67 are denoted (▾), whereas the hydratase 2 domain is underscored (∗). 	The sequences used for the Leishmania proteins throughout this work were retrieved from GeneDB of the Sanger Institute, whereas the accession number for TbHTD2 was Q580H9_9TRYP.

Mutant S. cerevisiae BY4741htd2Δ cells producing native mitochondrial Htd2p, peroxisomal catalase A Cta1p, or each of the mitochondrially targeted Leishmania proteins LmjF07.0440 and LmjF07.0430 were grown on SD-Ura medium selecting for plasmid presence, and following tenfold serial dilution (triangle), the cells were applied to the indicated solid media. 
PMC5013595	P38484	Methods	UniProt	False	Cloning, expression and purification of IFNγR2   	The gene encoding the extracellular part of IFNγR2 (residues 28–247 of UniProt entry P38484) was cloned into a Drosophila pMT-BiP-V5-His_A vector using BglII and AgeI restriction enzymes in frame with an N-terminal BiP signal peptide and a C-terminal 6×His tag. 	This expression vector was co-transfected into insect Schneider S2 cells along with the pCoBlast selection plasmid using Effectene Transfection Reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
PMC5013595	P38484	Results	UniProt	False	The overall structure of the extracellular portion of IFNγR2   	The structure of IFNγR2 was solved at 1.8 Å resolution and electron density was observed for amino-acid residues 28–240 of UniProt entry P38484, except for two two-residue loops. 	Data-collection and refinement parameters are shown in Table 1 ▸. The extracellular part of the IFNγR2 molecule consists of two domains (Fig. 2 ▸), the N-terminal D1 domain of UniProt residues 28–133 and the C-terminal D2 domain of residues 144–247. Both domains belong to the immuno­globulin fold with fibronectin type III topology, forming β-sandwiches (Pfam PF00041). 
PMC5630949	F5CPE6	Results	UniProt	False	One translated P. variabilis transcript shared proper sequence similarity with the snake venom TFT Toxin_1 domain region (Pfam ID: PF00087). 	This domain displays the closest similarity with the snake toxin sequence TFT MALT0070C (UniProt ID: F5CPE6) from the venom gland of Micrurus altirostris (Correa-Netto et al. 2011). 	The TFTs encompass a large family of toxic polypeptides from snake venom; these polypeptides are mainly monomeric and are characterized by the archetypical three β-strand loops constrained by four disulfide bonds, spatially resembling fingers protruding from a core. Despite minor but critical structural variations, TFTs evolved to produce an array of pharmacological activities and targets, such as neurotoxins (α-neurotoxins, β-cardiotoxins, muscarinic toxins, and Ca2+-channel blockers), acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, cytotoxins (cardiotoxins), platelet aggregation inhibitors, coagulation factor inhibitors, heparin binders, and K+-channel, and integral-receptor ligands (Kini and Doley 2010; Kini 2011; Utkin 2013). 
PMC4360730	P01137	Conclusion	UniProt	False	Therefore, we will need to expand the ontologies that are used to appropriately capture these details in the metadata. 	For example, the Protein Ontology (PRO, http://pir.georgetown.edu/pro/pro.shtml) details proteins, their various modifications and relevant taxon information [e.g. transforming growth factor beta-1 (human)—PR:P01137] (24). 	Terms from PRO can be used to annotate biosample treatments that use protein reagents. With each new assay and analysis method comes new file formats. 
PMC6174280	P56556	Article	UniProt	False	The encoded polypeptide is predicted to harbor 34 alternative amino acids at the C terminus, extending the polypeptide by 17 residues and affecting the tertiary structure of the mature protein and thus possibly resulting in proteolytic degradation. 	It is noteworthy that NDUFA6 has three reported functional isoforms in UniProt: the first (UniProt: P56556) represents the longest isoform with 154 residues (GenBank: NM_002490.4; Ensembl: ENST00000498737.6), the second (UniProt: A0A0C4DGSO) has 128 residues (Ensembl: ENST00000602404.5), and the third (UniProt: R4GN43) has 71 residues (Ensembl: ENST00000470753.1). 	All isoforms occur in frame and use alternative methionine residues for translation initiation (Figure 2C). Until now, no consensus on the clinically relevant transcripts has been reached, but Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data and in-house RNA-seq data19 support ENST00000602404.5 as the predominant isoform, and RNA expression data specifically correlate with the 5′ UTR of ENST00000602404.5 (Figure S2). 
PMC6174280	P56556	Article	UniProt	False	Although the fibroblast cell line from subject 3 also demonstrated normal complex I activity (data not shown), a clear growth defect was demonstrated when glucose-rich culture medium was replaced with galactose-rich (and glucose-free) medium, forcing the cells to be dependent upon oxidative phosphorylation for ATP production (Figure S6). 	The existence of the longer NDUFA6 isoform (UniProt: P56556) could explain the normal complex I activity reported for subject 3, whose variant would instead act as a homozygous missense variant in the encoding transcript (c.81G>A [p.Met27Ile]). In silico predictions suggest that the c.81G>A (p.Met27Ile) variant might be tolerated (Align-GVGD = C0, Grantham distance = 10.12, SIFT = 0.070 [tolerated], PolyPhen = 0.702 [possibly damaging], CADD = 34). 	The CADD score discordance is most likely due to the consideration of alternative transcripts in the prediction and is therefore exacerbated by the pathogenicity associated with the initiation methionine in the alternative transcript. Attempts to assess whether an alternative methionine was selected for translation initiation in vivo have been unsuccessful; analysis of tryptic fragments of subject proteins produced during complexome profiling was uninformative, and commercially available antibodies have failed to conjugate successfully with the target protein in subject and control tissues (data not shown). 
PMC6219538	P0ADT8	Results	UniProt	False	Similarly, mCherry-YgiM(TA) was not detectable at mitochondria (Fig. 1d), even upon deletion of Msp1p (Supplementary Fig. S1), which extracts peroxisomal tail-anchored proteins mistargeted to mitochondria27,28.Figure 1The predicted tail anchor of Escherichia coli YgiM localizes to peroxisomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

A MUC5B (UniProtKB accession number Q9HC84) COOH-terminal construct was created consisting of D4-B-C-CK (CT5B; residues 4955 and 5762; Fig. 2A) (4). 	The recombinant protein was expressed with an NH2-terminal His6 tag using the mammalian episomal expression vector pCEP-His in 293-EBNA (19). Conditioned medium was collected from stably transfected 293-EBNA cells and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

PMC5648524	P11137	Methods	UniProt	False	The immunohistochemistry procedure was the same as that described previously (Forsberg et al., 2016). 	The primary antibodies used were mouse anti-microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2; Invitrogen, cat. no. P11137), rabbit anti-neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA, cat no. S8305), mouse anti-GFAP (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA, cat no. MAB360), rabbit anti-S100β (Millipore; cat. no. 04–1054), rabbit anti-Iba1 (Wako, Japan; cat. no. 019–19741) and goat anti-GFP (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom; cat. no. Ab6673). 	The secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor Plus 555 goat anti-mouse IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA; cat. no. A32737), Alexa Fluor Plus 555 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA; cat. no.

A11055). In negative control tissue, incubated in the absence of primary antibodies, no stained cells were found. 
PMC5648524	P11137	Methods	UniProt	False	Sections were postfixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, rinsed in PBS, and blocked and permeabilized in 5% donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA), 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 45 min. 	The permeabilized sections were then incubated overnight with the primary antibody (anti-microtubule associated protein 2; MAP2; Invitrogen, cat. no. P11137 and mouse anti-GFAP; Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA, cat no. MAB360) in a moist chamber. 	The following day, the sections were washed in PBS and then incubated for 1.5 hr with the secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Flour 546 (1:400; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). After subsequent washing with PBS, the sections were mounted in ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI. 
PMC6509187	F1SKJ1	Results	UniProt	False	Next, we explored how NMHC-IIA interacted with DAP12. 	On one hand, NMHC-IIA was divided into three fragments from N to C terminus, denominated IIA-A (residues 1 to 742; the numbering is according to UniProt entry F1SKJ1), containing myosin N-terminal SRC homology 3 domain (SH3)-like domain and actin-binding domain; IIA-B (residues 743 to 1560), containing the coiled-coil rod domain; and IIA-C (residues 1561 to 1957), with the nonhelical tail. 	Glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown assays showed that IIA-B was responsible for the interaction with DAP12 (Fig. 2F). IP assay further indicated that the interaction was independent of D50 and the five Y’s in DAP12 (Fig. S7A). 
PMC6509187	Q9TU45	Results	UniProt	False	Pulldown assays determined that both ΔICD and ΔECD bound to IIA-B, suggesting that the DAP12 TMD might be the binding region (Fig. 2G and Fig. S7B). 	Furthermore, a short stretch (residues 51 to 57; the numbering is according to UniProt entry Q9TU45) within the DAP12 TMD was proven to be indispensable for the interaction (Fig. S7C and D). 	Interaction of DAP12 with NMHC-IIA depends on its TMD. (A) The association of NMHC-IIA with DAP12 is not required with D50 and Y’s of DAP12. 
PMC6468893	Q7YT83	Results	UniProt	False	Due to this important C-terminal difference between insect and arachnid CRISPs, we generally propose to name such peptides, identified in arachnid venoms, CRISPs rather than venom allergens. 	In the venom of cone snails, comparable cysteine-rich proteins exhibiting the CAP domain were also identified: Tex31 ([Q7YT83], Conus textile, 31.5 kDa) a calcium-dependent substrate specific protease, MR30 ([A1BQQ5], Conus marmoreus, 30.1 kDa), and GlaCrisp [DQ647193.1]. 	So far, the substrate-specific proteolytic activity of Tex31 [47] could not be verified in further studies [48,49]. More recently, functional studies of antigen-5/CAP family members, identified in the salivary glands of blood-sucking insects, revealed that these proteins are Cu2+-dependent antioxidant enzymes involved in the removal of radical superoxide and inhibit platelet aggregation by collagen and neutrophil oxidative burst [50]. 
PMC6468893	B5M6G6	Results	UniProt	False	The identification of these domains points to a possible role as a protease inhibitor because the thyroglobulin type-1 domains belong to MEROPS protease inhibitor familyI31 (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk). 	MSA with other spiders shows an identity of 76.8% with a protein from V. fasciatus and of 49.7% with a protein from the mygalomorph spider Haplopelma schmidti (tr_B5M6G6). 	Lower identities of 28.5% and 33.3% were obtained by MSA with the ctenid P. nigriventer and the theridiid Latrodectus hesperus (Supplementary Figure S1.16). TT1LPs have been detected in the venom and salivary gland transcriptomes of arachnids, and seem to be a fixed constituent of the venomous cocktail of spiders, scorpions [71], pseudoscorpions [65], and blood-sucking ticks [72].

PMC6319964	Q05320	Methods	UniProt	False	Shotgun Mutagenesis epitope mapping (Davidson and Doranz, 2014) on EBOV-GP was performed as described previously (Davidson et al., 2015). 	Briefly, alanine scanning mutagenesis was carried out on an expression construct for EBOV-GP (strain Mayinga-76; UniProt accession # Q05320) lacking the mucin-like domain (residues 311–461). 	Residues 33–310 and 462–676 of the EBOV delta (D) mucin GP were mutagenized to create a library of clones, each with an individual point mutant. Residues were changed to alanine, with alanine residues changed to serine. 
PMC4657206	Q91XV3	Results	UniProt	False	The fact that this technique was successfully applied to study the mouse brain proteome is exemplified by the mass spectrometric identification of 2 well-established brain proteins, BASP-1 and SNP-25. 	The growth-associated brain acid soluble protein BASP-1 (Q91XV3; also known as neuronal axonal membrane protein NAP-22) is a membrane-attached signalling protein of growth cones that form the tips of elongating axons [55]. 	Its sequence was covered in the wild type brain by 16 unique peptides with 87 % coverage and in the mdx-4cv brain by 17 unique peptides with 87 % coverage. The synaptosome-associated protein SNP-25 (P60879) is associated with proteins involved in vesicle docking and membrane fusion and plays a critical role in synaptic function and the molecular regulation of neurotransmitter release [56]. 
PMC4657206	P60879	Results	UniProt	False	Its sequence was covered in the wild type brain by 16 unique peptides with 87 % coverage and in the mdx-4cv brain by 17 unique peptides with 87 % coverage. 	The synaptosome-associated protein SNP-25 (P60879) is associated with proteins involved in vesicle docking and membrane fusion and plays a critical role in synaptic function and the molecular regulation of neurotransmitter release [56]. 	SNP-25 was covered in the wild type brain by 13 unique peptides with 47 % coverage and in the mdx-4cv brain by 11 unique peptides with 46 % coverage. In contrast to gel-based studies, the usage of liquid chromatography in combination with highly sensitive label-free mass spectrometry identified both extremely large proteins and highly hydrophobic integral membrane proteins. 
PMC4657206	Q9QXS1	Results	UniProt	False	These types of brain proteins are usually underrepresented in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. 	For example, the sequence of the 500-kDa intermediate filament-binding protein plectin (Q9QXS1) [57] was covered in the wild type brain by 18 unique peptides with approximately 5 % coverage and in the mdx-4cv brain by 17 unique peptides with approximately 4 % coverage. 	Remarkably, the five main subunits of the plasmalemmal Na+/K+-ATPase [58] were all identified in brain extracts. The alpha-1 (Q8VDN2), alpha-2 (Q6PIE5), alpha-3 (Q6PIC6), beta-1 (P14094) and beta-2 (P14231) subunits were covered in the wild type brain by 13, 17, 20, 9 and 4 unique peptides with 20, 21, 27, 19 and 10 % coverage, respectively. 
PMC3987133	Q41048	Methods	UniProt	False	All Cys variants of cpTatC were made by QuikChange mutagenesis with, as template, pre-cpTatCaaa (with or without the C-terminal His tag), a variant of pre-cpTatC with all natural Cys residues substituted by alanine (Ma and Cline, 2013). 	The tOE17-20F substrate protein is a modified form of the OE17 precursor protein from maize (GenBank accession no. Q41048), which lacks the chloroplast transit peptide and several nonessential residues of the thylakoid-targeting signal peptide. 	It also contains a phenylalanine at the twin-arginine (RR) +2 position, resulting in higher affinity binding (Ma and Cline, 2000; Gérard and Cline, 2007). The clone for tOE17-20F (Gérard and Cline, 2007) was used as template to prepare by QuikChange single and double Cys-substituted substrates as well as truncated substrate proteins SpF8 through SpF29, where the number after the SpF refers to the number of mature domain residues after the signal peptide. 
PMC6291300	P55899	Results	UniProt	False	Rozanolixizumab had only very weak binding to mouse and rat FcRn at pH 6.0 (KD three orders of magnitude weaker), and showed no detectable binding to rabbit FcRn (Table 1). 	In support of these binding data, analysis of the sequence alignment of the FcRn α-chains of human, cynomolgus monkey, rat, mouse and rabbit FcRn showed sequence variability in the region of the 1519.g57 binding epitope (data not shown; Swiss Prot: P55899, Q8SPV9, P13599, Q61559, A9Z0W1, respectively). 	Thus, while cynomolgus monkey was potentially equivalent to human for reproducing the intended in vivo pharmacological effect of 1519.g57 antibodies, wild-type murine and rabbit species were not suitable. Lack of 1519.g57 IgG1 binding to human β2m and lack of inhibition of human albumin binding to human FcRn by 1519.g57 IgG1 was confirmed by SPR analysis (Supplementary Table 2), and was consistent with screening and epitope-mapping results.

The FcRn ECD was purified by affinity chromatography on IgG (CnBr-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow; GE Healthcare, UK), binding at pH 5.8 and eluting at pH 8.67,68 Rabbit, mouse and rat FcRn ECD were expressed, each with the homologous β2m, in proprietary Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) SXE69 cells and protein purified.

PMC3350626	P06685	Methods	UniProt	False	Three-dimensional structure of ATNA_CAVPO was iteratively modeled with the non-redundant PDB database by CPHmodels 3.0 [109]. 	This program aligned the query amino acid sequences with a segment of the rat Na+/K+-ATPase (AT1A1_RAT: P06685), employed as template, whose partial crystalline structure had been previously determined in the E2-P conformation [69]. 	A lateral view of the protein is shown, showing P-type ATPase structural domains, active site and some relevant amino acid residues (Glu-322, Ile-724, and Asp-754).

PMC4309245	A3DRP0	Introduction	UniProt	False	It is dominated by the globular head domain, which includes the sialic acid binding site 130–230 and a number of glycosylation sites, which have increased since 1918 [9]. 	Uniprot lists nine glycosylation sites in A3DRP0, Memphis/10/1996 HA1 (27, 28, 40, 71, 104, 142, 177, 286, and 304) and only one on HA2 (498). 	Glycan microarray analysis has revealed glycosylation differences between either remote H1N1 strains (1918, modern) at a few sites [10] or differences between H1N1 and other subfamilies such as H5N1 [11]. The multiple glycosylation sites apparently contribute mainly to the HA agglutination function, as will be seen below. 
PMC3432061	Q02083	Methods	UniProt	False		The sequence for human NAAA was taken from the SWISS-PROT protein sequence database (amino acids 126–359 primary accession number Q02083). 	The homology model of hNAAA was constructed using the crystal structure of conjugated bile acid hydrolase (CBAH) from Clostridium Perfringens (PDB ID: 2BJF) [15] as a template in Prime (1.6 ed., Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY). An initial BLAST alignment between the two sequences was adjusted by taking secondary structure into account using SSpro and PSIPRED [26].

The homology models were created using the DockoMatic 2.1 and MODELLER packages [65]. The α3β2-nAChR subunit dimer consisting of only the extracellular domains, although nAChRs exist naturally as a pentameric transmembrane protein complexes [27].

PMC2731242	Q8I599	Results	UniProt	False	This central domain contains the catalytic domain of the SCD [13], comprising the three Histidine-Boxes designated region Ia, Ib and II (Fig. 1). 	All eight conserved His residues are essential for stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity, as mutations of any of these residues abrogate enzymatic activity [13]. Δ9-desaturase activity requires two co-acting enzymes, the cytochrome b5 and NADPH cytochrome b5-reductase [30] that were also found to be present in the P. falciparum genome (accession numbers Q8I599 and Q8ID33, respectively). 	The cytochrome b5 reductase provides cytochrome b5 with electrons and protons extracted from NADPH. These attach to HisBox of SCD through two iron atoms and attaches two protons and two electrons to the fatty acyl-CoAs [31].

PMC4481277	H3HA10	Methods	UniProt	False	Protein expression and purification 	The E. coli codon-optimized gene sequence of our designed construct H3HA10 was synthesized with a stop codon at the 3’ end (GenScript, USA). 	The gene was cloned into the expression vector pET-28a (+) (Novagen) in-frame with the N-terminal His-tag between the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. The E. coli codon-optimized gene sequences encoding IZ and foldon were individually synthesized (Abexome, India) with KpnI and HindIII restriction sites at the 5’ and 3’ ends respectively. 
PMC4481277	H3HA10	Methods	UniProt	False	The designed proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. 	H3HA10, H3HA10-IZ, and H3HA10-Foldon were all purified using a similar protocol from the soluble fraction of the cell culture lysate. 	Briefly, a single transformed colony of E. coli BL21(DE3) cells was inoculated into 50 ml of Luria-Bertani broth (HiMedia). The primary culture (50 ml) was grown overnight until saturation at 37°C. 
PMC4481277	H3HA10	Methods	UniProt	False	Antibody binding studies using surface plasmon resonance 	Binding affinity of the purified proteins (H3HA10, H3HA10-IZ, and H3HA10-Foldon) and full-length recombinant HAs (rHAs) (H3N2 A/Aichi/2/68 and H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/34) (Sino Biological Inc., Beijing, China) to the single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of the stem-directed bnAb FI6v3 was determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments performed with a Biacore2000 optical biosensor (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden) at 25°C. 	Recombinant FI6v3-scFv was produced as described previously (32). Amine coupling chemistry was used to immobilize 750 response units (RU) of the ligand (FI6v3-scFv) to the surface of a CM5 chip (GE HealthCare, Uppsala, Sweden). 
PMC4481277	H3HA10	Results	UniProt	False	We analyzed the interaction network within H3 HA [H3N2 A/Hong Kong/1/68, PDB ID: 1HGD (38)] using PREDBURASA, as described previously (46), to identify HA stem fragments defined by stable structural breakpoints. 	During HA protein minimization, we performed iterative calculations to identify residue fragments: 191-461, 2901-3211, and 442-1132 (included in H3HA10) within the stem domain having minimalistic interactions with the rest of HA (Figure 1B). 	Residues from HA1 and HA2 subunits are distinguished by subscripts 1 or 2 respectively. The termini of HA stem-fragments in H3HA10 also had optimal Cα-Cα distances for “molecular stitching” as indicated in Figure 1B from our analysis of the Cα-Cα distance matrix of H3 HA.

All the designed proteins were purified from the soluble fraction of E. coli cell culture lysate. H3HA10 was partially degraded upon purification. 
PMC4481277	H3HA10	Methods	UniProt	True	The shoulder of the elution peak corresponds to H3HA10ΔCt. 	H3HA10-IZ and H3HA10-Foldon predominantly elute as a homogenous oligomer (probably trimer) and do not form higher order aggregates. (B) The column was calibrated using a broad range of molecular weight markers (x). 	The elution volume(s) of the designed protein(s) corresponding to A220 signal maxima were plotted [open circles (∘)] on the calibration curve to estimate the molecular weights. 
PMC4481277	H3HA10	Methods	UniProt	False	Accordingly, the oligomeric derivatives of H3HA10 had considerably tighter binding to FI6v3-scFv. 	H3HA10-IZ and H3HA10-Foldon had an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 89.5 ± 3.2 and 114.3 ± 6.8 nM, respectively (Table 1; Figures S2 in Supplementary Material). 	Characterization of antigen-specific antibody response All the designed HA stem-fragment proteins were highly immunogenic in mice and elicited a robust antibody response with self-titers ≥1 × 106. 
PMC5104453	P38605	Results	UniProt	False	The search for LdCAS conserved domains returned one hit, the squalene cyclase (SQCY) domain subgroup 1 (NCBI CDDS ID: cd02892), which has an alpha 6 –alpha 6 barrel fold and belongs to the Isopren C2 like superfamily (NCBI CDDS ID: cl08267). 	Further, using the CAS1 from A. thaliana (UniProtKB ID: P38605), we were able to identify all five farnesyltransferase B subunit (PFTB) repeats in LdCAS. 	The mutagenesis sites, where the change of residues leads to the production of distinct compounds, and the active sites of AtCAS1 and LdCAS were all the same, suggesting that our LdCAS is indeed a cycloartenol synthase, as AtCAS1 is the cycloartenol synthase from A. thaliana, previously isolated and characterized [29]. A phylogenetic tree using the amino acid sequences from putative OSCs from other species formed seven major groups (Fig 1).

PMC5963842	P63162	Introduction	UniProt	False	Of particular interest in the context of SMA pathology is SNRPN (this protein is also known as SmN, denoted with a lowercase ‘m’), which is expressed in neural tissues (Schmauss et al., 1992) and can replace SNRPB in the heptameric Sm protein ring (Huntriss et al., 1993). 	The human SNRPN protein differs from SNRPB′ by 17 amino acids (UniProt identifiers P63162 and P14678, respectively), and little is known about its behaviour other than its incorporation into snRNPs, although the SNRPN gene locus is within the paternally imprinted region of the genome critical in Prader–Willi syndrome (Özçelik et al., 1992). 	There is growing appreciation that some Sm proteins may ‘moonlight’ in functions beyond their presence in splicing snRNPs. In addition to the role of SNRPB in cytoplasmic trafficking vesicles in human cells, in Drosophila the homologues of SNRPB and SNRPD3 are implicated in mRNA localisation (Gonsalvez et al., 2010) and SNRPD1 has a role in micro (mi)RNA biogenesis (Xiong et al., 2015). 
PMC5963842	P63162	Results	UniProt	False	Differences in amino acid sequence are in red. 	Sequences are from Uniprot [entries P63162 (SNRPN) and P14678-2 (SNRPB)]. 	(D) NCDN was identified in the interactome of YFP–SNRPN, with five unique peptide hits encompassing 9% sequence coverage. Each Ion score (Mascot Ion Score) was above the threshold for peptide identity (Mascot Identity Score), with two out of the five identified peptides having a score of above double the threshold score. 
PMC5963842	Q96RS0	Discussion	UniProt	False	SNRPN has a proline-rich C-terminal tail that SNRPB lacks, although a similar sequence is present in SNRPB′ (Mourao et al., 2016), an alternatively spliced product of the SNRPB gene. 	Several proteins were identified in the SNRPN interactome but not the SNRPB interactome, such as nuclear receptor co-activator 6 interacting protein (UniProt Q96RS0), and 7SK snRNA methylphosphate capping enzyme (UniProt Q7L2J0), both of which are associated with snRNA capping (Hausmann et al., 2008; Jeronimo et al., 2007). 	Additionally, RNA-binding protein 40 (UniProt Q96LT9) was uniquely identified within the SNRPN interactome, and is involved in the minor spliceosome (Benecke et al., 2005). This suggests that some of these proteins may interact preferentially with SNRPN, perhaps mediated by amino acid changes within the proline-rich tail.

PMC5049672	Q92400	Methods	UniProt	False	TeCel7A variants were generated in yeast expression vector pCu424 (Labbé and Thiele, 1999). 	Because TeCel7A does not naturally contain a carbohydrate binding module (CBM), the CBM from Agaricus bisporus (Uniprot accession number: Q92400) was appended to the catalytic domain using a short, flexible linker from Acremonium thermophilum (Uniprot accession number: A7WNT9) as described previously (Dana et al., 2012). 	Inclusion of the native signal sequence allowed for secreted enzyme expression and enabled the mature form of the protein to carry the proper N‐terminal pyroglutamate following signal sequence cleavage (Dana et al., 2014).

PMC6310946	B4FQP4	Discussion	UniProt	False	As previous research shows, decreasing the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis rate can significantly lower plant resistance [58, 59]. 	In our study, we identified three proteins (B4FQP4, K7VC35, and Q6VWJ0) related to the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic process, which abundances were decreased with S2 treatment. 	Besides, we also found that a series of proteins (A0A096RTN1, A0A096T686, A0A0B4J3G7, B4FA32, B4FR89, B6SIF0, B6SQM0, C0HGH7, K7VC35, K7VH58, and P33679) involved with the defence categories were down-accumulated with S2 treatment. Similar results have been reported in rice that received a stress [60].

Similar results have been reported in rice that received a stress [60]. Moreover, a series of proteins that play roles in plant defences were identified in S4 treatment. 
PMC6310946	A8IK79	Discussion	UniProt	False	Asr proteins function in response to abiotic stresses in plants [67–71]. 	Therefore, the down-regulation of Asr protein (A8IK79) in ear leaves with S4 treatment indicated that removing four leaves weakened the tolerance of maize to abiotic stress. 	Zeamatin was first identified in corn seeds with high amino acid homology to PR-5 proteins. Besides, it has potent antifungal activity against a number of plant pathogens [72]. 
PMC6092840	F6YV64	Results	UniProt	False	Based on RNA-seq data, a missense variant ((SH3RF2:c.796 T > C:(p.Ser266Pro)) affecting a conserved residue was detected.. 	Equine SH3RF2 (UniProtKB - F6YV64) contains 4 domains: one RING-type domain and three SH3 (src Homology-3) domains that are responsible for protein-protein interactions in signal transduction pathways [23]. 	The p.Ser266Pro substitutionis localized in the gene region encoding the protein fragment between the second and third SH3 domain (253 to 382 amino acids). Genesilico Metasever [24] based protein comparisons showed that the SH3RF2:c.796 T > C variant possibly affect protein structure and function. 
PMC3990513	P25929	Methods	UniProt	False		The sequence of the hY1 receptor (Swiss-Prot accession number: P25929) was aligned with a multiple sequence alignment of all the inactive-like GPCRs of known structure using the GPCR-ModSim (http://gpcr.usc.es) web-server [39]. 	The human C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (hCXCR4) was considered the best template for modeling of the hY1 receptor because it is a peptide binding GPCR with high homology to hY1 in the C-terminal part of extracellular loop 2. This loop segment (Cys5.25-Ser5.31 in hY1) constitutes part of the orthosteric binding cavity wall and is often involved in ligand binding. 
PMC5331984	P31041	Methods	UniProt	False	mPEG PV1-Fab’ (PV1) was provided by Dr. Bernard Vanhove (INSERM U1064, Nantes, France).Briefly, PV1 has been produced by conjugating a 40KDa polyethylene glycol moiety (Sunbright GL2-400MA; NOF Corporation, Japan) to Fab’ fragments obtained from the PV-1 antibody (ATCC HB 11944). 	ATCC HB 11944 is a hamster monoclonal antibody reacting against mouse CD28 (P31041; Mouse Cd28.), and not against other molecules, such as CTLA-4 (http://web.expasy.org/cellosaurus/CVCL_8970). 	Induction of EAU and anti-CD28 treatment B10.RIII mice (n = 5–10/group), male and female at 4 to 6 weeks-old, were immunized subcutaneously at the flanks with 50 μg/animal of 161–180 IRBP peptide emulsified in 200μL of complete Freund’s adjuvant (v/v) [8]. 
PMC4156330	P04626	Methods	UniProt	False	Data collection and protein BLAST (basic local alignment search tool) 	The human HER2 amino acid sequence with accession number P04626 was compared to the UNIPROT database using BLAST via the web service (http://www.uniprot.org/) with default setting. 	Structural conserved motifs scanning in PROSITE database According to the domain organization of the ErbB family, the extracellular domain region of HER2 has ∼620 residues [25]. 
PMC6458243	P20432	Discussion	UniProt	False	In order to improve the credibility of data sets, the integration of multi-omic approaches has been applied in many fields (Dittmer et al., 2012). 	Based on the differential expression of target proteins/genes, we found four common up-regulated proteins/genes, i.e., GST (P20432), larval serum protein (Q24388), FKBP12 (P48375), and FoxO (B4G4S8). 	FKBP12 (Figure 4A) inhibits the activity of the TOR protein (Somarelli and Herrera, 2007). TOR is an atypical serine/threonine kinase in the phosphatidylinositol kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family and a major regulator of growth in eukaryotes (Zoncu et al., 2010). 
PMC6458243	Q9VFE4	Discussion	UniProt	False	In Aedes albopictus, FoxO may be involved with increasing the transcript levels of genes related to fatty acid synthesis, as observed in early diapause females (Poelchau et al., 2011). 	In addition, we identified six common down-regulated proteins/genes comprising 40S ribosomal protein (Q9VFE4), JHAMT (Q9VJK8), YP1 (P06607), YP2 (P02843), YP3 (P02844), and NADH (Q9V4E0) (Supplementary Table S2). 	JHAMT (Figure 4C) is the ultimate enzyme in the JH biosynthetic pathway, and it is considered to be critical for regulating JH synthesis (Shinoda and Itoyama, 2003). JH regulates many physiological processes in insects, such as diapause (Denlinger and Tanaka, 1989). 
PMC6350856	B2IV87	Methods	UniProt	False	To confirm the presence of diazotrophic microorganisms in the sub-community co-cultures, we searched for the NifH protein sequence, an enzyme involved in nitrogen fixation and relevant in symbiotic relationships (Warshan et al 2018). 	We used the NifH protein from N.punctiforme PCC 73102 (B2IV87), Bradyrhizobium japonicum OX = 375 (I4DDG5), and Mesorhizobium japonicum LMG 29417 (Q98AP7) from the NCBI databases (July 2018), as query sequences to perform standard protein BLAST searches with the default parameters. 	
PMC4443022	P14867	Methods	UniProt	False	The 2.97 Å crystal structure of the GABA β3 homopentamer (Miller and Aricescu, 2014) was used as basis for homology modeling. 	We carried out a sequence alignment of the α1 sequence (Uniprot entry P14867, The UniProt Consortium, 2013) and the β3 subunit sequences from the crystal structure with MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004; default settings). 	The resulting alignment showed 35.3% sequence identity and 61.9% sequence similarity and is included in the Supplementary Material. As we know from GPCR modeling, an identity >35% is a good basis for homology modeling of transmembrane proteins (Wolf et al., 2008; Kufareva et al., 2011).
