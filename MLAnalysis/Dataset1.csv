PMC1940057	AM282973	Results	ENA	False	Use	This identity can be explained by the high-stringency PCR conditions and the low degree of degeneration of the two used primers. 	Frame analysis of the nucleotide sequence (696 bp, accession no. AM282973) revealed the presence of a unique internal open reading frame. 	The alignment of the corresponding amino acid sequence (aa) with all available protein sequences using the Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST program [24] showed as expected important aa identities with different NRPS adenylation domains. This identity reaches 50% and 48% with the adenylation domains of the pristinamycin I (PI) synthetase 2, and actinomycin (ACM) synthetase III, respectively (Figure 1). 
PMC2154357	1BL8	Methods	PDBe	False	Background	All values are reported in Table I together with previous results on KcsA (Bernèche and Roux, 2001; Noskov et al., 2004). 	We estimate that the accuracy and overall significance of the calculated free energies is roughly on the order of 1 kcal/mol, based on the difference between the computations with 1K4C (Noskov et al., 2004) and 1BL8 (Bernèche and Roux, 2001) and the comparison between the CHARMM PARAM27 and AMBER force fields. 	For the simulations with the AMBER force field, the systems were reequilibriated for 1.5 ns before starting the free energy computations. The hydration number of K+ and Na+ in the various binding sites were computed from the average of 800 ps of MD for each configuration; statistical error was estimated by comparing block averages. 
PMC2216687	Q9XVV3	Results	UniProt	False	Background	We first explored this concept for PPI pairs from different species and have observed evidence of this conservation of function between the PPI pairs. 	For example, in C. elegans, nhr-67 [Swiss-Prot: Q9XVV3] and daf-21 [Swiss-Prot: Q18688] have been shown to interact [27], whereas in human ESR1 [Swiss-Prot: P03372] and HSP90AA1 [Swiss-Prot: P07900] are also known to interact [28]. 	Both PPI pairs contain a common domain interaction pattern, (PF00105)-(PF02518, PF00183), where ‘-’ denotes interaction and the parentheses denote modular domains. PF00105 is described by Pfam [29] as the zinc finger, C4 type domain, and PF02518 and PF00183 refer to HATPase_c and HSP90 domains, respectively.

For split-inteins structural models we used the I-Tasser server (36) for initial alignment and model creation. Sequences were submitted fused, and the resulting models were subsequently separated, by removing N-terminal Methionine of the C-terminal part of the split-intein.

PMC2677866	1ZD7	Results	PDBe	False	Background	To further examine the sequence-to-function features of the new split-inteins, five full-length split-intein pairs were selected from different loci (gp41-1, gp41-8, IMPDH-1, NrdA-2 and NrdJ-1) for a structural analysis. 	The N- and C-terminal sequence parts of the each split-intein were joined to form a contiguous intein, and the overall structure of each intein was modeled based on the available crystal structure of a joined DnaE split-intein (PDB code: 1ZD7). 	All five split-inteins fit the intein structure without major clashes, despite their sequence variations. We previously suggested that the charge distribution along the two long anti-parallel beta-strands of the associated split-inteins molecule has an important role in the electrostatic interaction between the two split-intein parts (17).

Patients homozygous for this variant exhibited a 5.96-fold increased risk (95% CI:1.33–18.57) of pneumonitis.

The increased risk for carrying three unfavorable genotypes was 13.30-fold compared to patients with 0 to 2 risk genotypes (P = 0.013). 	This risk was dramatically increased for the group of patients with four or more unfavorable genotypes (P<0.0001). These high risk individuals also had a shorter duration between start of treatment and development of pneumonitis of only 5.33 months compared to over 12 months for those with 0 to 2 unfavorable genotypes ( Figure 1B ).

PMC2928273	rs4073	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Background	IL1A:rs17561 is a non-synonymous SNP and increases processing of the IL1-α precursor resulting in an increase in the levels of active IL1-α [29]. 	The variant of IL8:rs4073, which was found to increase pneumonitis risk 3-fold, has been associated with increased secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine IL8 [30]. 	IL4 and IL13 work together to regulate the inflammatory response. Four genetic variants in these two genes were associated with ∼3-fold increased risk of pneumonitis. 
PMC2928273	rs1061622	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Background	Some studies have shown an increase in TNF-α production [35], [36], [37], while others have shown the opposite effect [38], [39], [40]. 	For TNFRSF1B, the non-synonymous variant Met196Arg (rs1061622) does not alter TNF-α binding affinity, but results in intensified TNF-α signaling [41] and decreased NF-kB signaling [42]. 	Only one genetic variant was found to confer a protective effect following radiotherapy. This variant, rs1799983, in NOS3 was associated with a 70% reduction in risk of pneumonitis.

PMC3044699	106210	Introduction	OMIM	False	Background		Aniridia (AN; OMIM 106210) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by the complete or partial absence of the iris. 	The incidence of AN in the general population is about 1 in 64,000 to 96,000 [1]. Vision is usually impaired by other ocular abnormalities such as corneal opacification, cataract, glaucoma, fovea and optic nerve hypoplasia, and nystagmus [1]. 
PMC3044699	194072	Introduction	OMIM	False	Background	A small numbers of aniridia cases can be due to large chromosomal deletions or rearrangements [2,8]. 	Aniridia generally occurs in isolation or accompanied by other ocular malformations, but it occurs, more rarely, as part of the WAGR (Wilms’ tumor, aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities, and mental retardation) syndrome (OMIM 194072) [9]. 	WAGR is usually caused by deletions of chromosome 11p13, which include PAX6 and WT1 (Wilms tumor 1) [9]. As large deletions could not be identified by the routine PCR-sequencing mutation detection method, only a few isolated aniridia patients with the large deletions in the PAX6 region have been documented and the most of them are sporadic cases [2,8-18].

The corresponding scFv structure has not been attainable experimentally due to high aggregation tendency of the scFv in crystallization conditions.

PMC3400600	rs6552828	Abstract	RefSNP	False	Use	The odds ratio (95%CI) for an elite endurance Chinese athlete to carry the G allele compared with ethnically matched controls was 1.381 (1.015–1.880) (P-value = 0.04). 	Our findings suggest that the ACSL1 gene polymorphism rs6552828 is not associated with elite endurance athletic status in Caucasians, yet a marginal association seems to exist for the Chinese (Han) male population. 	
PMC3400600	rs6552828	Title	RefSNP	False	Use	A GWA study was recently conducted by Bouchard et al. [3] in sedentary Caucasians to study the association of 324,611 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the trainability of one of the main phenotype traits indicative of human endurance performance, i.e. maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). 	The strongest association with the training response of VO2max was found to acyl coenzyme A synthetase long-chain 1 (ACSL1) gene polymorphism (rs6552828). 	The ACSL1 gene is a candidate to explain individual variability in endurance performance, as well as in some health-related phenotypes, owing to its potential role in aerobic metabolism at the adypocite, cardiomyocite, liver and skeletal muscle fiber level [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. The findings of GWA studies should be further explored in genetic association studies focused on those SNPs showing the highest level of association [2].

A GWA study recently conducted by Bouchard et al. [3] on 324,611 SNPs identified a set of 21 SNPs accounting for 49% of the variance in the trainability of VO2max [3]. The strongest association with the training response of VO2max was found to ACSL1 rs6552828.

In the single-SNP analyses, rs6552828 explained 6.1% of the variance in the response of VO2max. 	Homozygotes of the rs6552828 minor allele (AA) had 125 mL/min (−28%) and 63 mL/min (−17%) lower VO2max response than the common allele homozygotes (GG) and the heterozygotes (AG) respectively. Interestingly, in our study the A allele was less frequent in elite male endurance Chinese athletes compared with their controls. 
PMC3400600	rs6552828	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Use	Further investigations are thus needed with other ethnic groups and populations as the one studied here, i.e. representing an important fraction of the total planet population. 	In summary, our findings suggest that the ACSL1 gene polymorphism rs6552828 is marginally associated with male elite endurance status in Chinese (Han) population yet such association was not found in Chinese females or in a different (Caucasian) cohort. 	Our findings exemplify the need for further genetic association studies in the field of sport sciences to use at least two cohorts of a different ethnic background in order to increase the generalisability of their results.

Our choice of PDB system was driven by the considerations that while both Ca2+- and apo-form crystal structures are available for the core domain of the skeletal troponin complex, 1YTZ.pdb is the only available structure in the Ca2+ form. The 5TnC.pdb crystal structure of Herzberg and James is the first crystal structure of EF-hand type Ca2+-binding proteins, is determined at 2 Å resolution, and is widely considered to be the gold standard for skeletal TnC structural description.

The closeness of the two source species: Gallus gallus (1YTZ.pdb) and Meleagris gallopavo (5TnC.pdb) provided an additional level of complementarity. 	It should be noted that the selected PDB files have some missing residues. Specifically, in 1YTZ.pdb the 39 C-terminal amino acid residues (144–182) of TnI or the C-terminal residues of TnT2 (249–262), as well as the N-terminal tail domain of TnT, are not in the crystal set.

PMC3598806	1YTZ	Results	PDBe	False	Use	We performed equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations on the TnC subunit (residues 3 to 161) and the core domain of the troponin complex. 	The following set of systems were examined: first, open TnC systems where Ca2+ was removed from sites I and II, only from site I, only from site II and not removed at all (molecular coordinates derived from Ca2+-saturated structure - 1YTZ.pdb); second, the closed, deactivated TnC domain (molecular coordinates derived from the Ca2+-depleted TnC - 5TnC.pdb); and third, the troponin molecule Ca2+-saturated and Ca2+-depleted state (molecular coordinates derived from 1YTZ.pdb). 	Thus, we simulated the open activated skeletal Tn and TnC domain in the Ca2+-saturated state; and then to model the structural events leading to thin filament relaxation, we removed Ca2+ from sites I and II of open TnC and simulated the resulting structure. To access the conformational coupling between the two sites and the contribution of each site to the structural transitions of the N-lobe we also simulated structures with only one site occupied.

PMC3598806	1YTZ	Results	PDBe	False	Background	From electron microscope images [51], we do know that the troponin complex can be divided into two domains-the tail and core domains. 	Crystal structures of the core domain are only available to date and PDB entry 1YTZ is one of them. 	The tail domain is known to interact with tropomyosin [2]. Among the core domain, the inhibitory region and the C-terminal mobile domain of TnI are thought to interact with actin in the apo state [2]. 
PMC3689696	AY452039	Methods	ENA	False	Use	For distance calculation the distance estimation method K3ST (Kimura’s three-substitution-types; [29]) was used. 	To construct cluster networks in form of rooted rectangular phylogrammes, the sequence AY452039 of Candida picachoensis CBS 9804T was used as outgroup. 	This species is close enough to the M. pulcherrima group [7] to have a D1/D2 sequence moderately related to the analysed sequences but far enough to be an uncontroversial outgroup. To generate neighbor-nets, Equal Angle setting was chosen and the sequence used as outgroup in cluster networks was excluded from the analysis, as its inclusion had little effect on the overall structure (the neighbor nets are unrooted networks) of the network and the layout of the network was improved by its exclusion.

PMC3730352	AB065375	Introduction	ENA	False	Background	For example, novel mitochondrial Open Reading Frames (ORFs) can arise from gene duplication. 	In bivalve molluscs, a cox2 duplication is found in the clam Ruditapes philippinarum (Bivalvia, Veneridae) (Okazaki M and Ueshima R, unpublished data; GenBank AB065375.1) and in the mussel Musculista senhousia (Bivalvia, Mytilidae) (Passamonti et al. 2011). 	Moreover, nad2 duplication is at the origin of two novel ORFs in the oyster genus Crassostrea (Bivalvia, Ostreidae) (Wu et al. 2012). Extra elements were also found in Cnidaria mtDNA, either from duplication of extant genes or not: a duplicated cox1 in some hydroidolinan hydrozoans (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa), two novel ORFs in Medusozoa (Kayal et al. 2011), and a novel ORF in every octocoral (Cnidaria, Anthozoa) that has been screened to date (McFadden et al. 2010).

PMC3843656	rs11209026	Introduction	RefSNP	False	Use	Different studies have identified IL23R as a susceptibility factor associated to multiple inflammatory conditions [16,17,18]. 	In these studies several independent signals located within IL23R locus were suggested; however, only the R381Q (rs11209026) polymorphism, whose minor allele plays a protective role for several autoimmune disease, appear to have a functional involvement [19,20]. 	Additionally, the rs1495965 polymorphism has been reported as the stronger IL23R association with Behçet’s disease (BD), a systemic autoimmune disease involving uveitis, in a previous combined meta-analysis of two genome-wide association studies (GWASs) [21,22].

PMC3911802	rs40401	Abstract	RefSNP	False	Use	Using multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR), we identified rs17099451 in MMP8, using a single locus model, with a mean cross-validation of 87.0%. 	Using a two-locus model, combinations of MMP8 and rs44707 in ADAM33, and MMP8 and rs40401 in IL-3, were identified, with mean cross-validation consistencies reaching 45.0%. 	Of the SNPs selected by the MDR method, rs17099451 in MMP8 and rs40401 in IL-3 were regarded as the most significant results in a 2 × 2 dominant model analysis. The finding that an MMP8 allele was most strongly related to asthma development indicates that metalloproteinase function is crucial to the airflow limitation process involved in this disease.

The sequences obtained were compared with the reference sequence of COL6A1 gene (NM_001848.2) with Sequencer ver. 4.10.1 software (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). 	As a result, we found three variants of unknown significance; one homozygous intronic variant (c.588+19dupC), one heterozygous missense variant in the start of exon 11 (c.904G>A; p.Gly302Arg), and one homozygous silent variant (c.1095T>C; p.Gly365=). Of those variants, c.904G>A (p.Gly302Arg) was considered as a potential candidate for disease-causing mutation (Fig. 3).

PMC4030988	1FSL	Methods	PDBe	False	Use	In order to search for a 3D structure similar to that of the E-to-H helix unit, a 3D structure comparison program, Dalilite (http://ekhidna.biocenter.helsinki.fi/dali/star), was used [4] with the PDB structures. 	The 3D coordinates of the Cα atoms in the E-to-H units in soy bean leghemoglobin (PDB: 1FSL) were used as a query because the E-to-H unit in this protein has been confirmed as a folding core [2,3,26]. 	To do this, we prepared a 3D structure database, with Dalilite searches for the E-to-H-unit-like structures, by excluding the globin-like fold proteins from the whole PDB structures. Because all the globin-like fold proteins are expected to potentially possess an E-to-H unit, any PDB structures annotated as “globin-like fold” at SCOP were discarded from the Dali search.

PMC4107892	AF384860	Article	ENA	False	Background	Additionally, they observed morphological characteristics typical of Sebacinales such as dolipore septa with continuous parenthesomes in specimens of C. chaetosporum. 	The ITS sequence data of E. albescens (type species of the genus Efibulobasidium, AF384860) shows 98.9 % similarity with CBS 154.59 (neotype of C. chaetosporum), suggesting that they are congeneric, and that Chaetospermum (1892) should have preference over Efibulobasidium (1975) (Wells 1975). 	
PMC4107892	GU727556	Article	ENA	False	Use	Two cultures listed in the CBS collection as E. subulatus (CBS 458.88 and CBS 139.90) were found to be phylogenetically and morphologically distinct (Figs 1 & 6, respectively) and represent different taxa. 	Highest similarity of the LSU sequences was found with “Mollisia incrustata” GenBank GU727556; however, this sequence does not appear to be congeneric with other Mollisia sequences on GenBank (data not shown) and thus the application of the supposed taxonomic lineage of Mollisia (Leotiomycetes; Helotiales; Dermateaceae) would not be confirmed here. 	Examination of the blast results also did not result in a clear affinity to any of the classes, with a more or less equal similarity to both Leotiomycetes and Sordariomycetes and therefore this genus is treated here as incertae sedis. It is quite possible that the genus belongs to a class that is currently not represented in the NCBI GenBank nucleotide database.

PMC4188009	2ei4	Methods	PDBe	False	Use	Structural analysis was performed with CNS (Brünger et al., 1998 ▶), REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al., 2011 ▶) and XtalView (McRee, 1993 ▶). 	The structure of aR2 in the P321 crystal (PDB entry 2ei4) was used as an initial model. 	After rotational and translational searching with MOLREP (Vagin & Teplyakov, 2010 ▶), water and lipid molecules were added on the basis of the 2F o − F c map and the structure was refined by several cycles of simulated-annealing and individual B-factor refinements. The final refinement of the protein structure using REFMAC5 resulted in an R cryst of 21.4% and an R free of 23.4% (Table 1 ▶). 
PMC4188009	1c3w	Discussion	PDBe	False	Use	It has been reported that the neutral purple form is destabilized in bR-containing vesicles reconstituted with egg lethicin, in which the transition from the neutral purple form into an inactive red form with λmax at 480 nm takes place at pH 6.5 (Nasuda-Kouyama et al., 1990 ▶). 	With respect to the protein structure in the P63 crystal, Glu194 OE2 in the structural model solved at 1.55 Å resolution (PDB entry 1c3w) has an unusually large B factor (62 Å2; Luecke et al., 1999 ▶). 	(The B factor of Glu199 OE2 of aR2 in the H32 crystal is 31 Å2.) It is possible that the conformation of Glu194bR in the P63 crystal represents a mixed state between the neutral purple form and the alkaline pink form. There is another caveat to the structural model of bR that was built using the P63 crystal.

PMC4208647	A23187	Results	ENA	False	Use	Then, we investigated whether VNUT gene expression is linked with the secretion of nucleotides from MEG‐01 cells. 	Nucleotide secretion was triggered by the addition of A23187, a Ca2+ ionophore, since it causes entry of extracellular Ca2+ into the cell interior; the resultant rapid increase in Ca2+ facilitates exocytosis of secretory vesicles. 	As shown in Figure 4A, appreciable amounts of ATP and ADP were released from the cells in a time‐dependent fashion. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+ in the medium, no A23187‐dependent release of nucleotides was observed.

PMC4479853	rs1420101	Introduction	RefSNP	False	Background	SNPs associated with childhood asthma could be consistently linked to transcript levels of ORMDL3, a member of a gene family that encodes transmembrane proteins anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum.13 The second asthma GWAS analyzed sequence variants affecting blood eosinophil counts in Icelanders, and the ten most significant SNPs were further studied in 12118 Europeans and 5212 East Asians including Koreans. 	While SNP rs1420101 in the IL1RL1/IL18R1 gene cluster at 2q12 was strongly associated with asthma (p=5.5×10-12), its OR was still below 1.5. 	In 2010, a large-scale, consortium-based GWAS of asthma with 10365 asthmatics and 16110 controls confirmed the association of the previously defined SNPs including the ones in ORMDL3 and IL1RL1,14 yet their ORs were within the range of 0.5 to 1.5. Subsequently, GWAS has been applied to determine whether disease-related intermediate phenotypes are causal or secondary to the disease progress.15 A meta-analysis on total IgE concentration showed strong association with HLA-DQ (rs9469220) in Caucasians16 and CRIM1 in Koreans (rs848512 and rs711254).17

Though no clear evidence supports a link between variants in ALDH1A3 with autism, mouse studies show that lack of Aldh1a3 (Gene NC_000073.6) results in abnormal GABAergic neuronal differentiation in the forebrain basal ganglia [24]. Malfunctions in this inhibitory system have been found to be associated to mental disorders like ASD, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder [25,26].

PMC4591669	P50694	Results	UniProt	False	Use	The most abundant contig by far was Pa_24402 with a FPKM sum of 523 781 over the 24 samples, or 4.2 million mapped reads total. 	Its best B2G hit was GenBank accession P50694, a glucan endo-1,3-β-glucosidase or thaumatin-like protein, the most abundant soluble protein in the ripe sweet cherry fruit.59 Five other ‘Top 40’ contigs also had B2G hits to published P. avium sequences: Pa_11846 (P. avium allergen 1), Pa_29501 (non-specific lipid transfer protein), Pa_00414 (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase 1), Pa_21625 (thaumatin-like protein) and Pa_03818 (anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosyltransferase). 	Altogether, based on the best hit descriptions, 11 of the 40 most abundant contigs represent proteins likely related to abiotic and biotic stresses, such as oxidative stress and responses to pathogens. Also, three further contigs described as putative transport proteins may also be associated with defense responses such as metallothionein-like proteins60 and lipid transport protein.61 The latter are predominantly expressed in surface tissues,61 including citrus and tomato fruit.26,27 While relevant in constitutive and acute stress responses, many stress defense proteins were proposed to have other, developmental functions as well. 
PMC4591669	IPR002022	Results	InterPro	False	Use	The corresponding pectate lyase may be involved in cell wall loosening and rearrangement during the rapid cell fruit growth occurring at this time. 	The finding is in line with the expression peak of the apple pectate lyase MdPL1 in growing apple.72 In our transcriptome, a total of eight contigs contained the pectate lyase/Amb allergen motif (IPR002022), four of which were predicted to represent full-length ORFs. 	Three of these contigs were in cluster NG1: The above mentioned Pa_07062 (NG1-QT44), Pa_06731, and, in cluster NG1-QT18, Pa_03006. The latter one had two prominent expression maxima, 24 and 66 DAFB, while the former ones were not expressed during Stage III. 
PMC4591669	BG319625	Results	ENA	False	Use	The latter one had two prominent expression maxima, 24 and 66 DAFB, while the former ones were not expressed during Stage III. 	Interestingly, contig Pa_03006 was the best hit of a pectate lyase from sour cherry (PcPEL1, GenBank BG319625; 98% identity), which was highly expressed during the Stage III, and only slightly upregulated during Stage I in developing sour cherry.73 	In cluster NG1-QT42, with expression maxima between 3 and 17 DAFB, the most specific, over-represented terms were related to ribosomes and translation. This is consistent with the high cell division activity characteristic for Stage I. Over-represented GO terms among the 29 exocarp-specific contigs of this cluster were carboxylesterase and tyrosine decarboxylase activities (Supplementary Table S8, Supplementary Table S4). 
PMC4591669	JU090722	Results	ENA	False	Use	Notable contigs in cluster NG1-QT39 further included two putative transcription factors (an AP2 family member, Pa_00973 and an MYB family member, Pa_23194, best B2G hit MYB66), a putative (hemi)cellulase (Pa_10720) and a lipid transport protein (Pa_22556, best BG2 hit uncharacterized GPI-anchored protein). 	The best PAVE hit of the latter contig was another assembled sweet cherry cDNA encoding a putative lipid transport protein, PaLTPG1 (GenBank JU090722), tentatively involved in cuticle deposition in sweet cherry fruit.29 Other exocarp-specific, putatively cuticle-related contigs in cluster NG1-QT39 included Pa_14044 and Pa_04572. 	
PMC4591669	IPR012392	Results	InterPro	False	Use	Exocarp-specific contigs with probable relevance for wax biosynthesis included Pa_00478 (best hit WAX2, or CER1), Pa_06166 (3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 6) and the Top 40 contig Pa_29501 (non-specific lipid-transfer protein, allergen Pru av 3) in cluster NG1-QT28, and the unclustered contig Pa_08907 (3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 19). 	Contigs Pa_08907 and Pa_06166 were, together with Pa_01742 (NG1-QT43), the only three exocarp-specific contigs in Group 1F, which contained a full-length ORF and the InterPro motif very-long-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (IPR012392), essential in wax biosynthesis. 	Pa_08907 was present at much lower levels than the other two but, interestingly, its expression peaked at equal levels during Stage I and during Stage III, while the two major KCS transcripts were abundant mainly during Stage I. Based on the expression patterns, cluster NG1 was likely to contain most of the contigs with potential relevance to the process of our key interest, cuticle formation. 
PMC4591669	AY376878	Results	ENA	False	Use	With Pa_06731 (NG1-QT43), it is the most abundant pectate lyase transcript in the sweet cherry fruit transcriptome. 	It was the best hit of a ripening associated pectate lyase from apple (GenBank AY37687814) and the third best hit of the ripening associated pectate lyase PcPEL1 from sour cherry73 (best hit of PcPEL1 was Pa_03006, NG1-QT18; see above). 	Contig Pa_14097 was more expressed in the exocarp than in the mesocarp (80 DAFB exocarp, 1161±43 FPKM; mesocarp, 245 FPKM), suggesting that in sweet cherry fruit, this ripening associated pectate lyase is mostly relevant for the expansion growth of the exocarp cells. Altogether, the pectate lyase/Amb allergen motif (IPR002022) was identified in eight contigs, four of which were also predicted to contain a full-length ORF.

Altogether, the pectate lyase/Amb allergen motif (IPR002022) was identified in eight contigs, four of which were also predicted to contain a full-length ORF. 	Other contigs relevant for the cell wall architecture in cluster NG4-QT67 include Pa_09347 (best hit expansin) and Pa_44853 (probable rhamnose biosynthetic enzyme). Both contigs share with Pa_14097 the sharp peak in expression level 66 DAFB, consistent with functions in cell wall re-arrangements that enable the rapid expansion growth at this developmental stage.90 In addition to these cell wall-related contigs in cluster NG4-QT67, contig Pa_02283 (best hit cytidine triphosphate (CTP) synthase 1) also had a sharp expression peak 66 DAFB, with lower but still elevated expression from 73 to 87 DAFB.

The tridimensional model that was generated was used for a structural alignment with the HsNMNAT-1 model (PDB ID: 1KQO) (Zhou et al. 2002), which was generated from the X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) database and registered on the PDB database (Bernstein et al. 1978). 	This process was performed using UCSF Chimera v.1.8 software (Pettersen et al. 2004). T. cruzi culture and DNA extraction - T. cruziepimastigotes were cultured at 27ºC in Schneider medium (Sigma S9895) that was supplemented with 10% (v/v) foetal bovine serum (Gibco) (Baker & Price 1973, Miralles et al. 2002).

It is most commonly caused by constitutional heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, usually MLH1 (MIM #120436) or MSH2 (MIM #609309) [Lynch et al., 2009]. 	The reported mutations in Lynch syndrome families are genetically heterogeneous and include gross structural alterations such as deletions or inversions, [Wagner et al., 2002] missense, nonsense or frameshift mutations, [Tavtigian et al., 2008] splice site mutations, [Thompson et al., 2014] or variants within MMR gene regulatory regions such as promoter regions [Green et al., 2003]. In many cases, the functional and hence clinical significance of the sequence alterations, in particular single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) outside coding regions, is uncertain. 
PMC4682451	164757	Methods	OMIM	False	Background	The c.-28A>G and c.-7C>T variants studied in this manuscript have been submitted to the LOVD database at http://www.lovd.nl/MLH1. 	At the age of 38 years, Proband 32 had microsatellite-unstable colorectal cancer with wild-type BRAF (MIM #164757) and loss of MLH1 and PMS2 expression (as determined by immunohistochemistry). 	Proband N was a 54-year-old woman who sought advice due to a family history of colorectal neoplasia (Fig. 1). Multiplex ligation-dependent PCR amplification (MLPA) was performed using a commercially available kit (MRC Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). 
PMC4682451	600259	Methods	OMIM	False	Use	Multiplex ligation-dependent PCR amplification (MLPA) was performed using a commercially available kit (MRC Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). 	No copy-number alterations were identified in any exons of the MLH1, PMS2 (MIM #600259), MSH2, and MSH6 (MIM #600678) genes in either proband. 	Sequence alterations across the MLH1 and PMS2 genes were further assessed using long-range PCR and Sanger sequencing. No sequence alterations were detected in the MLH1 or PMS2 genes except for the c.-28A>G and c.-7C>T heterozygous variants in the MLH1 5′UTR.

PMC4682451	138120	Methods	OMIM	False	Use	M.CviPI enzyme methylates accessible DNA at GpC sites, whereas nucleosome-bound DNA is inaccessible and remains refractory to GpC methylation. 	The promoter of the HSPA5 (MIM #138120) gene, known to be nucleosome free and accessible, was used as a control for GpC methyltransferase M.CviPl in each sample examined. 	GpCpG sites were excluded from analysis. Nucleosome occupancy was defined as a region ≥150 bp that was inaccessible to M.CviPI. 
PMC4682451	193040	Discussion	OMIM	False	Background	The VILL c.1164del1 frameshift variant has a MAF of only 0.00008 and is therefore a more recent genetic event within this haplotype. 	The function of VILL is unknown but its homology with the VIL1 (villin [MIM #193040]) gene suggests it may play a role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of microvilli at the epithelial surface of the gut. 	The presence of a constitutional frameshift variant in VILL in Proband 32 raised the possibility that it might explain early-onset cancer. However, this variant is unlikely to be the cause of cancer predisposition because it was absent in Family N in which the c.-28A>G and c.-7C>T variants cosegregated.

PMC4720046	NCT02061917	Abstract	NCT	False	ClinicalTrials	Results indicated reduced exposure to many potentially harmful constituents found in cigarette smoke following product switching. 	Findings support differences in exposure from the use of various tobacco products and are relevant to the understanding of a risk continuum among tobacco products (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02061917). 	
PMC4720046	NCT02061917	Introduction	NCT	False	ClinicalTrials	Additionally, these biomarkers account for variations in smoking behaviors among consumers (e.g. puff number, puff volume, puff frequency), unlike the easily quantified and standardized machine-generated mainstream smoke constituent yields (Borgerding & Klus, 2005). 	A randomized, multi-center study of adult cigarette smokers switched to tobacco-heating cigarettes, snus or ultra-low machine yield tobacco-burning cigarettes was conducted (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02061917) (Ogden et al., 2015b). 	Subjects’ experience with the randomized product was followed for 24 weeks. A group of never smokers was included for baseline comparisons.

PMC4724163	KT594769	Results	ENA	False	Use	The genome of MaHV-1 is the first metatherian herpesvirus to be sequenced. 	Excluding the genomic termini, which remained unresolved, the final genome length of MaHV-1 was approximately 140.1 kbp (Fig. 1) [GenBank:KT594769], larger than previously predicted. 	This difference appears to be due to a larger than predicted inverted repeat region [15]. This included a 98.8 kbp UL region and a 15.3 kbp US region flanked by 13 kbp inverted repeat sequences (IRS/TRS). 
PMC4724163	BAP00706	Results	ENA	False	Use	Comparison of other viral core genes yielded similar clustering patterns. 	Comparison of the MaHV-1 UL27 and UL30 ORFs with those of the recently sequenced fruit bat herpesvirus 1 (FbHV-1) [GenBank:BAP00706 and GenBank:YP_009042092; UL27 and UL30, respectively] showed that these ORFs shared 71 and 67 % pairwise aa identity, respectively (83 and 78 % aa similarity). 	This similarity is comparable to that seen between MaHV-1 and HHV-1/HHV-2 (Table 1 and Fig. 2), which may offer some insight into their evolutionary relationship, for example, may suggest transmission of herpesviruses from primates to bats, and then to marsupials. 
PMC4724163	SRP067309	Methods	ENA	False	Creation	Sequencing was carried out using a 300 cycle V2 SBS kit (Illumina, Inc.) in paired-end 150 bp format. 	Over 350 Mbp of sequence data were obtained from 2.69 million paired reads with a mean length of 137 bp (standard deviation of 26.3) and were submitted to the Short Read Archive [SRA:SRP067309]. 	Reads were trimmed to an error probability limit of 0.5 % and de novo assembly was performed using medium-low default sensitivity settings on the bioinformatics package Geneious version 6.1.7 [37] (Biomatters Ltd). This yielded four large contigs (52.6 kbp, 37.3 kbp, 14.9 kbp and 17 kbp) with consensus sequences that corresponded to herpesvirus sequence, according to Blastx and Blastn searches of GenBank databases [38, 39].

Prediction of open reading frames (ORFs) using Glimmer3 was restricted to those larger than 240 bp, and ORF annotations were determined by Blastx and Blastn searching against the NCBI non-redundant protein and nucleotide databases, respectively [38, 39].

PMC4748402	3R5N	Article	PDBe	False	Use	A pharmacophore model is a 3D arrangement of physicochemical features (e.g., hydrogen bond donor/acceptor, hydrophobic area, aromatic ring) that represents the key interactions between a ligand molecule and its target protein. 	As an example, the chemical interaction pattern that defines the interaction of magnolol with the binding site of PPARγ (PDB 3R5N) is presented in Fig. 2A [for more details about the significance of this example the reader is referred to (Zhang et al., 2011) and (Fakhrudin et al., 2010)]. 	3D-multiconformational compound libraries can be screened against a pharmacophore model to retrieve molecules that map the pharmacophore features and consequently have a high likelihood of being active on the target. Depending on the target, this method can achieve success rates between 2 and 30% (Hein et al., 2010). 
PMC4748402	3R5N	Figure	PDBe	True	Use	As indicated, the used search keywords were plant chemistry, plant pharmacology, plant natural product, plant compound, plant drug discovery, plant bioactivity, and the total number of PubMed publications per year was retrieved by search with the symbol *. The trend analysis reveals that the increase of PubMed citations in the target areas is faster than the increase in the total number of annual PubMed citations (indicated by the steeper slopes of the respective trend lines). 	(A) Two molecules of magnolol concomitantly occupying the binding site of PPARγ (PDB 3R5N) are shown, with the chemical interaction pattern that defines the activity of the molecules depicted. 	Yellow spheres represent hydrophobic interactions, red and green arrows mark hydrogen bond acceptor and donor atoms. This interaction pattern may be converted into a structure-based pharmacophore model and used for virtual screening.

PMC4860839	3NMW	Methods	PDBe	False	Use	Crystals of the APC–ARM/Amer1-A1 complex belonged to the P212121 space group, with one set of the complex in each asymmetric unit. 	The structure was determined at 1.90 Å by the method of molecular replacement with the CCP4 program Phaser [37], using the structure of APC–ARM by itself (PDB code: 3NMW) [10] as the searching model. 	After model-building by Coot [38] and refinement by the CCP4 program REFMAC [39, 40], the final model has an R/R free factor of 18.06%/22.13%. In the Ramachandran plot, 99.4 and 0.6% of residues are in the most favored and allowed regions, respectively. 
PMC4920148	135100	Introduction	OMIM	False	Background		Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP; OMIM 135100) is a rare genetic disease with a prevalence of about one per 2-million people. 	The inheritance is autosomal dominant, although most cases are due to sporadic new mutations (Shore et al., 2005). Individuals with FOP are characterized by a peculiar congenital toe malformation and, usually starting within the first decade of life, by a progressive heterotopic ossification (HO) that takes place following some types of injury (such as trauma, medical surgery, intramuscular immunization, infections) or spontaneously.

PMC4961654	137215	Introduction	OMIM	False	Background	Most of GC cases are sporadic and hereditary cases account for only 1–3 % of GCs, this includes hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) (Monahan and Hopkins 2016). 	HDGC (OMIM #137215) is an autosomal dominant genetic predisposition cancer syndrome with high penetrance. 	Between 25 and 30 % of cases of HDGC are caused by mutations in E-cadherin gene (CDH1) (Hallowell et al. 2016; Hansford et al. 2015). This gene maps to chromosome 16q22.1, consists of 16 exons and encodes the cell-to-cell adhesion protein, E-cadherin (Masciari et al. 2007).

PMC5070816	AFW98990	Discussion	ENA	False	Background	A2M is an evolutionarily conserved element of the innate immune system and a non-specific protease inhibitor involved in host defense, and it has been revealed that A2M is relative to immunity in L. vannamei [65]. 	The F11 gene (GenBank: AFW98990.1) was reported to play a role in immunity [1]. 	Recent studies revealed the importance of KLKB1 in shrimp immune response, particularly towards protect animals from the microbial pathogens [66]. Aquatic animals metabolize foreign toxicity of chemicals mainly by oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis and conjugation reactions catalyzed by various enzymes, and the metabolic activation is primarily catalyzed by the cytochrome P450-dependent oxygenase system in the endoplasmic reticulum [67].

PMC5296949	NCT01692756	Conclusion	NCT	False	ClinicalTrials	Corticosteroids have previously been demonstrated to reduce early OA changes such as osteophyte formation and cartilage lesion in a canine OA model [54] and to reduce cartilage degradation when administered early after anterior cruciate ligament injury in a porcine model [55]; however, they do not entirely halt disease progression. 	Clinical trials are currently underway to examine the effect of intra-articular administration of a synthetic glucocorticoid on pain, joint function, inflammation, and cartilage degradation (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01692756). 	Anti-cytokine, anti-MMP therapies, and anti-S100A8/A9 therapies are promising candidates for new disease-modifying OA drugs. However, preventing the expression and/or release of degradative mediators rather than inhibiting their activity may prove more efficient. 
PMC5346417	KFX50394	Article	ENA	False	Background	This discovery of the chloride-sensing capacity of the WNKs has confirmed them as the ‘missing-link’ kinase in chloride regulation. 	It seems likely that WNK1 played a pivotal evolutionary role in controlling cell volume in single cells, although the only unicellular organism with a WNK1 orthologue identified so far is the dimorphic fungus Penicillium marneffei (GenBank: KFX50394.1). 	The development of closed cardiovascular systems in larger complex metazoan organisms may have necessitated the refinement of its volume regulatory function with gene duplication deriving later WNKs (WNK2–4). What is clear is that the WNKs now have a very diverse biology and a central role in the control of blood pressure.

Calmodulin (National Center for Biotechnology Information Protein P62158) was expressed in BL21 (DE3) CodonPlus RIL cells from a plasmid encoding full-length (149 residues) protein. 	N-terminal and C-terminal calmodulin lobe constructs contained calmodulin sequence amino acids 1–80 and 81–149, respectively. Calmodulin expression was induced with isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mM) in LB media for 16 h at 16 °C. 
PMC5393379	NC_007782	Methods	RefSeq	False	Background	Conversely, Gastropoda were constrained as a monophylum, so that at least some possible artifacts, due to long-branch attraction (LBA) with the 5 outgroup taxa, are avoided. 	Moreover, the mtDNA of Lottia digitalis (GenBank Accession Number NC_007782) turned out to be very fast-evolving and very prone to create LBA artifacts, therefore this taxon was excluded from the study, thus lowering the number of ingroups to 109. 	Being Lottia the only known representative of the clade with a published complete mtDNA, unfortunately this also led to the exclusion of the whole Patellogastropoda from our analysis. The ML analysis was extensively described elsewhere (see, in particular, see supplementary Additional file S4, Supplementary Material online of Plazzi et al. 2016). 
PMC5393452	AP006153	Article	ENA	False	Background	When mapped onto the medaka genome, 22 of these sex-specific RAD-tags were found to be on the Y chromosome (LG1) and 30 on unordered scaffolds, probably due to an incomplete assembly of the medaka Y chromosome. 	Among these sex-specific RAD-tag sequences, nine mapped to the Y non-recombinant sex-specific region (Gen-Bank ID: AP006153) including two sequences that were less than 1 kb downstream of the 5′ end of the dmrt1bY medaka sex-determining gene (GenBank ID: AY129241) [10]. 	These results clearly demonstrate that the RAD-Sex approach is highly efficient because it enabled the identification of sex-specific sequences located very close to the previously known SD gene even in a GWAS that does not allow a simultaneous genetic mapping of the RAD-tags. It should be noted, that our analysis, although conducted on a species with a sequenced genome, did not use the genome sequence for the analysis of sex-associated RAD-tags: the genome sequence only provided validation of the proof of principle.

In the present study, we analyzed microarray data of breast cancer expression profiling (NCBI GEO database, accession GSE65194), focusing on Na +/K +-ATPase coding genes. 	We found overexpression of the ATP1A1 and down-regulation of the ATP1A2. We expect that our research could help to improve the understanding of predictive and prognostic features of breast cancer.

In the present study, we analyzed public breast cancer expression profiles made using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (NCBI GEO database 20, accession GSE65194) for the expression of alpha subunits of NKA. 	We found abnormalities in ATP1A1 (coding α1-subunit) and ATP1A2 (coding α2-subunit) expression ( Table 1) in breast cancer samples relative to their expression in normal breast tissue. ATP1A1 was overexpressed approximately 1.5 times in all groups of breast cancer samples (p<0.05). Coincidently, ATP1A2 expression decreased by more than 2 times (p<0.05).

PMC5501546	rs2075650	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Use	In the present study of patients with established CAD, we investigated the association between 45 lead SNPs from loci associated with CAD and five common biochemical markers of inflammation. 	The main findings were; 1) for SNP rs2075650 in the TOMM40, APOE locus, the established CAD-risk allele was significantly associated with lower hs-CRP levels, 2) No other CAD-related SNPs were associated with the inflammatory marker levels, either measured as individual SNPs or when combined into a GRS. 	Previous GWASs have demonstrated a robust association between the rs2075650 G-allele and an increased risk of CAD [11]. In a recent study based on the present cohort, subanalysis also confirmed an association between rs2075650 and recurrent CAD events showing that an increase in the number of CAD risk alleles was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.40 (95% CI 1.00–1.97) of the primary endpoint composed of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stable coronary revascularization [19].

Considering the well-established relationship between increasing levels of hs-CRP and adverse cardiovascular outcome [20], it may be surprising that the CAD risk allele of rs2075650 was associated with lower levels of hs-CRP in our sample. 	However, our findings are consistent with results from several previous large population-based cohort studies. In these studies, the same inverse relationship between the CAD risk allele and lower levels of hs-CRP has also been observed in European Americans [21], Australian twin families [22], Asians [23], and Hispanics [21] but not Afro-Americans [21]. 
PMC5501546	rs2075650	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Background	The CAD risk allele (G) has been associated with a range of other phenotypes including reduced longevity [24], reduced BMI [25], increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) [22,26], and an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease [27]. 	Because of the relatively strong linkage disequilibrium in the TOMM40/APOE locus, it has been suggested that the G-allele at rs2075650 is in fact tagging causal variation in the APOE gene. 	The APOE encodes the apolipoprotein E with three different isoforms (ε2, ε3, and ε4 defined by the combination of rs7412 and rs429358. Northwestern European ancestry (CEU): r2 = 0.02 and r2 = 0.20 with rs2075650, respectively), of which the ε4 isoform has long been known to associate with LDL-C, Alzheimer’s disease, and hs-CRP [28,29].

In studies of hs-CRP, the IL6R locus (rs4129267) was consistently, though moderately, associated with hs-CRP levels (CEU: r2 = 0.54 with rs4845625) [32–34]. 	Furthermore, IL6R (rs4129267) has been associated with plasma levels of fibrinogen and IL-6 [35–37].

In studies of hs-CRP, the IL6R locus (rs4129267) was consistently, though moderately, associated with hs-CRP levels (CEU: r2 = 0.54 with rs4845625) [32–34]. 	Furthermore, IL6R (rs4129267) has been associated with plasma levels of fibrinogen and IL-6 [35–37]. Although we observed a nominal association between the IL6R locus and C3, our study does not support a significant effect of IL6R on the inflammatory response.

PMC5501546	rs1561198	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Background	To our knowledge, the present study is the first to explore the association between calprotectin and CAD-associated risk variants. 	Although none of the CAD-associated variants significantly affected calprotectin levels, a trend was observed for rs1561198. 	This SNP is located between the VAMP5 and VAMP8 genes, whose products are involved in different aspects of vesicle trafficking including cytokine release and phagocytosis [43]. Hence, a link between this locus and calprotectin levels may plausibly exist. 
PMC5501546	rs2075650	Conclusion	RefSNP	False	Use		In the present study, a common CAD-associated variant at the TOMM40/APOE locus (rs2075650) was significantly associated with lower levels of hs-CRP in patients with stable CAD. 	Future studies using deep sequencing of the TOMM40/APOE locus in large clinical samples are warranted to determine if rs2075650 is truly causing opposite allelic effects on CAD and hs-CRP, or if the opposite association is explained by underlying linkage disequilibrium with several hidden functional variants of which some affect the development of CAD independent of hs-CRP. None of the remaining variants, both assessed independently or combined as a GRS, were associated with hs-CRP, IL-6, calprotectin, fibrinogen, or C3.

PMC5589870	GCA_000973045.2	Methods	GCA	False	Use	As an additional screening test, all potential virus assemblies were screened against the Conserved Doman Database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi) with an expected value threshold of 1 × 10−3 to identify viral gene segments. 	To exclude possible endogenous viruses, all virus assemblies were blasted against the I. ricinus reference genome (GCA_000973045.2). 	Finally, to assess mean sequence depth and relative frequency, the quality trimmed libraries were mapped back against all viral assemblies and the COX11 mitochondrial gene of I. ricinus (KF197136.1) using Bowtie2 v.2.2.831. Following previous studies1 we assume that a higher relative frequency suggests that the virus is more likely to be associated with ticks (rather than being a component of diet or environment).

PMC5591096	rs3765467	Methods	RefSNP	False	Use	Genotype frequencies were tested for Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium using the chi-square test. 	Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess independent associations between patient's responses to DPP-4 inhibitors (dependent variable) and rs3765467 (independent variable), including covariates. 	Results were expressed as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Given that triglyceride, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT) values were not normally distributed, statistical analyses of these values were conducted on log-transformed data.

PMC5591096	rs3765467	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Use	Many investigators have found the concepts of genetic variation and antidiabetic medication efficacy to be quite attractive. 	For PPAR agonists, polymorphisms of PPAR, adipose tissue, adiponectin, and cholesterol synthesis have all been shown to have an impact on drug potency.[6–8,20,21] Genetic variants in transcription factors have also been shown to influence pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of metformin.[22] Although the correlation between DPP-4 inhibitors and genetic variation is controversial, our study would support such a correlation with the A allele of rs3765467. 	
PMC5591096	rs3765467	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Background	Meanwhile, the degree of DPP-4 inhibitor efficacy could be explained by ethnicity.[33] Compared to non-Asians, Asians exhibit a higher capacity to respond to DPP-4 inhibitor treatment. 	In a meta-analysis study, lower BMI in Asians, which could be related to insulin sensitivity, was referred to as a primary factor.[33] According to an international database, minor allele frequency (MAF) for rs3765467 is reported to occur in up to 36% of Asians, which is relatively high compared to other ethnicities.[34] In the current study, the MAF was 17.1%. 	The relatively high A allele frequency in Asians may account for the better response in these populations. A recent Taiwanese study showed that GLP-1 analog response was not affected by GLP1R variation.[35] The study enrolled 36 patients with poorly controlled hyperglycemia and treated them with a 6-day continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and exenatide, a GLP-1 analogue. 
PMC5591096	rs3765467	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Background	First, we could not assess insulin sensitivity or pancreatic beta cell function due to a lack of information on C peptides and insulin levels. 	However, a previous study showed that the minor allele of rs3765467 is associated with a 2-fold increase in insulin secretion in response to exogenous GLP-1 infusion.[13] Second, types and dose of DPP-4 inhibitors were not controlled in the study population. 	Despite uncontrolled medication, difference in the types of DPP-4 inhibitor between responder and nonresponder was insignificant. Third, physical activity and dietary changes that could improve hyperglycemia were not evaluated in the current study.

PMC5715601	rs754929347	Article	RefSNP	False	Background	This alteration was not identified in the mother of F1‐III2 (Fig. 1B), suggesting that it is of paternal origin. 	To our knowledge, the PROS1 c.1871‐14T>G variant was not described associated with PSD and it is very rare in the general population (rs754929347; MAF C = 0.000009/1). 	Analysis of this variant using the Alamut‐v2.2 interactive biosoftware predicted the creation of a new cryptic acceptor splice site (scores: SSF = 71.78; MaxEnt = 2.32 and HSF = 76.10). As c.1871‐14T>G has a potential effect on intron 14–exon 15 acceptor splice site, we decided to study its PROS1 mRNA.

PMC5731891	NCT02876861	Discussion	NCT	False	ClinicalTrials	Currently, only a few prospective randomized studies are ongoing for locally advanced UTUC. 	One ongoing randomized trial (NCT02876861) evaluating the role of 2 to 4 cycles of NAC (gemcitabine and cisplatin) for patients with locally advanced UTUC who are eligible for cisplatin hopefully will provide insight for clinical benefit. 	However, this study will not provide the useful information for the role of NAC in cisplatin-ineligible patients. The use of carboplatin in a neoadjuvant setting is still a matter of debate [14]. 
PMC5737465	PRJNA275635	Methods	BioProject	False	Use	Population Genomic Data Processing 	We downloaded whole genome resequencing data from 200 individuals of a single C. grandiflora population, generated by Josephs et al. (2015) (NCBI accession number PRJNA275635, ID: 275635). 	We trimmed the paired-end 100-bp raw reads with Trimmomatic 0.32 (Bolger et al. 2014), and randomly subsampled reads of each individual to a total of 54 million reads per sample (average coverage 25×) to avoid an overrepresentation of individual samples with high coverage. We mapped the trimmed reads to a TE-merged reference with bwa bwasw 0.7.13 (Li and Durbin 2009), as recommended before analyses with PoPoolationTE2 (Kofler et al. 2016). 
PMC5737465	PRJNA212731	Methods	BioProject	False	Use	C. rubella was derived from a C. grandiflora-like outcrossing ancestor fairly recently, most likely <200,000 years ago (Foxe et al. 2009; Guo et al. 2009; Brandvain et al. 2013; Slotte et al. 2013), and it is the best available model for inferring such information. 	Additionally, a previous study found no evidence for different TE silencing efficacies between C. rubella and C. grandiflora (Steige et al. 2015), hence, we expect silenced TEs in C. rubella to be also silenced in C. grandiflora.TEs targeted by siRNAs were determined by using small RNA sequencing data from roots, seedlings, and flowers of the C. rubella reference accession generated by Smith et al. (2015) (NCBI Accession: PRJNA212731, ID: 455735/456437/456438). 	We trimmed the raw sRNA reads with Trimmomatic 0.32 (Bolger et al. 2014) and mapped them to the TE-merged-reference using STAR 2.5.1b (Dobin et al. 2013), with default settings modified to allow mapping of small RNA reads. After removing all reads with more than one nucleotide soft-clipped from their 5′ end, in order to remove long RNA reads which were not fully mapped by STAR, we considered all RNA reads, which mapped to a TE, with a length of 24 nucleotides and no mismatches to be siRNAs.

M(NLS-88R)-neutral occurs as physiological monomers similar to wt-M1 structure 1EA3 (also crystallized at neutral pH),12 and are arranged loosely in a so-called ‘face-to-back’ orientation with each other in the cell (Figure 1A). 	The residues Lys104 (part of the NLS motif), Arg134, Tyr100 and Asp94 on the ‘face’ of one molecule (Monomer A) interact with several complementary residues on the ‘back’ of a second molecule (Monomer B), including Glu29, Asp30, Lys21 and Ser17 (Figures 1A and 1B). Despite also crystallizing at a neutral pH, the two monomers (A and B) of M(NLS-88E)-neutral unexpectedly associate to form a physiological face-to-face dimer with the NLS basic residues adjacent to each other similar to wt-M1 dimer 1AA7 (crystallized at acidic pH).13 The two monomers of M(NLS-88E)-neutral are similar with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of ~0.4 Å, but are different from those in wt-M1 1AA7.13 
PMC5750462	1AA7	Discussion	PDBe	False	Use	When compared to the M(NLS-88E)-neutral dimer interface, the positively charged Lys104 side-chain in M(NLS-88R)-acidic has reoriented to avoid close contact with the positively charged opposing Arg88 (Figures 1F and 2). 	When comparing wt-M1 neutral (1EA3) and acidic (1AA7) structures, several hydrogen-bond interactions occurring at the dimer interface of 1AA7 appear to serve as the fulcrum of the subunit rotation for transition from the face-to-back-oriented 1EA3 to the face-to-face-oriented 1AA7.10 Some of these inter-subunit hydrogen-bond interactions are conserved in the dimeric structure of M(NLS-88)-acidic, including X88-O to Tyr100-OH and Asn85-ND2 to Arg134-O (see Supplementary Table S3). 	In addition to these conserved inter-subunit hydrogen-bonds, the G88R mutation also results in an extra hydrogen-bond from Arg88-NE to Arg134-O in M(NLS-88)-acidic structure. This additional inter-subunit interaction may explain why it took longer for M(NLS-88R) M1 to disintegrate in vitro at pH 5.5 than wt-M1, as the fulcrum of M(NLS-88R)-acidic was relatively difficult to break during the dimer interface rotation.

This may explain why a lower pH was needed to soften the M1 layer in assembled M(NLS-88R) virions than in WSN particles. Nevertheless, M(NLS-88R) M1 retains pH-dependent conformational transition like WSN.

PMC5766183	4mut	Results	PDBe	False	Creation	EMSA experiments revealed that the E89A+R91A mutant of the UbaLAI-N domain retained residual DNA binding ability (KD for specific DNA is approx. 200 nM, or 5000-fold lower than observed with wt UbaLAI-N, Supplementary Figure S5A and D). 	To generate an UbaLAI variant with a completely disabled N-domain, we have introduced two additional mutations, R37A and H38A, thereby generating a quadruple (R37A + H38A + E89A + R91A) mutant of the full-length UbaLAI (henceforth referred to as UbaLAI-4mut), and a corresponding variant of the UbaLAI-N domain. 	EMSA experiments with the quadruple UbaLAI-N mutant confirmed complete loss of its specific DNA binding ability (Supplementary Figure S5E). DNA binding by the full-length UbaLAI-2mut and UbaLAI-4mut proteins was investigated by a standard gel-shift assay. 
PMC5766183	3hqf	Discussion	PDBe	False	Use	We show here that Type IIE enzymes UbaLAI and EcoRII use similar N-terminal effector domains specific for the 5′-CCWGG-3′ sequence. 	Despite the fact that UbaLAI-N and EcoRII-N domains share only 18% sequence identity (Supplementary Figure S1C), their overall structures are very similar (Figure 4B): 134 of 173 residues of the EcoRII N-terminal domain (3hqf) could be aligned with UbaLAI-N with r.m.s.d. of 3.1 Å (DALI server (22)). 	The loops of the N-arms adopt slightly different conformations in both domains; the C-arms overlay better, but the loop between the strands in the C-arm of UbaLAI-N is shorter (Supplementary Figure S6). Both domains make identical contacts with the central T0:A0 base pairs employing overlaying residues (Figure 4D and E, Supplementary Figure S6). 
PMC5766183	2reu	Discussion	PDBe	False	Background	According to sequence analysis, only the N-terminal Sau3AI domain contains an intact catalytic center, while the catalytically inactive C-terminal domain acts as an effector domain (26). 	Though the originally proposed Sau3AI reaction mechanism involved transient dimerization (25), recent structural studies of apo-Sau3AI performed by Xu et al. are consistent with the monomeric oligomeric state of Sau3AI (PDB IDs 2reu and 4pxg (27)). 	We therefore propose that Sau3AI may also employ an UbaLAI-like reaction mechanism, as depicted in Figure 7B. A similar mechanism to UbaLAI was also described for the Type IIS enzyme BfiI, which contains a B3-like DNA recognition domain specific for the 5′-ACTGGG-3′ DNA sequence attached to a nonspecific nuclease that cuts DNA 5/4 nucleotides downstream from the recognition site (28,29).

PMC5813224	NCT01344707	Discussion	NCT	False	ClinicalTrials	Intriguingly, analysis of the genetic landscape of SHH subgroup medulloblastoma identified frequent somatic alterations in genes encoding histone acetyl transferases.25 In light of these findings, our data together with the previous studies by the Canettieri group may provide a mechanistic basis for this observation and guide possible new therapeutic approaches. 	The clinical relevance of our findings is further underlined by a recent phase I clinical trial with 4SC‐202, where 18 out of 24 patients with advanced hematologic malignancies went into follow up treatment, one patient showed complete response and remained on study medication for >28 months, while another patient had a partial response over a period of 8 months (Clinical trial: NCT01344707, poster J Clin Oncol 32:5 sec, 2014 (suppl; abstr 8559)). 	Although it is unclear whether the promising clinical response to 4SC‐202 treatment was due to inhibition of GLI activity, the results of the present study warrant further clinical evaluation of 4SC‐202 as a treatment for GLI‐dependent cancers including BCC, medulloblastoma and possibly other malignancies with high medical need.

PMC5849279	rs2200733	Results	RefSNP	False	Use	However, rs10033464 (4q25, PITX2) displayed a risk estimate in the opposite direction than had been previously reported by others. 	This discrepancy appears to be in part due to linkage disequilibrium between this marker and the nearby SNP with the strongest association in this gene, rs2200733 (p = 0.005). 	We and others have observed that the risk alleles at these markers are negatively associated with each other. There remains uncertainty in the optimal genetic risk model for AF, and superior models will certainly evolve in the future as more genetic discoveries are made. 
PMC5849279	rs2200733	Results	RefSNP	False	Use	In this light, we also considered a modified AF GRS that included only the most strongly associated SNP in each gene—which is a common solution in GRS estimation to eliminate confounding due to linkage disequilibrium [32]. 	The resulting 9-SNP model included rs2200733 for PITX2 and the other 8 SNPs from the other genes. 	The risk of AF with this modified AF GRS, as in the 12-SNP model, was greater for the highest AF GRS quintile than for the lowest AF GRS quintile (OR 5.07; 95% CI 2.04–12.60; p < 0.001), and this model appeared to better differentiate risk of AF throughout the distribution of genetic risk (S3 Table). As expected, the risk estimates derived for both AF GRS models remained significant in an analysis limited to participants who self-reported as white (S4 Table).

PMC5893785	NCT00297193	Introduction	NCT	False	ClinicalTrials	Mechanistic studies suggest that restoration of immunological tolerance in chronic autoimmunity occurs after auto-HSCT via eradication of immune memory and reconfiguration of the immune system. 	Although case reports suggested exceptional benefit for patients with refractory CD after auto-HSCT (14, 15), concerns about safety and a lack of understanding as to whether benefit relates to the chemotherapeutic agents administered during mobilization/pre-transplant conditioning regimen or the transplant itself, led to the Autologous Stem cell Transplantation International Crohn’s disease (ASTIC) randomized controlled trial (NCT00297193) (16, 17). 	This was conducted at 11 accredited centers in 6 European countries (16, 17). Autologous Stem cell Transplantation International Crohn’s disease compared cyclophosphamide mobilization alone to mobilization, high-dose chemotherapy, and auto-HSCT in patients with refractory CD (16, 17).

PMC6155776	4NNI	Introduction	PDBe	False	Background	However, there are limitations that make them inapplicable for our compounds. 	The complex of POA bound to the ribosomal protein S1 (involved in trans-translation process) was resolved (pdb: 4NNI). 	From this complex it is obvious that POA could be substituted in positions 5- and/or 6-, but not in position 3- [23]. The pyrazinamidase (PncA) active site cavity is quite small and from a model based on the X-ray determined structure of PncA (pdb: 3PL1), it is quite obvious that the only position for possible substitutions of PZA is position 6- of the pyrazine ring [24].

Substitution of position 3- by a large moiety (benzylamino in our case) would push the PZA core away from the position and orientation needed for an enzymatic conversion by PncA.

PMC6243512	rs2066842	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Use	Environmental carcinogens and NOD-induced proinflammatory cytokines could be possible reasons by which the studied polymorphisms may increase the risk for gastric cancer [9]. 	A meta-analysis evaluated several NOD2 polymorphisms such as rs2066842 C/T, rs2066844 C/T, rs2066845 C/G, rs2066847, L1007fsinsC and risk of cancer. 	The NOD2 rs2066844 C/T polymorphism was associated with increased risk of cancer for individuals bearing TT or CT genotype compared to individuals with CC genotype. The subgroup of analysis revealed that TT+CT genotype was associated with high risk of colorectal cancer, but there was no important association with the development of gastric cancer.

PMC6303916	rs12953717	Article	RefSNP	False	Background	It was shown that there was a significant difference between the rs4464148 AG frequency of SMAD7 in the CRC and control groups. 	It was demonstrated that the allele T at rs12953717 of SMAD7 can be introduced as a risk factor of CRC among Iranian patients [24]. 	Canonical Wnt/b-catenin is one of the critical pathways during the tumorigenesis in which the unphosphorylated and activated b-catenin enters into nucleus and activates the LEF/TCF/PYGO2 transcriptional complex [25]. GSK3b, AXIN, and APC are the components of a complex which is responsible for the regulation of b-catenin. 
PMC6303916	rs3135500	Article	RefSNP	False	Background	It seems that the rs3135500 SNP is involved in deregulation of NOD2 through changing the mRNA–miRNA interaction. 	There was a significant correlation between AA genotype of rs3135500 and increased risk of CRC in Iranian population [42]. 	CD86 is expressed by immune cells and is associated with inflammation related malignancies and cancer susceptibility. The 3’UTR + 237 G/C polymorphism of CD86 was assessed among 300 Iranian CRC cases and showed a strong correlation between rs17281995 polymorphism and risk of CRC [43].

The 3’UTR + 237 G/C polymorphism of CD86 was assessed among 300 Iranian CRC cases and showed a strong correlation between rs17281995 polymorphism and risk of CRC [43]. 	IL-10 as an anti-inflammatory cytokine is commonly secreted by type 1 regulatory T cells and can be an oncogene or tumor suppressor based on microenvironment condition. A case–control study showed that there was significantly lower serum levels of IL-10 in Iranian CRC cases compared with controls which cause an aberrant innate immune reaction and tumor cell ignorance by adaptive immune. 
PMC6303916	rs2228570	Article	RefSNP	False	Background	It has been reported that the vitamin D interaction with its receptor (VDR) is associated with CRC susceptibility [76]. 	It was observed that the ff (TT) genotype of rs2228570 can be suggested as a risk factor genotype for CRC susceptibility among a group of Iranian CRC patients [77]. 	Moreover, another group also reported that the VDR ApaI genotype “aa” is correlated with higher risk of CRC among a sub population of Iranian patients [78]. Insulin is involved in cell proliferation and has an anti-apoptotic role in the target tissues.

Similarly, carriers of the risk allele rs12255372 T/T were less likely to respond to SU than carriers of G/G3. 	Differences were also observed in the response to some dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4 i)4. Variants in the SLCO1B1 (encoding the hepatic cationic transporter OATP1B1) and CYP2C8 genes (encoding the drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP450 C8) have been shown to have an impact on the therapeutic response to the thiazolidinedione OAD, rosiglitazone (but not to pioglitazone)5.

PMC6406689	rs541731	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Use	Considering the higher statistical power of haplotype analysis compared to individual SNP analysis when LD was exploited to explore genes associated with diseases, we conducted the haplotype analysis and haplotype—environment interaction analysis to further investigate the roles of SPRY genes in Chinese NSCL/P. 	The results of haplotype analysis altogether indicated that one genetic segment (rs541731- rs9669948, from 80345577 to 80372188) located at 4.5 kb—31.1 kb downstream of SPRY2 was associated with NSCL/P, indicating that the neighborhood region of this segment might contain causal variants. 	Although the position drifted a little compared with formerly reported positions (rs8001641, 222.4 kb upstream of SPRY2; rs9545308, 270.7 kb upstream of SPRY2), our findings still enriched the evidence of this gene in the etiology of NSCL/P. The biological function of SPRY2 has also been identified by several experimental studies.

PMC6406689	rs541731	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Background	Although statistical interactions do not always guarantee biological interaction, evidence about the biological function of SPRY2 [21,29,30] and the signals in the single haplotype analysis might together support a biological interaction. 	Moreover, four SNPs in the identified genetic region, respectively, rs541731, rs496932, rs9545412, and rs9669948, are enhancer histone marks in embryonic stem cells or embryonic stem derived cells, which play important roles in the development of NSCL/P, as reported by ChromHMM software [31]. 	Genes with histone marks have been reported to have a significantly higher expression, while gene expression levels are correlated with DNA methylation [32]. Based on the general understanding that DNA methylations can be influenced by environmental exposures, it was reasonable to infer that ETS or multivitamin supplementation affected the DNA methylation processes of SPRY2 in embryonic stem cells or embryonic stem derived cells, and then influenced the development of NSCL/P.

The clinical features include low visual acuity, nystagmus, photophobia, severe color vision defects, and no recordable or only residual cone function on electroretinography (ERG) with normal rod functions. Fundoscopy is usually normal, although macular pigmentary changes and atrophy have been described in the literature [2-5].

PMC3210356	NCT01217008	Article	NCT	False	ClinicalTrials	Indeed, this has been recognized by the U.S. 	Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in allowing a clinical trial of embryonic stem cell-derived cells in SCI to proceed on the basis of pre-clinical safety demonstrated exclusively in rodent models (www.clinicaltrial.gov; clinical trial identifier: NCT01217008). 	Moreover, it is important to note that rodent contusion/compression models of SCI are generally “incomplete” with partial sparing of motor and sensory functions. These models closely mimic most patients with severe, partial lesions with an American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment (ASI) scale rating of AIS B or C. Given that most trials of cell therapy have been carried out in AIS A patients (the safest to inject, but also the least likely to show cell therapy-induced benefit), there is a need for future clinical trials to include patients actually modeled in the laboratory.

PMC3210356	NCT01328860	Article	NCT	False	ClinicalTrials	The inflammatory component of SCI and subsequent demyelination of surviving axons are serious limiting factors in the efficacy of early cell therapy for SCI, as implanted cells are more likely to be eliminated by the host. 	It is therefore worth considering interventions to modify the inflammatory milieu to enhance donor cell survival and efficacy, as in the newly initiated clinical trial of autologous BMSCs in children suffering from SCI (Table 2) (clinical trial identifier: NCT01328860). 	On the other hand, and considering the 1 case of neoplasms in a recipient of fetal neural progenitor cells (NPCs) reported by Amariglio et al. [53], the question of whether this strategy may increase the oncogenic risk of cell therapy must be considered. 
PMC3210356	NCT01327768	Article	NCT	False	ClinicalTrials	At least 2 of these trials [60, 61] have reported functional improvement in small patient cohorts, which may be confirmed by future pre-clinical studies on human OECs of various anatomical derivations to support future clinical trials.

PMC3210356	NCT01151124	Article	NCT	False	ClinicalTrials	The conditional immortalization of cells might provide a partial solution to limiting the use of fetal and embryonic tissue, overcoming the limited supply of cells irrespective of donor age, removing a source of variability between clinical trials and enabling extensive characterization of cell lines prior to clinical application. 	Clinically approved, conditionally immortalized fetal cortical NPCs (ReN001 or CTX0E03) of human origin are already in a phase I clinical trial for stroke in Scotland, UK (Pilot Investigation of Stem Cells in Stroke; clinical trial identifier: NCT01151124). 	These cells have been developed by the biotechnology firm ReNeuron using a karyotypically stable immortalization platform to enable cells to proliferate in culture and differentiate when induced without oncogenic transformation. Although this clinical trial will not include SCI patients, the results of this trial will be very interesting and relevant because stroke and SCI share many common pathophysiological mechanisms.

PMC3382138	2IVD	Discussion	PDBe	False	Use	CRTI and mxPPOX share an overall 20% sequence identity and 35% sequence similarity. 	Of the twenty-nine residues implicated in FAD binding in mxPPOX (pdb code 2IVD), thirteen are invariant in CRTI with a further six residues being of similar type (45% identity, 66% similarity). 	Of the nine residues that make hydrophilic contacts with FAD only E39 (E31, CRTI) makes side-chain only contacts (with the ribose moiety) and is one of only six residues that are invariant in all six proteins (the others being G8, G10, G38, G53 and V244 in CrtI). Two others form main-chain and side-chain contacts, S20 and N441, but both are replaced by G12 and G466 in CRTI, allowing only the main-chain contacts to be preserved.

We mapped these four alterations onto the existing crystal structure of ATP-bound Aquifex aeolicus NtrC1 (PDB:3M0E) [43], which has high sequence homology to LuxO (Figure 6B). 	The four residues we identified in the screen map to three regions that abut the Walker B motif (D245, E246, L247, and C248 in LuxO) (Figure 6B). In other NtrC-type proteins, mutations in this region have been shown to prevent ATP hydrolysis (See DISCUSSION).

PMC3472925	268000	Introduction	OMIM	False	Background		Retinitis pigmentosa (RP, OMIM 268000) represents a clinically heterogeneous group of progressive inherited retinal disorders that primarily affect rod photoreceptor cells, followed by secondary cone photoreceptor cell degeneration [1-3]. 	RP is the most frequent cause of inherited blindness, affecting approximately 1 in 3,500 to 1 in 5,000 people worldwide. This disease is initially characterized by night blindness followed by visual field constriction that can ultimately lead to legal blindness at a later stage [4]. 
PMC3472925	603937	Introduction	OMIM	False	Background		Mutations in the retinitis pigmentosa 1 gene (RP1, OMIM 603937) are thought to account for approximately 5.5% of adRP cases and only 1% of arRP cases, depending on the type and the position of the mutations [6]. 	To date, more than 50 disease-causing mutations in the RP1 gene have been identified. They are predominantly frameshift or nonsense mutations in individuals with dominant RP, clustered in a region spanning codons 500–1053 in exon 4 [6-24].

In this study, one gene cel6A (GenBank accession No. M73321) encoding an endoglucanase was selected to study the capacity of the novel expression vector we constructed in this paper. 	The reason for selecting endoglucanase Cel6A lies in the potential industrial application because of its thermostability, utility through a broad pH range and high activity [24]. Although an expression vector for production of endoglucanase Cel6A from T. fusca YX in Streptomyces has been reported recently, its maximum expression level was relatively low (about 64 mg/L) [25]. 
PMC3826001	3G33	Abstract	PDBe	False	Use		In this study, molecular modeling and protein structure optimization was performed for crystal structure of CDK4 (PDB id: 3G33), and was subjected to Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation for 10 nanoseconds, as a preparatory process for docking. 	Furthermore, the stable conformation obtained in the MD simulation was utilized for virtual screening against the library of natural compounds in Indian Plant Anticancer Compounds Database (InPACdb) using AutoDock Vina. Finally, best docked ligands were revalidated individually through semi-flexible docking by AutoDock 4.0.

IMPα residues 72–497 from the nucleosplasmin NLS complex structure (PDB ID 3UL1) [6] were used as the search model for molecular replacement to generate phases and an initial electron density map, with the test set reflections transferred from the search model dataset.

PMC3884852	1SR3	Article	PDBe	False	Background	CcmE is a heme-binding protein, discovered as an essential System I component as early as the late 1990's [63]. 	CcmE is a monotopic membrane protein, anchored to the membrane via its N-terminal TM segment and exposing its active site to the periplasm; it is the only Ccm component of the heme trafficking and delivery module of System I for which a three-dimensional structure is available ([21] PDB: 1SR3; [64] PDB: 1LM0). 	The 3D structure of the apo-state (without bound heme) consists of a six-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, reminiscent of the classical OB-fold [65] with N- and C-terminal extensions. CcmE can be considered a “heme chaperone,” as it protects the cell from a potentially dangerous compound by sequestering free heme in the periplasm [66]; it is thought to act as an intermediate in the heme delivery pathway of Cytc maturation.

PMC3884852	2KCT	Article	PDBe	False	Background	Recently, it was shown that CcmE proteins from the proteobacteria D. desulfuricans and D. vulgaris contain the unusual CXXXY heme-binding motif, where the Cys residue replaces the canonical His binding residue. 	NMR solution structure of D. vulgaris CcmE (PDB: 2KCT) revealed that the proteins adopt the same OB-fold characteristic of the CcmE superfamily. 	Contrary to what reported for the D. desulfuricans CcmE [69], the homologous protein from D. vulgaris binds ferric heme noncovalently through the conserved C127 residue [70]. An additional conserved residue in CcmE proteins is Tyr134, which was shown to provide a coordination bond to the heme iron of holoCcmE [71, 72] once it is released from CcmABCD complex [36], as discussed below.

PMC3884852	2HL7	Article	PDBe	False	Background	Notably, CcmH proteins from different bacterial subgroups may display structural variability; indeed, while in E. coli Ec-CcmH is a bipartite protein characterized by two soluble domains exposed to the periplasm and two TM segments, CcmH from P. aeruginosa (Pa-CcmH) is a one-domain redox-active protein, anchored to the membrane via a single TM helix and homologous to the N-terminal redox-active domain of Ec-CcmH. 	Surprisingly, the 3D structure of the soluble periplasmic domain of Pa-CcmH revealed that it adopts a peculiar three-helix bundle fold strikingly different from that of canonical thiol-oxidoreductases (Figure 5; PDB: 2HL7; [23]). 	The N-terminal domain of Ec-CcmH was also shown to have the same 3D structure, although helix-swapping and dimerization have been observed in this case (PDB: 2KW0; [91, 92]). The conserved redox-active motif (LRCPKC) is located in the loop connecting helices 1 and 2; close to the activesite, the crystal structure reveals the presence of a small pocket on the surface of Pa-CcmH surrounded by conserved hydrophobic and polar residues, which could represent the recognition site for the heme-binding motif of apoCyt.

PMC3892923	1CNV	Results	PDBe	False	Use	The cis confirmations of peptide bonds are mostly responsible for these deviations. 	For example, in the protein concanavalin B (PDBID:1CNV), there are four violation of the 3.8 Å constraint: Ile33/Ser34 - 4 Å, Ser34/Phe35 - 3 Å, Pro56/Ser57 - 4 Å and Trp265/Asn266 - 3.4 Å. These all these deviations are noted in the PDB file as footnotes, mentioning that ‘peptide bond deviates significantly from trans conformation’ 34. 	Another example is the Glu223-Asp24 violation in PBDid:1ADS, which is between two cis prolines (as noted in the PDB file) 35. However, these conformations are rare and not expected to occur frequently in a protein structure.

This validates our hypothesis that RDCC is minimized in native structures. Hence, structures that have a RDCC value more than a user specified threshold can be pruned out as structures with low quality or non-native structures.

Some of these are the result of erroneous residue numbering in the CASP8 I-TASSER decoy set. 	For example, Ala24 is mistakenly numbered as Ala19 in T0423 (PDBid:3D01, identified by doing a BLAST search). 	Correcting this numbering results in a RDCC of 0.002 Å. Similarly, T0470 (PDBid:3DJB) has a correct RDCC of 0.001 Å, since Ser112 is mistakenly numbered as Ser101.

Figure 3 shows the superimposition of the native structure and the first decoy structure (AXPROA00-MIN) for a protein (PDBid:1FC2) taken from the fisa decoy set. 	The distance between Ile12/C α and Leu13/C α atoms is 3.8 Å and 4.1 Å in the native and the decoy structures, respectively. According to our hypothesis, a 4.1 Å distance between consecutive C α atoms is typically unfeasible in protein structures, and their occurrence should be relatively rare.

PMC4146382	4BUM	Introduction	PDBe	False	Background	Thus, the 3D structure of the VDAC2 and VDAC3 isoforms have been predicted on the basis of secondary structure prediction servers [5]. 	It was only during revision of the present work that a crystallographic structure of VDAC2 was published [30] (zebra fish VDAC2; PDB code 4BUM at 2.8 Å resolution) confirming the very high degree of structural similarity with the VDAC1. 	The most striking difference between the three human isoforms is certainly the longer N-terminal fragment of hVDAC2, which has 11 residues more than the other two isoforms (figure 1). The N-terminal fragment of VDAC, comprising the first 25 amino acid residues (36 in the case of hVDAC2), is located inside the channel in the 3D structures, partially closing the wide pore [20]–[22]. 
PMC4146382	4BUM	Results	PDBe	False	Background	This resulted in their simple addition to the protein structure model according to a random coiled backbone conformation. 	Recently [30], the crystallographic structure of VDAC2 has been solved for zebra fish (PDB code 4BUM) at high resolution (2.8 Å), showing a very high degree of similarity with both the human and mouse VDAC1 3D structure. 	The root mean square deviation (rmsd) between zebra fish VDAC2 and the mVDAC reference structure used in this work is only 0.98 Å. The zebra fish VDAC2 amino acid sequence has 84% identity and 98% similarity with the human VDAC2, with the main differences located in the external loops. In agreement with the solved 3D structures, the N-terminal fragment crosses the lumen with a helical folding from the residue 6 to 20 in all the isoforms, and is horizontally located close to the lumen center.

PMC4228564	190685	Introduction	OMIM	False	Background		Down syndrome (DS) (MIM 190685), is the most frequent genetic cause of mental retardation, resulting from the presence of three copies of genes located on chromosome 21 and the most common chromosomal disorder in newborns with prevalence of 1/700 live births. 	Advanced maternal age is the only well-documented risk factor for nondisjunction of chromosome 21.[1] In spite of high prevalence, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying meiotic nondisjunction are not yet understood, and much research have been done on factors that influence the rate of chromosome nondisjunction. The relationship between chromosomal nondisjunction and folate metabolism has drawn attention in the past decade. 
PMC4228564	607093	Introduction	OMIM	False	Background	Increased homocysteine and decreased methionine cause decreased SAM to S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio, which takes part in DNA methylation.[4] 	The MTHFR gene (OMIM 607093) has been mapped at short arm of chromosome 1 (1p36.3) and more than 40 polymorphism have been described in MTHFR, but C677T (rs1801133) is the most common[5] in which a cytosine is replaced by thymine at 677th position (alanine →valine in protein). 	C677T mutation was shown to render the enzyme thermolabile and homozygotes (T/T) and heterozygotes (C/T) had about a 70% and 35% reduced MTHFR enzymatic activity. Frequency of mutant T allele differs in various ethnic and geographical populations of the world.

The larger trial was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01325909 – March 2011), and initially this NCT registration was taken to cover all aspects of the larger trial, including the present pilot study. 	Subsequently the pilot study was registered separately (NCT 01859442 – May 2013), and as a result of this change of approach this specific registration post-dated the recruitment of the first patients reported here, for which studies commenced in October 2012. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered.

This was then superimposed on one chain of the dimer structure of human E3 (PDB ID: 2F5Z, [33]) using PyMol (Schrödinger, LLC) and the process repeated for the second chain of human E3 in order to gain an overview of how a putative PfaE3 dimer would compare with its human counterpart.

Dimer forms of both models were generated by superimposition on the dimer structure of human E3 (PDB ID: 2F5Z, [33]). 	Whilst the PHYRE2 monomer superimposed well, residues 406–420 of the I-TASSER monomers sterically clashed.

In addition to the two extra loops, the high-resolution model positions a two-stranded anti-parallel β motif in the space that, in the structure of human E3 plus the SBD of E3BP (PDB ID: 2F5Z, [33]), is occupied by the E3BP SBD. PfaE3 does not interact with E3BP SBD, but rather the SBD of PfE2 since the parasite genome does not encode an e3bp homologue. 	The presence of this ‘extra’ β motif implies that this interaction may be quite different from that observed for human E3-E3BP, supporting the suitability of PfaE3 as a target for the development of intervention strategies. To further assess PfaE3 function, we generated Pfae3 null mutants (3D7Δae3).

For ease of clarity we will refer to the gene products using their respective ORF gene numbers.] gpl15 (NP_043563) is a minor structural protein, while hypothetical protein gp35 (AAO49840) is proposed to be a host-determinant protein (Stuer-Lauridsen et al., 2003). 	gpl15/gp35 show conservation at the N termini and to a lesser degree the C-terminal ends while the middle is variable and likely to be involved in host recognition. It has been shown that recombinant bIL67 isolates which maintained the 5′ and 3′ ends of gene ORF35 but exchanged the middle section for that of phage CHL92 ORF2 acquired the host range of CHL92. 
PMC5156332	AAD20610	Introduction	ENA	False	Background	Adsorption patterns of these hybrid bIL67 isolates were equivalent to those of CHL92 (Stuer-Lauridsen et al., 2003). 	Lastly, gpl16 (NP_043564) is a minor structural protein while hypothetical protein gp36 (NP_042309) is possibly a collar protein (AAD20610). 	In the infection process, lactococcal phages including C2viruses initially recognize carbohydrate receptors to bind to the host cell wall (for recent reviews see Ainsworth et al., 2014; Chapot-Chartier, 2014; Mahony et al., 2016; McCabe et al., 2015). More extensive studies have been performed on carbohydrate receptors of the 936 and P335 type phages while studies of C2viruses have focused on a cell membrane protein secondary receptor designated Pip (phage infection protein) (Valyasevi et al., 1991; Monteville et al., 1994). 
PMC5156332	L14679	Introduction	ENA	False	Background	For phage c2, binding to carbohydrate receptors is reversible, and interaction with Pip results in irreversible binding followed by phage DNA ejection (Monteville et al., 1994; Geller et al., 1993). 	The lactococcal Pip protein, first described in L. lactis C2 (GenBank accession number L14679), is a 901 aa membrane-spanning protein encoded by a 2706-bp gene (Geller et al., 1993) with homologues in most Gram-positive bacteria (Mooney et al., 2006); notably Bacillus subtilis orthologue yueB (São-José et al., 2004, 2006). 	It has been reported that inactivation of pip virtually eliminates infection by C2virus in lactococci without any apparent effect on the host (Garbutt et al., 1997; Kraus & Geller, 1998). Similarly, SPP1 requires YueB to infect B. subtilis, where the interaction has been extensively studied (Plisson et al., 2007; Jakuytė et al., 2012).

PMC5216611	168600	Introduction	OMIM	False	Background		Genetics plays a significant role in PD [MIM*168600], both in determining risk (if one will develop PD: cause) as well as age-at-onset (when a disease might manifest: modifier) (1). 	Several rare causative genes (2–11) and 28 common risk alleles (12–16) have been confirmed for PD. The known genes and risk factors account for ∼5% of the heritability (17), hence much of the genetic component of PD is still missing. 
PMC5216611	609718	Discussion	OMIM	False	Use	The loci accounted for 3.5% (5q14.1) and 3.9% (15q22.2) of variation in age-at-onset. 	The 5q14.1 signal maps to LHFPL2 [MIM*609718], a member of the lipoma HMGIC fusion partner (LHFP) gene family. 	The function of LHFPL2 is unknown. Interestingly, LHFPL2 is expressed in all normal tissues and cell lines except brain and leukocytes (40); however, while healthy brain tissue has no detectable LHFPL2 transcript, LHFPL2 protein is abundant in malignant brain tissue (41).

The 15q22.2 signal maps to the tropomyosin 1 gene (TPM1 [MIM*191010]). TPM1 encodes a highly conserved actin-binding protein that plays a central role in calcium-dependent regulation of muscle contraction. TPM1 is a tumour suppressor gene (42). 	Cancer and Parkinson’s disease are often likened to the two sides of a coin. Epidemiological studies have shown that the risk of developing PD is inversely associated with the risk of developing cancer (except skin cancer) (43).

An in-silico model was calculated using HADDOCK (Dominguez et al. 2003; de Vries et al. 2007) using the NMR structure (PDB ID 2MNA) as a template (Gamsjaeger et al. 2015). 	DNA (6T) was replaced by RNA (6U) and the definition of semiflexible and flexible residues; all ambiguous and unambiguous interaction restraints (AIR and UIRs, respectively) as well as base planarity restraints were taken from the docking calculations of the SsoSSB-DNA structure (Gamsjaeger et al. 2015).

Indeed, mapping of the observed chemical shift changes onto the crystal structure of SsoSSB (PDB ID 1O7I) confirmed that ssDNA and RNA recognise essentially the same binding interface on the protein (Fig. 4b–e). 	We have recently solved the structure of SsoSSB bound to ssDNA and have shown that the defining feature of the complex structure is the base-stacking of three aromatic residues (W56, W75 and F79) with three ssDNA bases (PDB ID 2MNA) (Gamsjaeger et al. 2015). The NMR data suggest that this base-stacking mechanism is conserved between ssDNA and RNA.

LbpB crosslinks were mapped onto an in silico homology based model of LbpB using Swiss-Model that was modelled against N. meningitidis TbpB [4] (PDB entry 3V8U) as a template. 	The LbpB model should be quite reliable for the core beta-barrel and handle structures but will be least reliable in the loop regions that harbour the clusters rich in aspartic acid and glutamic acid residues.

PMC5433092	KX243552	Introduction	ENA	False	Use	Thus, studying the expression and regulation of dehydrin genes under different abiotic stress conditions contributes to our understanding of the resistance of bermudagrass to abiotic stresses. 	We determined the full-length cDNA sequences of a novel YSK2-type dehydrin CdDHN4 from Tifway (drought-tolerant) and C299 (drought-sensitive) (GenBank accession no. KX243552). 	The objective of this study was to determine the regulation of dehydrin genes in drought conditions. The main steps were as follows: (1) isolating the promoter sequence of CdDHN4 and analyzing its cis-acting elements in bermudagrass; (2) identifying environmental stresses that can activate the CdDHN4 promoter and inducing the CdDHN4 expression; (3) the response of CdDHN4 expression under drought and ABA conditions in Tifway and C299.

All data were deposited at the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) public database (accession number PRJEB8960), and a table containing the ranked gene list of expression changes is provided in Table S1. 	In order to identify pathway dysregulations, the data were assessed bioinformatically with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA).

PMC5509450	NCT02810418	Article	NCT	False	ClinicalTrials	As a separate approach to improve clinical responses, several groups searched for drugs that synergistically enhance immunotoxins [1, 2]. 	Paclitaxel was identified as a potent enhancer of bolus doses of mesothelin-targeted immunotoxin in vivo resulting in a new clinical trial testing the combination against solid tumors (NCT02810418) [7]. 	In line with these results, the combination of paclitaxel and CD22-targeted immunotoxin achieved a long-lasting durable remission in 60% of the mice bearing a systemic ALL xenograft and the efficacy of continuously administered immunotoxin was enhanced substantially by 100-fold in a systemic MCL mouse model [5]. These striking effects of the combination of continuously administered immunotoxin and paclitaxel strongly support future clinical trials in patients with B-cell malignancies [5]. 
PMC5509858	2A79	Methods	PDBe	False	Use	While this model provides a new template for understanding the effects of mutations in this region, it contains a pore domain in the closed state, and the molecular volume available for binding inside the pore is far too small to accommodate any of the common blockers. 	Therefore, to study the potential interactions between the channel and hERG blockers, we used a previously developed and experimentally validated model of the hERG pore in the open state (Durdagi et al. 2012; Anwar‐Mohamed et al. 2014) based on the Kv1.2 X‐ray crystal structure (PDB ID 2A79), determined at 2.9 Å resolution (Model 2). 	It is important to stress that this previously published model of the hERG pore displays remarkable structural conservation with the published Eag1 structure for residues critical for drug binding (T623, S624, Y652 and F656), with major differences in the pore loop region far away from the common intra‐cavity binding site (Wang et al. 2016). To further refine both Model 1 and Model 2 of the hERG channel, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a protocol described below.

Under our experimental conditions, the Cotaxtla and Temporalero cultivars showed a similar expression profile in the roots, while Tres Ríos and Huimanguillo formed another group with similar expression profiles between them.

We hypothesize high-level BP of the intervention for reducing the incidence of postoperative complications.

The structure of ValFadR was determined by molecular replacement using EcFadR structure (PDB: 1E2X) as a search model. 	The model was first built automatically using PHENIX package (Adams et al., 2002) and then manually with COOT (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004) and structure refinement was performed with Phenix. For the structure of ValFadR and palmitoyl-CoA complex, the apo-ValFadR structure was used as a search model and then was built manually with Coot and refined with Phenix.

Patches of hydrophobic residues are also present in the lipid-binding region of APOB, as it can be observed by examining the homology model of APOB by Richardson et al.

PMC5751318	200100	Discussion	OMIM	False	Use	Interestingly, the molecular genetic analysis of the two genes, APOB and MTTP, which are involved in the transfer of triglycerides, assembly, and transport of APOB-containing lipoproteins, failed to demonstrate any mutation in these genes in our FSD cases. 	These results led to the conclusion that the hypo-APOB-lipoproteinemia associated with hypofibrinogenemia does not fit into the spectrum of hereditary a-betalipoproteinemia (OMIM# 200100). 	The latter is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the virtual absence of VLDL and LDL from plasma [20]. In this disorder, the failure of secretion of VLDL points to defects in the processing of the APOB proteins or to an impairment of the assembly or secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. 
PMC5751318	107730	Discussion	OMIM	False	Background	The molecular defect was identified in the absence of activity of MTTP, a factor critical to lipidation of APOB. 	In familial hypo-beta-lipoproteinemia (FHBL) (OMIM# 107730), a genetic heterogeneous autosomal codominant disorder [21], defects of APOB genes are involved in most cases, leading to the formation of prematurely truncated APOB species. 	However, a number of defects affecting the rate of synthesis or the rate of removal of APOB is also emerging [21]. The second point to bring into discussion is the colocalization of the two proteins (the abnormal fibrinogen and the normal APOB) in the same ER inclusions. 
PMC5751318	1FZB	Discussion	PDBe	False	Use	With regard to the presence of lipid droplets within the fibrinogen inclusions, we can assume that the overexposed hydrophobic patches of particular γ chain mutations can bind APOB molecules, since the latter protein is characterized by large hydrophobic regions that are normally used for the transport of lipids. 	These hydrophobic features are highlighted in Figure 2, showing the arrangement of fibrinogen α, β, and γ chains and the D–D interface of two gamma chains in the fragment D from the PDB structure 1FZB [22], and in Figure 3 showing a fibrinogen gamma monomer from the previous structure, the homology model of APOB [13], and the crystal structure of the lamprey lipovitellin (PDB 1LSH) [23] that is the closest homologue of APOB with known folding. 	γ chain mutants anomalously bound to APOB may serve as nucleation centers for the formation of hydrophobic clusters. Above a critical concentration, the latter coalesce into a lipid phase that becomes visible in the form of lipid droplets at both light and ultrastructural levels.

PMC5995288	NCT01283438	Introduction	NCT	False	ClinicalTrials	Some devices utilize suturing techniques, with or without anchors, in an attempt to seal and reapproximate the defect.16,17 Another strategy has been to occlude the defect with a mesh insert that is anchored to one of the adjacent vertebral bodies.18 Regardless of the technology, the primary goal of an ACD is to minimize reherniation and revision. 	There is currently one ongoing RCT that is focused on studying the safety and efficacy of a bone-anchored ACD in patients with large annular defects following lumbar discectomy (Clinicaltrials. gov ID: NCT01283438). 	Various inclusion criteria for this ongoing RCT, such as minimum pain and disability scores, result in the exclusion of many patients from the trial. Based on the indications of this ACD, many of these patients would still be eligible for treatment.

Nucant pseudopeptide (N6L) is a 4-kDa pseudopeptide currently in phase II clinical trials (NCT01711398), while the MultiFun European project (EU-FP7 no. 262943) is currently working on the multifunctionalization of IONPs with N6L and anticancer drugs. 	The significance of this pseudopeptide is that it acts as a targeting agent through its specific binding to nucleolin and nucleophosmin (overexpressed in several cancers) and also as a therapeutic agent [51][52]. The first results obtained showed the targeted uptake of N6L covalently-functionalized IONPs and the controlled release of N6L in a reducing medium which mimics the intracellular environment

PMC6278402	1GXN	Results	PDBe	False	Use	The amino acid sequence of PpPel10a from P. polymyxa KF-1 showed similarity to the characterized PL family 10 pectate lyases (e.g., AF121904.1, 35%; JQ723690, 40%) (Figure 2). 	Using the family 10 polysaccharide lyase from Cellvibrio cellulosa (PDB ID: 1GXN, identity = 44.79%) as a template [27], the structure of PpPel10a was modelled; it displayed a predominantly α-helical structure with short β-strands and irregular coils (Figure S2). 	The structure of family 10 pectate lyases is different from that of the pectate lyases from PL families 1, 3 and 9, which have a parallel β-helix fold [28]. From the amino acid sequence alignment it is deduced that residues D138, N139, R273, E276, R355 and R370 of PpPel10a were responsible for catalysis.

(2013) obtained imidazopyrimidines (EtOH-ionic liquid catalyzed, r.t.) with another positional orientation of substituents than in compounds 102b. 	However, there was not enough data (2D NMR experiments or X-Ray analysis) proving that structure while the structure of azolopyrimidines 102 was proven with the help of X-Ray analysis in cases of heterocycles 102d (Zhao et al., 2013) and 102e (Zhao et al., 2014). 	Formation of pyrimidines 105a and 106d,e was also observed in the reactions with the CH-acids 103: malononitrile (103a) (X = CN) or ethyl 2-cyanoacetate (103b) (X = COOC2H5). The condensation of aldehydes 1, malononitrile (103a) and 2-aminobenzimidazole (101a) under the variety of conditions [neat, poly(vinylpyrrolidonium) perchlorate catalyzed, 100°C (Abedini et al., 2016); neat-p-TSA(10%), 80°C (Reddy et al., 2014b); EtOH-Fe3O4@IM, Δ (Hemmati et al., 2016); PEG-H2O (4:1), Δ (Survase et al., 2017)] afforded dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidines 105a.

PMC6291425	NCT02432287	Article	NCT	False	ClinicalTrials	Our data showed that SIRT2 contributes to the effects of metformin on aging-related diseases, including cardiac remodeling (252). 	Currently, clinical trials investigating the anti-aging effects of metformin is undergoing (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02432287). 	Importantly, the Sirtuins do not function in individual metabolic organs or cell types alone during aging. Instead, the Sirtuins orchestrate the crosstalk between different organs or between different cell types within the local microenvironmental niche to maintain metabolic homeostasis and prevent against insulin resistance.
