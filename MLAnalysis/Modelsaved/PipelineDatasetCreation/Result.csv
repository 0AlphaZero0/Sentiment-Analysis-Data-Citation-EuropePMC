PMC5222340	1O3T	Results	PDBe	False	We attempted to fit the positions of three sulfates as closely as possible to the phosphates in the bent DNA molecule. 	Surprisingly, these three sulfates fit well with the phosphates of curved DNA molecules in the CAP (catabolite activator protein)-DNA complexes (PDB ID: 1O3T) [48]. 	The Sso7c4-DNA model shown in Fig 5A is approximately 2-fold symmetric, with each Sso7c4 dimer interacting with one half-site of symmetry-related DNA. Two swapped-β-loop-β motifs on the top of Sso7c4 contact the major groove on the concave side of the curved DNA. 
PMC5222340	1B67	Results	PDBe	False	In comparison with histone H3, which has a similar fold, the related DNA-binding residues R72 and R83 in H3 correspond to R11 and R20 in HMfA (as well as the equivalent residues in HMfB), respectively. 	When the crystal structures of HMfA (PDB 1B67) and H3 (H3 histone in the nucleosome, 1KX5) are superposed by using the α carbons, the orientation of R11 side chain in HMfA is quite different from that of R72 in H3 (S7B Fig). 	Therefore, the similarity between R22 of Sso7c4 and R72 of H3 is not readily observed in R11 of HMfA. Nevertheless, it is likely that the R11 side-chain conformation of HMfA could be changed, similar to that of R72 in H3, upon DNA complex formation.

PMC5222340	2L66	Methods	PDBe	False	Structure determination and refinement 	Although a solution structure of Sso7c4 (PDB ID: 2L66) was previously determined by NMR [36], it did not yield a correct molecular replacement (MR) solution for the crystals. 	The structure was instead determined using the two-wavelength anomalous dispersion data collected from a crystal of a mutant protein in which Val21 was replaced with Se-Met. The phases of the crystals of the selenomethionine-derived Sso7c4-V21M protein were calculated using the 2.1 Å resolution data from two-wavelength anomalous dispersion experiments collected at a selenium high remote wavelength of 0.9635 Å and an inflection wavelength of 0.9789 Å. The locations of the two selenium sites were identified using the program SHELX/C/D/E [58], with an occupancy of greater than 0.8. 
PMC5222340	1OT3	Methods	PDBe	False	Molecular docking model of the Sso7c4-DNA complex 	We used the chimera to build the complex model using a bent dsDNA from the CAP-DNA complex structure (1OT3). 	The DNA-binding surface of the Sso7c4 dimer was manually docked into the major groove to position the sulfates as close as possible to the phosphates in the DNA backbone. We also carefully considered sharp complementarity, avoided steric hindrance and maintained favorable electrostatics at the protein-DNA interface. 
PMC5222340	2L66	Supplementary material	PDBe	False	The r.m.s.d. values are 0.27 Å for 86 atoms and 0.34 Å for 79 atoms, represented by chain AB vs. chain CD and chain AB vs. chain EF, respectively. 	(C) The superposition of the α carbons of the wild-type and C-terminally truncated crystal structures and the NMR solution structure (2L66) is shown. 	By comparing the r.m.s.d. value of chain AB between the wild-type and C-terminally truncated structures, which is 0.35 Å for 85 atoms, the r.m.s.d. values between the coordinates of the wild-type and C-terminally truncated crystals and the coordinates of the NMR solution model are 1.56 Å for 92 atoms and 1.64 Å for 90 atoms, respectively. The crystal structures of the wild-type and C-terminally truncated proteins are similar to each other, but they have larger deviations from the NMR solution structure.

PMC4278209	AB175663	Article	ENA	False	The production of TDA by another Pseudovibrio sp., strain D323 (Figure 1B) has also been reported by Penesyan et al. [23]. 	This marine epiphytic strain was 99% 16S rRNA gene identical to P. ascidiaceicola (Genbank Acc. #AB175663) and exhibited antimicrobial activity against target strains from the phyla Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. 	The authors in particular noted that TDA produced by D323 was highly active against Nautella sp. R11, which causes disease in a marine seaweed Delisea pulchra, thereby supporting the hypothesis that these host-associated bacteria serve as a defence against potential pathogenic surface colonisers.

PMC5511225	JN257693	Results	ENA	False	The substitutions of S268T and P289S were found in the GA2, ON1, and all NA genotypes. 	When the Chinese ON1 sequences were compared with the sequence of the first ON1 genotype detected in Canada in 2010, (GenBank number: JN257693), 2 lineage-specific substitutions were identified in some of the Chinese ON1 genotypes: T249I and E262K; HRSVA with these substitutions clustered into a potential new lineage (lineage 1) within the ON1 genotype (Figs 1a and 3b). 	The E262K substitution occurred in the sequence duplication region in the HVR2 of ON1 (Fig. 3b).Figure 3(a) Amino acid substitutions at the HVR2 region of the G protein in representative HRSVA sequences. Different background colors are used to facilitate visualization of different genotypes. 
PMC5511225	JN257693	Discussion	ENA	False	Continuous molecular epidemiology surveillance needs to be conducted to determine if the sequence insertion also influences the transmissibility of the ON1 genotype and if the ON1 genotype circulates widely and for a long period of time like the BA genotype. 	When compared with the first identified ON1 genotype sequence (Canada strain, ON67–1210, GenBank number: JN257693), a number of Chinese ON1 sequences identified in this study had 2 amino acid substitutions in the G protein: T249I and E262K. 	Sequences with these 2 substitutions clustered into a new lineage, named lineage 1 in this study. Both substitutions were detected in Beijing, Shandong and Jilin provinces in 2014 and 2015.
