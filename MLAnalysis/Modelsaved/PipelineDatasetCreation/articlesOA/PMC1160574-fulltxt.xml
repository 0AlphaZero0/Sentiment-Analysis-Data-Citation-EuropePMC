The successful isolation of human ES cells (hESCs) has raised the hope that these cells may provide a universal tissue source to treat many human diseases. However, directed differentiation of hESCs into specific tissue types poses a formidable challenge. Protocols are currently available for only a few cell types, mostly of neural identity [<xref rid="pmed-0020161-b01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pmed-0020161-b03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and differentiation into many of the cell types derived from the paraxial mesoderm has not been reported, with the exception of a recent study indicating osteoblastic differentiation [<xref rid="pmed-0020161-b04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been isolated from the adult bone marrow [<xref rid="pmed-0020161-b05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], adipose tissue [<xref rid="pmed-0020161-b06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and dermis and other connective tissues [<xref rid="pmed-0020161-b07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Harvesting MSCs from any of these sources requires invasive procedures and the availability of a suitable donor. The number of MSCs that can be obtained from a single donor is limited, and the capacity of these cells for long-term proliferation is rather poor. In contrast, hESCs could provide an unlimited number of specialized cells. In this study, we present techniques for the generation and purification of mesenchymal precursors from hESCs and their directed differentiation in vitro into various mesenchymal derivatives, including skeletal myoblasts. Our isolation method for mesenchymal precursors is the first example, to our knowledge, of efficiently deriving structures of the paraxial mesoderm from ES cells, and further highlights the potential of hESCs for basic biology and regenerative medicine.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell Culture and FACS</title><p>Undifferentiated hESCs, H1 (WA-01, XY, passages 40&#8211;65) and H9 (WA-09, XX, passages 35&#8211;45), were cultured on mitotically inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Specialty Media, Phillipsburg, New Jersey, United States) and maintained under growth conditions and passaging techniques described previously [<xref rid="pmed-0020161-b03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].

OP9 cells have been previously shown to induce blood cell differentiation from mouse ES cells [<xref rid="pmed-0020161-b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

We next established the membrane antigen profile of the resulting population of flat spindle-like cells. The H1- and H9-derived CD73+ cells expressed a comprehensive set of markers that are considered to define adult MSCs, including CD105(SH2), STRO-1, VCAM (CD106), CD29(integrin &#946;1), CD44, ICAM -1(CD54), ALCAM(CD166), vimentin, and alpha smooth muscle actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020161-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020161-g001">1</xref>C).

The expression profiles of hESMPC-H1.2 and hESMPC-H9.1 were compared with that of human primary adult MSCs. Housekeeping genes for each of the mesenchymal cell populations were eliminated by subtracting those transcripts also expressed in at least one of three independent samples of undifferentiated hESCs. Based on this analysis, 1,280 transcripts were selectively expressed in hESMPC-H1.2, 932 transcripts in hESMPC-H9.1, and 1,218 transcripts in primary adult MSCs. A remarkable overlap of 579 transcripts shared among the three mesenchymal populations was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020161-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). Using the genes that were selected in the initial filter, we performed a statistical analysis on the expression levels to determine whether the genes were expressed significantly differently in the two cell types. We used a Bayesian extension to the standard <italic>t</italic>-test [<xref rid="pmed-0020161-b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] to assess this difference. Of the 579 genes, 412 of them were significantly different, at a false discovery rate cutoff of 0.05. The relative fold changes were also extremely large in many of the cases. We also looked at the variance of the expression levels within the cell types. For the MSCs, 94% had a coefficient of variation less than 20% for the expression (log transformed); for the ES-derived cells, 72% had a coefficient of variation less than 20%.

This study presents the induction of paraxial mesoderm with the generation of multipotent mesenchymal precursors. We calculate that under these conditions a single undifferentiated hESC yields an average of one CD73+ cell at day 40 of differentiation, suggesting a balance between cell proliferation and cell selection. There were no obvious differences in marker and gene-expression profile or in differentiation behavior among the five hESMPC lines generated. However, some of the lines (e.g., hESMPC9.1) exhibited a tendency of spontaneous osteogenic differentiation after long-term propagation. Directed differentiation of hESCs into somatic stem-cell-like precursors represents a substantial advancement in harnessing the developmental potential of hESCs. The high purity, unlimited availability, and multipotentiality of hESMPCs will provide the basis for future therapeutic efforts using these cells in preclinical animal models of disease. Such in vivo studies will also be required to properly assess the safety profile of these cells. Furthermore, our system also offers a novel platform to study basic mechanisms of mesodermal induction and differentiation during early human development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Human Identity of CD73+ Cells after FACS</title><p>All cells as visualized by DAPI+ nuclei express human nuclear antigen (hNA) confirming the absence of any contaminating OP9 cells.

In particular, it would be very valuable to be able to replace tissues that are derived from one particular tissue type&#8212;mesenchyme&#8212;which bone, cartilage, fat and muscle develop from. However, before such treatments can happen, it will be necessary to work out exactly how embryonic cells become other cells, and whether it is possible to make these changes happen in the laboratory.</p></sec><sec id="sb1a2"><title>What Did the Researchers Do?</title><p>They took two lines of completely undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells and by culturing them in the presence of mouse cells stimulated them to turn into mesenchymal cells. They then treated these cells with compounds to make them change into specialized bone, cartilage, fat, and muscle cells. They were able to confirm that these cells were all human (important because the early part of the experiment is done in the presence of mouse cells) and also that there was no evidence that the cells became cancerous.</p></sec><sec id="sb1a3"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>It is theoretically possible to produce lines of bone, cartilage, fat, and muscle cells from human embryonic stem cells. However, the process will need more refinement before the cell lines could be used for treatment; ideally, for example, all the culturing would be done without any mouse cells.</p></sec><sec id="sb1a4"><title>Where Can I Get More Information?</title><p>The United States National Institutes of Health has a group of Web pages on stem cells: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://stemcells.nih.gov/info/faqs.asp">http://stemcells.nih.gov/info/faqs.asp</ext-link>
