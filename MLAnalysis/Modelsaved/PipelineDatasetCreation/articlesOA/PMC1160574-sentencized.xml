</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Embryonic stem (ES) cells are pluripotent cells derived from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst that can be maintained in culture for an extended period of time without losing differentiation potential. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The successful isolation of human ES cells (hESCs) has raised the hope that these cells may provide a universal tissue source to treat many human diseases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, directed differentiation of hESCs into specific tissue types poses a formidable challenge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Protocols are currently available for only a few cell types, mostly of neural identity [1–3], and differentiation into many of the cell types derived from the paraxial mesoderm has not been reported, with the exception of a recent study indicating osteoblastic differentiation [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been isolated from the adult bone marrow [5], adipose tissue [6], and dermis and other connective tissues [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Harvesting MSCs from any of these sources requires invasive procedures and the availability of a suitable donor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The number of MSCs that can be obtained from a single donor is limited, and the capacity of these cells for long-term proliferation is rather poor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In contrast, hESCs could provide an unlimited number of specialized cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In this study, we present techniques for the generation and purification of mesenchymal precursors from hESCs and their directed differentiation in vitro into various mesenchymal derivatives, including skeletal myoblasts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Our isolation method for mesenchymal precursors is the first example, to our knowledge, of efficiently deriving structures of the paraxial mesoderm from ES cells, and further highlights the potential of hESCs for basic biology and regenerative medicine. </plain></SENT>
