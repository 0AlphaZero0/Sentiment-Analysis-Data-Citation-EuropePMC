</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RNA interference (RNAi) is a natural response of eukaryotic cells to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) leading to silencing of homologous gene transcripts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While application of RNAi in reverse genetic approaches is nowadays common use, therapeutic use, in particular, of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) is still fraught with challenges. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this exponentially growing field of RNAi, stability, degradation and delivery of siRNA receive increasing attention. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A limited correlation between chemical siRNA stability on one hand and RNAi efficiency and duration on the other hand has been described, but the limits are not well understood (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The argonaute-2 (Ago2) protein, a central component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), features a RNAse III type domain which cleaves the siRNA passenger strand (2,3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, given that several thousand siRNA molecules penetrate into a cell during transfection, the comparatively low number and siRNA-cleavage activity of Ago-2-containing RISCs makes it unlikely that Ago-2 is a major factor in the degradation of exogenous siRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Thus there is considerable interest in discovering other degradation factors and their subcellular location, a process that would greatly benefit from knowledge on the subcellular location of their potential substrate, i.e. reserves of intact siRNAs after transfection. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The standard siRNA delivery protocol in mammalian cell culture includes incubation of siRNAs with cationic lipid transfection agents, resulting in siRNA-containing lipoplex particles of ill-defined size around ∼500 nm (4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>While lipoplexes facilitate uptake (5), standard cationic transfection agents are toxic to the cells (6) and considered unsafe for in vivo applications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Potential adequate systemic delivery systems include ∼100 nm liposomes (7) and related formulations (8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The huge excess of siRNA molecules devoted to one cell in standard transfection protocols (107–109) over the targeted mRNA (101–104) clearly illustrates the potential benefits of new approaches to monitor delivery and transport processes into and inside the cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>It is unclear, in what manner the ensemble of siRNA molecules, once penetrated into the cell, contributes to RNAi, because they outnumber the ensemble of RISCs by several orders of magnitude. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In this context, methods to determine the whereabouts of pools of intact siRNA in the cell should be extremely helpful. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>To this end, we present here a FRET-based imaging approach where communicating dyes are located on opposing strand of the applied siRNA, allowing a non-destructive and non-invasive assessment of the degradation state of siRNAs in cultured cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>RNAi efficiency of siRNA duplexes is superior to single strands of siRNA by several orders of magnitude (9), clearly illustrating the necessity of tracing the whereabouts of the intact siRNA duplex in the cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Standard methods, which trace siRNA conjugated to fluorophores inside cells, cannot distinguish between intact siRNA duplexes, single strands or even just the mere fluorophores left after siRNA degradation in the imaging process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the use of FRET techniques, based on distance-dependent communication of two dyes, is an attractive way to approach this issue (10–12), because degradation of a double-labelled siRNA results in spatial separation of the dyes and a breakdown of FRET. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The most important problems that needed to be addressed for judicious use of FRET-labelled siRNA inside cells include compatibility of dye-labelling with RNAi (13,14), possible changes of spectral properties of the dyes inside the cell due to lipophilic environment or pH variations, and conclusive and quantitative correlation of fluorescence emission from inside the cell with siRNA integrity or degradation status. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>We report here a judicious application of siRNA-labelling with a commonplace FRET dye pair, using different relative positions of the dyes to establish a calibration system that correlates FRET efficiency with siRNA integrity outside and inside a cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>This calibration can be used with a standard confocal microscope to visualize regions containing high amounts of intact siRNA inside the cell at high resolution. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>The concept of using a FRET dye pair to monitor RNA integrity has been proposed and partially implemented by several groups (10–12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>An important aspect to be emphasized in such studies is the site of dye conjugation and the chemistry employed, because certain dye labels were reported to impede knockdown efficiency (13,14,20,21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>We labelled siRNA at different sites with the well-characterized FRET pair fluorescein and TMR, which has a Förster radius of ∼55 Å (16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>In previous investigations on FRET in siRNA, the dyes were either tethered to the 5′′ and the 3′ end of the same strand (5′–3′) (12) or to the respective 5′ ends of opposing strands (5′*–5′, where * denotes the guide strand) (11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Some controversial data on functionality of dye-labelled siRNA in the literature (13,14,20–22) instigated us to test the RNAi function of permutations of attachment sites with labels on opposite strands of siRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Four permutations, in which the guide strand was labelled with TMR and the passenger strand was labelled with fluorescein, were submitted to a GFP reporter gene knockdown assay. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>In agreement with previous reports (20,21), 5′-dye labels were found to impede knockdown efficiency somewhat in comparison to an unlabelled siRNA (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>However, and in some contrast to earlier reports, all of the permutations resulted in a knockdown efficiency still better than 70%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>The latter value is a conservative estimate, since the siRNA by itself produces an increased background fluorescence in the GFP channel, thus biasing the apparent knockdown values towards lower efficiency (see lanes labelled ‘RNA only’ in Figure 1).

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Spectral properties of the siRNA constructs were investigated in the cuvette upon fluorescein excitation at 488 nm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>The respective emission spectra (Figure 2A–C) clearly reflected differential FRET efficiencies as a consequence of the spatial separation of the dyes: constructs with communicating dyes in proximity (5′*–3′), or on the opposite ends of the duplex (5′*–5′) showed high and low FRET efficiency, respectively, in zcomparison to an siRNA mixture containing the respective dyes in different molecules which showed no FRET at all. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>According to their labelling type and the resulting FRET efficiencies, siRNAs were dubbed ‘high-FRET’, ‘low-FRET’ and ‘no-FRET’, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Digestion with double-strand specific nuclease V1 was monitored in real time in the cuvette, and the end-point of this degradation provided the ‘donor-only’ fluorescence values needed to calculate FRET efficiencies, which correlated well with values calculated from the estimated distance between the dyes: 0.98 versus 0.97, 0.17 versus 0.18 and 0, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>FRET properties of ‘no-FRET’ siRNA were very similar to those of heat-denatured ‘high-FRET’ siRNA as observed in fluorescence melting curves (Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Since the ‘no-FRET’ sample showed the same spectral properties as the fully degraded samples, it was further on used as a model compound for ‘dissociated’ siRNA, where the term dissociated indicates that the same spectral properties may also result from dissociation of both RNA strands without involving actual RNA cleavage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the ‘high FRET’ compound was the ‘intact’ siRNA, whose degradation status constitutes the actual object under investigation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Of note, the TMR emission cannot serve as a stand-alone indicator of siRNA integrity, because the emission shoulder of the dequenched fluorescein produces a fluorescence increase at the typical TMR emission wavelength in degraded samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>Rather than calculating FRET efficiencies, the relative fluorescence emissions of the TMR and fluorescein (R/G ratio) were further on used as a measure of siRNA integrity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>This ratio, which consistently exceeded a value of three in three different ‘high-FRET’ siRNAs, is strongly dependent on the content of degraded siRNA in a sample, as shown in the calibration curve obtained from mixtures of different ratios of intact and ‘dissociated’ siRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>The curve shown in Figure 2D is normalized to 1 to account for these subtle variations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Its steep initial slope provides a dynamic range from 0% to 10% ‘dissociated’ RNA, which is useful for tracing populations containing high proportions of intact siRNA, while the small changes in between 10% and 100% ‘dissociated’ siRNA do not allow to measure precisely the degradation state of such mixtures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>A small intermediate region of moderate changes of around 10% corresponds to the R/G value of the ‘low-FRET siRNA’, which was further on used as a model compound emulating the spectral properties of ‘partially dissociated’ siRNA, providing an additional calibration point to mark the lower end of the dynamic R/G range.

<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Lipoplexes formed from ‘intact’ siRNA and oligofectamin revealed particular degradation kinetics upon incubation with RNase V1 (Figure 2E): the R/G ratio rapidly dropped to ∼80% of its initial value and then abruptly stabilized, while in degradation of free siRNA it continued to drop quickly out of the dynamic range. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Complete digestion of lipoplexed siRNA was effectively delayed to several hours (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>The initial drop-off in the R/G ratio likely corresponds to degradation of siRNA, which is accessible on the lipoplex surface or not complexed at all. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>For comparison, we have formulated ‘intact’ siRNA into so-called stealth liposomes which are covered with a polyethylene layer to prevent rapid clearance from the blood stream (23). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>A novel DAC technique allows formulation of liposomes with a narrow size distribution of around 100 nm on a very small scale and with high-inclusion yield (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Presumably due to strong light scattering, addition of empty liposomes to a solution of ‘intact’ siRNA reduces the overall fluorescence by a factor of ∼2 (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>The background fluorescence of empty liposomes increases the baseline and consequently decreases the R/G ratio. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Hence, R/G values in the following reactions were normalized to the initial value. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>After a brief initial drop to 80% of the initial R/G value, freshly formulated siRNA-liposomes showed complete resistance to nuclease V1, as indicated by an R/G ratio that remained stable even after 2 h (Figure 2E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>However, formulations of several weeks of age slowly release the siRNA, as shown by gel filtration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the R/G ratio in a V1 degradation of 10-week-old siRNA liposomes rapidly dropped out of the dynamic range (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Investigations of pH dependence showed a strong decrease of overall fluorescence observed in the emission spectra taken at low pH in the cuvette for free siRNA as well as in liposomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Investigations of siRNA labelled with either dye showed that this was due to the known sensitivity of fluorescein towards low pH, while TMR fluorescence was only moderately diminished. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>In summary, the R/G ratio in ‘intact’ and ‘partially dissociated’ siRNA was effectively increased in acidic conditions, showing a minimum around neutral pH (Supplementary Figure S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Consequently, siRNA populations in certain organelles e.g. maturating endosomes and lysosomes are expected to show an increased R/G ratio, but contribute little to the overall fluorescence emission. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>After injection, cells were immediately fixed and then imaged by confocal spectroscopy in spectral mode, i.e. emission spectra of the different siRNA inside the cells ranging from 500 to 650 nm were recorded in 32 bins of 5 nm upon excitation at 488 nm (24). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Areas of interest were defined corresponding to different zones and/or organelles of the cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>As can be seen in Figure 3, R/G ratios of the ‘intact’ siRNAs vary somewhat, depending on whether the zones of interest comprise the entire cell (4.5), the cytoplasm (3.9) or the nucleus only (&lt;5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>In other microinjected cells the R/G ratios of intact siRNA varied between ∼3 and ∼5 in accordance with the variations observed in the cuvette. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Overall, the excellent agreement with the respective spectral properties in the cuvette show that the R/G ratio can be meaningfully interpreted inside cells, despite the potential changes of dye properties due to intracellular variations of lipophilicity and pH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the validity of the calibration curve in Figure 2D inside the cell is clearly demonstrated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>However, the definition of zones of interest (Figure 3), necessary to obtain enough fluorescence signal intensity for spectral analysis, constitutes an important limitation in that it provides poor spatial resolution.

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>For higher spatial resolution, microinjected cells were imaged with a confocal microscope in high spatial resolution mode. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Because of the shape of the fluorescence emission bands, R/G ratios of the same sample vary, depending on the bandwidth of the collected emission light. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Thus, R/G values calculated from spectra recorded from cells in the confocal spectral mode were binned with a bandwidth of 5 nm, meaning that value at 580 nm is generated by photons of wavelengths from 578 to 582 nm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Broadening the bins lowers the spectral resolution, but improves sensitivity, because more photons are collected in the same bin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>In the following, a standard procedure called R/G imaging is developed, where fluorescence light is collected with a bandwidth of 30 nm through the use of a band-pass filter setting in standard confocal mode. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Since the spectral equivalence of siRNAs in the cuvette and in the cells has been demonstrated above, it is no longer necessary to record a full fluorescence emission spectrum as in Figure 3, because the fluorescence wavelength at two selected wavelengths is sufficient to characterize the intactness of the siRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Hence, we now resorted to recording two superimposable images, a green one of the fluorescein emission peak (510–540 nm) and a red one of the TMR emission peak (570–600 nm).

<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>The red segment in the histogram of intact siRNA (lower left in Figure 4) contains &gt;93% of voxels, meaning that imaging these voxels in red accounts for the vast majority of all ‘intact siRNA’. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>The fraction of voxels with an R/G value higher than 2.1 in the ‘dissociated’, and ‘partially dissociated’ siRNA samples (red areas in the respective histograms), show that the probability of assigning ‘false intact’ siRNA to a red voxel is below 3%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Moreover, errors in the localization of clusters of such voxels are exponentially reduced with the number of voxels in a potential cluster: the likelihood that N adjacent voxels are all wrongly identified as intact is ∼(0.03)N and therefore negligible for N &gt; 1. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Inversely, imaging voxels below 1.1 in green accounts for &gt;63% of voxels in the ‘dissociated’ siRNA sample, and creates &lt;3% ‘false dissociated’ (green areas in the respective histograms). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>For the intermediate segment of yellow voxels, assignment to either category is error-prone. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>In the later case, the green voxels would correspond to the cell regions, where the dyes are spatially separated, either by cleavage of the dye from the RNA, or from actual degradation of the siRNA, or by dissociation of sense- and antisense strands. Figure 5, depicting R/G images of cells 48 h post-transfection, shows that this is indeed the case: R/G imaging of cells containing no-FRET and low-FRET siRNAs produces exclusively green images (images of siRNAs labelled with either fluorescein or TMR can be found in Supplementary data, Figure S4). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>However, since they may not reflect a native state of the cell, interpretation of these data in terms of the RNAi-related pathways must be approached with caution. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec><title><text><SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Dye conjugation chemistry and RNAi efficiency </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>In this work, a labelling type of siRNA with two standard dyes was investigated, both of which feature some drawbacks, including in particular the susceptibility of fluorescein to bleaching and to pH variations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>In addition, the emission of TMR coincides with background fluorescence upon excitation at 488 nm in tissue (data not shown) rendering transfer to animals difficult. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>However, the GFP reporter gene assay employed here shows only little impediment of RNAi by the dyes, despite some dispute in the literature about the compatibility of siRNA end labelling with knockdown (13,14,20–22). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Although 5′-labels appear to have a stronger negative effect than 3′-labels, as reported by Chiu and Rana (21) and Ohrt et al. (20), all of our constructs show high enough activity to easily justify their use as models of functionally active siRNAs in cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Of note, two publications describing 5′-modifications as detrimental to knockdown (21) and (20) used 5′-amino groups to which dyes were conjugated by N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)- or tetrafluorophenol-chemistry, while the siRNAs presented here feature peptide bonds instead. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Considering in addition, that these authors did not use fluorescein or TMR dyes, the reasons for discrepancies may well be found in the exact structure of the chemical entity conjugated to the 5′-phosphate, meaning that, while other dyes, such as Cy3 and Cy5, may have more favourable spectral properties, their effect on RNAi is not yet entirely clarified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Indeed, hydrolysis of this linker may occur before or during incorporation of the siRNA into RISC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>In this case, our method would observe the intact siRNA as a prodrug, which is converted to its active form by cellular metabolism. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Features of the imaging techniques </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Fluorescein and TMR are inexpensive; their spectral properties are contained in the standard settings of any fluorescence microscope, and these spectral properties, in particular the communication by FRET, favour the detection of intact, high-FRET siRNA, while being rather insensitive to any amount &gt;10% ‘dissociated’ siRNA in a sample. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>In the cuvette, monitoring the R/G ratio allowed facile observation of siRNA degradation by nuclease, and partial or complete protection therefrom by formulation in lipoplexes and liposomes, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>The degradation kinetics of both formulations are of interest in the design of efficient transfection agents and in the field of siRNA delivery in vivo, which is of growing interest (8). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>R/G imaging enables tracing of populations of un-degraded siRNAs in cells over extended periods of time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>This task was hitherto afflicted with potential artefacts resulting from tracing of mere fluorophores, dissociated from the oligo during its degradation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>Further commonplace criticisms of tracing dye-labelled oligos in cells have been addressed here: neither variations in pH nor a lipophilic environment (such as lipoplexes or liposomes) disturb the of R/G ratio beyond our interpretation limits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>The validity of transferring the R/G concept from the cuvette into cells was thoroughly documented by in-cell spectral imaging, showing virtually identical spectral properties in both environments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>However, in the actual R/G-imaging process, the spectral resolution of fluorescence light emitted inside cells was foregone in favour of high spatial resolution, obtainable with any confocal fluorescence microscope. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Potential applications of the imaging technique </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>The usefulness of our approach was demonstrated by observations of three different modes of siRNA internalization into cells: microinjection, lipoplex-mediated transfection and liposome-mediated transfection, each of which results in nuclear accumulation of intact siRNA soon after its application. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>After a certain lag period, a distribution in the cytoplasm is observed, but no more nuclear fluorescence is in evidence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Perinuclear localization is commonly reported for numerous nucleic acids (25), but this localization now appears to be a hallmark of a rather late stage in various processes of siRNA uptake. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Transport in and out of the nucleus after microinjection has already been reported for antisense agents several years ago (26), and has only very recently been observed for siRNA (12,20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>We show here that this process occurs after standard transfection with lipoplexes and after lipofection with liposomes as well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Previously reported application of (3′–5′) double labelling of an siRNA allowed assessment of integrity of only the labelled strand, but did not address potential strand unwinding during transport (12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Our combination of (3′–5′*) labelling and R/G imaging shows that at least some siRNA molecules end up hybridized in the cytosol after import into and export from the nucleus, suggesting that no helicase is involved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>The observed strong influx and subsequent export raises questions concerning their significance in gene silencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>Indeed, while some triple-strand forming antisense agents act by inhibiting transcription in the nucleus (27), antisense research including siRNA will likely focus primarily on the major silencing pathways acting on mRNAs in the cytoplasm (28). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>The export of siRNA (among other RNAs) from the nucleus was shown to be dependent on exportin-5 (20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>It is thus possible that factors governing the activity of exportin-5 are affected by interventions such as microinjection or transfection, and that our observations reflect a certain trauma on the physiological level of the cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>If so, observation of this phenomenon may be useful in the search of optimized transfection procedures. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Finally, beyond tracing the intact siRNAs after transfection, our method is suited to quantify them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Our first estimates show that a fraction of only ∼1% of the applied amount, corresponding to ∼106 molecules is left intact in the cell 48 h after a standard transfection protocol. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Our imaging tool presented here may prove useful in determining the fate of this still huge reservoir of potentially active siRNAs. </plain></SENT>
