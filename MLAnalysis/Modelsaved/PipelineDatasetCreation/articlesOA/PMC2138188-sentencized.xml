<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Actin polymerization plays a critical role in this process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The leading edge of motile cells is dominated by thin actin-rich structures called lamellipodia, which exhibit highly dynamic behavior characterized by rapid extension and retraction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In lamellipodia, actin filaments are oriented almost exclusively with their fast growing barbed ends facing the membrane (for review see Small, 1988). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Actin polymerization adjacent to the membrane is coupled to protrusion, and may provide the driving force for this process (Hill and Kirschner, 1982; Mogilner and Oster, 1996). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Many aspects of the mechanism of lamellipodial protrusion are echoed in the intracellular motility of certain bacterial and viral pathogens (for review see Cossart, 1995; Theriot, 1995; Higley and Way, 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Of these, the most extensively studied is the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>L. monocytogenes move in arcing trajectories within cell cytoplasm, forming cometlike tails composed of actin filaments oriented with their barbed ends towards the bacterium (Tilney et al., 1992). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Actin polymerization at the bacterial surface is tightly coupled to propulsion (Sanger et al., 1992; Theriot et al., 1992), suggesting that it provides the motile force. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Although a role for myosins in bacterial propulsion and lamellipodial protrusion cannot be definitively ruled out, the myosin inhibitor butanedione monoxime (BDM) which inhibits classic myosin-driven processes such as muscle contraction, does not affect either process (Cramer and Mitchison, 1995). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The central role of actin polymerization in both lamellipodial protrusion and L. monocytogenes propulsion suggests that the underlying mechanisms for promoting polymerization and generating force may be similar in both processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Since L. monocytogenes motility can be reconstituted in cell extracts (Theriot et al., 1994; Laurent and Carlier, 1997; Welch et al., 1997) understanding the biochemical mechanisms that underlie this process has proven more tractable. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>We have recently purified a multiprotein complex from human platelets that induces actin polymerization at the L. monocytogenes cell surface and mediates bacterial motility (Welch et al., 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>This complex contains actin- related proteins in the Arp2 and Arp3 families and therefore was named the Arp2/3 complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In addition to Arp2 and Arp3, the human complex consists of 41/40-, 34-, 21-, 20-, and 16-kD subunits, all present in approximately equal stoichiometry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>These subunits are referred to as p41-Arc, p34-Arc, p21-Arc, p20-Arc, and p16-Arc (Arp complex). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>A similar Arp2/3 complex was first discovered by profilin affinity chromatography of cell extracts from Acanthamoeba castellanii (Machesky et al., 1994). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In addition, Arp2 and Arp3 proteins appear to be found in all eukaryotes (for reviews see Frankel and Mooseker, 1996; Mullins et al., 1996), suggesting that the Arp2/3 complex itself has been conserved through evolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular identities of all but one of the non-Arp subunits have remained undetermined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The exception is p41-Arc, which contains WD (tryptophan and aspartate) repeats and is similar to proteins in the Sop2 family (suppressor of profilin; Machesky et al., 1994; Balasubramanian et al., 1996; McCollum et al., 1996). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which the Arp2/3 complex promotes actin polymerization remains enigmatic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Structural modeling of Arp2 and Arp3 proteins has led to the prediction that the Arp2/3 complex serves as a seed for the nucleation of actin assembly (Kelleher et al., 1995). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Thus far, only filament binding and bundling activity have been observed in vitro (Mullins et al., 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Despite the lack of detailed information regarding mechanism, several lines of evidence indicate that the Arp2/3 complex is important for actin function in cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Subunits of the A. castellanii Arp2/3 complex colocalize with actin in ameba, particularly at sites of dynamic actin assembly at the cell cortex (Machesky et al., 1994; Kelleher et al., 1995; Mullins et al., 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Arp2 and Schizosaccharomyces pombe Arp3 proteins are also localized to cortical actin structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Deletions of their corresponding genes are lethal, and temperature-sensitive mutations cause defects in actin function (Lees-Miller et al., 1992; Schwob and Martin, 1992; McCollum et al., 1996; Moreau et al., 1996). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In this study we have begun to explore the function of the Arp2/3 complex in animal cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>We have determined the complete amino acid sequence of all seven subunits of the human complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Each protein has homologues in diverse eukaryotic organisms, indicating that the subunit composition, and most likely the function of the Arp2/3 complex, have been conserved through evolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The ability of the complex to promote actin assembly and mediate L. monocytogenes motility suggests that it may play a corresponding role in cellular lamellipodia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>In fact, multiple subunits of the complex are localized to L. monocytogenes assembled actin clouds and tails as well as to lamellipodia in stationary and motile fibroblast cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>These subunits are absent from less dynamic actin filament bundles in fibroblasts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Our observations further strengthen the analogy between L. monocytogenes motility and lamellipodial protrusion and suggest that the Arp2/3 complex plays a central role in both processes. </plain></SENT>
