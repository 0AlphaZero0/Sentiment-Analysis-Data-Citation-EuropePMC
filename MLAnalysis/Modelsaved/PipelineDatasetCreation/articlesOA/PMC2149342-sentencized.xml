<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After transfer to protein, the N-linked oligosaccharide (NLO),1 while present in the ER, is subject to trimming reactions (see Fig. 1) involving glucosidase I, glucosidase II, and mannosidase I (Herscovics and Orlean, 1993; Moremen et al., 1994; Roth, 1995). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In higher eukaryotes, a specific role of the trimming intermediate Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide in the ER quality control process has been proposed (Helenius et al., 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>An incorrectly folded glycoprotein bearing such an oligosaccharide structure is bound by specific ER resident proteins and retained in a folding competent environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Correctly folded glycoproteins can exit the ER, enter the Golgi apparatus, and are delivered to their final destination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, improperly folded glycoproteins are retained in the ER and are eventually degraded. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In many cases, degradation occurs via the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway that requires their exit from the ER lumen to the cytosol as shown both in higher eukaryotic cells and in yeast (Jentsch and Schlenker, 1995; Bonifacino, 1996; Kopito, 1997; Sommer and Wolf, 1997; Varshavsky, 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>For the export to the cytosol, constituents of the ER translocon play an important role (Pilon et al., 1997; Plemper et al., 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Additionally, ER proteins such as the chaperone Kar2p (Plemper et al., 1997), as well as the ubiquitin-conjugating proteins Ubc6p and Ubc7p, are thought to be involved in this process (Biederer et al., 1996; Hiller et al., 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the proteolysis of nonglycosylated α-factor is ATP and cytosol-dependent (McCracken and Brodsky, 1996) and also mutated and therefore misfolded carboxypeptidase Y (prc1-1, CPY*; Wolf and Fink, 1975; Finger et al., 1993) has been shown to enter the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway (Hiller et al., 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The degradation of the misfolded protein appears to be glycosylation dependent, since nonglycosylated CPY* remains stable in the ER (Knop et al., 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the degradation also appears to be mannosidase I–dependent (Knop et al., 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Despite this, the molecular signals required for the initiation of ER glycoprotein degradation are not known. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>We investigated the possible role of specific oligosaccharide structures in degradation of CPY* by genetic tailoring of the protein-bound oligosaccharide structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>We found that the Man8GlcNAc2 structure as the final product of the trimming reaction in the ER in yeast (Byrd et al., 1982) was mandatory for efficient degradation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the ER α1,2-mannosidase represents a key enzyme for timing the onset of degradation. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>To understand in more detail the role of NLO in glycoprotein degradation, we determined the kinetics of protein-bound oligosaccharide trimming in the ER in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>For this, two yeast strains that carry the sec18-50 mutation were used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>The sec18-50 mutation results in a temperature-sensitive phenotype and prevents the fusion of ER-derived vesicles with the Golgi apparatus at nonpermissive temperature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>No processing of protein-bound oligosaccharides by Golgi glycosyltransferases was observed in sec18 mutant strains at nonpermissive conditions (Novick et al., 1980; Eakle et al., 1988). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>We performed the experiments at the permissive temperature for the sec18-50 mutation, nevertheless, the export rate of secretory proteins to the Golgi apparatus was slower in sec18-50 cells as compared with wild-type cells and we were able to analyze the trimming of the NLO in the ER. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>One of the strains carried in addition a deletion in the GLS2 locus inactivating glucosidase II. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>No growth phenotype was associated with the Δgls2 mutation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Cells were labeled with 3H-mannose for 1 min at 26°C and the radioactivity was chased by adding an excess of nonradioactive (±)D-mannose. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>At the given time points, the chase was terminated, NLO were released from protein by endoglycosidase H (endo H), and then analyzed by HPLC (see Materials and Methods section). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>In the Δgls2 strain, only two trimming events occur in the ER: the removal of the terminal α1,2-linked glucose residue by glucosidase I and the cleavage of an α1,2-linked mannose residue by mannosidase I. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>As expected, a protein-bound oligosaccharide with the putative structure Glc2Man9GlcNAc2 (G2M9)2 was found, which was slowly converted to Glc2Man8GlcNAc2 (G2M8) with a half-life of ∼10 min (Fig. 2, A and B, left). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>We were unable to detect protein-bound Glc3Man9GlcNAc2. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the structure of the different oligosaccharides in more detail. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>The endo H–released Glc2Man9GlcNAc2 NLO comigrated with the Glc2Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide obtained from endo H–treated LLO of a Δalg10 strain (Fig. 2 C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>This strain accumulates lipid-linked Glc2Man9 GlcNAc2 due to the inactivation of the α1,2 glucosyltransferase (Burda and Aebi, 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Digestion of the two major protein-derived oligosaccharides from a Δgls2 sec18-50 strain by exo-α1,2-mannosidase (from Aspergillus saitoi) converted both of them to a single species (Fig. 2 C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the two oligosaccharides found on protein in a Δgls2 sec18 strain differed by one α1,2-linked mannose. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>This observation, the mobility of the exo-α1,2-mannosidase digestion product and the comigration of one oligosaccharide with the Glc2Man9GlcNAc2 marker showed that protein bound Glc2Man9GlcNAc2 and the corresponding mannosidase product Glc2Man8GlcNAc2 were present in the Δgls2 sec18-50 strain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>The minor peak observed after exo-α1,2-mannosidase digestion (Fig. 2 C, left) was possibly due to incomplete digestion, since the presence of glucose residues on oligosaccharides reduced the efficiency of the enzyme (Burda, P., unpublished data). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the results confirmed that release of the α1,2-linked glucose from protein-bound oligosaccharide by glucosidase I was a rapid process in the Δgls2 strain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>However, trimming of the oligosaccharide by endogenous α1,2-mannosidase (Mns1p) occurred much slower. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>When we analyzed the NLO processing in a strain fully competent for trimming (sec18-50; Fig. 2, right), we were again unable to detect the complete protein-bound Glc3 Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide, even in preparations obtained shortly after the pulse (Fig. 2, A and B, right). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>The largest oligosaccharide, detected after 2 min of chase (1-min pulse), comigrated with the Glc2Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide but represented a minor fraction (&lt;10%) of the total NLO. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>In contrast, significant amounts of Glc1 Man9GlcNAc2 were detected at this time point (the structural analysis of this oligosaccharide is described below). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>However, from this oligosaccharide one or two hexose units were rapidly trimmed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>To determine whether this trimming was due to glucosidase II or mannosidase I activity, we analyzed the NLO preparation from the 5-min chase point by digestion with the exo-α1,2-mannosidase (Fig. 2 C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>This preparation contained small amounts of oligosaccharides comigrating with the Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 standard and significant levels of oligosaccharides that migrated as expected for Man9GlcNAc2 and Man8GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Indeed, digestion by exo-α1,2-mannosidase revealed that only the Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharides contained a protective glucose residue and was converted to Glc1Man7GlcNAc2, whereas the majority of the oligosaccharides was trimmed to Man5GlcNAc2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>These results showed that the Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 protein-bound oligosaccharide was converted primarily to Man9GlcNAc2 and that the peak representing this oligosaccharide contained no significant amounts of mannosidase I–trimmed, monoglucosylated oligosaccharide. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>The analysis of the structure of protein-bound oligosaccharide species as well as their temporal appearance showed that the removal of the terminal α1,2-glucose on protein-bound oligosaccharides by glucosidase I was a rapid process in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Similarly, since we observed only small amounts of diglucosylated oligosaccharides (Fig. 2, A and B, 2-min chase), the hydrolysis of the first α1,3-linked glucose by glucosidase II was a rapid process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>We concluded that under our experimental conditions, the monoglucosylated oligosaccharide Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 was converted to the Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide with a half-life of ∼2 min and that this occurred before processing by mannosidase I, which was a relatively slow process (half-life 10 min). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Evidently, removal of glucose-linked residues was not a prerequisite for mannosidase I action because mannose hydrolysis occurred with approximately the same kinetics in both glucosidase II–proficient or –deficient strains (Fig. 2 B). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>A similar stabilization of CPY* as in Δmns1 cells was observed in Δalg9 and Δalg12 cells, where incompletely mannosylated oligosaccharides (Man6GlcNAc2 and Man7GlcNAc2, respectively) were transferred to protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>In Δalg3 cells, which contain protein-bound Man5Glc NAc2, degradation of CPY* was reduced, however, not to the same extent as in Δalg9 or Δalg12 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in Δalg6 cells, where nonglucosylated oligosaccharide Man9GlcNAc2 was transferred to protein and trimmed to Man8GlcNAc2, no effect on the stabilization of CPY* was observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>We concluded, that the protein-bound Man8GlcNAc2 structure was an important recognition element in the degradation pathway of CPY*. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Our results were best explained by a model (Fig. 7) where the Man8GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide on a misfolded glycoprotein acted as a positive signal for degradation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>This oligosaccharide structure might be recognized by a lectin, since any changes in its structure reduced the efficiency of degradation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Such a carbohydrate-binding protein has also been postulated in the degradation of glycoproteins in mammalian cells (Yang et al., 1998) and might represent “the additional signal to direct them (soluble misfolded proteins) to the dislocation and the ubiquitation machinery” (Kopito, 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that glucosylated oligosaccharides also reduced the degradation rate of CPY*, albeit to a lesser extent than the Man9GlcNAc2, Man7GlcNAc2 and Man6GlcNAc2 structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>We concluded that the α1,2-α1,2-dimannose branch of the Man8 GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide was a less important structural element for oligosaccharide recognition than both the α1,6- and α1,3-branch affected by the alg3, alg9 and alg12 mutations (see Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>The observation that the Man5 GlcNAc2-producing Δalg3 mutation had a less severe effect on degradation was explained by the hypothesis that this oligosaccharide structure represents an intermediate in the degradation of glycoprotein as shown in higher eukaryotic cells (Villers et al., 1994; Ermonval et al., 1997). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Whether the postulated lectin additionally recognizes unfolded protein domains, as does UDP-glucose/glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, involved in the ER quality control pathway of higher eukaryotes (Sousa and Parodi, 1995), is not known. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>It is possible that the binding of both, the chaperones and the postulated lectin constitute a signal which targets the glycoprotein to the degradation pathway. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>This timer function might be required to prevent permanent residence of misfolded glycoproteins in the ER due to the binding to calnexin and calreticulin in higher eukaryotes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Our results are fully compatible with this timer model: as in higher eukaryotic cells (Hubbard and Robbins, 1979), the protein bound oligosaccharide underwent a step-wise trimming process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Removal of the terminal α1,2-glucose by glucosidase I and the first α1,3-glucose by glucosidase II was a very rapid process, whereas the second α1,3-glucose was removed more slowly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>The same difference in glucose hydrolysis was observed for glucosidase II of higher eukaryotic cells (Hubbard and Robbins, 1979) and it has been proposed that two different substrate binding sites of glucosidase II are responsible for this difference: the high affinity site would be responsible for the hydrolysis of the first glucose, the low affinity site for the hydrolysis of the second glucose (Alonso et al., 1993). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Similar to the findings in higher eukaryotic cells, the mannose trimming was a slow process as compared with hydrolysis of the glucose residues of the protein-bound oligosaccharide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>The removal of one specific α1,2-mannose residue by ER-α1,2-mannosidase might represent the time-point after which a misfolded protein is routed to the degradation pathway. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>However, there are additional ER mannosidase activities in the ER of higher eukaryotic cells and a different Man8GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide isomer, where the α1,2-mannose linked to the α1,6-mannose is removed, can be produced (Weng and Spiro, 1993, 1996; Moremen et al., 1994). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>The trimming process in higher eukaryotes is therefore more complex than in yeast. </plain></SENT>
