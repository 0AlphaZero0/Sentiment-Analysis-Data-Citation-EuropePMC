</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Polarity is a common feature of many different cell types and is the prerequisite for various processes including vectorial transport of molecules, directed cell migration, and asymmetric cell division. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Epithelial cells, for example, possess apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains that are distinguished from each other by their different lipid and protein composition (Rodriguez-Boulan and Nelson 1989; Drubin and Nelson 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Similar differences exist between axonal and somatodendritic membrane domains of neurons (Foletti et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>1999; Winckler and Mellman 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Polarity is not restricted to the plasma membrane but can also be observed in the underlying cytocortex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Examples of cell types with pronounced cortical polarity are the blastomeres of the early Caenorhabditis elegans embryo (Bowerman and Shelton 1999) and Drosophila neuroblasts (Lu et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>1998). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms leading to the generation of cell polarity are just beginning to emerge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Membrane proteins and lipids are sorted in the trans Golgi network and are subsequently delivered to distinct regions of the plasma membrane via vesicular transport (Ikonen and Simons 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The cytocortex may acquire polarity by interaction of cortical proteins with certain membrane lipids; e.g., by binding of proteins containing pleckstrin homology domains to phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) trisphosphate or by binding to the cytoplasmic tails of transmembrane proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Vice versa, the correct localization of many transmembrane proteins depends on binding to cortical proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>So far, it is not known whether membrane polarity can be established in the absence of cortical polarity or whether both processes are strictly dependent on each other. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="?"><plain>How are the different membrane domains separated from each other in polarized cells? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In vertebrate epithelia, the tight junction (TJ) is considered to be the boundary between apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains (Stevenson and Keon 1998; Tsukita et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In addition, TJs create a paracellular seal that prevents the free diffusion of macromolecules in the extracellular space between cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>At the ultrastructural level, TJs are characterized by the fusion of the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of adjacent cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The formation of TJs depends on transmembrane proteins of the claudin family (Furuse et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>1998; Tsukita and Furuse 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Claudins and occludin, another transmembrane protein of the TJ, associate with several cortical proteins (ZO-1, ZO-2, ZO-3, and cingulin) that form a link with the actin cytoskeleton (Stevenson and Keon 1998; Tsukita and Furuse 1999; Tsukita et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>1999). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In contrast to vertebrate epithelial cells, neurons do not possess TJs, but nonetheless establish and maintain separate axonal and somatodendritic plasma membrane domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The border between these membrane domains is located at the initial axonal segment (Winckler and Mellman 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Measurements of the force required to move transmembrane and GPI-linked proteins in the plane of the membrane revealed that the lateral mobility of both classes of proteins is strongly reduced in the initial segment (Winckler et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Treatment with the actin depolymerizing drug latrunculin B disrupts the diffusion barrier in this region (Winckler et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>1999), suggesting that the submembraneous cytoskeleton plays an important role in maintenance of neuronal cell surface polarity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Like neurons, most epithelial tissues in arthropods lack TJs, despite being highly polarized (Tepass and Hartenstein 1994; Müller 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that the septate junction (SJ) could be the functional equivalent of TJs in arthropods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>This may be true at least in some cases for the sealing of the paracellular space (Skaer et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>1987; Baumgartner et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>1996), but the SJ is probably not responsible for the formation of a diffusion barrier in the plasma membrane. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>In Drosophila, the separation of apical and basolateral membrane domains can already be observed at the time of gastrulation (3 h after egg laying) (Müller and Wieschaus 1996), while SJs form much later (11 h after egg laying) (Tepass and Hartenstein 1994). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the septate junction forms basally of the zonula adherens (ZA), a belt-like adhesive junction around the apex of epithelial cells, whereas the border between the apical and the basolateral plasma membrane domain is located at the apical end of the ZA (Tepass 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="?"><plain>So how is the separation of apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains achieved in Drosophila epithelia? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Double mutants lacking zygotic expression of the genes stardust (sdt) and bazooka (baz) fail to establish plasma membrane polarity after cellularization of the Drosophila embryo (Müller and Wieschaus 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>This phenotype is characterized by expression of the basolateral marker Neurotactin (Nrt) on the whole cell surface and mislocalization of the ZA component Armadillo (Arm). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in sdt, baz double mutants, the monolayered organization of the blastoderm epithelium is lost and cells acquire irregular shapes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>These morphological changes are reminiscent of those seen during epithelial-mesenchymal transitions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Essentially, the same phenotype as in sdt, baz double mutants is observed in baz mutants lacking maternal and zygotic Bazooka (Baz), whereas zygotic sdt and baz single mutants show a weaker phenotype later in development (Tepass and Knust 1993; Grawe et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>1996; Müller and Wieschaus 1996; Kuchinke et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that baz is absolutely required for establishment of plasma membrane polarity and epithelial morphology, whereas the early function of sdt may be partially redundant with that of baz. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>baz is also required for establishment of apico-basal polarity and asymmetric division of neuroblasts in the developing central nervous system (CNS). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Neuroblasts delaminate from the neuroectodermal epithelium and undergo several rounds of asymmetric cell division, generating a ganglion mother cell and another neuroblast in each division. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Before division, the mitotic spindle rotates by 90° and localization of the cell fate determinants Prospero and Numb becomes restricted to the basal cortex of the neuroblast. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>These events are prerequisites for proper segregation of Prospero and Numb into the ganglion mother cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>From delamination to early anaphase, Baz is localized in the apical cortex of neuroblasts, where it forms a complex with Inscuteable (Insc) (Schober et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>1999; Wodarz et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>1999), a protein required for rotation of the mitotic spindle and correct localization of Prospero and Numb (Kraut and Campos-Ortega 1996; Kraut et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>1996; Kaltschmidt et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>2000; reviewed in Jan and Jan 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>In the absence of Baz, asymmetric cortical localization of Insc is abolished, leading to randomized spindle orientation and mislocalization of cell fate determinants (Schober et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>1999; Wodarz et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>These data led to the conclusion that apico-basal polarity in neuroblasts depends on maintenance of apical Baz expression and is thus inherited from the neuroectodermal epithelium. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>baz encodes a protein with three PDZ domains which shows significant sequence similarity along its entire length to Par-3 (Caenorhabditis elegans) and ASIP (rat) (Etemad-Moghadam et al. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>1998; Kuchinke et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>In the early C. elegans embryo, Par-3 is asymmetrically localized in the anterior cortex of the zygote and of blastomeres that undergo asymmetric cell divisions (Etemad-Moghadam et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>1995). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>In these cells, Par-3 controls spindle orientation and asymmetric localization of cell fate determinants (Etemad-Moghadam et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>1995; reviewed in Rose and Kemphues 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Later on, Par-3 is also expressed in the apical cortex of the embryonic gut epithelium (O. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Bossinger, personal communication). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Par-3 binds to PKC-3, an atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) isoform (Tabuse et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>1998; Wu et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Both proteins are mutually dependent on each other for correct cortical localization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Moreover, embryos depleted of PKC-3 by RNA interference show a very similar phenotype to par-3 mutant embryos (Tabuse et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>ASIP was isolated as a binding partner of the mammalian aPKC isoforms, PKCλ and PKCζ (Izumi et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, ASIP and PKCλ colocalize at the TJ in vertebrate epithelial cells (Izumi et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that the association of ASIP/Par-3 with aPKCs is functionally important and evolutionarily conserved. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>We have identified an aPKC from Drosophila (DaPKC) that shows very high sequence similarity to PKCλ and PKCζ from vertebrates and PKC-3 from C. elegans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>DaPKC and Baz coimmunoprecipitate and directly bind to each other in a yeast two-hybrid assay. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>In embryos, both proteins colocalize in the apical cortex of almost all epithelial tissues and in neuroblasts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Apical localization of DaPKC in epithelia and neuroblasts is abolished in baz mutants, and vice versa, Baz is delocalized in DaPKC mutants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>We show that the phenotype of DaPKC loss-of-function mutants resembles that of baz mutants, consistent with a close functional interdependence of both proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Together, our data provide the first in vivo evidence for an essential role of an atypical protein kinase C isoform in establishment and maintenance of epithelial and neuronal polarity. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>1997; Xu et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>InaD contains five PDZ domains and distinct binding partners have been identified for each of them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, all of the proteins that bind to InaD are part of the phototransduction cascade in the Drosophila eye (Tsunoda et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>1997; Xu et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>Thus, it has been proposed that InaD provides a scaffold for the assembly of a signaling complex, a so called “transducisome.” </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>In the case of DaPKC and Baz, the situation is more complicated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>Consistent with a function as a scaffold, Baz is required for localization of the signaling protein DaPKC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>However, Baz itself is not properly localized in the absence of DaPKC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="?"><plain>It is easy to imagine how a structural multi-PDZ domain protein like InaD or Baz can localize a protein kinase, but how can DaPKC be responsible for localization and stabilization of Baz? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>Baz possesses a PKC consensus phosphorylation site that is conserved between Baz, Par-3, and ASIP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of this site by DaPKC could be important to regulate binding of Baz to other proteins or to protect Baz from proteolytic degradation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>It is also possible that DaPKC binds simultaneously to Baz and another protein that may be required for localization of Baz. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>A detailed structure–function analysis of both Baz and DaPKC will be necessary to clarify this issue. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the DaPKC loss-of-function phenotype revealed that DaPKC is already required very early during embryogenesis, before the onset of zygotic transcription. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>Most homozygous DaPKCk06403 embryos with a reduced maternal dosage of DaPKC die before cellularization is completed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="313" pm="?"><plain>What could be the reason for this early death? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>aPKCs have been implicated in the control of apoptotic cell death in vertebrate tissue culture cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of aPKCs induces apoptosis (Diaz-Meco et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>Treatment of cells with UV irradiation also triggers apoptosis and rapidly inhibits aPKC kinase activity, suggesting that inhibition of aPKCs is an early event in the apoptotic signaling cascade (Berra et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>In accordance with these data, aPKCs have been implicated in the transduction of survival signals downstream of growth factor receptors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>In contrast to conventional and novel PKC isoforms, aPKCs can be activated by phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)trisphosphate and ceramide, two second messengers that are generated in response to inflammatory cytokines and growth factors (Nakanishi et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>1993; Lozano et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>1994; Akimoto et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>Our observation that DaPKC mutant embryos show premature cell death and strongly increased TUNEL labeling (A. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>Wodarz, unpublished observations), which is a hallmark of apoptosis, is consistent with a function of DaPKC in the transmission of survival signals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>A detailed analysis of the role of DaPKC in the control of cell death in Drosophila is beyond the scope of this work and will be addressed in a future publication. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>The loss-of-function phenotype of DaPKC mutants in epithelia is very similar to the phenotypes described for baz null mutants and zygotic sdt, baz double mutants (Müller and Wieschaus 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>The most striking abnormalities in these mutants are loss of the monolayered epithelial organization, irregular cell shapes, and loss of plasma membrane polarity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>Multilayering of epithelia and abnormal cell shapes are most likely caused by defects in cell adhesion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>Indeed, formation of the ZA, a region of intense, cadherin-mediated cell contact, is defective in DaPKC, baz, and sdt mutants (Grawe et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>1996; Müller and Wieschaus 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>Another gene, crb, is also required for correct positioning and maintenance of the ZA (Wodarz et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>1995; Grawe et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>1996; Tepass 1996; reviewed in Müller 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="335" pm="?"><plain>DaPKC, Baz, and Crb are all localized apically of the ZA (Tepass 1996; this work), so how can they control formation of the ZA? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>Crb, a transmembrane protein (Tepass et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>1990) binds via its cytoplasmic tail to the cortical multi-PDZ domain protein Discs Lost (Bhat et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>1999; Klebes and Knust 2000), which probably associates with additional proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>This complex could be involved in the formation of a protein scaffold in the apical cytocortex that prevents ZA components from moving further apically. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>A similar function can be envisioned for Baz, since it is also a multi-PDZ domain protein with the capacity to interact with several partners at the same time. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="341" pm="?"><plain>How does DaPKC fit into this model? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>As discussed above, DaPKC is required for localization and stabilization of Baz, but this may not be its only function in ZA formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="343" pm="."><plain>Several reports show that PKCs are involved in the assembly of adherens junctions and TJs (Lewis et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>1994; Citi and Denisenko 1995; Stuart and Nigam 1995; van Hengel et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>The majority of these studies used cultured cell lines and analyzed the effects of different inhibitors and agonists of PKCs on localization and phosphorylation of junctional proteins, cell adhesion, and cell morphology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>Although these studies provided compelling evidence for an involvement of PKCs in junction formation, in most cases neither the specific PKC isoforms responsible for the observed phenotypes nor the targets of these PKCs have been unambiguously identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>In one interesting study, inhibition of aPKCs induced epithelial-mesenchymal transformation in quail neural tube explants, while inhibitors of conventional or novel PKCs had little or no effect in this assay (Minichiello et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>1999). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>In addition to their effects on epithelial organization and cell shape, mutations in DaPKC, baz, sdt, and crb also affect plasma membrane polarity (Wodarz et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>1993, Wodarz et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="352" pm="."><plain>1995; Müller and Wieschaus 1996; Klebes and Knust 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="353" pm="."><plain>As discussed in the Introduction, establishment and maintenance of plasma membrane polarity requires the separation of apical and basolateral membrane domains by a diffusion barrier in the plane of the membrane. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="354" pm="."><plain>In vertebrate epithelia, this diffusion barrier is created by the TJ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="355" pm="."><plain>In arthropod epithelia, TJs have not been found by ultrastructural analysis (Tepass and Hartenstein 1994). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="356" pm="."><plain>We note, however, that the vertebrate homologues of DaPKC and Baz, PKCλ, PKCζ, and ASIP, are localized at the TJ in epithelial cells (Izumi et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="357" pm="."><plain>1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="358" pm="."><plain>Moreover, DaPKC and Baz are localized apically to the ZA in Drosophila epithelia, which corresponds to the position of the TJ in vertebrate epithelia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="359" pm="."><plain>Thus, based on their localization and their mutant phenotypes, we propose that DaPKC and Baz are components of an evolutionarily conserved protein complex that may serve similar functions as the TJ in vertebrates. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="360" pm="."><plain>Neuroblasts do not possess elaborate cell junctions but clearly show cortical and, at least to some extent, plasma membrane polarity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="361" pm="."><plain>DaPKC and Baz are required for anchoring Insc in the apical neuroblast cortex (Schober et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="362" pm="."><plain>1999; Wodarz et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="363" pm="."><plain>1999; this work) and it is conceivable that DaPKC and Baz may also be involved in the formation of a submembraneous protein scaffold analogous to the model we have proposed for epithelia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="364" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this idea is the finding that Nrt staining is reduced precisely in those regions of the neuroblast plasma membrane where DaPKC and Baz are localized beneath the membrane. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="365" pm="."><plain>Thus, DaPKC and Baz may be generally responsible for the separation of membrane domains by preventing diffusion of basolateral proteins into the apical domain. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="366" pm="."><plain>From the available data, it is impossible to decide whether the primary function of DaPKC in neuroblasts is the stabilization of Baz or whether DaPKC phosphorylates additional targets involved in asymmetric division of neuroblasts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="367" pm="."><plain>One candidate for phosphorylation by DaPKC is Miranda, an adaptor protein with six consensus PKC phosphorylation sites that binds to Prospero and Insc (Ikeshima-Kataoka et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="368" pm="."><plain>1997; Shen et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="369" pm="."><plain>1997, Shen et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="370" pm="."><plain>1998; Schuldt et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="371" pm="."><plain>1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="372" pm="."><plain>Miranda colocalizes with Insc only briefly in late interphase, and then moves together with Prospero to the basal cortex of the neuroblast during prophase (Shen et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="373" pm="."><plain>1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="374" pm="."><plain>It is an attractive possibility that phosphorylation of Miranda by DaPKC regulates binding of Miranda to Insc and its release from the apical complex later in the cell cycle. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="375" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we have shown that DaPKC is an essential binding partner of Baz in epithelia and neuroblasts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="376" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, Baz does not simply function as a scaffold to anchor DaPKC in the apical cytocortex, but is itself dependent on DaPKC for proper localization and stability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="377" pm="."><plain>This mutual dependence is indicative of an intimate cross-talk between structural proteins like Baz and the signaling protein DaPKC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="378" pm="."><plain>The link between signal transduction components and structural components of the cytocortex may be important to allow rapid rearrangement of cellular junctions and cell shape changes such as those occurring during delamination of neuroblasts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="379" pm="."><plain>To fully understand the role of DaPKC in the generation of cellular asymmetry, it will be essential to identify the physiological activators, inhibitors, and downstream targets of this important protein kinase. </plain></SENT>
