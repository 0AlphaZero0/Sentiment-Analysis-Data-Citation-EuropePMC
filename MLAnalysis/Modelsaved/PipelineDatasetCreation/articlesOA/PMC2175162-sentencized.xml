</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>One of the best characterized integrin–ligand interactions is α5β1 binding to fibronectin (FN). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The RGD sequence in the FN III domain 10 (FN10) is the key binding site for α5β1 (Pierschbacher and Ruoslahti 1984), but it also has been found that the FN III domain 9 (FN9) contributes importantly to adhesion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Although FN9 has no adhesive activity by itself, it causes an ∼100-fold increase in cell adhesion to FN via α5β1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Thus, the adhesive region in FN9 has been called the synergy site (Obara et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>1988; Kimizuka et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>1991; Aota et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>1994). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The synergy site in FN9 has been mapped using a series of chimeric FN9-10 fragments in which regions of FN9 were replaced with the equivalent residues from FN8 (Aota et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>1994). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>These homology scanning mutants revealed the importance of P1376-N1380 (PHSRN) to the synergy effect, and site-directed mutagenesis showed that R1379 was a key residue in the synergy site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>An R1374/ R1379 double mutant also had a dramatic effect on synergy, and the authors concluded that R1374 and PHSRN were the major components of the synergy site (Aota et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>1994). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The integrin αIIbβ3 apparently uses a similar synergy site, since the peptide DRVPHSRNSIT inhibited binding of FN to this integrin (Bowditch et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>1994). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The requirement of the synergy site for maximum adhesion to the FN via α5β1 is not absolute, however, since fully activated α5β1 binds equally well to fibronectin fragments in which the classic PHSRN synergy site was highly mutated (Danen et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>1995). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>This abrogation of the need for the synergy site by integrin activation also extends to matrix assembly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>FN with a synergy mutation was shown to be poorly incorporated into matrix, yet exogenous activation of integrins stimulated incorporation of the mutant FN into the extracellular matrix (Sechler et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The synergy site has been shown to have a physiological role in Xenopus development, as an antibody against it blocked gastrulation (Ramos and DeSimone 1996). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The three-dimensional structure of the FN III domains 7–10 (FN7–10) revealed that the PHSRN site and the RGD loop are ∼35 Å apart but are on the same side of the FN molecule (Leahy et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>1996), suggesting that both sites can contact the same integrin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The orientation and positioning of the FN III domains with respect to each other would be critical if the integrin binding includes both sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Insertion of short (2–6 amino acid) linkers between domains 9 and 10 significantly decreased cell adhesion (Grant et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The introduction of the linkers could result in reduced adhesion by altering the distance between the RGD and the synergy site, by allowing more random rotation of the two domains, or by a combination of these effects. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Since the PHSRN and RGD sites are separated by 35 Å, we considered the possibility that amino acids in this intervening surface, other than PHSRN, might contribute to the synergy site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Using the three-dimensional structure of FN7–10 as a guide, we identified candidate amino acids based on the following two criteria: (1) that they face in the same direction as RGD and PHSRN (toward the integrin); and (2) that they project from the protein surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>We made a series of single site-directed mutants, further combined them in pairs and triplets, and tested each of the recombinant proteins for cell adhesion. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>We have found that R1379 of the PHSRN site is a major component of the synergy site, but mutating several other residues on the surface of FN9 also significantly reduced the synergy effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Some residues had no observable effect when mutated singly, yet they reduced cell adhesiveness when combined with other mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>In all cases, combining mutations augmented the effects of deleterious single mutations, particularly when the combination included R1379A. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>In brief, the wells of a 96-well plate were coated with 20 μg/ml (high FN) or 0.8 μg/ml (low FN) solutions (in PBS) of the proteins to be tested and blocked with 10 mg/ml BSA in PBS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Activated K-562 cells were labeled with rhodamine B isothiocyanate (Sigma Chemical Co.), and 104 cells were plated into each well of the 96-well plate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>The wells were filled with medium and sealed with transparent tape (3M book tape). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>A swinging bucket centrifuge fitted with microplate carriers was used to subject the plate to a force of 50× G for 5 min at 4°C, gently forcing the cells into contact with the substrate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>The plate was immediately inverted and the same force was applied for 5 min at 4°C to dislodge the cells that did not adhere to the substrate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>The inverted plate was examined by fluorescence microscopy using either a Nikon Axiophot or Axioplan microscope equipped with a Star 1 digital camera (Photometrics Inc.). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>A digital image of the central 44% of each well was captured and examined using the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the National Institutes of Health and available on the internet at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Thresholding and particle analysis were used to count the number of bound cells in the imaged area of each well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>The number of cells bound to a set of four wells (see below) was normalized to the number of cells bound to a set of four FN7–10-coated wells on the same plate. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>We used tissue culture–treated polystyrene 96-well plates (Costar #3596; Costar Corp.) for our assays since we could not get reproducibly uniform protein coating of the PVC plates that were used in the original assay. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>On the PVC plates, we frequently observed a bull's-eye effect: cells bound preferentially around the edge of the well and to a spot in the center, leaving a cell-free annulus between the central spot and the edge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Occasionally, we also noticed a reverse bull's-eye in our BSA-coated control wells: a cell-covered annulus between a cell-free central spot and the cell-free well edge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Both effects were exacerbated by a low protein concentration, and this unpredictably uneven cell distribution prevented any sort of quantitative analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>On the polystyrene plates, we rarely saw this sort of annular cell distribution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Thanks to the rimmed well design of the polystyrene plates, we were able to plate cells into all 96 wells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>We noticed that the wells on the outside of the plate tended to have cells accumulate toward the outside edge, with a consequent depletion toward the inside edge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>This effect can be explained by the radial distribution of G forces. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>In the center of the plate, the G force is precisely perpendicular to the surface of the well but, at the edges, it acquires a small component parallel to the surface and toward the outside of the plate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>This is a small effect, but to eliminate the associated error, we arranged the wells so that each substrate was coated on a set of four wells, on one side of the 8-well row, and we averaged these four wells to give a set average. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>We used the centrifugation assay of McClay and Hertzler 1999 to measure adhesion because it gives a reproducible quantitative measure of receptor–ligand interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>The forces experienced by the cells during the centrifugation assay are limited to those applied by the centrifuge, unlike the uncharacterized fluid shear forces generated by pipetting and washing during the more traditional assay. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>In addition, most cell adhesion assays include an incubation at 37°C, usually for 30–60 min, during which the cells spread on the adhesive substrate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>The cytoskeletal coupling that occurs during spreading makes the cells more rigid, therefore, more resistant to detachment, even though the number and strength of ligand–receptor interactions may be unchanged. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>1994 have demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis that R1379, in the PHSRN sequence, was a critical component of the synergy site, and demonstrated that the nearby R1374 was also important. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Based on the three-dimensional atomic structure (Leahy et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>1996), we selected these two and five additional amino acids in FN9 as likely candidates to contribute to integrin binding, based on a geometry projecting them toward the integrin (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Each of these residues is highly conserved in all seven species for which FN has been sequenced (Fig. 1), and we found all of them to be fully exposed to solvent beyond the beta carbon. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>All of our mutations replaced the side chain with the single methyl group of alanine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>We began by replacing R1374 and R1379 with A, both singly and in tandem. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>These mutations confirmed that R1379 makes a significant contribution to the synergy effect, as R1379A reduced cell adhesion to ∼75% of that to wild-type FN7–10 (Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>R1374 makes a smaller contribution to this effect, as R1374A reduced adhesion to ∼85% of the wild type (Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>We also confirmed the observation of Aota et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>1994 that the effects of R1374A and R1379A were additive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Adhesion to the double mutant was ∼55% of adhesion to wild-type FN7–10 (Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Although the data of Aota et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>1994 suggested that only R1379 of the PHRSN sequence was critical for the synergistic effect, all of their mutants contained a proline at either position 1376 or 1377. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>To test the importance of proline in the PHSRN site, we made the triple mutant R1374A/P1376A/R1379A. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Cell adhesion to this mutant protein was essentially destroyed (Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>For a control, we constructed a protein in which the RGD sequence was deleted (we deleted the four amino acids RGDS, as the three-dimensional structure showed that this deletion would cause minimal distortion of the domain). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>We also tested FN10, a single domain protein that lacks the synergy domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Both ΔRGDS and FN10 gave negligible adhesion (Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>The atomic structure shows T1385 and N1386 to be the most prominent amino acids protruding from the surface of FN9 between the PHSRN loop and the RGD loop of FN10 (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, neither T1385A nor N1386A had a significant effect on cell adhesion under the assay conditions we were using, specifically to wells coated at 20 μg/ml (Fig. 3, high FN). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we constructed the double mutant, T1385A/N1386A, and found that this mutant reduced adhesion slightly, to ∼80% of the wild type (Fig. 3, high FN). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>In these initial assays, the wells were coated at 20 μg/ml protein (high concentration). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>We found that a lower concentration of the coating protein gave a much more sensitive indication of adhesion defects. Fig. 3 also shows the assay with wells coated with 0.8 μg/ml of recombinant protein (low concentration). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Although cell adhesion to T1385A or N1386A was indistinguishable from wild type at the high coating concentration, adhesion to T1385A or N1386A was ∼85 or 80% that of the wild-type FN7–10, respectively, at the low concentration (Fig. 3, low FN). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Adhesion to the low concentration of the T1385A/N1386A double mutant was reduced to ∼30% of binding to the wild type (Fig. 3, low FN), and adhesion to the low concentration of R1379A was ∼20% that of wild type (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>We also tested adhesion to an R1379A/T1385A/N1386A triple mutant; this showed 30 and 5% of adhesion to wild type at the high and low concentrations (Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>For each protein, we tested four different concentrations of soluble protein, from 0.037 to 37 μM in 10-fold dilutions (Fig. 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>We found that T1385A and N1386A inhibited cell adhesion nearly as well as wild-type FN7–10, although the small decrease in competition for the mutants was consistent and probably significant. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>One of the more general conclusions of our study is that the synergy site in FN9 is not limited to the short PHSRN sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>The previously identified R1379 in this sequence is indeed the most important residue, but the synergy site receives contributions from several other amino acids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>These are distributed over the surface of FN9, projecting from the fibronectin surface in the same direction as the RGD, and presumably making contact with the integrin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>The integrin-binding interface spans at least the 41 Å from R1374 to R1445, and involves several residues between and beside these residues, forming an extensive integrin-binding surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>The integrin-binding interface may extend even farther, as we have not tested more distant residues. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the atomic detail of the FN side of the interface, there is not much information on the structure of the integrins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, there are several studies that indicate that the synergy site binds primarily or exclusively to the α5 integrin subunit, and that RGD binds to both the α5 and β1 integrins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>We discuss the details of these assignments below. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>A model showing an integrin in scale with the FN9-10 atomic model, and indicating the contacts, is shown in Fig. 7. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>The integrin site that binds the synergy region has been identified primarily from antibody inhibition experiments, which showed that the synergy- and RGD-binding regions of α5β1 are relatively distant (Mould et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the crystal structure of FN7–10 that shows the R1379 and the RGD are separated by ∼32 Å (Leahy et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Antibody data also indicated that the synergy site binds to α5, primarily via the third of its seven NH2-terminal repeats (Mould et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>1997; Burrows et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>1999). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Several studies show that RGD binds to both the α5 and β1 integrins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Recombinant fragments of α5 containing repeats IV–VII or III–VII have been shown to bind to RGD (Banères et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>1998, Banères et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>More specifically, these α5 integrin fragments have been shown to bind to the RGD of fibronectin via the carboxylate group of the aspartate, probably through an intermolecular metal coordination (Banères et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>2000). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>The case is even stronger for RGD binding the β integrin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Cross-linking studies, mutational analysis, and mapping of ligand-blocking antibodies show that the β1 I-like domain, ∼250 amino acids near the NH2 terminus, binds to RGD (for review see Loftus and Liddington 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have refined this observation to show that β1 binds to the guanidinium of the arginine in the RGD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>This binding is possibly to one of the aspartates in the highly conserved (among β integrin subunits) DDL (Banères et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>2000). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Two points of flexibility in FN may be important for its interaction with the integrin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>The solution structures of FN fragments show that the RGD loop is quite flexible (Main et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>1992; Copie et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>1998), allowing variation in both its distance from and orientation toward the synergy site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>In addition, the crystal structure of FN7–10 showed that the interface between FN9 and FN10 is exceptionally small, suggesting that this junction may be somewhat flexible (Leahy et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>NMR solution structures provided additional evidence that this junction is flexible in solution (Copie et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>If flexibility at the FN9-10 hinge is important for adapting FN to different integrins, each integrin may bind FN with a different bend. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>The bacterial protein, invasin, binds α5β1 with 100 times higher affinity than does FN, and it binds a range of other β1 integrins. Hamburger et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>1999 determined the X-ray structure of invasin and suggested a possible mimic of FN, including an aspartate residue that might correspond to the D in RGD, and an arginine and aspartate 32 Å away that might correspond to R1379 and D1373 in the FN synergy region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>However, the shapes of FN and invasin between these residues are quite different, FN being concave and invasin convex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Moreover, invasin is completely rigid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>A pronounced hump of invasin comprising Y863 and Y885 is positioned similarly to the T1385/N1386 of FN, but it projects much farther. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>If T1385/N1386 contacts the integrin, as indicated by our data, this same interface could not accommodate the hump of invasin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Even bending FN at the FN9-10 hinge cannot bring a match to the convex surface of invasin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>An alternative explanation is that invasin binds to an interface on the integrin that is different from, but partly overlapping the FN binding site. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Our guiding principle in thinking about the FN–integrin interface is that protein–protein interfaces are preformed, rigid, complimentary surfaces that fit together like a lock and key. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>This principle was originally proposed by Chothia and Janin 1975, and has been confirmed by the X-ray structures of numerous protein–protein complexes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>For a simple protein–protein association the interface is usually a contiguous patch of amino acids, ∼20 Å in diameter, with some hot spots contributing most to the interaction (Cunningham and Wells 1993; Clackson and Wells 1995). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>The FN–integrin interaction may well comprise two interfaces: one for the synergy site on the α integrin subunit, and one for RGD in a cleft between the α and β integrins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>The atomic structure of FN has provided important insights into that side of the interface. </plain></SENT>
