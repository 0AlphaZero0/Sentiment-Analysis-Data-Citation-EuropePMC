The E3L gene product consists of an N-terminal Z&#945; domain and a C-terminal double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding domain; the left-handed Z-DNA-binding activity of the Z&#945; domain of E3L is required for viral pathogenicity in mice. E3L is highly conserved among poxviruses, including the smallpox virus, and it is likely that the orthologous Z&#945; domains play similar roles. To better understand the biological function of E3L proteins, we have investigated the Z-DNA-binding behavior of five representative Z&#945; domains from poxviruses. Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), we have demonstrated that these viral Z&#945; domains bind Z-DNA tightly. Ability of Z&#945;<sub>E3L</sub> converting B-DNA to Z-DNA was measured by circular dichroism (CD). The extents to which these Z&#945;s can stabilize Z-DNA vary considerably. Mutational studies demonstrate that residues in the loop of the &#946;-wing play an important role in this stabilization. Notably the Z&#945; domain of vaccinia E3L acquires ability to convert B-DNA to Z-DNA by mutating amino acid residues in this region. Differences in the host cells of the various poxviruses may require different abilities to stabilize Z-DNA; this may be reflected in the observed differences in behavior in these Z&#945; proteins.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Poxviruses are the largest, most complex, double-stranded DNA viruses that have been observed to replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Each poxvirus exhibits a different host range; some are extremely species specific, for example, swinepox virus, while others exhibit a broad host range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Vaccinia virus is the best-characterized member of this large family, due to its long established role in vaccination against smallpox as well as its importance as a gene transfer vehicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><p>The E3L protein of vaccinia virus is composed of two distinct domains associated with two different nucleic acid-binding properties. The N-terminal domain (Z&#945;) binds tightly and specifically to left-handed Z-DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7 B8">5&#8211;8</xref>), while the C-terminal domain comprises a well-characterized double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11 B12">9&#8211;12</xref>). The dsRNA-binding domain allows the virus to overcome host defense systems mediated by the dsRNA activated protein kinase PKR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Vaccinia virus lacking the dsRNA-binding domain of E3L has an increased sensitivity to IFN and restricted host range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The Z-DNA-binding domain is a member of the Z&#945; family of Z-DNA-binding proteins, whose other members include the vertebrate dsRNA editing enzyme ADAR1 and the mammalian Z-DNA-binding protein ZBP1 (previously known as DLM-1).</p><p>The molecular structures of several Z&#945; domains have been determined. Z&#945;:Z-DNA co-crystal structures have been solved for the Z&#945; domains of human ADAR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), mouse ZBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and yaba-like disease virus E3L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In each case, the protein adopts a helix-turn-helix with &#946;-sheet (winged helix-turn-helix) fold, with the left-handed DNA backbone grasped between the recognition helix and the &#946;-sheet by numerous hydrogen bonds. Both the precise shape of the fold and the interaction with DNA are extremely similar among these proteins. The DNA-contacting residues are highly conserved, both between species within a given protein and between different members of the Z&#945; family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), however, different members of the Z&#945; family are not otherwise similar. The solution structure of free vaccinia virus Z&#945;<sub>E3L</sub> shows the same overall fold and supports the concept that E3L proteins share their Z-DNA-binding mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). There is one provocative difference between the different Z&#945; structures: although the contacts between the &#946;-sheet and the DNA are nearly the same, the shape and position of the &#946;-sheet is variable, differing in each or the determined structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>In previous studies, the Z-DNA-binding domain of E3L protein from vaccinia virus (vZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub>) was shown to play a key role in viral pathogenesis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Furthermore, it was shown that the ability to bind Z-DNA is the essential characteristic required for the biological activity of this domain; vZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub> can be replaced with the Z&#945; domain of either ADAR1 or ZBP1 with no loss of viral pathogenicity. Mutations that decrease or abolish Z-DNA-binding activity proportionately decrease or abolish pathogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). It has been demonstrated that the Z-DNA-binding activity of vZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub> is responsible for the anti-apoptotic activity of vaccinia E3L when expressed in cultured cells and can activate expression of a battery of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Therefore, it is of interest to characterize the binding activity of viral Z&#945; domains in order to better understand poxvirus infection.</p><p>In this study, we have expressed the Z&#945;<sub>E3L</sub> domains from a representative group of five poxviruses: vaccinia virus (vZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub>), swinepox virus (spZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub>), yaba-like disease virus (yabZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub>), orf virus (orfZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub>) and lumpy skin disease virus (lsZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).We show that these proteins bind strongly to Z-DNA and alter the equilibrium between B-DNA and Z-DNA. In addition, we have modified the &#946;-sheets of several of these proteins using site-directed mutagenesis. These modified proteins display altered Z-DNA-binding activity, showing that changes in this region can modulate the interaction between protein and Z-DNA. These modulations are similar in magnitude to differences between the E3Ls of several poxviruses. It remains to be determined whether such changes in binding activity would alter the biology of the virus.

The purified protein was adjusted to &gt;2 mM final concentration, as determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm, using extinction coefficients deduced from amino acid sequence. The purified proteins were stored frozen at &#8722;70&#176;C until use.</p></sec><sec><title>Surface plasmon resonance analysis</title><p>The binding affinities of viral Z&#945;s for Z-DNA were determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using a BIAcore 2000 as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Briefly, ca. 300 response units (RU) of biotinylated poly (dG&#8211;dC) stabilized in the Z conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) were immobilized on a SA chip (Biacore). Protein solutions at concentrations between 75 nM and 2000 nM were passed over the chip surface at 20 &#956;l/min. All experiments were carried out at 25&#176;C in HBS buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.01 mM EDTA). Regeneration was performed with a pulse of 0.05% SDS. The association and dissociation times were 180 and 200 s, respectively.

The conversion of poly (dG&#8211;dC) from the B to the Z conformation was monitored by circular dichroism (CD). CD spectra were taken at 25&#176;C using a Jasco J-810 CD spectrophotometer. Measurements were carried out on 150 &#956;g/ml (225 &#956;M base pair) DNA in CD buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl and 0.1 mM EDTA) in a 2 mm quartz cell for all proteins except yabZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub> and its mutants, which included 100 mM NaCl. To the DNA, 90 &#956;M (final concentration) protein was added. The maximum volume of protein added to the sample did not exceed 5% of the total. Wavelength spectra were recorded at 1 nm interval averaged over 3 s. For kinetic measurements, CD signal changes at 255 nm were recorded at 1 s intervals for 1 h.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutagenesis of viral Z&#945;s</title><p>Mutant proteins were constructed using the QuikChange&#174; site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), according to the instructions provided by the supplier. After PCR and cloning, the sequence of each construct was verified.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><p>We chose five representative viral Z&#945;s from several subfamilies of poxvirus for careful examination. The amino acid sequences of these Z&#945; domains show relatively little sequence identity (between 19% and 39%); in contrast to the proteins as a whole, the residues that make contact with DNA are highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16">14&#8211;16</xref>). Many, including the asparagine and tyrosine in the recognition helix &#945;-3, and the first proline and tryptophan in the wing &#946;-3 are invariant in proteins that bind Z-DNA, while the rest show mostly conservative changes. An exception is the Thr-191 of hZ&#945;<sub>ADAR1</sub>; this residue makes contact with the DNA in the hZ&#945;<sub>ADAR1</sub> co-crystal structure, but is not well conserved in other Z&#945;s. Even between poxvirus proteins there is no observable conservation of residues that do not contact DNA. In order to determine the effect on DNA binding of sequence variability in the Z&#945; domains from E3L proteins, the activity of these domains was examined, with a focus on the effect of the residues preceding the invariant proline. We will henceforth refer to the two residues preceding the conserved proline as &#8216;P-2&#8217; and &#8216;P-1&#8217; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><sec><title>Characterization of the interaction between the Z&#945;<sub>E3L</sub> poxviruses and Z-DNA by SPR</title><p>The viral Z&#945; domains shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> were purified from <italic>E. coli</italic>.

It should be noted that the SPR experiments measure the binding of Z&#945; protein to preformed Z-DNA, while the CD experiments observe a conformational change in dsDNA induced by the protein. Factors including the off rate, the specific geometry and contacts between the protein and the Z-DNA are likely to affect the conversion of B-DNA to Z-DNA in a different way than the binding to pre-stabilized Z-DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Gain of B to Z-DNA conversion activity in a vZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub> mutant</title><p>The Z&#945; domain from vaccinia virus E3L appears inert in the CD experiments shown above.

This apparent contradiction correlates with a low on rate, an order of magnitude less that that of yabZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).

Changing the residues at P-2 and P-1 in the &#946;-wing can significantly affect the ability of a Z&#945; protein to convert DNA from the B to the Z conformation, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>.

The mutation yabZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub>SN6566TT does not affect activity, but yabZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub>SN6566DI has reduced activity.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm748f4"/></fig></p><p>Examination of the structure of the &#946;-wing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) suggests an explanation for this effect. The wing from vZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub> is positioned parallel to the DNA, aligning the two prolines nearest to the backbone, while the wing from yabZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub> extends toward the backbone, providing DNA interactions not only with the prolines but also with the Asn at P-1. It is possible that both P-1 and P-2 amino acid residues can make DNA contacts, possibly with DNA in an intermediate state between B and Z. These residues would then play a larger role in the conversion of DNA from the B to the Z-form than in binding to pre-stabilized Z-DNA. If this is true, positively charged and polar residues at positions P-1 and P-2 should effect the B to Z-DNA transition better non-polar amino acids and much better than negatively charged amino acids. The yabZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub> mutants described above both satisfy this prediction. In the case of vZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub>, the negatively charged Asp at P-2 could decrease binding to DNA, and the neutral Ile at P-1 cannot form hydrogen binds. The mutations D60T and I61T, vZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub>DI6061TT, remove one negative charge and offer the possibility of hydrogen bonds at both sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of changes in P-1 and P-2 in other viral Z&#945;s</title><p>To further test the hypothesis, mutations were made in other Z&#945; domains from E3L proteins. When both P-1 and P-2 were changed to threonine in orfZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub>, a pronounced increase in the proportion of Z-DNA at equilibrium and the rate of conversion were seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). In order to determine whether changes at both P-1 and P-2 were required for this effect, the single mutations orfZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub>GN5455TN and orfZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub>GN5455GT were tested. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, the orfZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub>GN5455TN mutation was sufficient to produce the increased binding. Changing Gly at P-2 to another amino acid acts to stiffen the &#946;-turn; this will increase Z-DNA binding, except in the case of a negatively charged amino acid, which will destabilize binding due to electrostatic effects, as demonstrated by orfZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub>GN5455DI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).

When both amino acid residues at P-1 and P-2 have abilities to form hydrogen bond(s), these mutants show better B to Z-DNA conversion activities than wild types or other mutants that have Gly (orfZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub>) or Ala (spZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub>) at P-2 position, respectively. This may indicate that the amino acid residue at P-2 could contribute to B to Z-DNA conversion possibly by hydrogen-bond interaction(s) with Z-DNA backbones as is found in P-1.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm748f5"/></fig>

This result is unexpected because the residue at position P-1 contacts the Z-DNA in hZ&#945;<sub>ADAR1</sub> and yabZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub>; therefore an effect of optimizing the residue at that position is more expected. The notable effect of sequence at P-2 supports the idea that this residue plays a role in either making a binding intermediate between protein and DNA, or, attractively, in shifting the equilibrium between B-DNA and Z-DNA by stabilizing an intermediate. This later possibility explains the discrepancy between <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values and CD data.</p><p>When positions P-2 and P-1 are changed to aspartic acid and isoleucine, respectively, in orfZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub> or spZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub>, the effect is the same as that seen in yabZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub>SN6465DI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). The mutant proteins bind Z-DNA less well. This supports the hypothesis that these residues are not optimized for DNA binding in vZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub>.</p><p>Although a single threonine at position P-2 increases the B- to Z-DNA conversion activity of orfZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub> and spZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub> as much as the double mutant, this is not true for vZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). In the case of the vaccinia protein, neither vZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub>DI6061TI nor vZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub>DI6061DT shows any activity in the CD assay. This suggests that the position of the &#946;-wing of vZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub> remains different for that of yabZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub>, even in the presence of a single mutation. It is likely that other residues also play a role in positioning the wing.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of a charged amino acid in position P-2</title><p>It has been hypothesized that the presence of a positively charged amino acid at position P-2 could increase the ability of a Z&#945; protein to alter the equilibrium between B-DNA and Z-DNA. This was tested by making mutants of vZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub>, orfZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub> and spZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub>, in each of which P-2 and P-1 were changed to lysine and threonine, respectively. As predicted, the presence of the positively charged lysine improved the ability of the protein to stabilize Z-DNA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). In each case, the KT mutant performed better than the TT mutant. This supports the idea that residues P-1 and P-2 are close to or make contact with the DNA backbone, as part of a binding intermediate and/or in the final Z-DNA&#8211;protein complex. Binding to and stabilization of Z-DNA by a Z&#945; protein can be optimized if residue P-2 is positively charged and residue P-1 is able to form a hydrogen bind to a backbone phosphate.</p></sec><sec><title>Biological implications of modulation of Z-DNA binding by viral Z&#945;s</title><p>Although residues that are required for binding to Z-DNA are well conserved in Z&#945; domains from viral E3L gene products, we have shown that there are residues that modulate DNA binding, which are conserved poorly or not at all. On one hand, yabZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub> binds to Z-DNA extremely tightly, and is fully capable of stabilizing appropriate sequences in the Z conformation. On the other, vZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub> cannot stabilize Z-DNA in the absence of other factors such as cobalt hexamine or negative supercoiling. Nevertheless, it is in vaccinia virus that it has been shown that the ability of E3L to bind Z-DNA is essential for viral pathogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>In vaccinia infections, it is essential for Z&#945;<sub>E3L</sub> to bind Z-DNA; mutations that decrease Z-DNA binding of vZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub> decrease the pathogenicity of the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). However, it is possible that viral E3L proteins do not have to stabilize Z-DNA in the absence of other factors, but rather bind to Z-DNA stabilized by factors such as negative supercoiling. Perhaps certain viral Z&#945;s, e.g. vZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub>, do not need to stabilize Z-DNA on their own. Substitution of a stronger Z&#945; domain such as hZ&#945;<sub>ADAR1</sub> or mZ&#945;<sub>ZBP1</sub> for vZ&#945;<sub>E3L</sub> in a chimeric E3L maintains pathogenicity but does not increase it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>Our study demonstrates that viral Z&#945;s from different poxviruses have different ability for Z-DNA stabilization. The variability in the sequence of the &#946;-wing and the modulation in Z-DNA-binding activity may reflect the lifecycle of the virus. In each of viruses, different degrees of modulation of Z-DNA-binding activity may be essential. Too weak binding will inactivate the Z&#945;, but too much binding may result in binding to inappropriate targets or the activation of genes that will hamper viral activity.</p><p>The biological action of the different viral Z&#945; domains can only be the object of speculation at present. When transfected into a cultured cell, Z&#945; can prevent apoptosis, stopping one of the most powerful host defenses against viral infection. Expression of Z&#945; also regulates the expression of many genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), and may act thus in viral pathogenesis. Finally, viral Z&#945;s may compete with cellular Z&#945;s or other, as yet undiscovered, Z-DNA-binding proteins, much as the C-terminal dsRNA-binding domain acts by competing for substrate with PKR.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p>
