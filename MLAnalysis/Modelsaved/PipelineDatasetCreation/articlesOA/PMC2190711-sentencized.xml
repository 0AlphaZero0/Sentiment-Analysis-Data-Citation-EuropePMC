</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Poxviruses are the largest, most complex, double-stranded DNA viruses that have been observed to replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells (1,2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Each poxvirus exhibits a different host range; some are extremely species specific, for example, swinepox virus, while others exhibit a broad host range (3,4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Vaccinia virus is the best-characterized member of this large family, due to its long established role in vaccination against smallpox as well as its importance as a gene transfer vehicles (1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The E3L protein of vaccinia virus is composed of two distinct domains associated with two different nucleic acid-binding properties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The N-terminal domain (Zα) binds tightly and specifically to left-handed Z-DNA (5–8), while the C-terminal domain comprises a well-characterized double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding domain (9–12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The dsRNA-binding domain allows the virus to overcome host defense systems mediated by the dsRNA activated protein kinase PKR (9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Vaccinia virus lacking the dsRNA-binding domain of E3L has an increased sensitivity to IFN and restricted host range (13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The Z-DNA-binding domain is a member of the Zα family of Z-DNA-binding proteins, whose other members include the vertebrate dsRNA editing enzyme ADAR1 and the mammalian Z-DNA-binding protein ZBP1 (previously known as DLM-1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The molecular structures of several Zα domains have been determined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Zα:Z-DNA co-crystal structures have been solved for the Zα domains of human ADAR1 (14), mouse ZBP1 (15) and yaba-like disease virus E3L (16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In each case, the protein adopts a helix-turn-helix with β-sheet (winged helix-turn-helix) fold, with the left-handed DNA backbone grasped between the recognition helix and the β-sheet by numerous hydrogen bonds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Both the precise shape of the fold and the interaction with DNA are extremely similar among these proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The DNA-contacting residues are highly conserved, both between species within a given protein and between different members of the Zα family (15,16), however, different members of the Zα family are not otherwise similar. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The solution structure of free vaccinia virus ZαE3L shows the same overall fold and supports the concept that E3L proteins share their Z-DNA-binding mode (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>There is one provocative difference between the different Zα structures: although the contacts between the β-sheet and the DNA are nearly the same, the shape and position of the β-sheet is variable, differing in each or the determined structures (16,17). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In previous studies, the Z-DNA-binding domain of E3L protein from vaccinia virus (vZαE3L) was shown to play a key role in viral pathogenesis in mice (18,19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it was shown that the ability to bind Z-DNA is the essential characteristic required for the biological activity of this domain; vZαE3L can be replaced with the Zα domain of either ADAR1 or ZBP1 with no loss of viral pathogenicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Mutations that decrease or abolish Z-DNA-binding activity proportionately decrease or abolish pathogenicity (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>It has been demonstrated that the Z-DNA-binding activity of vZαE3L is responsible for the anti-apoptotic activity of vaccinia E3L when expressed in cultured cells and can activate expression of a battery of genes (20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is of interest to characterize the binding activity of viral Zα domains in order to better understand poxvirus infection. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have expressed the ZαE3L domains from a representative group of five poxviruses: vaccinia virus (vZαE3L), swinepox virus (spZαE3L), yaba-like disease virus (yabZαE3L), orf virus (orfZαE3L) and lumpy skin disease virus (lsZαE3L) (Figure 1).We show that these proteins bind strongly to Z-DNA and alter the equilibrium between B-DNA and Z-DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In addition, we have modified the β-sheets of several of these proteins using site-directed mutagenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>These modified proteins display altered Z-DNA-binding activity, showing that changes in this region can modulate the interaction between protein and Z-DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>These modulations are similar in magnitude to differences between the E3Ls of several poxviruses. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>The amino acid sequences of these Zα domains show relatively little sequence identity (between 19% and 39%); in contrast to the proteins as a whole, the residues that make contact with DNA are highly conserved (Figure 1) (14–16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Many, including the asparagine and tyrosine in the recognition helix α-3, and the first proline and tryptophan in the wing β-3 are invariant in proteins that bind Z-DNA, while the rest show mostly conservative changes. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>The wing from vZαE3L is positioned parallel to the DNA, aligning the two prolines nearest to the backbone, while the wing from yabZαE3L extends toward the backbone, providing DNA interactions not only with the prolines but also with the Asn at P-1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>It is possible that both P-1 and P-2 amino acid residues can make DNA contacts, possibly with DNA in an intermediate state between B and Z. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>These residues would then play a larger role in the conversion of DNA from the B to the Z-form than in binding to pre-stabilized Z-DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>If this is true, positively charged and polar residues at positions P-1 and P-2 should effect the B to Z-DNA transition better non-polar amino acids and much better than negatively charged amino acids. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>When both P-1 and P-2 were changed to threonine in orfZαE3L, a pronounced increase in the proportion of Z-DNA at equilibrium and the rate of conversion were seen (Figure 5 and Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>In order to determine whether changes at both P-1 and P-2 were required for this effect, the single mutations orfZαE3LGN5455TN and orfZαE3LGN5455GT were tested. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>As shown in Figure 5, the orfZαE3LGN5455TN mutation was sufficient to produce the increased binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Changing Gly at P-2 to another amino acid acts to stiffen the β-turn; this will increase Z-DNA binding, except in the case of a negatively charged amino acid, which will destabilize binding due to electrostatic effects, as demonstrated by orfZαE3LGN5455DI (Table 2). Figure 5.Effects of hydrogen bond forming mutations at P-1 and P-2 in the variable regions of orfZαE3L on B to Z-DNA conversion activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Kinetic measurements of DNA conformation change from B-DNA to Z-DNA in orfZαE3L (green) and its variable region mutants—orfZαE3LGN5455TN (blue), orfZαE3LGN5455TT (blue) and orfZαE3LGN5455GT (black)—were carried out to investigate effects of hydrogen bond forming potentials by amino acid residues in the variable region (P-1 and P-2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>When both amino acid residues at P-1 and P-2 have abilities to form hydrogen bond(s), these mutants show better B to Z-DNA conversion activities than wild types or other mutants that have Gly (orfZαE3L) or Ala (spZαE3L) at P-2 position, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>This may indicate that the amino acid residue at P-2 could contribute to B to Z-DNA conversion possibly by hydrogen-bond interaction(s) with Z-DNA backbones as is found in P-1. Table 2.Effects on the degrees of B to Z-DNA conversion and the time to saturation for mutations in the β-wing regionResults are normalized to hZαADAR1, which is set to 100% conversion. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>This result is unexpected because the residue at position P-1 contacts the Z-DNA in hZαADAR1 and yabZαE3L; therefore an effect of optimizing the residue at that position is more expected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>The notable effect of sequence at P-2 supports the idea that this residue plays a role in either making a binding intermediate between protein and DNA, or, attractively, in shifting the equilibrium between B-DNA and Z-DNA by stabilizing an intermediate. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>The mutant proteins bind Z-DNA less well. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Although a single threonine at position P-2 increases the B- to Z-DNA conversion activity of orfZαE3L and spZαE3L as much as the double mutant, this is not true for vZαE3L (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>In the case of the vaccinia protein, neither vZαE3LDI6061TI nor vZαE3LDI6061DT shows any activity in the CD assay. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>This was tested by making mutants of vZαE3L, orfZαE3L and spZαE3L, in each of which P-2 and P-1 were changed to lysine and threonine, respectively. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Although residues that are required for binding to Z-DNA are well conserved in Zα domains from viral E3L gene products, we have shown that there are residues that modulate DNA binding, which are conserved poorly or not at all. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>On one hand, yabZαE3L binds to Z-DNA extremely tightly, and is fully capable of stabilizing appropriate sequences in the Z conformation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, it is in vaccinia virus that it has been shown that the ability of E3L to bind Z-DNA is essential for viral pathogenicity (19). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>In vaccinia infections, it is essential for ZαE3L to bind Z-DNA; mutations that decrease Z-DNA binding of vZαE3L decrease the pathogenicity of the virus (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>However, it is possible that viral E3L proteins do not have to stabilize Z-DNA in the absence of other factors, but rather bind to Z-DNA stabilized by factors such as negative supercoiling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Perhaps certain viral Zαs, e.g. vZαE3L, do not need to stabilize Z-DNA on their own. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Substitution of a stronger Zα domain such as hZαADAR1 or mZαZBP1 for vZαE3L in a chimeric E3L maintains pathogenicity but does not increase it (19). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>In each of viruses, different degrees of modulation of Z-DNA-binding activity may be essential. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Too weak binding will inactivate the Zα, but too much binding may result in binding to inappropriate targets or the activation of genes that will hamper viral activity. </plain></SENT>
