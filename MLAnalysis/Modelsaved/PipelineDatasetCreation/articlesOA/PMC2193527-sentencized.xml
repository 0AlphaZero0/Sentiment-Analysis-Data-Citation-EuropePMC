</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL)* represents the most common leukemia in the Western countries with an estimated incidence of 1 per 100,000 per y (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This disease is characterized by the monoclonal expansion of B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and lymphoid organs, and by an indolent course which ultimately becomes aggressive and invariably lethal (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Current knowledge of the pathogenesis of CLL is limited because no specific genetic alteration has yet been associated with this disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In particular, CLL is not associated with reciprocal balanced chromosomal translocations, but rather with specific deletions (2) suggesting the loss of presently unidentified tumor suppressor genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CLL cells have a low proliferative rate and a prolonged life span, suggesting that their primary alteration may be a defect in apoptosis (1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The cellular origin of CLL is unknown and has been the object of recent controversy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CLL cells are characterized by the expression of the cell surface markers CD5, CD23, CD19, and low levels of sIgM/IgD, a pattern not shared by any known B cell subpopulation (1, 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The expression of the CD5 antigen was originally taken to suggest that B-CLL originates from CD5+ B cells (4), which are usually characterized by unmutated Ig variable region (IgV) genes (5, 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, recent studies have shown that 50–70% of CLL have undergone IgV hypermutation (7–9), a phenomenon that characterizes normal B cells undergoing a T cell–dependent germinal center (GC) reaction (10) and malignant B cells derived from GC or post-GC B cells (11, 12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>This finding has led to the hypothesis that CLL cases displaying mutated IgV may derive from a cell that had transited through the GC, whereas those with germline IgV may derive from GC-independent cells (8, 9, 13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis has both biological and clinical relevance since the two subgroups have different prognosis, with IgV-mutated CLL (M-CLL) displaying a more benign clinical course (13, 14). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>To further investigate the phenotype of CLL subtypes, their cellular derivation and their relationship with normal B cells, we have analyzed their gene expression profiles using oligonucleotide-based DNA chip microarrays (Affymetrix) representative of ∼12,000 genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The gene expression profiles have been comparatively analyzed: (i) between M-CLL and IgV-unmutated CLL (UM-CLL) cases, to determine whether the two subgroups are different; (ii) with those of normal B cell subpopulations, including GC-independent (CD5+), preGC (naive), GC (centroblasts [CBs] and centrocytes [CCs]), and post-GC (memory) B cells, to investigate their cellular derivation; and (iii) with those of normal B cell subpopulations and of other malignancies derived from mature B cells to identify genes that are specifically expressed in CLL. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>The gene expression profiles shown in Fig. 1 demonstrate that CLL has a characteristic gene expression profile that is clearly distinguishable from FL, a malignancy derived from mature B cells and displaying an indolent clinical course similar to CLL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>This observation confirms the results obtained by Alizadeh et al. using a different DNA microarray technology (oligonucleotide versus cDNA-based arrays) and a only partially overlapping set of genes examined (12,000 nonlymphocyte-biased versus 18,000 lymphocyte-biased; reference 40). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>These results also show that CLLs have a homogeneous phenotype independent of the presence of IgV mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>This phenotype is defined by the common pattern of expression of 12,000 genes, with only 23 being differentially expressed in the M- versus UM-subtypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Although significant differences in protein expression or modification cannot be excluded by gene expression profiling, this result does not support the hypothesis that CLL may include distinct biological entities (8, 13), as it is the case, for instance, for DLCL (40). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Rather, these findings strongly suggest that all CLLs may derive from a common cell precursor through a common pathogenetic mechanism (see below). </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>CLLs Are Related to Memory B Cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Based on various phenotypic similarities, mainly the presence of the CD5 marker and on initial reports that CLL displayed unmutated IgV, it has long been proposed that CLL may derive from the malignant transformation of CD5+ B cells (4), the human equivalent of mouse B1 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the identification of M-CLLs led to the hypothesis that a fraction of CLL cases may derive from a GC-experienced B cell, possibly a memory B cell (8, 9, 13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>The gene expression profiles shown here suggest that CLL do not derive from CD5+ B cells or from GC B cells, while they indicate that both M- and UM-CLLs are more related to memory than to naive B cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>This conclusion is based on a comparative evaluation and cannot formally exclude the existence of a presently unrecognized B cell subpopulation that is more similar to CLL than memory B cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>However, this conclusion is in agreement with other well established traits shared by CLL and memory B cells, namely the frequent presence of IgV mutations and, most notable, the expression of the CD27 marker (14, 17–19, 41). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>The fact that CLL cells express the CD5 and CD23 markers, which are not typical of memory B cells, is not inconsistent with their derivation from memory B cells since the expression of these markers could represent an abnormal trait of the transformed phenotype rather than a characteristic of the normal precursor of CLL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>In the case of CD23, whose expression is induced by IL-4 (42), this hypothesis is supported by the abnormal expression of several genes involved in the IL-4 pathway (upregulation of IL-4 receptor, downregulation of SOCS1; see Results) and by the abnormal sensitivity of CLL to IL-4 in vitro (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Finally, a derivation of CLL cells from memory B cells is also consistent with the fact that CLLs lack chromosomal translocations which are thought to occur in developing B cells rearranging their antigen receptors or in GC B cells (see below). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>The notion that CLL may all derive from memory B cells leaves open the question of why a sizable fraction of them expresses unmutated IgV genes, which are typical for pre-GC, naive B cells, or GC-independent cells involved in T cell–independent humoral responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>One possible explanation is provided by the observation that a minor fraction of CD27+ B cells carry unmutated IgV (17, 18) and may have entered the memory cell pool without acquiring IgV mutations, possibly due to already high affinity for the antigen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Such CD27+ unmutated memory B cells may therefore represent the normal counterpart of UM-CLLs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, the precursor of UM-CLLs may be a cell that has acquired a memory phenotype via encounter with a T-independent (and thus GC-independent and IgV mutation-independent) pathway (9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis implies that the antigen recognized by M-CLLs and UM-CLLs may be of different nature, consistent also with the observation that CDRIII length and IgV region usage differs among the two subgroups (9, 43). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>A difference in the nature and/or time of exposure to antigen may also explain the different clinical behavior of the two subgroups. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Overall, the finding that CLLs, including the UM subtype, display a gene expression profile similar to memory B cells warrants further investigations on the possible heterogeneity of the memory B cell pool (44, 45). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>The few genes that are differentially expressed in M- versus UM-CLLs (Fig. 2 A) may turn useful in dissecting this heterogeneity, although further characterization is needed because they represent a heterogeneous group of genes, some of unknown function. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Implications for CLL Pathogenesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>The observation that all CLLs share a common gene expression profile suggests that they derive from a common pathogenetic pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>This notion is consistent with the relatively homogeneous cytogenetic profile of CLL, characterized by few common chromosomal abnormalities and, particularly, by the strong association with 13q14 deletions, present in the majority of cases (up to 70%) (46–48). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>These deletions are often present as a single chromosomal abnormality and are thought to reflect the loss or inactivation of a still unknown tumor suppressor gene (46–48). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>The homogeneity of the gene expression profile of CLL suggests that this alteration or some functional equivalent (e.g., inactivating point mutations) may be present also in those cases lacking cytogenetically or molecularly detectable 13q14 deletions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>The observation that CLL is more related to memory B cells than to any other known normal B cell subset suggests that the multistep process leading to CLL may actually initiate in memory B cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis is consistent with the notion that, unique among lymphoid malignancies, CLL lack reciprocal balanced chromosomal translocations (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>These aberrations are thought to occur either during Ig VDJ recombination in maturing B cells, or during Ig hypermutation and isotype switch in mature B cells within the GC (11), and, accordingly, are common in B cell lymphoma, most of which derive from mature GC B cells (12, 49). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Thus, if the transformation process leading to CLL initiates in memory B cells, it cannot involve chromosomal translocations since the mechanisms involved in these aberrations have been inactivated in these cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>This notion is consistent with the predominant presence in CLL of genetic alterations, such as deletions and amplifications, common in tumors deriving from tissues not physiologically subjected to antigen receptor gene rearrangements or hypermutation (50). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>The comparative analysis of the gene expression profiles of CLL versus memory B cells (Fig. 4) or other normal and neoplastic cells (Fig. 5) provides a significant body of new information to dissect the CLL phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>First, the downregulation of a number of proapoptotic genes, together with the already known upregulation of the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl-2, is consistent with the documented long-lived apoptosis-resistant phenotype of CLL (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Second, unique among normal and neoplastic B cells, CLL cells consistently display a significant overexpression of the EPAC and CDC25 genes, both encoding guanine nucleotide exchange factors that activate, respectively, Rap1 and Ras, the small GTPases that control pleiotropic transcriptional responses via the Raf/ERK pathway (51). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>This observation has possible pathogenetic relevance and warrants further studies since deregulation of the Ras pathway represents one of the most common alterations in human tumors (52), while recent evidence suggests that Rap1 can be deregulated by chromosomal translocations in lymphoid malignancy (53). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Finally, the upregulation of mRNA for several cytokine or chemokine receptors compared with memory cells (IL-4R, TGF-β type III receptor, CCR7; Fig. 4) or to other B cells (Ror1 and thromboxane A2 receptor; Fig. 5) suggests that CLL cells may be abnormally responsive to certain stimuli. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>While each of the genes specifically expressed in CLL requires validation for differential expression at the protein level, these observations are potentially important for CLL pathogenesis and are amenable to experimental testing. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>The results of these studies have potential clinical application in several areas. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>First, the ability to distinguish M- versus UM-CLLs by gene expression profiling (Fig. 2) represents a potential prognostic test for CLL since these two groups have a distinct clinical course. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>It is unlikely that this analysis will find clinical application using expensive microarrays with 12,000 genes such as the ones used in this study since IgV sequencing is more rapid and economical. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>Rather, these results should lead to the development of simple and inexpensive cytochemical assays recognizing the products of few of the genes differentially expressed in M- versus UM-CLLs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Second, the products of genes specifically expressed in CLL (Fig. 5) represent potential markers for the diagnosis of CLL, its differential diagnosis from related B cell malignancies, or the detection of small numbers of CLL cells in minimal residual disease contexts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>Finally, the products of these same genes represent potential therapeutic targets based on their specific expression in CLL cells versus normal cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>The successful use of mAb therapy targeting the CD20 molecule in B cell lymphoma (54) suggests that cell surface receptors that are abnormally expressed in CLL (e.g., Ror1 and thromboxane A2 receptors) may represent good candidates for initial testing of this approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Further DNA microarray studies may be aimed at determining the expression profiles of cytogenetically distinct CLL cases or cases displaying different clinical behavior (55). </plain></SENT>
