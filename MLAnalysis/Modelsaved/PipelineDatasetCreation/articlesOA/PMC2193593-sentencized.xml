</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) colonizes the mucosal surface of the human nasopharynx. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Infection occurs when the organism spreads beyond this niche into normally sterile parts of the respiratory tract or, in the most serious cases, into the bloodstream. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Colonization, therefore, is the crucial first step in the pathogenesis of all pneumococcal disease (1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The acquisition and widespread dissemination of resistance to β-lactam antibiotics as well as resistance to other classes of antimicrobials has complicated the treatment of pneumococcal infection (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This problem has emphasized the need for preventive strategies against this common pathogen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The immunodominant antigen of the pneumococcus is the capsular polysaccharide (PnPS) of which there are 90 known types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Antibody to the PnPS of a given type is thought to provide protection only to an isolate of the homologous type (3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Although colonization results in an increase in type-specific serum antibody, it remains unclear whether carriage is an immunizing event for a given type (4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Immunization with a mixture of PnPS of the most prevalent types is protective in adults; but because young children do not respond to T cell–independent polysaccharide antigens, this prophylactic strategy is unsuccessful in the population at highest risk of disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>This finding has led to the recent introduction of a vaccine based on conjugate technology that couples PnPS to an immunogenic carrier protein resulting in a shift to a T cell–dependent immune response (5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>To produce an epidemiologically effective PnPS-protein conjugate vaccine, however, multiple types of the 90 known PnPSs must be conjugated to a protein carrier. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>This requirement results in a complex and expensive multi-component vaccine with restricted potential efficacy because of the limited number of PnPS types that can be included in any single formulation, the possibility of serotype replacement, and the high titer type-specific antibody response to some but not to all types (6, 7). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The focus of this study is the identification of pneumococcal proteins that are immunogenic during carriage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>A pneumococcal protein vaccine that would specifically interfere with carriage would avoid many of the problems associated with vaccines based on PnPS and could potentially have the greatest impact on the prevention of disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>A number of pneumococcal proteins that have been shown to induce opsonophagocytic antibodies or to offer some degree of protection in murine models are currently under investigation as novel vaccine candidates (8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Mice, however, are not naturally colonized by S. pneumoniae and, when subjected to infection via artificial routes, are variably susceptible to a limited number of pneumococcal types (9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>To avoid the limitations of animal models, this study utilizes experimental human colonization and shows that the presence of serum antibody to a single pneumococcal protein correlates with susceptibility to carriage. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Western blots demonstrated that pneumococci from 5/6 subjects expressed PspA31–189 throughout the entire period of colonization suggesting that the full-length protein is not essential for maintenance of the carrier state (Fig. 4 A). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Western analysis showed that the loss of the 22 kD band from P833-FS1 was associated with the acquisition of a prominent choline-binding protein of the predicted size of the full-length PspA of P833 (Fig. 4 B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Nucleotide sequence analysis of P833-FS1 showed the loss of two additional nucleotides upstream of the adenosine deletion in P833 restored the in-frame expression of pspA (Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>As P833-FS1 was the same serotype and the sequence of the entire pspA was otherwise identical to P833, it was concluded that this was a mutant of the same strain and that this mutation most likely occurred in vivo. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>A number of pneumococcal protein vaccine candidates have shown promise in animal studies, although no single immunogen has emerged despite many years of investigation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>The current study utilizes an experimental model of colonization by an exclusive human pathogen in the natural host. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>We focused on the humoral immune response during nasopharyngeal colonization, the first step in the interaction of the pneumococcus and humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>This approach also allowed for the identification of protein targets against which the presence of preexisting antibody may predict susceptibility to carriage. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>One of the key features of the experimental model of carriage used in this study was the availability of preinoculation samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>These sera permitted the identification of targets of newly acquired antibody from among the many antigens recognized by preexisting antibody in human serum and secretions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Results of this limited study in 14 adults failed to support the hypothesis that the susceptibility to carriage correlates with diminished levels of type-specific anti-PS antibody (3, 17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Instead, susceptibility to colonization was most closely associated with lack of preexisting systemic (serum IgG) and mucosal (nasopharyngeal sIgA) antibodies against a 22 kD protein subsequently identified as the first 159 amino acids of mature PspA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>No other antigens with this characteristic could be detected when serum and nasal washes were screened by Western analysis, a technique limited in its sensitivity by the possibility of antibody against one protein obscuring another. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>In fact, if the clinical isolate used in the inoculum did not express a truncated form of PspA, allowing for the NH2-terminal portion to be visualized separately from the more conserved COOH-terminal portion, this association may not have been detected (12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>The fortuitous use of this natural PspA mutant, however, enabled us to demonstrate a correlation between the presence of preexisting antibody to PspA31–189 and resistance to an intranasal challenge with the homologous strain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Based on this observation, this immunogenic portion of PspA may be an important target of the immune response to the pneumococcus during colonization and would seem to offer promise as a vaccine component to protect specifically against the acquisition of pneumococcal carriage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>PspA has previously been shown to be immunogenic and able to generate protection in colonization studies in mice (8, 18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>In addition to providing corroborative data in humans, the current study defines a smaller fragment of 96 amino acids (PspA93–189) that may be sufficient as an immunogen against carriage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>This fragment of PspA, however, is highly variable in sequence and does not contain amino acids 192–260 previously shown to be important in eliciting cross-protection in murine models (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>As a result of the variability of the NH2-terminal region of PspA, the correlation of preexisting antibody against PspA31–189 and susceptibility to carriage appears to be strain-specific. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Our study, therefore, provides evidence to support the immunization strategy proposed by Briles and others based on a mixture of antigenically variable PspA molecules representative of the most common clades but suggests that a different region of PspA may contain the critical epitopes for protection in humans (20). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Although it appears that the NH2-terminal portion of PspA is highly immunogenic and that the immune response to it may block the acquisition of carriage in the natural host, the expression of PspA was noted to be unstable during carriage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Such instability could be a limitation in development of a PspA-based vaccine and we are currently examining the frequency of mutations in PspA in carriage strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>This study shows that S. pneumoniae is able to colonize and persist in the human nasopharynx for as long as 122 d without expression of a full-length form of this major surface protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>A thorough understanding of the contribution of PspA to colonization and disease caused by this organism is still lacking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Two features of PspA in the inoculum strain, however, indicate that it was unlikely to have been fully functional during colonization in 5/6 subjects; PspA31–189 is secreted rather than anchored on the cell surface and it no longer binds to lactoferrin, the only known ligand of PspA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>The observation that the challenge strain isolated from an inflamed middle ear space and used in this human model of experimental colonization expressed a truncated protein could be evidence of prior selective immune pressure directed against PspA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>This escape mutation resulted in secretion of an immunogenic fragment of PspA and loss of expression of the relatively conserved portions of the protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>The frame-shift mutation in the inoculum strain occurred in a run of eight tandem adenosines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Although not a particularly long repetitive feature in this species with AT rich DNA, tandem repeats are known to be subject to increased rates of mutation by a mechanism involving slip-stranded mispairing (21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the last isolate cultured from 1/6 colonized subjects had a second mutation site that restored the expression of a full-length protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>The in vivo instability of expression and frequency of mutations in PspA or other pneumococcal antigens has not been recognized previously. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the use of experimental carriage studies performed in humans allowed for the identification of a potentially protective immunogen as well as demonstrating a naturally occurring variability in its expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>This study offers a paradigm for using experimental human infection to characterize the immune response to a pathogen and to identify and/or confirm vaccine targets. </plain></SENT>
