Multiple independently evolving clones define a complex parasite population that can be arranged into two broad genetic lineages termed <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I and II. These lineages have different evolutionary origin and display distinct ecological and biological traits. Here we describe a novel molecule termed TSSA for trypomastigote small surface antigen that provides the first immunological marker allowing discrimination between lineages. TSSA is a surface, glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored mucin-like protein, highly antigenic during the infection. TSSA sequences from different parasite isolates reveal a population dimorphism that perfectly matches with the two <italic>T. cruzi</italic> lineages. Interestingly, this dimorphism is restricted to the central region of the molecule, which comprises the immunodominant B cell epitopes. This sequence variability has a major impact on TSSA antigenicity, leading to no immunological cross-reactivity between both isoforms for antibodies present either in immunization or infection sera. Furthermore, the absolute seroprevalence for TSSA in confirmed Chagasic patients is restricted to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> II isoform, strongly suggesting that human infections are due to this particular subgroup. Even though association of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> II with Chagas' disease has been proposed based on molecular markers, this is the first immunological evidence supporting this hypothesis. The implications of these results for the future research on Chagas' disease could be envisaged.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic></kwd><kwd>mucin-like</kwd><kwd>lineage dimorphism</kwd><kwd>Chagas' disease</kwd><kwd>serodiagnosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>J.M.

<italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> is the etiological agent of Chagas' disease, an endemic illness that affects 18 million people in Latin America (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The parasite alternates its life cycle between vertebrates and insect vectors, with different developmental stages involved in each host (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Within the reduviid vector two forms of the parasite can be observed: replicative epimastigotes and metacyclic trypomastigotes. The latter form brings the infection into humans when released on the skin or mucosa with the depositions of the bug. After cell invasion, metacyclic trypomastigotes differentiate into the replicative amastigote form that, after several divisions, differentiates into bloodstream trypomastigotes. The latter stage is able to invade a wide variety of nucleated cells, thus propagating the infection. The cycle closes when the hematophagous vector ingests circulating trypomastigotes with its blood meal.</p><p>After an acute phase characterized by a high parasitemia, the infection progress to a chronic stage, where parasites are barely detected. In 35% of the human cases pathological signs such as myocarditis and neurodegenerative effects on the digestive system would appear, thus leading to Chagas' disease (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The incidence of acute cases in humans is steadily declining in a number of countries mainly due to the successful control of vectorial transmission (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). However, as <italic>T. cruzi</italic> develops a life-long infection in humans, these people can serve as parasite reservoirs throughout their lifetime. Thus, the risk of congenital and/or horizontal transmission by infected blood transfusion may become a major problem in nonendemic regions, increased by the migration of people from endemic areas in South and Central America to the developed countries (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In this context, the identification of new immunodominant parasite molecules reliable for serodiagnosis is desirable (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>
<italic>T. cruzi</italic> is grossly divided into two divergent genetic groups or lineages, called <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I and II that include all typed strains and cloned stocks thus far isolated (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), although further subdivisions are possible (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). This population structure is a consequence of both its divergent evolutionary history (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and its clonal rather than sexual propagation (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Diversity among parasite isolates has been early noted, mainly based on biochemical, ecological, and epidemiological data (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). More recently, several molecular markers have been identified that allow the conformation of two broad lineages and a more accurate discrimination between isolates. These markers include the 24S&#945;rRNA gene and its promoter sequence (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), the intergenic region of the tandemly repeated mini-exon gene (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and microsatellite DNA (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Current biological and epidemiological data provide evidence for a strong association of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> II with human disease whereas <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I is preferentially detected in the sylvatic cycle (affecting mainly American marsupials and edentates; references 6 and 14). However, a state-of-the-art demonstration of this assumption is still lacking.</p><p>
<italic>TcMUC</italic> is a complex <italic>T. cruzi</italic> family of genes that resemble vertebrate mucin genes (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), comprising 500 to 700 members per haploid genome (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Accordingly to the structure of the deduced proteins three groups of genes were conformed (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). All of them code for short Thr, Ser, and Pro-rich proteins that share highly homologous N- and COOH-terminal regions, encoding for an endoplasmic reticulum targeting signal and a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">*</xref> anchor attachment signal, respectively (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Divergences that account for their classification on different groups arise mainly in their central domains. Mucin molecules belonging to group I were identified on the surface of the vertebrate stages of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> and have Thr<sub>(8)</sub>-Lys-Pro<sub>(2)</sub> tandem repeats in the central region that become highly <italic>O</italic>-glycosylated in vivo (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The products of group II display nonrepeated unique central sequences and their expression at the protein level have never been confirmed in the parasite. Nevertheless the deduced products are rich enough in Thr, Ser, and Pro residues as to support its mucin-like denomination (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Finally, group III yielded a very small-deduced product that displays no significant homologies with anything in the sequences databases (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>In the present work, we show that <italic>TcMUC</italic> group III is actually conformed by a dimorphic single-copy gene, with two alleles distributed among the parasite isolates coinciding with the two broad lineages postulated for <italic>T. cruzi</italic> (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The expression of its encoded protein was verified in the surface of the cell-derived trypomastigotes. Therefore, we named it trypomastigote small surface antigen (TSSA) given that the product is highly immunogenic during <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infections in humans and laboratory animals. By using peptide scanning we demonstrated that the Ab recognition was mainly restricted to epitope(s) contained within a single 10-amino acid long peptide. Interestingly, sequence differences observed for the two alleles found in the species were mainly clustered within this antigenic region and lead to no immunological cross-reactivity between both isoforms. More important, the high prevalence (100% among confirmed Chagasic individuals and &gt;87% among potentially Chagasic individuals) of anti-TSSA Abs is exclusively attributed to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> II isoform. Thus, we propose TSSA as the first immunological marker of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> genetic subgroups that correlates human infection with <italic>T. cruzi</italic> II.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Parasites and Experimental T. cruzi Infection Sera.</title><p>The CL Brener genome project reference clone of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> was used for the antigen characterization (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).

Two further sequences from CL Brener were downloaded from GenBank: EST TENU3264 and GSSTc10735 (GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession nos. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AI077116">AI077116</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AZ049892">AZ049892</ext-link>, respectively). They all seemed to be derived from the same gene given that no nucleotide differences were detected among them. The open reading frame spanned 276 bp rendering a 92-amino acid long deduced product (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Comparison of this product with those from TcMUC groups I and II showed a predicted 26-amino acid long signal peptide at the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), 73% identical to the consensus of the family (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Likewise, the last 27 amino acid residues were compatible with a GPI-anchoring signal with 85% identity to the one described for groups I and II (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). As these two regions were shown to be functional for <italic>TcMUC</italic> genes in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) the mature product could be predicted with some confidence. Therefore, this protein would be 40-amino acid long after these two regions were intracellularly processed, with a <italic>M</italic>

This biased amino acid composition, along with the existence of 10 putative <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation sites (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), suggests that this gene encode for a <italic>T. cruzi</italic> mucin-like molecule.

The hybridization pattern was compatible with the existence of a single gene per haploid genome (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A). In addition to the Southern blot, two further evidences reinforced the previous statement.

This expression pattern contrasted with that observed for the TSSA protein, which is mostly expressed in cell-derived trypomastigotes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>).

The addition of PI-PLC caused the disappearance of the signal in lysates from treated parasites when probed with an anti-GST-TSSA serum in Western blotting (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C). Nevertheless, the band was not recovered in the culture supernatant. As a control, the same filter was probed with an antiserum raised against shed acute-phase antigen (SAPA), a cell-derived trypomastigote surface antigen known to be GPI-anchored and readily shed into the medium by the same PI-PLC treatment (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). SAPA was solubilized and detected in its intact form in the supernatant after the treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C). So, it seems that the failure to detect soluble TSSA in the filter was due to the inability of the released protein to bind to nitrocellulose membranes.</p><p>The surface localization of TSSA was further assessed by indirect immunofluorescence on nonpermeabilized parasites. The surface of cell-derived trypomastigotes was clearly labeled by anti-TSSA Abs but not by a mouse normal serum (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, D and E</xref>). Broad trypomastigote forms were more strongly labeled than slender trypomastigotes. On the other hand, amastigotes were only faintly labeled (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> E). Axenic culture-derived insect parasite stages (epimastigotes and metacyclic trypomastigotes) gave no reaction by this technique (data not shown). Along with results obtained from the Western blotting it is concluded that TSSA is a surface antigen mainly expressed in the cell-derived trypomastigote stage.</p></sec><sec><title>Interstrain Variability of TSSA.</title><p>The analysis of several <italic>T. cruzi</italic> isolates by Southern blotting with the <italic>tssa</italic> probe indicated that the genomic organization and gene copy number was conserved among isolates. However, differences in the signal intensity were noted when comparing the isolates, which might denote certain degree of heterogeneity within this locus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A). To clarify this issue, <italic>tssa</italic> alleles were cloned and sequenced from Y and RA strains (both rendering strong signals on the Southern blot) and Dm28c and Tulahuen2 isolates (that rendered weak signals on the Southern blot; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A). The <italic>tssa</italic> gene from SilvioX10 and CA-I/72, not assayed in the Southern blot, were also cloned and sequenced. The resulting deduced proteins showed that two forms of <italic>tssa</italic> existed within the species yielding two different kinds of TSSA proteins (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B). Even though minor changes were observed in the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal peptide and the putative GPI anchor, the inter-strain variability was mainly focused to the central region. Interestingly, this dimorphism seemed to correlate with the two major evolutive lineages proposed for <italic>T. cruzi</italic> (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B). To further evaluate this possibility <italic>tssa</italic> alleles from several <italic>T. cruzi</italic> strains or cloned stocks were typed by endonuclease restriction after PCR amplification of their central regions. A unique PvuII site exclusively present in the variable region of the <italic>tssa</italic> allele from <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I isolates was used as diagnostic (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> C). In addition, aliquots of the same DNA samples from the different isolates were typed as <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I or II by analyzing the PCR product length from the intergenic region of the tandemly repeated mini-exon gene and the variable region of the 24S&#945;rRNA gene as originally described (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> C, the <italic>tssa</italic> dimorphism perfectly correlated with the existence of these two lineages.

To assess the persistence of anti&#8211;TSSA-II Abs during the course of the infection, a follow up study was performed in BALB/c mice experimentally infected with the CL Brener clone. All of them (<italic>n</italic> = 12) showed a peak of TSSA-II&#8211;specific Abs that coincided with the moment of parasitemia declining and, thereafter, circulating Abs could be detected up to 4 mo postinfection at a fairly constant level (about half of the peak value, data not shown).

Amino acid sequence variation included one single residue deletion and several nonconservative replacements (in particular the exchange of <sup>42</sup>Pro for Thr) that might have a major impact on the antigenic structure of TSSA.

First, immunofluorescence of nonpermeabilized parasites clearly labeled the surface of cell-derived trypomastigotes, specially the broad forms (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> E). Slender trypomastigotes and amastigotes were faintly labeled (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> E) while the insect-derived stages were negative (data not shown). Broad trypomastigotes might correspond to intermediate forms (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), suggesting that the expression of TSSA is narrowed to defined periods of the trypomastigote development. Second, treatment of intact cell-derived trypomastigotes with PI-PLC resulted in the lost of the signal on parasite lysates when probed with an anti-TSSA serum in Western blot (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C). Unexpectedly, this signal was not recovered in the culture media. The possibility of generalized proteolytic degradation during PI-PLC treatment is unlikely since another GPI-anchored molecule (SAPA) was recovered in its intact form in the supernatant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C). It has been recently demonstrated that certain GPI-anchored proteins present in protozoan and mammalian cells suffer a drastic effect on their antigenicity after the removal of the GPI lipid moieties, suggesting that they might undergo conformational changes (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Whether this phenomenon might be operating in our system is uncertain but it is noteworthy the presence of strong linear epitopes on TSSA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) whose recognition should not, in principle, be affected by protein conformation. One more likely explanation is that TSSA might be posttranslationally modified in vivo, in particular by the addition of <italic>O</italic>-linked oligosaccharides as suggested by its primary sequence (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Therefore, the cleavage of its lipid moieties would yield a highly hydrophilic, soluble TSSA that no longer binds to nitrocellulose filters, as previously observed for the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> trypomastigote total mucins (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). The same explanation could also account for the observed discrepancies between the predicted and the observed SDS-PAGE mobility (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). Altogether, these results are compatible with TSSA being GPI-anchored to the surface of the cell-derived trypomastigote stage.</p><p>Genomic analyses of the <italic>tssa</italic> locus revealed the existence of two alleles that code for two distinct forms of the protein (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B). Interestingly, the distribution of these alleles correlated with the two major lineages proposed for the species (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> C, lineage classification of 19 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> isolates by our <italic>tssa</italic> gene-typing assay showed a perfect correlation with two of the most commonly used methods: mini-exon and rDNA PCR polymorphism (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Accordingly, it can be proposed that the <italic>tssa</italic>-I allele is restricted to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I isolates (and encodes the TSSA-I isoform) and <italic>tssa</italic>-II is restricted to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> II isolates (and encodes the TSSA-II protein).</p><p>In addition to its potential use as a reliable serodiagnostic molecule (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>) and a genetic tool for <italic>T. cruzi</italic> typification, TSSA provides with the first immunological marker allowing the lineage identification of infecting isolates on serum samples. Amino acid variations between TSSA-I and TSSA-II are mainly restricted to their central regions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B), which turned out to comprise the major B cell antigenic determinants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). These sequence changes have a major impact on TSSA antigenicity, leading to negligible cross-reactivity between both isoforms. As such, anti&#8211;TSSA-I hyperimmune sera did not recognize recombinant TSSA-II and viceversa (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A). Counterpart in vivo evidence was provided by sera from experimentally infected animals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> B) and from Chagasic patients (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> C). Sera from animals infected with <italic>T. cruzi</italic> II isolates showed an exclusive recognition toward the TSSA-II molecule. In the same line, although weak anti&#8211;TSSA-I specific responses are elicited during the infection with <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I parasites, a proportion of these animals (3 out of 12 rabbits, 3 out of 5 mice, and 5 out of 8 rats) did elicit significant anti&#8211;TSSA-I Abs that were unable to cross-recognize TSSA-II (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> B). The decreased amounts of Abs detectable with the TSSA-I recombinant molecule can be attributed to differences in the course of infection caused by both kinds of parasite lineages. It has been established that <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I isolates develop a mild infection in laboratory animals, characterized by low parasitemia and low morbidity rate, thus leading to decreased overall reactivity against parasite antigens (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Alternatively, it may be proposed that TSSA-I is less immunogenic than TSSA-II or undergoes major posttranslational modifications in vivo leading to a decreased Ab response against the TSSA-I protein backbone. We do not favor the latter hypothesis because the similarities between the primary sequences of both proteins (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B) are strong enough to assume that posttranslational modifications would be similar in kind and extension. Further biochemical characterization of both TSSA isoforms should help to clarify this issue.</p><p>The major finding of the present work was that, even though anti&#8211;TSSA-I Abs can be readily detected in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I experimental infections (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref>), the seroreactivity displayed by Chagasic patients was clearly shifted toward the recognition of TSSA-II (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> C). As shown, 175 out of 201 (87%) of potentially Chagasic sera and 100% of confirmed Chagasic sera (<italic>n</italic> = 123) showed specific reactivity against TSSA-II, whereas only 12 out of 324 (3.7%) total Chagasic serum samples displayed a mixed recognition (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). All of the latter sera, that might have been underestimated due to the low titers of Ab directed toward TSSA-I peptide epitopes elicited during <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I infections (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref>), exhibited a much stronger anti&#8211;TSSA-II Ab response (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> C). Therefore, they can represent detection of minor cross-reactivities due to Ab populations directed against common epitopes in both TSSA isoforms, mostly in high responsive patients. More likely, they can be interpreted as genuine <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I/<italic>T. cruzi</italic> II coinfection cases (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). It is worth noting that none of the Chagasic sera analyzed so far showed a restricted recognition toward TSSA-I. These simple results have a great epidemiological value as it indicates that strains belonging to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> II (or even a subgroup of this lineage) are by far the more common in producing human infections and, hence, Chagas' disease. On the other hand, they strongly argue against human infection cases exclusively due to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I strains. Although molecular markers and biological evidences existed associating <italic>T. cruzi</italic> II with the domestic cycle of the infection and <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I with the sylvatic cycle (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), TSSA provides with the first antigenic marker supporting this hypothesis. This fact should be kept in mind for reevaluating previous data obtained in animals experimentally infected with <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I isolates and, more important, for choosing the appropriate strains to develop animal models to study human pathogenesis and treatments.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Profs.
