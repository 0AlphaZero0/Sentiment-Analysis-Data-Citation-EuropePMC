</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent of Chagas' disease, an endemic illness that affects 18 million people in Latin America (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The parasite alternates its life cycle between vertebrates and insect vectors, with different developmental stages involved in each host (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Within the reduviid vector two forms of the parasite can be observed: replicative epimastigotes and metacyclic trypomastigotes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The latter form brings the infection into humans when released on the skin or mucosa with the depositions of the bug. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>After cell invasion, metacyclic trypomastigotes differentiate into the replicative amastigote form that, after several divisions, differentiates into bloodstream trypomastigotes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The latter stage is able to invade a wide variety of nucleated cells, thus propagating the infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The cycle closes when the hematophagous vector ingests circulating trypomastigotes with its blood meal. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>After an acute phase characterized by a high parasitemia, the infection progress to a chronic stage, where parasites are barely detected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In 35% of the human cases pathological signs such as myocarditis and neurodegenerative effects on the digestive system would appear, thus leading to Chagas' disease (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The incidence of acute cases in humans is steadily declining in a number of countries mainly due to the successful control of vectorial transmission (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>However, as T. cruzi develops a life-long infection in humans, these people can serve as parasite reservoirs throughout their lifetime. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Thus, the risk of congenital and/or horizontal transmission by infected blood transfusion may become a major problem in nonendemic regions, increased by the migration of people from endemic areas in South and Central America to the developed countries (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In this context, the identification of new immunodominant parasite molecules reliable for serodiagnosis is desirable (3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>T. cruzi is grossly divided into two divergent genetic groups or lineages, called T. cruzi I and II that include all typed strains and cloned stocks thus far isolated (4–6), although further subdivisions are possible (7, 8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>This population structure is a consequence of both its divergent evolutionary history (9) and its clonal rather than sexual propagation (10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Diversity among parasite isolates has been early noted, mainly based on biochemical, ecological, and epidemiological data (11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>More recently, several molecular markers have been identified that allow the conformation of two broad lineages and a more accurate discrimination between isolates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>These markers include the 24SαrRNA gene and its promoter sequence (5, 12), the intergenic region of the tandemly repeated mini-exon gene (5) and microsatellite DNA (13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Current biological and epidemiological data provide evidence for a strong association of T. cruzi II with human disease whereas T. cruzi I is preferentially detected in the sylvatic cycle (affecting mainly American marsupials and edentates; references 6 and 14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>However, a state-of-the-art demonstration of this assumption is still lacking. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>TcMUC is a complex T. cruzi family of genes that resemble vertebrate mucin genes (15, 16), comprising 500 to 700 members per haploid genome (17, 18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Accordingly to the structure of the deduced proteins three groups of genes were conformed (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>All of them code for short Thr, Ser, and Pro-rich proteins that share highly homologous N- and COOH-terminal regions, encoding for an endoplasmic reticulum targeting signal and a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI)* anchor attachment signal, respectively (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Divergences that account for their classification on different groups arise mainly in their central domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Mucin molecules belonging to group I were identified on the surface of the vertebrate stages of T. cruzi and have Thr(8)-Lys-Pro(2) tandem repeats in the central region that become highly O-glycosylated in vivo (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The products of group II display nonrepeated unique central sequences and their expression at the protein level have never been confirmed in the parasite. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless the deduced products are rich enough in Thr, Ser, and Pro residues as to support its mucin-like denomination (17, 20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Finally, group III yielded a very small-deduced product that displays no significant homologies with anything in the sequences databases (17). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>In the present work, we show that TcMUC group III is actually conformed by a dimorphic single-copy gene, with two alleles distributed among the parasite isolates coinciding with the two broad lineages postulated for T. cruzi (5, 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The expression of its encoded protein was verified in the surface of the cell-derived trypomastigotes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we named it trypomastigote small surface antigen (TSSA) given that the product is highly immunogenic during T. cruzi infections in humans and laboratory animals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>By using peptide scanning we demonstrated that the Ab recognition was mainly restricted to epitope(s) contained within a single 10-amino acid long peptide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, sequence differences observed for the two alleles found in the species were mainly clustered within this antigenic region and lead to no immunological cross-reactivity between both isoforms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>More important, the high prevalence (100% among confirmed Chagasic individuals and &gt;87% among potentially Chagasic individuals) of anti-TSSA Abs is exclusively attributed to T. cruzi II isoform. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Thus, we propose TSSA as the first immunological marker of T. cruzi genetic subgroups that correlates human infection with T. cruzi II. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>TcMUC is a complex T. cruzi gene-family whose diversity is still not well understood (16, 17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>In the present work we have identified and characterized the product of TcMUC group III as a small membrane antigen expressed by the infective cell-derived trypomastigote (Fig. 3, A and B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>This protein, termed TSSA, is encoded by a single-copy gene (Fig. 2 A) that is dimorphic among T. cruzi isolates correlating with the two broad lineages previously described for the species (5, 6; Fig. 4, B and C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>A preliminary biochemical characterization of TSSA was done on the CL Brener protein since it has been chosen as the genome project reference clone and the description of its gene products would be of great interest in the postgenomic phase (18, 21). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>On its COOH terminus, TSSA displayed a hydrophobic region compatible with a GPI-anchoring signal (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this sequence is 85% identical to the previously described in MUC-R (a tagged version of a TcMUC gene), which rendered a GPI-anchored mucin when transfected into T. cruzi (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>Amino acid conservation included the critical tripeptide Asp-Gly-Ser, postulated to function as the ω, ω +1, and ω +2 positions for lipid attachment in GPI-anchored proteins from T. cruzi and Trypanosoma brucei (40, 41). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>Two further evidences suggest that TSSA is GPI-anchored to the parasite surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>First, immunofluorescence of nonpermeabilized parasites clearly labeled the surface of cell-derived trypomastigotes, specially the broad forms (Fig. 3 E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>Slender trypomastigotes and amastigotes were faintly labeled (Fig. 3 E) while the insect-derived stages were negative (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>Broad trypomastigotes might correspond to intermediate forms (2), suggesting that the expression of TSSA is narrowed to defined periods of the trypomastigote development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>Second, treatment of intact cell-derived trypomastigotes with PI-PLC resulted in the lost of the signal on parasite lysates when probed with an anti-TSSA serum in Western blot (Fig. 3 C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, this signal was not recovered in the culture media. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>The possibility of generalized proteolytic degradation during PI-PLC treatment is unlikely since another GPI-anchored molecule (SAPA) was recovered in its intact form in the supernatant (Fig. 3 C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>It has been recently demonstrated that certain GPI-anchored proteins present in protozoan and mammalian cells suffer a drastic effect on their antigenicity after the removal of the GPI lipid moieties, suggesting that they might undergo conformational changes (42). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>Whether this phenomenon might be operating in our system is uncertain but it is noteworthy the presence of strong linear epitopes on TSSA (Fig. 5) whose recognition should not, in principle, be affected by protein conformation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>One more likely explanation is that TSSA might be posttranslationally modified in vivo, in particular by the addition of O-linked oligosaccharides as suggested by its primary sequence (31; Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the cleavage of its lipid moieties would yield a highly hydrophilic, soluble TSSA that no longer binds to nitrocellulose filters, as previously observed for the T. cruzi trypomastigote total mucins (43, 44). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>The same explanation could also account for the observed discrepancies between the predicted and the observed SDS-PAGE mobility (Fig. 3, A and B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>Altogether, these results are compatible with TSSA being GPI-anchored to the surface of the cell-derived trypomastigote stage. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>Genomic analyses of the tssa locus revealed the existence of two alleles that code for two distinct forms of the protein (Fig. 4 B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the distribution of these alleles correlated with the two major lineages proposed for the species (5, 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>As shown in Fig. 4 C, lineage classification of 19 T. cruzi isolates by our tssa gene-typing assay showed a perfect correlation with two of the most commonly used methods: mini-exon and rDNA PCR polymorphism (5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, it can be proposed that the tssa-I allele is restricted to T. cruzi I isolates (and encodes the TSSA-I isoform) and tssa-II is restricted to T. cruzi II isolates (and encodes the TSSA-II protein). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>In addition to its potential use as a reliable serodiagnostic molecule (Table I) and a genetic tool for T. cruzi typification, TSSA provides with the first immunological marker allowing the lineage identification of infecting isolates on serum samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>Amino acid variations between TSSA-I and TSSA-II are mainly restricted to their central regions (Fig. 4 B), which turned out to comprise the major B cell antigenic determinants (Fig. 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>These sequence changes have a major impact on TSSA antigenicity, leading to negligible cross-reactivity between both isoforms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>As such, anti–TSSA-I hyperimmune sera did not recognize recombinant TSSA-II and viceversa (Fig. 6 A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>Counterpart in vivo evidence was provided by sera from experimentally infected animals (Table II and Fig. 6 B) and from Chagasic patients (Fig. 6 C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>Sera from animals infected with T. cruzi II isolates showed an exclusive recognition toward the TSSA-II molecule. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>In the same line, although weak anti–TSSA-I specific responses are elicited during the infection with T. cruzi I parasites, a proportion of these animals (3 out of 12 rabbits, 3 out of 5 mice, and 5 out of 8 rats) did elicit significant anti–TSSA-I Abs that were unable to cross-recognize TSSA-II (Table II and Fig. 6 B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>The decreased amounts of Abs detectable with the TSSA-I recombinant molecule can be attributed to differences in the course of infection caused by both kinds of parasite lineages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>It has been established that T. cruzi I isolates develop a mild infection in laboratory animals, characterized by low parasitemia and low morbidity rate, thus leading to decreased overall reactivity against parasite antigens (6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, it may be proposed that TSSA-I is less immunogenic than TSSA-II or undergoes major posttranslational modifications in vivo leading to a decreased Ab response against the TSSA-I protein backbone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="343" pm="."><plain>We do not favor the latter hypothesis because the similarities between the primary sequences of both proteins (Fig. 4 B) are strong enough to assume that posttranslational modifications would be similar in kind and extension. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>Further biochemical characterization of both TSSA isoforms should help to clarify this issue. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>The major finding of the present work was that, even though anti–TSSA-I Abs can be readily detected in T. cruzi I experimental infections (Table II), the seroreactivity displayed by Chagasic patients was clearly shifted toward the recognition of TSSA-II (Table I and Fig. 6 C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>As shown, 175 out of 201 (87%) of potentially Chagasic sera and 100% of confirmed Chagasic sera (n = 123) showed specific reactivity against TSSA-II, whereas only 12 out of 324 (3.7%) total Chagasic serum samples displayed a mixed recognition (Table I). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>All of the latter sera, that might have been underestimated due to the low titers of Ab directed toward TSSA-I peptide epitopes elicited during T. cruzi I infections (Table II), exhibited a much stronger anti–TSSA-II Ab response (Fig. 6 C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>Therefore, they can represent detection of minor cross-reactivities due to Ab populations directed against common epitopes in both TSSA isoforms, mostly in high responsive patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>More likely, they can be interpreted as genuine T. cruzi I/T. cruzi II coinfection cases (45). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>It is worth noting that none of the Chagasic sera analyzed so far showed a restricted recognition toward TSSA-I. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>These simple results have a great epidemiological value as it indicates that strains belonging to T. cruzi II (or even a subgroup of this lineage) are by far the more common in producing human infections and, hence, Chagas' disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="352" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, they strongly argue against human infection cases exclusively due to T. cruzi I strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="353" pm="."><plain>Although molecular markers and biological evidences existed associating T. cruzi II with the domestic cycle of the infection and T. cruzi I with the sylvatic cycle (6, 14), TSSA provides with the first antigenic marker supporting this hypothesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="354" pm="."><plain>This fact should be kept in mind for reevaluating previous data obtained in animals experimentally infected with T. cruzi I isolates and, more important, for choosing the appropriate strains to develop animal models to study human pathogenesis and treatments. </plain></SENT>
