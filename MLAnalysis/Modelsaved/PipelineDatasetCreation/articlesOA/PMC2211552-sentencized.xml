</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Entamoeba histolytica, the causative agent of amebiasis, is estimated to be the second leading cause of morbidity and mortality among protozoan parasites worldwide [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Phagocytosis has been one of the most recognized behaviors of E. histolytica. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Erythrophagocytosis has even been used as a diagnostic indicator of invasive E. histolytica infection by microscopy [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Still, little is known concerning why host cells are ingested and/or what affect this has on the course of disease. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Invasive infection by E. histolytica leads to dramatic tissue destruction [3–6], including hallmarks of both apoptotic and necrotic host cell death [7–9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Previous work has demonstrated that following contact by E. histolytica, host cells display many features of apoptosis including DNA laddering, caspase 3 activation and phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic host cells are subsequently ingested by the ameba [10], an interaction which has been shown to involve exposed phosphatidylserine (PS) on the host cell surface [10,11]. In vitro, calcium treatment of erythrocytes causes externalization of phosphatidylserine and an increase in amebic uptake, providing a convenient and physiological model for analysis of this process [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Although little is known concerning the role of this behavior in disease, phagocytosis has been suggested as a virulence determining factor [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Amebic clones [13], and engineered mutants by either expression of dominant negative constructs [14], or by chemical mutagenesis [15] which display defective in vitro phagocytosis are less virulent in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In addition, use of pan-caspase inhibitors to interfere with apoptotic induction in vivo has also reduced infection by this parasite [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Given these results we hypothesized that the identification of proteins which participate in the ingestion of the apoptotic corpse would be key to understanding virulence. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Many individual groups have used the process of ingestion of beads to identify essential proteins required for phagocytosis in organisms ranging from amebae to man [17–19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Criticisms concerning the physiological relevance of bead ingestion have recently been dispelled by data demonstrating that bead ingestion is sensitive to inhibition by Annexin V, similar to uptake of apoptotic cells [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Although large scale proteomic analysis has revealed many interesting proteins, there appears to be much more left to discover. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Controversies concerning both the PS receptor [21] as well as the role of the endoplasmic reticulum in phagocytosis [22,23] indicate that these efforts have not been exhaustive. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Two independent groups have published work using latex beads that were either carboxylated or opsonized with IgG to identify the constituents of the E. histolytica phagosome [24–28]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>However, some metazoan proteins including EEA1, RIN1, and LAMPs do not have discernable homologues in the E. histolytica genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>These recent screens have identified only a small number of surface proteins that could act early in the phagocytic pathway, including Hgl, Igl, ABC transporter, p-glycoprotein-2 and 6, and M17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Of these, only Hgl and Igl have been confirmed as constituents of phagosomes [24]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>The most important finding of this study was the identification of PATMK as a member of the TMK family that participates in erythrophagocytosis and is uniquely required for intestinal but not hepatic infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>In addition this manuscript introduced a novel technique of gene knockdown using shRNA in E. histolytica that could find general usefulness in a parasite for which there is not the ability to replace genes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>The participation of PATMK in ingestion of the dead human red cell was demonstrated not only by shRNA but by identification in the early phagosome proteome, co-localization with erythrocytes, and inhibition with anti-peptide antibodies and by expression of a carboxy-truncated mutant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Enzymatic activity of the kinase domain was not demonstrated when PATMK was expressed and purified from E. coli or immunoprecipitated from E. histolytica, Further studies will therefore be required to understand if PATMK is acting as a receptor for apoptotic red cells or as a regulator of ingestion via its kinase domain. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive analysis of the phagosome proteome was not the goal of this work, as several groups have accomplished this for E. histolytica. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>However it is interesting that each group has identified new molecules of interest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>The first analysis of this type in E. histolytica, published by Okada et al., revealed many of the GTP binding proteins that are important for maturation of phagosomes [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>However, this screen did not reveal any of the endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins identified in metazoan systems [17,22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>More recent work by Marion et al. identified ER resident proteins in E. histolytica phagosomes such as calreticulin as well as significant involvement by myosin IB, actin and actin accessory proteins [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Later this group identified a small number of surface proteins which were suggested as possible receptors [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>The screen reported here was focused on early time points following ingestion with the goal of identifying new surface molecules with roles in this process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>In addition proteins were identified such as amoebapore A and B, which were known to be involved in phagocytosis but had remained absent in other screens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>The most obvious conclusion from this collection of proteomics is that not one effort has taken its screen to saturation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Incompleteness of these screens may also explain the differences that have been published between clinical isolates of E. histolytica [28]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Manipulation of PATMK by binding the ectodomain with antibody (75% reduction of ingestion of calcium treated erythrocytes in M199S with 55mM D-galactose), reducing the protein levels with interfering RNA (65% reduction in M199S with 55mM D-galactose), or by expressing a truncated protein (81%), all produced a similar reduction of erythrophagocytosis in vitro. The mechanism of this interference is not entirely clear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Given that anti-PATMK serum co-localizes with erythrocytes in contact with ameba, we assume that antibody against this protein blocks uptake of erythrocytes by interfering with receptor function, but it is very possible that this could be blocking interaction with a different molecule by steric hinderance or by interfering with signaling (as opposed to receptor) functions of PATMK. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Clearly all of the experimental approaches supported a role for this protein in host cell ingestion by E. histolytica. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Although no kinase activity has been demonstrated, we hypothesize that PATMK is in fact a receptor kinase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>The Mer family of tyrosine kinases provide a paradigm for receptor kinase involvement in phagocytosis [30–32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Mer tyrosine kinase interacts with the bridging molecule GAS6 to recognize PS on apoptotic cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>The identification of the TMK family was one of, if not the most exciting finding from the genome project, because of its lack of precedent in a unicellular eukaryote. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Implication of PATMK in erythrophagocytosis is an important step towards understanding the role of this family of kinases in parasite biology. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Virulence of E. histolytica has been long associated with the parasite's ability to ingest host cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>This work suggests that this may be more important in intestinal disease than in liver abscesses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Ameba expressing PATMKΔ932 had reduced ability to infect the intestine but were not impaired in causing liver abscess when directly injected into the liver. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>A varying requirement for virulence factors in different environments for the amebae has been seen before. For example cysteine protease 2 over-expression was found to reduce in vitro monolayer destruction but had no effect on liver abscess formation [33], and amoebapore A silencing led to inability to cause liver abscesses although these parasites still caused tissue damage in a colonic xenograft model of amebiasis [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>The data presented here concerning a retention of virulence in the liver abscess model as well as the analysis showing that lectin expression on the surface has not been altered illustrate that the ameba are otherwise competent to attach to the host and cause disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>This may indicate that expression of PATMKΔ932 does not simply produce an impaired ameba, but an ameba which fails to colonize the intestine possibly because of failure to clear dead and dying host cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>It also suggests that the virulence program required for the parasite's success in the gut differ from that of the liver. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>The rationale behind phagocytosis of host cells by this parasite is still a mystery, but erythrophagocytosis is a hallmark of E. histolytica infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>One could envision that this behavior provides an advantage during infection by clearing dying and dead cells and thereby reducing the infiltration of inflammatory cells and release of toxic cellular content. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>PATMK may have a pivotal role in allowing this parasite to persist longer in the host. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Interfering with this pathway may produce a more robust immune response to E. histolytica and clearance of infection. </plain></SENT>
