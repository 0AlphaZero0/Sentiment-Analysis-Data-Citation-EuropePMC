The HC forms a groove with six pockets (A&#8211;F) for binding of proteolytic fragments derived from self- and nonself-proteins (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). These peptides are presented to TCRs located on CTLs and initiate a cellular immune response leading to the destruction of the antigen-presenting cell if the peptide is derived from a nonself-protein. Several MHC class I alleles are associated with autoimmune diseases, and allele-specific binding of foreign or self-peptides by MHC class I molecules may be crucial to disease pathogenesis (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>The association of the HLA class I allele <italic>HLA-B27</italic> with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and related spondyloarthropathies is among the strongest observed for any <italic>HLA</italic> gene (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Population analyses have shown that most of the common <italic>HLA-B27</italic> subtypes, including the frequent <italic>B</italic>*<italic>2705</italic> allele, are disease associated, whereas two subtypes, <italic>B</italic>*<italic>2706</italic> and <italic>B</italic>*<italic>2709</italic>, are not (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The B*2705 protein differs in only a single HC amino acid (Asp116) from B*2709 (His116) (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). This residue is located at the floor of the F pocket, which accommodates the COOH-terminal side chain of the bound peptide, and both subtypes can be distinguished by the peptides presented in vivo (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Despite some differences, in particular with regard to the COOH-terminal peptide residue, the majority of the peptides constituting the B*2705 repertoire were found to overlap with those from B*2709 and vice versa (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>A self-peptide (pVIPR, previously termed VIP1R<sub>400&#8211;408</sub>, RRKWRRWHL) with potential arthritogenic properties (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) is derived from vasoactive intestinal peptide type 1 receptor and shows high sequence homology to a peptide from the latent membrane protein 2 (pLMP2, residues 236&#8211;244, RRRWRRLTV) of EBV (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). pVIPR can be presented by both subtypes, but the resulting T cell repertoires are distinct; <italic>B</italic>*<italic>2709</italic> individuals very rarely possess pVIPR-specific T cells, whereas such T cells are more abundant in peripheral blood of healthy <italic>B</italic>*<italic>2705</italic> persons and are very frequently present in patients suffering from AS (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).

Although these findings do not prove a causative role of pLMP2 and pVIPR in AS, they open the possibility to correlate structural properties of these subtypes with the retention (in <italic>B</italic>*<italic>2705</italic>) or elimination (in <italic>B</italic>*<italic>2709</italic>) of pVIPR-specific T cells.</p><p>The two crystal structures described here show that B*2705 accommodates pVIPR in two different conformations, of which one is identical to that seen when complexed with B*2709, whereas the other diverges substantially.

The pVIPR peptide (RRKWRRWHL) was obtained by standard solid phase synthesis and purified by HPLC (Alta Bioscience). The purified protein complexes were used for crystallization at concentrations of 20 mg/ml (B*2705:pVIPR) and 16 mg/ml (B*2709: pVIPR), respectively, in TBS buffer (10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mM NaCl).</p><p>Using hanging drop vapor diffusion, crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction experiments were obtained from a PEG 8000 pH screen. As observed earlier for similar HLA-B27 complexes, streak seeding was indispensible to produce large single crystals. For B*2705:pVIPR, drops made from 1 &#956;l of precipitant solution (0.1 M Tris HCl, pH 8.0, and 16% PEG 8000) and 1 &#956;l of protein solution produced prismatic crystals with a maximum size of 400 &#215; 250 &#215; 250 &#956;m. Using glycerol as cryoprotectant, the best dataset in terms of resolution (1.47 &#197;) was obtained at the BL2 beamline at BESSY-II, Berlin, Germany. In the case of B*2709:pVIPR, drops made of 1 &#956;l of precipitant solution (0.1 M Tris HCl, pH 8.5, and 19% PEG 8000) and 1 &#956;l of protein solution yielded platelike crystals with a maximum size of 300 &#215; 200 &#215; 100 &#956;m. Cryo-cooled crystals of this complex (glycerol as cryoprotectant) allowed collection of a 2.2-&#197; resolution dataset at the X13 beamline at Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron. Both datasets were collected at 100 K and processed with the HKL package (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>; reference <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Structure Determination.</title><p>The structure of HLA-B*2709:pVIPR was determined by molecular replacement using peptide-stripped B*2709:m9 (PDB code 1k5n) as a search model and program molrep (CCP4; reference <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). After rigid body refinement using refmac (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), the initial model was improved with ARP/wARP (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and water molecules were included. Further improvement of the structure was achieved by iterative cycles of manual rebuilding using O (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and restrained maximum-likelihood refinement with refmac comprising isotropic B factor adjustment. After translation, libration, and screw rotation refinement (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), the R value converged at 0.188 (R<sub>free</sub>, 0.244).</p><p>As the two HLA-B27:pVIPR complexes crystallized isomorphously, initial phases for B*2705:pVIPR were calculated from peptide-stripped B*2709:pVIPR with His116 replaced by alanine. This initial model was subjected to rigid body refinement followed by simulated annealing and energy minimization using CNS (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). ARP/wARP was used for improvement of the model and incorporation of water molecules and pVIPR in canonical conformation. After manual rebuilding, inclusion of alternate protein conformations, and atom positional refinement (refmac), there was still residual electron density in the peptide binding groove, to which an additional, noncanonical conformation of pVIPR could be fitted with an estimated occupancy of 0.5 for both peptide chains. Subsequent optimization of atomic displacement parameters decreased the R factor by 2.5% (R<sub>free</sub>, 2%) compared with isotropic refinement, justifying this procedure. Evaluation of anisotropy by parvati (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) showed the expected statistical distribution of 0.52 &#177; 0.14 for all atoms of the structure. The R value converged at 0.128 (R<sub>free</sub> 0.178). The equimolar distribution of the two pVIPR conformations in the B*2705 molecule was confirmed by an occupancy refinement performed with CNS. With the p6&#945; conformation (see Results) omitted from the atomic coordinates, the occupancy of the central part of the peptide refined to occupancies &#8764;0.5, whereas that of p1, p2, p8, and p9 stayed with full occupancy. Similar results were obtained when only the p6&#945; conformation was refined.</p><p>In both structures, radiation-decarboxylated Asp and Glu that showed negative difference electron density were assigned occupancies &lt;1.0. The final models include all 276 residues of the HC, 100 residues of &#946;<sub>2</sub>m (all 99 residues plus NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal Met), all nonhydrogen atoms of the pVIPR peptide, water, and glycerol (from the cryoprotectant). All &#981;/&#968; angles lie in allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (procheck; reference <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).

It has to be emphasized that, due to the isomorphous crystal structures, the intermolecular crystal contacts in both B*2705:pVIPR conformations are comparable, demonstrating that the two different binding modes of pVIPR found only in B*2705 are an intrinsic feature due to the presence of Asp116 and not a crystallographic artifact.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>pVIPR conformations, atomic displacement ellipsoids, and B factors.

No CTL recognizing only T2-B*2709 was observed, although pVIPR was used at a high concentration (70 &#956;M). This experimental setup was chosen to maximize the chances to detect reactivity genuinely specific for B*2705:pVIPR complexes.

Only one CTL line was found (EP76) that selectively reacted with pVIPR presented by T2-B*2705 cells. The complete lack of reactivity against the B*2709:pVIPR complex, even at the high peptide concentration used, indicates that EP76 is directed against a structure different from B*2705:pVIPR-p4&#945; because of the extreme structural similarity of B*2709:pVIPR and the p4&#945; binding mode in B*2705 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A).

This feature is of considerable interest both from structural and immunological points of view. Only one exception to the single binding mode of peptides has been described so far in the crystal structure of the rat RT1-A<sup>a</sup> antigen in complex with the exceptionally long 13-mer peptide MTF-E. Two entirely different MTF-E conformations were found that are possibly associated with crystal packing effects (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Because they could consequently represent nonphysiological artifacts, the two conformations and the reasons why MTF-E does not adopt a single binding mode are different from those reported here.</p><p>The simultaneous occurrence of pVIPR-p4&#945; and pVIPR-p6&#945; in B*2705 may be static or dynamic. If static, the analyzed crystals would be composed of approximately equal amounts of two cocrystallizing asymmetric units: one containing pVIPR-p4&#945; and the other pVIPR-p6&#945;. If dynamic, the peptide would change continually from one conformation to the other within the binding groove, using fixed NH<sub>2</sub>- and COOH-terminal amino acids with pivot points located at or close to the main chain connections of p2-p3 and p7-p8, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref> A and 3 C). Currently, we cannot distinguish between static and dynamic modes of peptide binding, but spectroscopic methods (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) or X-ray analyses of crystals produced at different temperatures may eventually provide an answer.</p><p>Thus far, the presentation of a peptide by an MHC molecule in a single, defined conformation has been considered a prerequisite for positive and negative selection of T cells within the thymus (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). The two drastically different binding modes of pVIPR to B*2705 show that this assumption might be an oversimplification. A peptide changing its conformation dynamically within the groove could possibly preclude high-affinity interaction with the two CDR3 regions of a TCR (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), whereas a static conformation might allow a more efficient recognition. The rare occurrence of pVIPR-specific CTL in <italic>B</italic>*<italic>2709</italic> individuals suggests that the B*2709:pVIPR complex can indeed serve in establishing tolerance (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Conversely, the number of B*2705:pVIPR-p4&#945; and -p6&#945; complexes might fall below the epitope density threshold required for negative selection (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), leading to the frequent presence of autoreactive, pVIPR-specific CTL (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>The CTL lines analyzed here seem to possess relatively low affinity (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), questioning the presentation of the VIPR-derived peptide under physiological conditions, and suggesting the use of VIPR transfectants in cytotoxicity studies. However, even when testing the reactivity of CTLs against EBV-derived peptides, lysis of target cells is rarely observed (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). At least the viral peptides are surely processed and presented; comparative studies with transfectants are usually unsuccessful. In addition, a COOH-terminal pLeu9 as seen in pVIPR does not present an obstacle for efficient proteasomal processing (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) and transport to the endoplasmic reticulum, as shown by peptide elution studies from B*2705 and B*2709 molecules (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The high number of pVIPR-specific CTLs in some <italic>B</italic>*<italic>2705</italic> individuals (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) might be explained by selective increase (clonal expansion) due to cross-reaction. This is not unlikely because TCR cross-reactivity is mandatory for the control of infections (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). In the case discussed here, the pVIPR cross-reactive nonself antigen could be the EBV-derived pLMP2 (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Convincing examples of molecular mimicry between viral and self-proteins have already been identified (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>).</p><p>Unconventional peptide binding modes distantly resembling that observed for the p6&#945; conformation in B*2705:pVIPR have occasionally been found in other MHC:peptide complexes as well (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>), but the involvement of a strategic subtype-specific residue at the floor of the binding groove is unprecedented. The detection of p6&#945; in B*2705:pVIPR but not in the closely related B*2709:pVIPR complex is obviously a consequence of the combined presence of the allele-specific residue Asp116 (B*2705) and a specific peptide sequence with Arg at position 5. The larger size and neutral or positive charge of His116 compared with Asp116 would interfere sterically and electrostatically if the pArg5 side chain were bound to the F pocket (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). The binding of the peptide COOH-terminal pLeu9 to the F pocket brings a further constraint into play: to avoid clashes, it is likely that the side chain of this residue has to be small and hydrophobic, but not positively charged to prevent competition with another basic amino acid (in this instance, pArg5) that contacts Asp116.</p><p>The paucity of peptides with pArg5, such as pLMP2, which have been found to be presented by HLA-B27 molecules under natural conditions (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), makes it difficult to provide an estimate of the generality of the p6&#945; conformation, let alone a dual peptide binding mode, in HLA-B27 molecules. We have found a few further peptides derived from self- as well as microbial proteins that have in common not only an Arg residue but even the WRR motif (unpublished data). As it seems conceivable that some of these peptides share the unorthodox structural features of pVIPR when complexed with the B*2705 subtype, analyses with these novel peptides are underway to examine the possibility that the WRR motif represents a sequence with direct involvement in AS pathogenesis. With only very few structures of HLA-B27:peptide complexes solved to date (Results; references <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), it seems premature to engage in a speculation on the prerequisites for a dual peptide conformation.</p><p>However, the pVIPR-p6&#945; peptide binding mode and its subtype dependency is not a unique, serendipitous finding. We have observed recently that the sequence-related pLMP2 peptide (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) binds in p4&#945;-like form to B*2709 but in p6&#945;-like conformation to B*2705, with pArg5 again forming a bidentate salt bridge with Asp116 (unpublished data). Therefore, the noncanonical binding mode involving residue 116 as observed for one of the conformations in B*2705:pVIPR and even its subtype dependency can be found in other HLA-B27:peptide complexes as well. Most AS-associated <italic>HLA-B27</italic> alleles encode Asp116, whereas this residue is Tyr (B*2706) or His (B*2709) in the two subtypes not associated with AS (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>A constellation similar to that of the B*2705/B*2709 pair is found in A*68012 (Asp116) and A*6807 (His116; reference <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), or in B*3501 (Ser116) and B*3503 (Phe116; reference <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), but comparative structural studies have not been performed for these proteins. Among further <italic>HLA</italic> class I genes, approximately half of the <italic>HLA-A</italic> alleles encode Asp116, and nearly all others encode Tyr116 that occurs also in a smaller number of HLA-B and HLA-C antigens, in which Asp116 is rarely represented (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). However, the mere availability of Asp116 is not sufficient for a basic residue in the middle of a peptide to engage in a p6&#945;-like binding mode. This is exemplified by the HLA-A*0201:MAGE-A4 complex (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>) or HLA-B*4402 and B*4403 complexed with an HLA-DP&#8211;derived peptide (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>): these peptides exhibit Arg either at position 5 or 6 that are solvent exposed and not buried. Other residues on the floor of the binding groove could principally also be involved in noncanonical anchoring modes such as the HC residues 97, 99, and 114, which are, like residue 116, highly polymorphic in HLA class I molecules (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). For example, HLA-B*3501 presents an EBV-derived nonapeptide with pAsp5 contacting Arg97 and Tyr99 (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Clearly, a nonconventional peptide anchoring could be more frequent than currently envisaged.</p><p>Polymorphisms within the MHC class I peptide binding groove as shown here may influence peptide presentation and T cell repertoire selection (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>), but a dual peptide presentation mode as found in B*2705 that depends on the HLA-B27 subtype-specific amino acid exchange is novel. Distinct pVIPR presentation modes and differential AS-association of <italic>B</italic>*<italic>2705</italic> and <italic>B</italic>*<italic>2709</italic> may be linked in the course of the development of AS (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), although other factors influencing AS initiation and progression have to be taken into consideration, among them possible polymorphisms of <italic>HLA-B</italic>&#8211;linked genes (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>).

In conclusion, our results provide an unexpected twist regarding the mode of peptide display as a single, structurally unaltered MHC molecule can present a given peptide in two entirely different binding modes, depending only on a buried HC amino acid polymorphism.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank all patients and the healthy proband for their participation in this paper.
