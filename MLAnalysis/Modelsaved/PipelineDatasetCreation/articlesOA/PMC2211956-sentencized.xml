</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are the main effector arm of the adaptive immune system in charge of combating intracellular pathogens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These cells recognize pathogen-derived peptides presented by surface-expressed MHC class I molecules and lyse the infected cell that bears them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the three-dimensional crystal structures of MHC class I molecules in complex with bound peptide (pMHCs) has revealed in great molecular detail the mechanisms these proteins use to bind a vast number of chemically distinct peptides (1, 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The peptide-binding groove formed by the α1/α2 domains is structured to bind peptides 8–10 amino acids long in an extended conformation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Eight β-strands establish the platform floor of the groove, with two antiparallel α-helices serving as its walls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The peptide binds between these helices and uses its main chain and terminal atoms to form extensive hydrogen bonds to MHC side chains, enabling peptide binding in a predominantly sequence-independent manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Peptide selectivity is achieved via discrete peptide-binding pockets present in the groove that are tailored to preferentially accept a subset of peptide side chains dubbed binding anchors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The high degree of polymorphism observed in class I alleles is clustered to residues that form these binding pockets, providing the basis for allele-specific peptide-binding motifs (3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The motifs for most MHC class I alleles can be described as a combination of preferred residues located at primary and secondary anchor positions (4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Primary anchor residues are typically completely buried within the peptide-binding groove pockets in a tightly coordinated fashion; only a highly restricted set of amino acids can typically serve as the primary anchor of a given pocket, allowing for highly stable peptide binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In contrast, secondary anchor residues tend to be less restrictive in allowable sequence due to flexibility of the engaging pocket, and their substitution to less favorable residues often does not markedly affect peptide-binding affinity or kinetics. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>TCR recognition of pMHC has also been studied extensively (5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The recent crystal structures of TCR–pMHC complexes have demonstrated that the TCR binds in a roughly diagonal orientation over the groove-flanking α-helices, positioning its CDR loops over the peptide (6–8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Numerous studies examining the role of solvent-exposed, TCR-contacting peptide side chains in TCR recognition have shown that even minor chemical differences in them can be discerned (9–12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the peptide anchor side chains are buried and are thought unable to directly contact the TCR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>These, and other similar observations, suggest that modulation of peptide-binding affinity is the dominant way anchor side chains affect TCR recognition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>However, our group and others have recently reexamined this issue and have shown that peptide anchor side chains, especially secondary anchors, can have a more direct effect, independent of peptide-binding affinity, on TCR recognition (13–15). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>One of the best-studied models in which discrete variation affects one of the minor anchor pockets of an MHC class I molecule is provided by allelic variant molecules H-2Kb (Kb) and its spontaneous mutant, H-2Kbm8 (Kbm8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Kbm8 arose from Kb by a gene conversion event (16) that changed four amino acids [Tyr22 to Phe22; Met23 to Ile23; Glu24 to Ser24; and Asp30 to Asn30] all located on the platform floor of the peptide-binding groove. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Of these four residues, two (MHC 23 and 30) are thought to be largely irrelevant to antigen processing and presentation, as their side chains point away from the peptide-binding groove, are not solvent accessible, and are not analogous to residues shown previously to contact TCRs (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The two remaining residues, MHC 22 and 24, point into the groove and serve to create the B pocket, where they contact the side chain of the second amino acid of the bound peptide (P2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Indeed, site-directed mutagenesis has shown that most, if not all, of the effects of the Kbm8 mutation upon presentation of the antigenic peptide OVA-8 can be recapitulated by isolated mutations at MHC 22 and 24 (18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Notably, Kb and Kbm8 have identical sequences at their membrane distal TCR-contacting residues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the bulk of biological differences between them are likely a consequence of indirect effects of the changes in the B pocket, which could be manifest as differences in peptide-binding preferences or alternate conformations of identically presented peptides. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The hallmark of peptides naturally presented by Kb is the presence of two primary anchors: a phenylalanine or tyrosine as the fifth (or sixth) residue and a leucine as the last of eight (or nine) residues (4, 19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>These two primary anchors find themselves deeply buried in the C and F pockets of the Kb peptide-binding groove, respectively, and their substitution to other amino acids typically results in a dramatic reduction in affinity and pMHC stability at the cell surface (20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>We have previously characterized an important secondary anchor located at the peptide P2 position that lies sequestered in the B pocket of the Kb groove that, in this allele, is directly adjacent to the C pocket (21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the preferred residue at P2 depends on which primary anchor occupies the C pocket; Ala and Gly are preferred if the C pocket anchor is Tyr, whereas medium-sized residues predominate for primary Phe anchors (15, 21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Peptide elution experiments demonstrated that many peptides ignore the Kbm8 mutation and are able to bind to both molecules with high stability, although a subset does bind differentially (20, 22). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Despite the discrete nature of the change in Kbm8, the two molecules exhibit differences in several interrelated biological properties, including peptide-dependent antibody recognition (23), cross-reactivity (24, 25), peptide binding and presentation (11, 14, 25, 26), and intrathymic repertoire selection (27, 28). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, the coisogeneic mouse strains C57BL/6 (B6, H-2b) and B6.C-H-2bm8 (bm8, H-2bm8), which differ from each other solely by expression of Kb or Kbm8, also differ in susceptibility to HSV-1, due to the fact that the dominant epitope of this virus, the glycoprotein B epitope 498-505 (called here HSV8), elicits a markedly more efficient CTL response in bm8 mice (29). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Previously, we reported that B6 mice immunized with HSV8 produce CTLs, which readily recognize Kb–HSV8, but are unable to recognize Kbm8–HSV8 (14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>This difference was not due to differential affinity or stability of peptide binding, nor was it due to gross conformational changes, as assayed by a panel of conformation-sensitive antibodies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>As the alteration in Kbm8 potentially changes the hydrogen bond network between the peptide P2 side chain and the MHC B pocket, we hypothesized that this change might somehow be manifest at the pMHC surface, where it could be directly detected by TCR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we performed second-site reversion of the Kbm8 mutation by introducing compensatory P2 peptide mutations that could restore the lost hydrogen bond network. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Indeed, changing the peptide SerP2 to a GluP2 (H2E peptide) compensated for the reciprocal Glu24 to Ser24 mutation present in Kbm8, so that the same Kb–HSV8-reactive TCR that could not recognize Kbm8–HSV8 was able to recognize Kbm8–H2E. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>However, when this H2E peptide was bound to Kb, there was no detectable TCR recognition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Although our paper highlighted an important role for secondary anchor residues in TCR recognition, it remained unclear how exactly these B pocket interactions were being discerned. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>To resolve this issue at the atomic level, we have now undertaken the study of these pMHCs by protein crystallography, solving the crystal structures of four distinct complexes: Kb–HSV8, Kbm8–HSV8, Kb–H2E, and Kbm8–H2E. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Examining the surface properties of each pMHC revealed, to our surprise, only nonconcerted differences that do not appear to correlate with T cell activation profiles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>However, our structures did reveal localized features of the pMHC B pockets that do correspond with our TCR recognition data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>When compared with Kb–HSV8, Kbm8–HSV8 and Kb–H2E contained alternate hydrogen bonding and chemical environments in their B pockets, resulting in loss of B6-derived TCR recognition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, Kbm8 in complex with the H2E peptide containing the secondary anchor substitution resulted in a B pocket environment closely approximating the one present in Kb–HSV8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Thus, our results indicate that pMHC binding pocket modifications can profoundly affect TCR activation without significantly altering the resting state (TCR unliganded) conformation of the pMHC surface, demonstrating that they can be significant determinants in an immune response. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>At that time, we hypothesized that this was due to the loss of hydrogen bonds between SerP2 of HSV8 and the altered B pocket of Kbm8 (particularly due to the key mutations Tyr22 to Phe22 and Glu24 to Ser24). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Specifically, the bm3 mutation is associated with altered presentation of the dEV8 peptide as well as an increase in overall TCR–pMHC contact and SC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Thus, an extremely minor change in hydrogen bonding and chemical environment can have substantial effects on the way a TCR engages nearly isostructural resting state pMHCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>In accordance with this data, we postulate that both our allelic and secondary anchor mutations need not be in direct contact with TCR to elicit profound changes in recognition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>For example, one could speculate that the ability of Kb-restricted, HSV-1–reactive T cells to engage only Kb–HSV8 and Kbm8–H2E is a manifestation of each pMHC's unique ability to adopt a conformation consistent with stable complex formation, or alternatively the transition state energy barrier to achieve a stable complex is too high for the unrecognized pMHCs (46). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>However, irrespective of the discriminatory mechanism, our data clearly support the notion that MHC anchor pocket environments can be just as significant an antigenic determinant as solvent-exposed peptide side chains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Given that some of the most pronounced effects of the Kb/Kbm8 polymorphism exert themselves at the level of intrathymic positive selection of TCR repertoire (27, 28), it is likely that this environment can play a broad role, affecting all the biological consequences of the TCR–pMHC contact. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this also implies that the self-peptides that mediate differential positive selection of TCR when presented by either Kb or Kbm8 must themselves participate in analogous, variable B pocket interactions as does the dominant HSV-1 epitope, providing another level of similarity between antigenic and positively selecting peptides. </plain></SENT>
