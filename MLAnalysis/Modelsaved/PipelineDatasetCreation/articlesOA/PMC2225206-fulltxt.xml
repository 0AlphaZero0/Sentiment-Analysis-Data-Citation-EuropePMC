For example, during replication the unwinding of the chromosome forces adjacent regions of DNA to overwind and underwind, generating a superhelical strain (Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 1988<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb17"> &#9654;</xref>). The removal of this intermolecular strain is vital for the prevention of DNA tangling and knotting, which produces structures that can lead to the formation of double-stranded breaks in the DNA and chromosome instability (Kato <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb10"> &#9654;</xref>); furthermore, it is essential that circular daughter chromosomes of bacteria are disentangled at cell division. The resolution of such structures is performed by topoisomerase IV (topoIV), a type IIA DNA topoisomerase, which can remove these regions of unusual topology by passing one double-helical segment of DNA through another.</p><p>All bacterial type IIA topoisomerases are <italic>A</italic>

            <italic>B</italic>
            <sub>2</sub> heterotetramers containing three discrete subunit interfaces which open and close sequentially in response to ATP binding and hydrolysis in order to effect DNA transport (Wang, 1998<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb16"> &#9654;</xref>). One segment of DNA (termed the gate segment) is initially bound by the <italic>A</italic> subunit, followed by the capture of a second strand (termed the transfer segment) by the <italic>B</italic> subunits as they bind ATP and dimerize. The dimerization and ensuing interaction with the <italic>A</italic> subunits triggers the cleavage of the gate segment. Subsequent hydrolysis of ATP causes the transfer segment to be passed through the DNA gate. DNA passage is followed by resealing of the gate segment and release of the transfer segment from the enzyme (Corbett &amp; Berger, 2004<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb4"> &#9654;</xref>).</p><p>Topoisomerases perform such a vital role in the maintenance of genetic stability within the cell that they are ideal drug targets and are the site of action of numerous antibacterial agents (Hooper, 2001<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb8"> &#9654;</xref>). One class of inhibitor includes the quinolone antibiotics, which have proven to be highly effective against a variety of bacterial species (Oliphant &amp; Green, 2002<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb15"> &#9654;</xref>). These molecules bind to the <italic>A</italic> subunit and stabilize the topoisomerase&#8211;DNA complex formed during the catalytic turnover of the enzyme. The stalled topoisomerase complex then acts as a physical barrier to DNA replication. Collision of an active replication complex with the topoisomerase is thought to lead to the double-stranded breaks necessary for cell lethality (Drlica &amp; Zhao, 1997<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb6"> &#9654;</xref>), although the exact mechanism by which this occurs is unknown.</p><p>Topoisomerase IV has been shown to be the primary target for quinolones in Gram-positive species (Oliphant &amp; Green, 2002<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb15"> &#9654;</xref>), but currently structural information is only available for the DNA-cleavage domains of topoisomerases from eukaryotic (PDB code <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1bgw">1bgw</ext-link>; Berger <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb1"> &#9654;</xref>) and Gram-negative bacterial species (PDB codes <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1ab4">1ab4</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1zvu">1zvu</ext-link>; Morais-Cabral <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb13"> &#9654;</xref>; Corbett <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb5"> &#9654;</xref>). Here, we describe the crystallization and X-ray analysis of two different constructs of the <italic>A</italic> subunit of topoisomerase IV from <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (GrlA) with a view to gaining further insight into the mode of inhibition of quinolone antibiotics against this enzyme.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><label>2.</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1.</label><title>Purification</title><p>Full details of the expression and purification are given elsewhere (Carr <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb2"> &#9654;</xref>). Briefly, the two constructs encompassing the N-&#173;terminal domains of <italic>S. aureus</italic> GrlA (accession code D67075) were generated by PCR from genomic DNA into the expression vector pET15b, such that 23 amino acids derived from the vector (including a hexahistidine tag) are fused to codons 25&#8211;491 or 1&#8211;491 of GrlA. This leads to the generation of proteins with molecular weights of approximately 56&#8197;kDa (GrlA56) and approximately 59&#8197;kDa (GrlA59), respectively. Protein expression was performed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> B834 DE3 (plysS) cultures by incubation at 310&#8197;K for 3&#8197;h after the addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 0.5&#8197;m<italic>M</italic>.

The diffraction images collected from crystals of GrlA56 were unusual in that they contained strong reflections when the <italic>h</italic> index was even and weak reflections when <italic>h</italic> was odd (Fig. 2<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> &#9654;</xref>).</p><p>The GrlA56 crystals belong to space group <italic>P</italic>2<sub>1</sub> (Table 1<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1"> &#9654;</xref>) and could contain between two and six copies of the construct per asymmetric unit, with four copies corresponding to a solvent content of 56% (Matthews, 1968<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb12"> &#9654;</xref>). Calculation of a self-rotation function (Fig. 3<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> &#9654;</xref>) reveals the presence of orthorhombic pseudosymmetry, so the data were rescaled applying the pseudosymmetry (<italic>P</italic>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2) indicated by inspection of systematic absences. Preliminary attempts at molecular replacement into the pseudo-cell using <italic>AMoRe</italic> (Navaza, 1994<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb14"> &#9654;</xref>) were performed using the complete model of the 59&#8197;kDa fragment of DNA gyrase from <italic>E. coli</italic> (PDB code <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1ab4">1ab4</ext-link>; Morais Cabral <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb13"> &#9654;</xref>). This revealed a dimer within the asymmetric unit with an intermolecular twofold axis coincident with the crystallographic twofold. A slight distortion of the molecules that shifted the molecular twofold away from the crystallographic twofold would result in a lower symmetry monoclinic space group.</p><p>Applying a solvent content of 56% to the monoclinic cell suggests the presence of four molecules per asymmetric unit. Knowledge of the packing within the crystal suggests they should be arranged as a pair of dimers related by a direct translation of <italic>a</italic>/2 and each possessing a noncrystallographic twofold axis almost parallel to <italic>c</italic>. This packing also accounts for the presence of weak <italic>h</italic>
            <sub>odd</sub> reflections in the diffraction pattern, as the similar orientation of each pair of dimers results in the strong reflections corresponding to a unit cell with a cell edge of <italic>a</italic>/2 interspersed with weak intensities generated solely by the small differences between the two independent dimers. Further refinement of this model was severely impeded by the translational NCS relating each dimer within the asymmetric unit and this led to the redesign and production of the GrlA59 construct.</p><p>Crystals of GrlA59 belong to space group <italic>P</italic>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2 (Table 1<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1"> &#9654;</xref>), contain one molecule per asymmetric unit and have a solvent content of 56%. The unit cell is related to that observed for GrlA56 crystals, but slight differences in packing have increased the order within the crystals, leading to the smaller unit cell and higher symmetry. It is possible that the additional residues at the N-terminus have created extra crystal contacts. It is likely that the orientation of the monomer within the asymmetric unit is such that the intermolecular twofold axis is parallel to <italic>c</italic>. Molecular replacement performed as previously described for GrlA56 confirm this assertion, generating a model suitable for rebuilding and refinement.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Val Sergeant for technical support and David Flot (ID23.2, ESRF) for assistance during data collection.
