</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The genus Brassica is one of the core genera in the tribe Brassicaceae and includes a number of crops with wide adaptation under a variety of agroclimatic conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Economically, Brassica species are important sources of vegetable oil, fresh, preserved vegetables, and condiments. B. napus, B. rapa, B. juncea, and B. carinata provide about 12% of the worldwide edible vegetable oil supply [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The B. rapa and B. oleracea subspecies represent many of the vegetables in our daily diet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In particular, B. rapa ssp. pekinensis (Chinese cabbage), on which this article focuses, is one of the most widely used vegetable crops in northeast Asia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Brassica species are important sources of dietary fiber, vitamin C, and anticancer compounds [2]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The genetic relationships among the different diploid and amphidiploid Brassica species are described by the U’s triangle [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Of the six widely cultivated species of Brassica, B. rapa (AA, 2n = 20), B. nigra (BB, 2n = 16), and B. oleracea (CC, 2n = 18) are monogenomic diploids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The remaining three species, B. juncea (AABB, 2n = 36), B. napus (AACC, 2n = 38), and B. carinata (BBCC, 2n = 34) exhibit stable diploid genetics, but are allotetraploids, which have evolved via hybridization between differing monogenomic diploids [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The diploid Brassica genomes range from 1.1 pg/2C (529 Mbp/1C) for B. rapa to 1.4 pg/2C (696 Mbp/1C) for B. oleracea (see Figure 1) [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The genomes of the allotetraploids range from 2.2 pg/2C (1,068 Mbp/1C) for B. juncea to 2.6 pg/2C (1,284 Mbp/1C) for B. carinata (see Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The genus Brassica is characterized by morphological diversity with regard to inflorescences, leaves, stems, roots, and terminal or apical buds [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>For example, such morphological diversity can be easily observed in subspecies of B. oleracea: the enlarged inflorescences of cauliflower (B. oleracea ssp. botrytis) and broccoli (B. oleracea ssp. italica); the enlarged stems of kohlrabi (B. oleracea ssp. gongylodes) and marrowstem kale (B. oleracea ssp. medullosa); and the many axillary buds of Brussels sprout (B. oleracea ssp. gemmifera) [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The morphological diversity in Brassica species may be linked to genomic changes associated with polyploidization [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The polyploidization in Brassica species has brought about triplication of genomic segments and subsequent rearrangements such as inversions, insertions, deletions, and substitutions [7–16], and these genetic variations may cause novel phenotypic variations for traits among these species [5, 6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Thus, Brassica genomics will provide us with an understanding of the rapid phenotypic evolution of polyploid plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Additionally, it will help us to understand genomic changes and how they shape the allotetrapolyploid Brassica species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>For example, a study has been done looking at rapid genomic changes and the effect of nuclear-cytoplasm interaction in synthetic allotetrapolyploid species [17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Because of the high economic value of Brassica species throughout the world and their potential to be models for the study of polyploidization, genome sequencing projects for Brassica species, especially B. rapa and B. oleracea, have recently been initiated (http://www.brassica.info) [18–20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In particular, B. rapa ssp. pekinensis inbred line Chiffu-401-42, discussed in this article, has been selected for Brassica-A genome sequencing in the Brassica rapa Genome Sequencing Project (BrGSP) (http://www.brassica.info), a component of the consortium of the Multinational Brassica Genome Project, with the goal of completely sequencing this genome through a BAC-by-BAC approach. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Karyotyping is the starting point for understanding the genome structure of a species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it provides insight into genome evolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Most of the karyotypic analyses in B. rapa have been performed on mitotic metaphase chromosomes [21–24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>However, the analyses are limited in what they can reveal about the cytological structure of the genome because of the low resolution of the technique. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>For example, different measurements of chromosome lengths and rDNA loci are obtained by this method. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Recently, the high-resolution karyotype for the B. rapa ssp. pekinensis inbred line Chiffu was determined on pachytene chromosomes by using 4′-6-diamino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) staining and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of rDNAs and pericentromeric satellite repeats [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>By DAPI analysis, the mean lengths of ten pachytene chromosomes ranged from 23.7 μm to 51.3 μm, with a total of 385.3 μm, a total length which is 11.9- ∼17.5-fold longer than that of the mitotic metaphase chromosomes reported by Lim et al. [24] and Koo et al. [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>In comparison, pachytene chromosome length of A. thaliana, Medicago truncatula, and tomato was estimated to be about 7.4%, 15%, and 24% of the total pachytene chromosome length, respectively (reviewed in Koo et al. [25]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>In B. rapa, the pachytene karyotype consists of two metacentric (chromosomes 1 and 6), five submetacentric (chromosomes 3, 4, 5, 9, and 10), two subtelomeric (chromosomes 7 and 8), and one acrocentric chromosome (chromosome 2), with the corresponding centromeric index ranges of 38.8–41.0%, 29.5–36.7%, 17.4–20.2%, and 9.38%, respectively [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>In the chromosomal structure at pachytene, the total length of pericentromeric heterochromatin regions was estimated to be 38.2 μm, which is approximately 10% of the total chromosome length [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>In conjunction with chromosomal structure and characteristics, 5S rDNA loci were located on pericentromeric regions of the short arms of chromosomes 2 and 7 as well as the long arm of chromosome 10, while 45S rDNA loci were located on the short arms of chromosomes 1, 2, 4, and 5 as well as the long arm of chromosome 7 [24, 25]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Brassica species are closely related to A. thaliana, having diverged 17-18 million years ago (MYA) from their common ancestor [16]. A. thaliana, which has been completely sequenced, has a rather small genome (about 146 Mb) with relatively little repetitive DNA and a high gene density [26, 27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Protein-coding regions of the genomes of Brassica species show high sequence conservation with those of A. thaliana, with nucleotide sequence similarity in exons between B. oleracea and A. thaliana ranging from 75% to 90%, compared to &lt;70% for intronic regions [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>This similarity allows the identification of sets of candidate genes in Brassica species and the studying of their genome structures through comparative genomics [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Comparative studies between Arabidopsis and Brassica have revealed the presence of collinear chromosome segments (see Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Comparative genetic mapping between diploid Brassica species and A. thaliana to identify homologous loci have revealed many conserved blocks in their genomes [7, 8, 14, 30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Comparative physical mapping between Arabidopsis and Brassica further corroborated the findings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>A set of six bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), representing a 431-kb contiguous region of Arabidopsis chromosome 2, was mapped on chromosomes and DNA fibers of B. rapa [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Moreover, studies on a 222-kb gene-rich region of A. thaliana chromosome 4 and its homologous counterparts in B. rapa or B. oleracea revealed the collinearity of genes in homologous segments [9, 11, 13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>This finding was supported by sequence analysis of specific homologous genomic segments [15, 16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>However, many structural rearrangements differentiate the Brassica and Arabidopsis chromosomes (see Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Comparative genetic mapping between B. nigra and A. thaliana species revealed that the average length of conserved segments between the two species was estimated at about 8 cM, which corresponds to ∼90 rearrangements since the divergence of the two species [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>In addition, it was found that gene contents in their homologous genomic segments were also variable with interstitial gene losses and insertions [9, 11, 13, 15, 16]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Genome triplication of diploid Brassica species </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Most of the comparative studies mentioned above demonstrated that Brassica species contain extensively triplicated counterparts of the corresponding homologous segments of the A. thaliana genome (see Figure 2), thereby suggesting that diploid Brassica species may have been derived from a hexaploid ancestor: the genome which was similar to Arabidopsis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the nature of genome triplication, Yang et al. [16] reported that paralogous subgenomes of diploid Brassica species triplicated 13∼17 MYA, very soon after the Arabidopsis and Brassica divergence that occurred at 17∼18 MYA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>In addition, it was reported that after the Brassica genomes had triplicated, their subgenomes were rearranged by inversions, translocations [7, 12, 32], extensive interspersed gene loss, as well as gene insertions occurred relative to the inferred structure of the ancestral genome (see Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Additionally, such genome triplication was extensively found across the tribe Brassicaceae [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>In comparison with the genome of A. thaliana, the genome triplication in Brassica species has clearly led to an increase in the genome size, resulting in a 3- to 5-fold inflation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Genome triplication events in Brassica species may also have an effect on gene expression of multicopy genes, leading to such phenomena as pseudogenization, subfunctionalization, or neofunctionalization in species [33–38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>For example, the MADS-box transcription factor family, whose members control key aspects of plant vegetative and reproductive development, shapes genetic systems by subfunctionalization [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>It appears that after polyploid formation, considerable and sometimes very rapid changes in genome structure and gene expression have occurred. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Researchers have hypothesized that genomic triplication in Brassica species permits mutations in loci that are normally under tight selective constraints in Arabidopsis, and may thus result in the observed greater phenotypic plasticity in Brassica [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Studies on expression of duplicated genes in Brassica species will provide insight into the role of polyploidization in the phenotypic divergence of the plant genus. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Analyses of BAC-end sequence or genome survey sequences assist in understanding whole genome structure [39–41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>It was estimated that the B. rapa genome might contain about 43000 genes (covering 16.8% of the genome), 1.6 times more than the A. thaliana genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Recently, Yang et al. [16] also estimated the gene content of B. rapa to range from 49,000 to 63,000, based on predictions from microsynteny studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that chromosomal triplication events in Brassica have led to an increase in gene number with subsequent gene loss [15, 16, 39, 42]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Transposable elements (TEs) with a predominance of retrotransposons were estimated to occupy approximately 14% of the genome (covering approximately 74 Mb), 8.2 times greater than that observed previously in A. thaliana [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Zhang and Wessler [44] reported that TEs in B. oleracea constituted 20% of the genome, slightly more than what was predicted for the B. rapa genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Of the predicted TEs, LTR retrotransposon families were the most abundant (69.9%), followed by non-LTR retrotransposons (13.4%), DNA transposons (11.4%), and other retrotransposons (5.3%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>In particular, Ty1/copia-like and Ty3/gypsy-like retrotransposons occupied 39.5% and 30.2% of LTR retrotransposon families, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>The amplification of TEs in B. rapa, especially retrotransposons, may have played a crucial role in both evolution and genomic expansion. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) have been estimated to occur with a frequency of approximately one per 4.8 kb within the B. rapa genome, as compared to approximately one per 3.2 kb within the A. thaliana genome [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Of SSRs identified, trinucleotides were the most abundant repeat type, constituting about 37% of all SSRs, a percentage similar to those reported in other plant genomes [39, 45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Comparison of SSR densities in different genomic regions demonstrated that SSR density was greatest immediately in 5′-flanking regions of predicted genes [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>SSRs were also preferentially associated with gene-rich regions, with pericentromeric heterochromatin SSRs mostly associated with retrotransposons [45], suggesting that the distribution of SSRs in the genome is nonrandom [39, 45]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Centromeric repeats characterized in plant genomes are composed of 155∼180-bp tandem repeat motifs, including the 180-bp pAL1 satellite in A. thaliana [48–50], the 155∼165-bp CentO satellite in rice [51, 52], the 156-bp CentC satellite in maize [53] and the 169-bp satellite in Medicago truncatula [54, 55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Centromeric satellite repeats of Brassica species, except for those of B. nigra, are represented by the 176-bp CentBr [24, 25, 56–59]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>The distances of genetic linkage maps ranged from 890 cM to 1850 cM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>However, the genetic linkage maps may not provide direct and accurate genetic information for the Chiffu genome sequencing because of genetic variation between the mapping populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>For that reason, the BrGSP community has constructed the CK genetic linkage map. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>Using the 78 CKDH lines, a reference genetic linkage map has been constructed [67]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>The map consists of a total of 556 markers, including 278 AFLPs, 235 SSRs, 25 RAPDs, and 18 ESTPs/STS/CAPS markers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Ten linkage groups were identified and designated as R1 to R10 via mapping with SSR markers derived from the reference linkage map of B. napus reported previously [68] (Table 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>The total length of the linkage map was 1182 cM with an average interval of 2.83 cM between adjacent loci. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Recently, for high-resolution genetic mapping, the community has set a goal of developing more than 1,000 SSR markers derived from BAC-end sequences, ESTs, and BACs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Moreover, based on the sequence-tagged site (STS) markers, a CKRI genetic linkage map has been constructed to be complementary to the CKDH one. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>The linkage groups in these genetic maps may not correspond to the chromosomes assigned in the cytogenetic map. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is important to align the linkage groups on the genetic map with chromosomes of the cytogenetic map. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>All ten linkage groups of a reference genetic map of B. rapa are being assigned to the corresponding chromosomes through fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using locus-specific BAC clones as probes (see an example in Figure 3, unpublished data). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>The fingerprinted BAC map (so-called “physical map”) makes it possible to select clones for sequencing that would ensure comprehensive coverage of the genome and reduce sequencing redundancy [69]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>In addition, the clone-based map also enables the identification of large segments of the genome that are repeated, thereby simplifying the sequence assembly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>To construct a deep-coverage BAC physical map of the B. rapa genome, all BAC clones from the three BAC libraries were fingerprinted using restriction enzyme digestion and SNaPshot [70] methodologies, and then BAC contigs have been assembled by FingerPrinted Contigs (FPC) software (http://www.agcol.arizona.edu/software/fpc/). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Of 91000 BAC-end sequences, a total of 45232 showed significant sequence similarity with unique Arabidopsis sequences, and 4317 BAC clones were allocated on Arabidopsis chromosomes by significant matching with both ends within 30–500 kb intervals, which span 93 Mb of Arabidopsis euchromatin regions (covering 78.2% of the Arabidopsis genome). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Based on the physical map of B. rapa and the in silico comparative map of its BAC-ends onto Arabidopsis chromosomes, 629 seed BACs have been selected spanning 86 Mb of Arabidopsis euchromatin regions and scattered throughout the B. rapa genome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.brassica-rapa.org">http://www.brassica-rapa.org</ext-link>), and the BACs have been mapped on B. rapa chromosomes by STS mapping and FISH analysis. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Brassica species are economically important crops and serve as model plants for studying phenotypic evolution associated with polyploidization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>The Brassica genomes have extensively triplicated and undergone subsequent genome rearrangements with sequence variations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>This has significantly affected their genome structure and may underline phenotypic diversity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Genome sequencing of B. rapa can pave the way for elucidation of the relationship between genome evolution and phenotypic diversity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it enables us to search for genes and develop molecular markers associated with agricultural traits, thereby establishing a molecular breeding system contributing to improvement of Brassica species economically. </plain></SENT>
