</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv) are key regulators of cellular excitability by shaping action potentials, tuning neuronal firing patterns, synaptic integration and neurotransmitter release [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Kv channels comprise four subunits arranged symmetrically around a central ion-conducting pore. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Each subunit consists of six transmembrane segments, including an S5–S6 region encompassing the aqueous pore and a peripheral S1–S4 voltage sensor domain (VSD). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>A large body of evidence indicates that the first four arginine residues in S4 account for most of the 12–13 electronic charges per channel that are translocated across the membrane's electric field [2], [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Although it is well accepted that the movement of the voltage-sensing S4 helix is tightly coupled to opening and closing of the cytoplasmic S6 channel gate, the nature of S4 motion is uncertain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Specifically, the topology of the VSD in the channel closed state and the magnitude of the S4 movement following depolarization remain controversial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>So far, three main models of VSD motion have been proposed: (i) the transporter model, in which S4 moves only a small distance (2–3 Å), but through a focused and mobile electric field within an aqueous crevice whose accessibility changes during gating [4]; (ii) the helical screw model, in which the S4 helix rotates clockwise and translates outward (∼13 Å) along its axis to move the gating charges across the membrane electric field [5], [6]; (iii) the paddle model where the sensing unit (S4-S3b) undergoes a large transverse movement (∼15–20 Å) across the membrane and in which the S4 arginines are mostly exposed to lipids [7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>While great efforts have been dedicated to elucidate the nature of the VSD motion using Shaker channels as a general model, virtually no study has addressed this key issue in Kv7.1 channels [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>This question is particularly pertinent in light of the pathophysiological importance of cardiac Kv7.1 (KCNQ1) channels and their unusual slow gating kinetics arising from their native co-assembly with the KCNE1 β subunits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In this work, we substituted residues along the S4 N-terminus and the short S3–S4 linker with cysteines and studied their propensity to form metal or disulfide bridges, using Cd2+ or copper-phenanthroline (Cu-Phen), respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Experimental data and structural modeling constrain the Kv7.1 closed state to an intra-VSD S1–S4 interaction and, upon depolarization to an inter-VSD S1–S4 interaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In the accompanying paper, we show that KCNE1 interferes with the inter-VSD S1–S4 interaction and thereby modulates Kv7.1 voltage sensor properties. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The wild-type (WT) Kv7.1 subunit has nine endogenous cysteines, of which three are in principle accessible from the external solution and could thus potentially form metal or disulfide bridges (C136, C214 and C331, located in the S1, S3 and S6 transmembrane segments, respectively) (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The remaining six cysteines are intracellularly located and likely inaccessible from the external solution; thus, they were not considered as potential coordinating residues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>We first introduced single cysteine mutations into the short S3–S4 linker and the S4 N-terminus (residues 220–228) in the background of WT Kv7.1 channels and expressed the mutant channels in Xenopus oocytes (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>We examined the propensity of engineered cysteines to form metal or disulfide bridges, using extracellular Cd2+ ions (100 µM) or copper-phenanthroline (100 µM, Cu-Phen; 1∶3 ratio) respectively, and studied their effects on K+ currents by two-electrode voltage-clamp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>As shown in Figure 2A and B, neither Cd2+ nor Cu-Phen significantly affected WT Kv7.1 channels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Current amplitudes, gating parameters and kinetics were unaffected by either reagents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>This suggests that none of the endogenous cysteines in Kv7.1 is able to form a metal or disulfide bridge under these experimental conditions or alternatively, if any bridge is formed it does not affect channel function. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>When recording of mutant I227C was performed without prior incubation of oocytes with 100 µM DTT (1 hour at 20°C under no voltage-clamp), large K+ currents were observed with a characteristic instantaneous rising component (at +40 mV, Iinst/Imax ratio = 0.40±0.05; n = 11) and a partial loss of the voltage dependence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>This latter feature was reflected by significant inward K+ currents evoked upon hyperpolarization (Figure 4A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Sometimes, tonic currents were recorded with a linear ohmic K+ current-voltage relation (Erev = −94±2 mV, n = 11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Following one hour preincubation of oocytes with 100 µM DTT, these features disappeared (at +40 mV, Iinst/Imax ratio = 0.1±0.01; n = 11, p&lt;0.01) and I227C channels regained the properties of clear voltage dependence and outward-rectification (Figure 4B and C, upper inset). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that in I227C channels, disulfide bonds form spontaneously and stabilize the mutant channels in the open state. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Therefore, to prevent spontaneous openings and to check the effects of Cd2+ and Cu-Phen, we routinely preincubated the oocytes with 100 µM DTT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Removal of DTT by external application of 100 µM Cd2+ to oocytes expressing I227C channels, rapidly converted the slow voltage-dependent activation into instantaneous leak K+ current (Figure 4B, lower inset; τact slow = 981±138 ms vs. τact fast = 90±10 ms, at +40 mV, n = 10), with an increased Iinst/Imax ratio (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>This drastic change is reflected by the conversion of the outwardly-rectifying K+ current into a linear I-V relation (Fig. 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Consequently, Cd2+ potently increased the amplitude of the inward current (by ∼11.8-fold at −140 mV, n = 11, p&lt;0.01) while slightly enhancing that of the outward current (by ∼1.2-fold at +40 mV). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>A significant activation was already observed at 25 µM Cd2+ (∼5-fold increase at −140 mV, n = 6, p&lt;0.01). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>To further quantify the Cd2+ effect, we calculated the rectification index which corresponds to the ratio of the current amplitude measured at −140 mV to that measured at −5 mV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>The larger is this ratio, the stronger is the constitutive open leak K+ current component (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Thus, for I227C channels the rectification index is 0.064 and 0.481 in the absence and presence of 100 µM Cd2+, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>These effects of Cd2+ were substantially reversed upon a 5 min washout, with yet some trend of spontaneous openings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>We reasoned that if the mutant I227C is able to form a metal bridge, which is likely involved in the activating effect of Cd2+, it should also be capable of forming a covalent disulfide bond induced by Cu-Phe, with the same functional consequences on channel activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>We obtained very similar results when oocytes expressing I227C were externally exposed to 100 µM Cu-Phen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Cu-Phen progressively converted the voltage-dependent outwardly-rectifying K+ current into an instantaneous leak K+ current (Figure 4C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Thus, Cu-Phen strongly stimulated the inward K+ current at negative potentials (by ∼20-fold at −140 mV; n = 10, p&lt;0.001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>The stimulation of I227C currents induced by Cu-Phen (including the positive holding current, Figure 4D, left) could not be reversed by washout using the ND96 buffer, but was fully reversible using ND96 containing 1 mM DTT, a reagent which reduces disulfide bridges into free sulfhydryl-cysteines (Figure 4D, right). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Next, we examined the state-dependence of disulfide bridge formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>When oocytes are preincubated for 10 min with Cu-Phen (100 µM) and subsequently washed out for 5 min with ND96, all at −80 mV, opening the I227C channels by a step depolarization to 0 mV produced a time- and voltage-dependent K+ current (red trace before the arrow) without any instantaneous component (Figure 4E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>In contrast, fast reapplication of Cu-Phen during depolarization to 0 mV gradually stimulated the current within second time-scale (Figure 4E, red trace after the arrow). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Using an identical preincubation protocol of Cu-Phen (10 min preincubation and 5 min wash at −80 mV), a step hyperpolarization to −140 mV did not produce any inward K+ current (Figure 4E, lower panel, black trace before the arrow). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Similarly, fast reapplication of Cu-Phen during hyperpolarization to −140 mV did not generate inward currents (black trace after the arrow). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Altogether, these data suggest an open state-dependence for disulfide bridge formation in mutant I227C. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>We showed that disulfide and metal bridges can form in homomeric I227C channels only upon depolarization, which locks the channels in the open state. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>At hyperpolarized potentials, it was also found that I241C (C136 in Kv7.1) can spontaneously form disulfide and metal bridges with R362C (R228 in Kv7.1). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>The model is also consistent with recently described closed state topology of S4 with respect to S1 (down state) [15], [16], [20], [21], where replacement of the first arginine R362 in Shaker (R228 in Kv7.1) by a histidine or by a small uncharged amino acid generates a proton or a cation (omega current) pore, respectively [4], [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a recent high resolution structure of the paddle of a Kv2.1-1.2 chimera channel in a membrane-like environment reveals that negatively charged amino acids in the VSD are grouped into two clusters: an external and an internal negative clusters whose residues are highly conserved in Kv7.1 channels [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>While the external negative cluster is located in an external aqueous cleft, the internal negative cluster belongs to a buried network of charged amino acids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Notably, a conserved phenylalanine (F167 in Kv7.1), positioned near the midpoint of the membrane, separates these external and internal negative clusters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>In the open conformation, the R4 α carbon (R237 in Kv7.1) is expected to be located at the level of this phenylalanine (F167 in Kv7.1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>Thus, it was suggested that in the channel open state a histidine side chain at this R4 location is well positioned to flip above and below the conserved phenylalanine side chain by rapid rotamer exchange, allowing protons to be transferred [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>It remains to determine whether such proton currents could be measured in Kv7.1 channels under these conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Overall, our data indicate a crucial role of S1 in funneling S4 motion during Kv7.1 gating. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the large VSD motion that we infer for Kv7.1 channel gating is in line with the most recent structural and functional studies [22], [23], indicating that the entire voltage sensing domain moves in a relatively unconstrained environment within the lipid membrane. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>To obtain the closed state, we first aligned the Kv7.1 open-state model with KcsA (PDB ID code 1K4C) by superposing the selectivity filter and the pore helix of the two structures, as performed by Long et al [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Then, the VSD (S1, S2, S3, S4 and the S4–S5 linker) and the lower part of S6 (ALA344-GLN356) were moved together using the bent around His258 (i.e., between S5 and the S4–S5 linker) as a pivot, until the lower part of the Kv7.1 S6 (ALA344-GLN356) aligned three-dimensionally with its homologous segment in KcsA (THR107-GLN119) (52 backbone atoms giving RMS value of 0.39 Å). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>At this stage, the VSDs adopted an excessively low topology and therefore they were manually tilted and lifted while preserving interactions between S6 and the S4–S5 linker to keep the bottom-pore constriction, closed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>The latter step takes into account previous inferences about gating charges of S4 that move through a narrow pathway between open internal and external vestibules [21], [26], [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>The S4 was rotated around its longitudinal axis by ∼190 degrees and was translated downward by ∼12 Å so as to account for the experimental results showing that, in the closed state, Cys substituted at position 225 interacts with Cys136 of the same subunit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>This rotation-translational motion allows the first arginine of S4 (Arg228) to pass near Cys136 of the same VSD and to become, at the end of the movement, sufficiently close to Glu160 (in S2) to enable ion pairing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Such proximities were shown to take place between the homologous positions in other voltage-dependent K+ channels [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>The C-terminus of S3 and the N-terminus of S4 (i.e., their most extracellular parts) are separated by only three amino acids. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Both S3 and S4 could move relatively far from S1 and S2, owing to a 20-amino acid long loop sequence residing between the bottom parts of S2 and S3. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>A major constraint that guided us to introduce the conformational changes in order to obtain the intermediate state relates to the open-state stabilizing interactions between two neighboring VSDs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>Of particular importance is the observation that position 227 of one VSD gets very close to position 227 of an adjacent VSD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>This is feasible only if a VSD moves upward during activation to the intermediate state where it can tilt toward- and interacts with a neighboring VSD that is still down in its closed-state conformation (resting state). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>For that purpose, we have used the flexible loop between S4 and S4–S5 helical linker (244QGG) as a pivoting hinge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>The S4 of the closed-state conformation was rotated clockwise by ∼90–100 degrees and translated upward by ∼4 Å. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>In this intermediate transition, the side chains of two Ile227 of neighboring VSDs get close to each other, while R228 of S4 of the upper-tilted activated VSD interacts with the Cys136 in S1 of the neighboring VSD, as shown in Figure 9C. </plain></SENT>
