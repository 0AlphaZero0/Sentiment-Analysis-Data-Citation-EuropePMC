<italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> is the cause of several gastroduodenal diseases, including chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer and gastric carcinoma <xref rid="pone.0002259-Ernst1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0002259-Parsonnet1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. <italic>H. pylori</italic> strains appear spread by person-to-person contact and humans seem the only identified source of infection <xref rid="pone.0002259-Drumm1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Prevalence studies suggest that infection is mostly acquired during childhood, and parent-to-child infection, especially involving infected mothers, has been suggested to be the major route of transmission <xref rid="pone.0002259-Rothenbacher1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002259-Tindberg1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, evidence for sibling transmission has been also reported and the exact routes of transmission remain elusive <xref rid="pone.0002259-Goodman1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Familial transmission of infection has been investigated by molecular typing studies, identifying clones shared by family members <xref rid="pone.0002259-Nwokolo1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0002259-Han1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Clonal descent among the <italic>H. pylori</italic> isolates infecting a family has been documented in one isolate from each biopsy of different members of families by comparing alleles of genes including <italic>vacA</italic>, <italic>flaA</italic> and <italic>flaB</italic>

Indeed, homologous recombination, highly dependent on sequence similarity, is expected to be frequent within this species <xref rid="pone.0002259-Vulic1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Therefore, it is important for epidemiological analysis, not only to study the transmission of a small number of genes between isolates from different members of a family, but also to investigate their whole genomic diversity.</p><p>The genetic diversity and evolutionary dynamics of <italic>H. pylori</italic> isolates strains can be explored by using macro-arrays to examine strain-specific genes. The whole genomes of <italic>H. pylori</italic> strains J99 (isolated from a white American in Tennessee with ulcer and belonging to the hspWAfrica subpopulation of hpAfrica1 <xref rid="pone.0002259-Gressmann1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and 26695 (isolated from a patient from United Kingdom with gastritis belonging to the hpEurope population) have been compared revealing regions that have extremely variable gene content that are referred to as &#8220;plasticity zones&#8221; (PZ)<xref rid="pone.0002259-Alm1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. They are the preferred sites for the insertion of a pathogenicity island <italic>cag</italic>, <italic>cag</italic>PAI, which is a large mobile element associated with an enhanced risk for the development of duodenal ulcers and adenocarcinoma of the distal stomach <xref rid="pone.0002259-Salama1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Also, several restriction/modification genes (R-M) often associated with insertion or repeat elements differ in terms of GC content from the rest of the genome; these genes may aid the bacteria under particular circumstances during their long-term infection of genetically diverse hosts <xref rid="pone.0002259-Gressmann1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The analysis of the presence or absence of genes at such loci gives an overall indication of diversity and can help to distinguish strains in various clinical contexts <xref rid="pone.0002259-Salama1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002259-Joyce1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>We previously studied intrafamilial spread by analysing polymorphism of two housekeeping genes (<italic>hspA</italic> and <italic>glmM</italic>) following the failure of treatment to eradicate infection of a child <xref rid="pone.0002259-Raymond1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Here, in addition to sequence analysis, we investigated the whole genome composition in <italic>H. pylori</italic> isolates colonizing the stomachs of infected members of three different families. Macro-arrays were used to test for 248 non ubiquitous open reading frames (ORFs) and 48 ubiquitous ORFs. Gene profiles were used to reconstruct gene transfer and gene loss events that had occurred in isolates. Phylogenetic analysis based on housekeeping genes sequences and genome composition in non ubiquitous genes provided an overview of the evolutionary dynamics of <italic>H. pylori</italic> strains infecting each family. Isolates with slight differences in gene content belonging to a same strain were carried by more than one family member, suggesting that circulation of strains between different hosts makes a significant contribution to the genomic diversity of <italic>H. pylori</italic>. Furthermore, re-infection of a child with a strain, with a genetic profile never observed in the family (before and after treatment<italic>)</italic> suggests that <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> can be acquired from outside the family.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>We compared the gene content of isolates circulating in three infected families with the genes representative of the genomic diversity of 132 strains isolated from patients suffered from various clinical diseases in Africa, Asia and Europe (41 genes always present and 213 genes variably present in genomes).

However, a limitation of this approach is that point mutations, small deletions, and gene rearrangements may decrease spot intensity values leading to signals that are difficult to interpret. For these reasons, we defined gene profiles of isolates only on unambiguous signals corresponding to presence or absence of CDS.

We found no evidence for exchange of IS between strains of <italic>H. pylori</italic> within families, suggesting that the strains acquired this element prior to the colonization. Most IS tested by the macro-array used are from the putative/hypothetical plasticity zone (PZ1 : HP0428 to HP0460, and PZ2: HP0982 to HP1078) of the genome 26695. All the CDSs from the PZ1 and PZ2 plasticity zones were found in both French families, but CDSs from PZ1 were absent in strains from the Moroccan family A.

Five different strains with very diverse gene contents circulated within this family. Child-4 and child-6 had mixed infections associating the strain S7 from mother with a strain (S8 or S9) also carried by an older sibling: this suggests transmission from the mother and older children to the younger children; or common sources of infection, as previously described <xref rid="pone.0002259-Nwokolo1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002259-Owen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002259-MaggiSolca1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002259-Rothenbacher2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The oldest children were infected by strains different from those carried by their parents. These strains may have been acquired outside the family since these two children grew up far from their parents. Furthermore, after treatment of all members of this family and proved eradication, only one child was re-infected with a fully different strain. This strain isolated one year after was acquired likely outside the family, since none of the others were reinfected.</p><p>Thus, in all three families studied, two routes of acquisition may be raised: intrafamilial transmission (between parents and children or between siblings) and acquisition from outside the family.</p><p>Polymorphism was low among the strains isolated from each of the two French families, and no mixed infection was detected.

They were labelled by random priming with 2 &#181;l of <sup>33</sup>P-dCTP in a reaction mixture (20 &#181;l) containing 11.5 &#181;l of LS buffer (25 volumes of 1 M HEPES, pH 6.6, and 25 volumes of DTM buffer, containing 100 &#181;M of each dATP, dGTP and dTTP, prepared in 250 mM Tris-HCL, pH8, 25 mM MgCl2, 0.36% &#946;-mercapto-ethanol) and 1 &#181;l BSA (10 mg ml<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) and 0.5 &#181;l of Klenow DNA polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotec, Orsay, France). Labelling was performed for 3 h at room temperature. Unincorporated radionucleotides were removed by purification on Quick Spin Sephadex G-25 columns (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France). Immediately before use for hybridization, the sonicated, labeled, and purified chromosomal DNA was heat-denatured and cooled on ice.</p><p>Commercialized membranes from Eurogentec with 590 CDSs of strain 26695 and home-made membranes harboring a subset of genes (213 non-ubiquitous and 41 ubiquitous) in triplicate were used. Both of these membranes carry PCR products that matched entire genes as established for strain 26695. Each nylon membrane was re-hydrated for 15 min in 15 ml 2&#215;SSC buffer (300 mM NaCl, 30 mM trisodium citrate 2H<sub>2</sub>, pH 7), and pre-hybridized for 2 hours at 65&#176;C in 15 ml hybridization buffer (5&#215;SSC, 2% SDS, 1&#215;Denhardt's solution, 0.02% Ficoll type 4 (Sigma, Saint Quentin Fallavier, France), 0.02% polyvinyl-pyrolidone (Sigma), 0.02% BSA and 0.01% salmon sperm). Hybridization was conducted in 5 ml pre-warmed (65&#176;C) hybridization mixes containing the heat-denatured probe with overnight incubation at 65&#176;C under rotary agitation. Membranes were washed once at room temperature in 100 ml 0.5&#215; SSC, 0.1% SDS, the four times (20 min each) at 65&#176;C in 50 ml of the same buffer. Membranes were sealed in polypropylene bags and exposed for 25 hrs to a Phosphoimager screen (Molecular Dynamics).</p><p>Screens were scanned on a Storm 860 machine (Molecular Dynamics). Image analysis and quantification of hybridization intensities for each spot were performed using the Xdots Reader program (COSE) and determined in pixels. A) For the whole genome DNA array membrane (Eurogentec membranes), the average intensity of the empty spots was subtracted from each spot intensity value. This value was then normalized by dividing it by the average of all significant intensity values on each filter. For ratio calculations, a reference array was used, and was built by combining the average normalized data from 10 independent labelling and hybridization experiments with the genomic DNA of <italic>H. pylori</italic> strain 26695 to the Eurogentec. B) For home-made arrays, the intensity of the background surrounding each spot was subtracted from that of each of the spots. Twenty-one homologous hybridizations were performed and were used for normalization. The average intensity of the 41 ubiquitous genes was calculated for each reference array. This number served to allocate a reference array to each heterologous hybridization (average of the ubiquitous spots from the heterologous and the homologous reference hybridizations were not significantly different, Student's t test) and to calculate the ratio used for normalization.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Determination of Gene Content of Isolates and Data analysis</title><p>Following normalization, the data were analyzed by attributing a binary score (presence/absence). To define the cutoff ratio for the presence of a gene, we analyzed the results for the sequenced <italic>H. pylori</italic> J99 DNA hybridized with <italic>H. pylori</italic> 26695. The threshold for the absence of a gene was defined as &lt;0.25. A predictor for presence of genes based on median hybridization ratios and standard deviation of the ubiquitous genes on the 21+16 membranes was established to determine positive cut-off values. A ratio cut-off for all data sets was obtained at a level &gt;0.36. Ratios from 0.26 to 0.35 were considered as indicating an uncertain or uninterpretable signal.</p><p>The final data set consisting of three different values (0&#8202;=&#8202;absent, 1&#8202;=&#8202;uncertain, 2&#8202;=&#8202;present) was incorporated into the PAUP40b4 software program <xref rid="pone.0002259-Swofford1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Phylogenetic trees of the <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> isolates were generated using different assumptions for parsimony analysis, including equal weighting or 10&#8758;1 weighting against acquisition of the pathogenicity islands (to reduce the number of insertion-deletion events for this region). The confidence level at each node was evaluated by bootstrap analysis (1000 bootstraps). Clusters of isolates with bootstrap values up to 90% were used to define limit of strains.</p><p>A list of genes predicted to be different at each node was obtained by parsimony analysis using equal weighted characters and the Branch and Bound algorithm. Description of strains, presented in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">results</xref> section, only includes the presence or absence of gene such that the level of signal was 2 or 0 (uncertain values were not taken into account).</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>The authors have no support or funding to report.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0002259-Ernst1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal">
