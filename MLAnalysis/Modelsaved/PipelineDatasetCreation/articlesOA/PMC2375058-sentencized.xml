</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Helicobacter pylori is the cause of several gastroduodenal diseases, including chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer and gastric carcinoma [1]–[3]. H. pylori strains appear spread by person-to-person contact and humans seem the only identified source of infection [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Prevalence studies suggest that infection is mostly acquired during childhood, and parent-to-child infection, especially involving infected mothers, has been suggested to be the major route of transmission [5], [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>However, evidence for sibling transmission has been also reported and the exact routes of transmission remain elusive [7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Familial transmission of infection has been investigated by molecular typing studies, identifying clones shared by family members [8]–[11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Clonal descent among the H. pylori isolates infecting a family has been documented in one isolate from each biopsy of different members of families by comparing alleles of genes including vacA, flaA and flaB [12] and by sequencing three housekeeping genes (ureI, atpA and ahpC) [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic analysis assessing the history of genes revealed frequent recombination for several genes in H. pylori [14]–[16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Indeed, homologous recombination, highly dependent on sequence similarity, is expected to be frequent within this species [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is important for epidemiological analysis, not only to study the transmission of a small number of genes between isolates from different members of a family, but also to investigate their whole genomic diversity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The genetic diversity and evolutionary dynamics of H. pylori isolates strains can be explored by using macro-arrays to examine strain-specific genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The whole genomes of H. pylori strains J99 (isolated from a white American in Tennessee with ulcer and belonging to the hspWAfrica subpopulation of hpAfrica1 [18] and 26695 (isolated from a patient from United Kingdom with gastritis belonging to the hpEurope population) have been compared revealing regions that have extremely variable gene content that are referred to as “plasticity zones” (PZ)[19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>They are the preferred sites for the insertion of a pathogenicity island cag, cagPAI, which is a large mobile element associated with an enhanced risk for the development of duodenal ulcers and adenocarcinoma of the distal stomach [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Also, several restriction/modification genes (R-M) often associated with insertion or repeat elements differ in terms of GC content from the rest of the genome; these genes may aid the bacteria under particular circumstances during their long-term infection of genetically diverse hosts [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The analysis of the presence or absence of genes at such loci gives an overall indication of diversity and can help to distinguish strains in various clinical contexts [20], [21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>We previously studied intrafamilial spread by analysing polymorphism of two housekeeping genes (hspA and glmM) following the failure of treatment to eradicate infection of a child [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Here, in addition to sequence analysis, we investigated the whole genome composition in H. pylori isolates colonizing the stomachs of infected members of three different families. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Macro-arrays were used to test for 248 non ubiquitous open reading frames (ORFs) and 48 ubiquitous ORFs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Gene profiles were used to reconstruct gene transfer and gene loss events that had occurred in isolates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic analysis based on housekeeping genes sequences and genome composition in non ubiquitous genes provided an overview of the evolutionary dynamics of H. pylori strains infecting each family. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Isolates with slight differences in gene content belonging to a same strain were carried by more than one family member, suggesting that circulation of strains between different hosts makes a significant contribution to the genomic diversity of H. pylori. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, re-infection of a child with a strain, with a genetic profile never observed in the family (before and after treatment) suggests that Helicobacter pylori can be acquired from outside the family. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>The presence of strain S4 in both the father and two children of family L (Fig 2, 7) and of strain S5 only in child-2 suggested at least two different routes of infection for the children in this family: one involving intrafamilial transmission and the other route remains to be discussed (S5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Indeed, with hspA and glmM alleles similar to the sequences of African strains, conversely to S4 colonizing the father and the two other children (Fig 4, 5), S5 seems to be acquired outside of the family. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Five different strains with very diverse gene contents circulated within this family. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Child-4 and child-6 had mixed infections associating the strain S7 from mother with a strain (S8 or S9) also carried by an older sibling: this suggests transmission from the mother and older children to the younger children; or common sources of infection, as previously described [8], [13], [16], [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>The oldest children were infected by strains different from those carried by their parents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>These strains may have been acquired outside the family since these two children grew up far from their parents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, after treatment of all members of this family and proved eradication, only one child was re-infected with a fully different strain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>This strain isolated one year after was acquired likely outside the family, since none of the others were reinfected. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Thus, in all three families studied, two routes of acquisition may be raised: intrafamilial transmission (between parents and children or between siblings) and acquisition from outside the family. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Polymorphism was low among the strains isolated from each of the two French families, and no mixed infection was detected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the multi-colonization of members of the Moroccan family is in agreement with data reporting that multi-colonization is more frequent in countries in which H. pylori infection is highly prevalent [24]–[26], [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>The relapse of the child-3 in family A shows that re-infection from a source independent of the family, a likely event in high prevalence developing countries [38], is also possible in developed countries. </plain></SENT>
