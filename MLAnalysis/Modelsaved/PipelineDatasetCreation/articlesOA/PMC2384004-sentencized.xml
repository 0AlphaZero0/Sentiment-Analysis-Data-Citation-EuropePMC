</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Rickettsia felis (R. felis) was first detected in 1990 in American Ctenocephalides felis fleas using electron microscopy, and named the ELB agent after the Elward laboratory (Soquel, CA) where the flea colony was raised [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>It was later detected by PCR in humans with a murine typhus-like illness [2]–[6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, despite a first phylogenetic study clearly showing its classification within the spotted fever group (SFG) [7], confusion was brought by further reports, which attributed to the ELB agent, renamed R. felis, several characteristics of R. typhi [8]–[11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>It was later demonstrated that these data, including the protein profile [11], antigenic properties, growth conditions [8], [9], and antibiotic susceptibility [10], resulted from the contamination of a R. felis culture with R. typhi [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>As a matter of fact, fleas can be infected by both R. typhi and R. felis [13], which may thus have been the source of contamination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In 2001, R. felis was cultivated from cat fleas at low temperature (28°C), and was established for the first time [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>It was then deposited as strain URRWXCal2 T in two official collections: the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC VR-1525), and the Collection de Souches de l'Unité des Rickettsies (CSUR R121). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, another two teams were able to successfully grow R. felis, also at temperatures ≤32°C [14], [15] and not at 35–37°C as initially reported [9], [10], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Phenotypic characterization of strain URRWXCal2 T demonstrated that its antibiotic susceptibility [16] and antigenic properties [17] classified it within the SFG. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In 2005, we sequenced the genome of R. felis strain URRWXCal2 T [18] and demonstrated, using bioinformatics, pulsed field gel electrophoresis and southern blot, that this strain had two forms of the same plasmid, i. e., a large, (pRF, 62-kb), and a small (pRFδ, 39-kb) forms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The pRF and PRFδ plasmids had identical sequences with the exception of an additional 24 ORFs in pRF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Then, we confirmed these results by PCR assays specifically targeting each plasmid [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The two plasmids were also detected in a collection of Ctenocephalides felis fleas from various locations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>However, in a recent bioinformatic analysis of the R. felis genome sequence, Gillespie et al. questioned our results and proposed that the pRFδ plasmid was an artefact from genome assembly [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>These authors based in part their conclusion on the results from Pornwiroon et al. who failed to detect the pRFδ plasmid in R. felis strain LSU [14], a strain cultivated in C. felis fleas at Louisiana State University [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In addition, on the basis of the analysis of a few genes, they proposed the classification of R. felis in a fourth phylogenetic lineage within the Rickettsia genus [19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>As our previous work had been carefully performed and experimentally confirmed, we believe that the conclusions of Gillespie et al. were not appropriate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we asked five independent laboratories worldwide to check the presence of two plasmids in R. felis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated the presence of both plasmids in various specimens and in cloned R. felis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Finally, we conducted a phylogenetic study based on 667 concatenated Rickettsia core protein-encoding genes, and tested new specimens. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Using all four primer pairs, we obtained PCR products of the expected sizes from R. felis cultivated from the initial isolate [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Non-template controls were negative. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The sequence obtained from the pRFa-pRFd amplicon was identical to GenBank accession number NC_007111, whereas pRFa-pRFb and pRFc-pRFd amplicons were identical to accession number NC_007110. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Thus, we could reproduce our previously reported result and confirmed the presence of the two plasmids in R. felis strain URRWXCal2 T. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>However, in order to obtain indisputable results, we proposed five independent laboratories worldwide to perform these PCR assays. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>To avoid any interpretation bias, we provided these laboratories with anonymized kits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>All five laboratories obtained similar PCR results (Figure 1a, Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>A PCR product of the expected size was obtained for all 4 assays from DNA specimen 1, whereas for DNA specimens 2 and 3, only the AF-AR PCR provided a positive amplification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Negative controls were negative for all assays. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Each of the five laboratories obtained a B-E PCR nucleotide sequence for R. felis identical to GenBank accession number NC_007111. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers EU155007, EU056172, EU022170, EU040362, and EU017504 for laboratories L1 to L5, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Further, when attempting to clone R. felis cells with a 40 cell culture passage history at various temperatures using the plaque assay, we obtained lysis plaques at 30°C but no culture at 37°C (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Of 20 clones grown from single R. felis cells and individually collected, we obtained PCR products of the expected sizes for the two plasmid forms in 15 clones (75 %) but only the large plasmid form in the remaining five clones. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>In addition, only the small plasmid form was detected from the positive control DNA extracted from R. felis with a 50 cell culture passage history. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrated that the plasmid content of R. felis may vary according to culture history, with a small plasmid form being unstable. R. felis may exhibit from two (R. felis grown from initial frozen culture) to one plasmid form (R. felis with a 50 cell culture passages). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Such a phenomenon was recently reported by Baldridge et al. who demonstrated that R. peacockii lost its plasmids during serial passage in cell culture [21]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>In our previous study, we were surprised to find two plasmid forms in R. felis, but found them both by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (Figure 3), southern blot, and genome assembly [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we verified biologically that the small plasmid form can specifically be amplified by PCR, showing that the 2 plasmid forms exist both in cell culture and in the wild by amplification of R. felis DNA from C. felis fleas [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the results that we and five independent laboratories obtained in the present study unambiguously confirm that our previous data did not result from a bioinformatic error and that two plasmid forms may co-exist in R. felis (Figure 1b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Moreover, by demonstrating in gels that the two plasmid forms were present in almost equal quantity in culture, we speculated that both forms may be present in a single R. felis cell (Figure 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>To explore this hypothesis, we cloned single R. felis cells and demonstrated that the small plasmid form lacked in 25 % of individual cells of this species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Baldridge et al. recently reported the detection of plasmids in five Rickettsia species, including two, i.e., R. peacockii and R. amblyommii which had two plasmids [21]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Using sequences from 15 chromosome-encoded proteins or from 21 conserved hypothetical proteins, Gillespie et al. proposed the creation of a fourth phylogenetic cluster within the Rickettsia genus, the “transitional group”, that contained R. felis [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>However, the data produced by these authors do not provide any evidence that R. felis belongs to “a lineage distinct from other previously established taxonomic categories for rickettsiae”. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>As stated by the authors, their phylogenetic study is similar to other recently published rickettsial trees, which showed no evidence or need for the creation of a fourth lineage [23], [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>This result even contradicts a previous article by the same team where R. felis was clearly associated with the SFG [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Initial speculations on an intermediate status of R. felis, with phenotypic properties similar to R. typhi but a genetic clustering with spotted fever group rickettsiae, resulted from studies that have not been reproduced [1], [8]–[11], [25], [26]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>By omitting some data, one may build a simplified model of host-vector-rickettsia co-speciation, with R. prowazekii being associated with lice, R. felis with fleas and R. rickettsii with ticks, and subsequently determine which species is pathogenic or not. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>However, over the past 15 years, new data have contradicted this vision of rickettsiae [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>As examples, R. parkeri, considered as non pathogenic for 65 years, was recently demonstrated to be a human pathogen [34]; R. canadensis is suspected epidemiologically and serologically to cause disease [35]; R. bellii has been shown to cause escharotic lesions when injected in guinea pigs [23] and may thus be pathogenic in humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Finally, Coxiella burnetii (as R. diasporica), R. africae (as ESF agent), and Legionella pneumophila (as Tatlock agent) [36] were considered to be non-pathogenic rickettsiae in the past, before being recognized as human pathogens [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Recent findings demonstrated that the vector range of rickettsiae is not fully established [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>For examples, R. prowazekii (a typical louse borne disease) was found in ticks in Africa and Mexico [37], [38] and was reported in lice and acarids from flying squirrels in the USA [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Similarly, R. conorii was reported to infect mites and lice [40], [41], and R. bellii was found in insects (unpublished data), although both species were believed to be strictly associated with ticks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a simplification of the relationship between ecological niche, pathogenicity and phylotype is not possible, and these findings forced rickettsiologists to define more carefully rickettsiae as either pathogenic or of unknown pathogenicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Moreover, by deliberately omitting SFG rickettsiae of unknown pathogenicity (such as the SFG species R. montanensis) the authors proposed in their Figure 1 a biased representation of what is currently known about rickettsial pathogenicity [19]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>We were surprised that the only hypothesis produced by Gillespie et al. [19] to explain the discordance between our results, showing the presence of two plasmids in R. felis [18], and those of Pornwiroon et al. who could detect only one plasmid [14], was that the small plasmid form of R. felis was an artefact of our genome assembly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>It is clear in other bacterial genera that the plasmid content may vary from one strain to another and that plasmids may not be stably maintained in culture [42], [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>In our previous work, we had shown the presence of the two plasmid forms [18], and demonstrated in the present article that R. felis may have one, two or no plasmid, depending on the strain or the culture passage history. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>This plasmidic instability, which we also identified in R. africae (unpublished data), was also described recently in R. peacockii [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon poses the problem of the significance of the genomic sequences of rickettsiae passaged many times in cell culture prior to sequencing, such as R. prowazekii or R. conorii. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Regarding the phylogenetic position of R. felis, the choice of genes for infering phylogenies should be extremely careful. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>For example, Woese clearly demonstrated discrepancies between the phylogenies obtained using the ribosomal operon and amino-acyl –tRNA synthetases [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>This is mainly due to the fact that bacteria have a core set of conserved and inherited genes, which may be used to establish phylogenies reflecting their true evolution, and a set of genes acquired by lateral gene transfer or recombination, which may provide biased phylogenies [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>By selecting a set of specific genes, Gillespie et al. [19] proposed the creation of a specific phylogenetic position for R. felis, between SFG and TG rickettsiae, contradicting biological data and their own work [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>Moreover, R. felis may be subject to gene recombination with R. typhi as these two rickettsiae can meet in the same host flea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>However, the current position of R. felis and its clustering with R. australis and R. akari is exactly the same as that defined in as early as 1999 [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Herein, we performed a unique phylogenetic study of Rickettsia species based on the concatenation of their core gene set and demonstrated unambiguously that R. felis belongs to the spotted fever group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Finally, classification of rickettsiae based on current knowledge of host specificity is not reliable. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrated for the first time using a cloning method in Vero cells that R. felis does not grow at 37°C. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>This result confirms the fact that authors who initially reported a culture of this species at 37°C [8]–[11] did not grow the current strain of R. felis [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Their data may have resulted from a contamination with R. typhi, which they later acknowledged [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>This also explains why phenotypic traits initially described for R. felis were similar to those of R. typhi [8]–[11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>We believe that it was important to clarify the status of R. felis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>We clearly demonstrated that R. felis is a SFG rickettsia, that it does not grow at 37°C and that it has, without any possible doubt, two plasmids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Finally, we think that it would have been fair, since our R. felis strain is available, to check the presence of plasmids prior concluding that our data resulted from an error. </plain></SENT>
