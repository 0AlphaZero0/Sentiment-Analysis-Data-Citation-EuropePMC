<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In mammalian cells, there are at least two enzymatically distinct pathways for the repair of DSBs, homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>HR uses a homologous template (most frequently the sister chromatid) to carry out DSB repair, whereas NHEJ joins two ends without the requirement for extensive homology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Proteins known to be involved in NHEJ include DNA-PKCS (the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase), Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer, XRCC4 (X-ray Cross Complementing factor 4), and DNA ligase IV (2,3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, DNA ends can also be joined via microhomologous sequences flanking the break point, especially when proteins responsible for NHEJ, such as Ku, are absent or limiting in mammalian cells (4–13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Microhomology-mediated end joining (MHEJ) is always accompanied by a deletion that spans one of the two homologous sequences and the intervening sequence, if any, and thus is a mutagenic repair pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Indeed, microhomologies were observed at deletion break points in the HPRT gene in primary human fibroblasts (14) and in the Aprt gene in hamster cells (15). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, translocations mediated by MHEJ were frequently detected in pre-B cell lymphomas in mouse models (16). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the factors involved in MHEJ, but it can be assumed that the MHEJ pathway may consist of a series of steps, culminating in the sealing of DNA nicks by the action of a DNA ligase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>DNA ligases catalyze the joining of nicked DNA in DNA replication, recombination and repair (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Eukaryotic cells encode three well-characterized ATP-dependent DNA ligases, DNA ligases I, III and IV, each specializing in distinct pathways of DNA repair and replication (18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Although these DNA ligases vary in sequence and size, sequence and structural analyses have shown that they contain a common catalytic core (18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>While the central core of the enzyme carries out the catalytic function of sealing nicked DNA, other domains may determine the specificity of the various ligases in different DNA metabolic reactions, e.g. by targeting ligases to different parts of the nucleus or by mediating interactions with different proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>DNA ligase I is involved in at least two distinct processes within the nucleus: the joining of Okazaki fragments during DNA replication, and the ligation of a newly synthesized patch during base excision repair (BER) (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>DNA ligase I is recruited to sites of DNA replication by its interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (19,20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that the loss of its PCNA binding activity severely compromised the ability of DNA ligase I to join Okazaki fragments, and to participate in long-patch BER (21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Two isoforms of DNA ligase III resulting from alternately spliced mRNA variants have been characterized (22). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Ligase IIIα is ubiquitously distributed, whereas ligase IIIβ has been detected only in testes, where it is believed to play a role in recombination during meiotic prophase (22). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>DNA ligase IIIα interacts with XRCC1 (X-ray Cross Complementing factor 1) via its carboxy-terminal BRCT (BRCA C-terminal) domains and functions in BER (23). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>DNA ligase IV is distinct from other DNA ligases in that it possesses two tandem C-terminal BRCT domains (18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>This protein forms a complex with XRCC4, which appears to stabilize (24) and stimulate the overall activity of ligase IV (25). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>This complex further interacts with DNA-PKCS and the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer to function in NHEJ (26). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Though many studies have revealed the role of DNA ligases in DNA repair pathways, such as NHEJ and BER, a systematic study of these ligases in the MHEJ pathway has been lacking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>We recently developed a cell-free assay, with which factors modulating two end-joining pathways, i.e. Ku-dependent NHEJ and MHEJ, can be evaluated (9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that Ku and histone H1 facilitate error-free NHEJ and inhibit MHEJ, and that FEN-1 is involved in MHEJ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have determined the roles of DNA ligases I, III and IV in these end-joining pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>We found that while DNA ligase IV is required to join DNA ends in the Ku-dependent NHEJ pathway, DNA ligase I and ligase III are required in MHEJ. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that PCNA coordinates the involvement of DNA ligase I and other factors, such as FEN-1, in MHEJ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Indeed, it has been reported that FEN-1 is required for the MHEJ pathway (9,35). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>It is possible that FEN-1 is responsible for the removal of single-stranded flaps formed from broken DNA ends during MHEJ, and then ligase I seals the remaining nick. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>All these processes are probably mediated by the protein–protein interaction of FEN-1 and ligase I with PCNA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>Besides its critical role in the repair of damaged bases and SSBs (32), evidence from several studies suggests that DNA ligase III is also involved in DSB repair through an alternative route of DSB repair that complement the DNA-PK/XRCC4/ligase IV-dependent NHEJ (35–37). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>In line with these findings, we have shown that DNA ligase III is required for MHEJ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>While ligase III exists in a tight complex with XRCC1 (23) in BER to repair DNA base damage and DNA SSBs (38,39), it was also reported that the Ku-independent end-joining, which may be mediated by microhomology sequences, required the synapsis activity of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) and the ligation activity of the XRCC1-DNA ligase III complex (36), implying that ligase III may also work together with other factors in MHEJ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>However, amongst DNA ligases, ligase III is unique in having a zinc-finger motif at the N-terminus (40), enabling its recruitment to DNA strand breaks (41). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Taylor et al. (42) reported that the zinc-finger motif confers upon ligase III the ability to bind DNA duplexes and stimulates intermolecular end joining between DNA duplexes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the possibility that ligase III functions alone in DNA end joining can not be excluded. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Like DNA ligase III that forms a complex with XRCC1, DNA ligase IV is tightly associated with XRCC4, upon which it depends for stability and activity (24,25,43). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, ligase IV–XRCC4 complex functions in coupling with Ku heterodimers and DNA PKCS in NHEJ, but not in other DNA repair pathways (44). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>In line with this notion, we here demonstrated that DNA ligase IV facilitated Ku-dependent end joining (Figure 6), but was not required for MHEJ (Figures 6 and 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, when ligase IV was absent, the activity of MHEJ in the nuclear extract was increased, suggesting that DNA ligase IV may negatively regulate the MHEJ pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>It is not clear how ligase IV inhibits MHEJ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>One possibility is that the Ku-ligase IV–XRCC4-dependent NHEJ pathway, which is initiated by binding of Ku proteins to DNA ends, may compete with the MHEJ pathway for binding to and processing DNA ends (9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Once the DNA ends are ligated by DNA ligase IV/XRCC4 complex, Ku proteins presumably become dissociated from DNA, and bind to other DNA ends to start another round of NHEJ reaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Lack of DNA ligase IV would lead to an incomplete NHEJ reaction in which Ku proteins cannot be released from DNA ends. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Due to lack of competition caused by a shortage of recycled Ku proteins, DNA ends would have a greater chance to be exposed to nuclease attack and to be joined by the alternative MHEJ pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>In addition, there is growing evidence showing that DNA ligase IV may coordinate DNA processing activities that are critical for both NHEJ and MHEJ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>For instance, Ma et al. (45) showed that there are conserved physical and functional interactions between DNA polymerase (pol) X family members (pol μ and pol λ) and DNA ligase IV that coordinate gap-filling DNA synthesis and DNA ligation in NHEJ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>Notably, in yeast, DNA ligase IV physically and functionally interacts with Rad27 (FEN-1 in mammalian cells) to process and join DNA molecules (46). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>Therefore, while ligase IV, by interacting with other DNA processing proteins, may facilitate the Ku-dependent NHEJ pathway, it may inhibit MHEJ as a consequence of the competition for components common to both pathways. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Overall, our work showed that human DNA ligase I and ligase III, which are involved in long patch BER and short patch BER, respectively, to repair DNA base damage and SSBs, are also critical for the repair of DSBs by MHEJ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>It should also be noted that the requirement of ligase I and III seems to vary depending on the length of microhomology sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>While a reduction in ligase III affects MHEJ using both short and long microhomology, a reduction in ligase I had only slightly affected MHEJ using 2-bp repeats, though it greatly decreased the MHEJ using 10-bp repeats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Since the 2- and 3-bp substrates are much more likely to occur in vivo, ligase III is probably the primary ligase contributing to MHEJ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>This notion is in accordance with previously published observations (35–37). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our observations also suggest that DNA ligase I and ligase III may function in MHEJ through two independent pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>In keeping up with this notion, protein partners of DNA ligases I and III, which are required for their stability, DNA-binding recruitment and catalytic activity, have never been shown to overlap. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>Although little is known about whether or not other factors may be involved in MHEJ, further studies of factors involved in the repair of DNA base damage and SSBs by using our end-joining assay may shed more light on the mechanisms of DNA DSB repair. </plain></SENT>
