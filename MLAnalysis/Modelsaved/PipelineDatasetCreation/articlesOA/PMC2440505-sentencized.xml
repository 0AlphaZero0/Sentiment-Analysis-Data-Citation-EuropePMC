</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological data suggest that maternal infection during pregnancy increases the risk of neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and autism in the offspring [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>These public health studies are supported by experimental data in rodents showing that maternal inflammation during fetal development impairs the behavior and social interactions of the adult offspring [3]–[5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms that link a transient prenatal inflammation with delayed impairment of neuronal functions have begun to be investigated at the cellular and molecular levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The symptoms detected in the offspring after injection of inflammatory or infectious agents into pregnant dams are due to the inflammatory response itself, rather than to chemicals, bacteria, or viruses [1], [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Recently, in a model mimicking a maternal viral infection, the behavioral alterations in the progeny were prevented by systemic injection of blocking antibodies against interleukin-6 [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>This reinforces the hypothesis that the deleterious effects arise from the reaction of the immune system, rather that from the inflammatory agent itself. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Moreover, several groups have found modifications of protein and mRNA levels of various cytokines and neurotrophic factors in the offspring [4]–[7], suggesting that the immune system of the embryos also contributes to inflammation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The role of microglia in this process has been little addressed [8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Some cellular bases for impaired brain functions in adult offspring following a prenatal infection have been proposed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>For instance, neurogenesis and apoptosis are altered in the adult offspring [4], and morphological damages have been reported [9], [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>However, whereas it is now accepted that synaptic dysfunctions are responsible for the cognitive impairments observed in psychiatric disorders or neurodegenerative diseases [11], the structure and function of synapses following embryonic inflammation have not yet been investigated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>We previously reported a link between immune system impairment and synaptic dysfunction, after having found an enhanced synaptic plasticity and an altered composition of synaptic AMPA receptors in mice mutated on a microglial gene [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>These mice, DAP12KI (previously referred to as KΔ75 mice [13]) carry a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding DAP12, a 12 kD transmembrane signaling adaptor for a family of innate immunoreceptors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In the immune system, DAP12 regulates the activation of peritoneal or bone-marrow-derived macrophages [14]–[16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>In the brain, DAP12 is transiently expressed by developing microglia [12], and its expression can be reinduced in adult upon pathological conditions [17]–[19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In culture, DAP12 also controls the phagocytic activity of microglia and the inflammatory response following neuronal death [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In humans, DAP12 mutations induce Nasu-Hakola disease (OMIM 221770), characterized by early dementia without any apparent neuronal damage [21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Microglia are the instrumental cells of brain inflammation, therefore we investigated here the relationship between prenatal activation of microglia and alteration of synaptic function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>We first demonstrated that the ratio between AMPA and NMDA receptor (AMPAR, NMDAR) currents is increased in adult DAP12KI mice, as compared to wild-type (WT). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Then, by analyzing pure neuronal cultures from DAP12KI P0 pups, we investigated the impact of the prenatal period in inducing late synaptic defects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Finally, as we observed that DAP12KI animals displayed a transient microglial activation at birth, we compared their synaptic phenotype with the one of WT animals having experienced a pharmacologically-induced inflammation during their fetal development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>We conclude from both genetical and pharmacological models that prenatal activation of microglia has a delayed impact on synaptic function. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that in the synapses of the Schaffer collaterals onto CA1 pyramidal neurons of DAP12KI mice, the NMDA receptors (NMDARs) were more sensitive to the NR2B-specific antagonist ifenprodil, and the AMPARs were more permeable to calcium, as compared with WT mice [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Noteworthy, in synapses formed by dentate gyrus granule cells onto interneurons, it has been shown that Ca2+-permeable AMPARs and high content of NR2B in NMDAR result in an enhanced contribution of AMPAR to the glutamatergic response, with high ratio of AMPAR- versus NMDAR-evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSC) [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Thus, in order to further understand the consequence of DAP12 mutation on synaptic function, we have now addressed the relative contribution of AMPAR vs. NMDAR EPSCs in the Schaffer collateral synapses formed onto CA1 pyramidal neurons in DAP12KI mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>In WT mice, the ratio of AMPAR- over NMDAR-mediated currents was 0.23±0.05 (n = 9), while in DAP12KI mice, this ratio was enhanced ∼2-fold (Fig 1A; DAP12KI: 0.45±0.08; n = 10; p&lt;0.03). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Thus, the relative contribution of AMPAR vs. NMDAR to glutamatergic currents is increased in the hippocampus of mutant mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>With electron microscopy analysis, we found that the synaptic density was unchanged in the hippocampus of DAP12KI mice (supplementary data, Fig S1B), but the density of perforated synapses was significantly increased in the stratum radiatum of their CA1 area (supplementary data, Fig S1CD). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the enhanced AMPAR/NMDAR ratio in DAP12KI hippocampus, since perforated synapses are more enriched in AMPARs than in NMDARs [23]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The above-described results raise a temporal paradox. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>DAP12 mutation impacts glutamatergic transmission in the adult, but we previously demonstrated that it ceases to be expressed in the hippocampus at this age [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>To solve this paradox, we examined more precisely the expression pattern of DAP12 in developing hippocampus of WT mice (Fig 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>At E17, microglia were sparse and mostly ameboid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>A majority displayed DAP12 immunoreactivity, albeit at low level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>At P0, the density of microglia increased, and most displayed a bright immunostaining for DAP12. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Between P0 and P3, the microglia became ramified and the fraction of DAP12-expressing microglia decreased. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>At P7, microglia were mostly ramified, and few DAP12-positive microglia were detected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Given that DAP12 is mainly expressed before P3 and that glutamatergic synapses are generated post-natally [24], we hypothesized that microglial dysfunction induced by DAP12 mutation has impacted the prenatal development of neurons with delayed consequences on synaptic function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we cultured neurons from DAP12KI and WT littermate P0 pups in the presence of AraC, so as to eliminate microglia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Neurons were grown for at least two weeks in culture to allow maturation of glutamatergic synapses [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>At that point, neuronal cultures were more than 99% pure (supplementary data, Fig S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Fluorometric calcium imaging was used to monitor neuronal activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Since spontaneous activity was moderate in hippocampal cultures, all recordings were performed in the presence of the potassium channel blocker 4AP (50 µM) to increase the global network activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Under these conditions, neurons cultured from WT and DAP12KI P0 displayed similar activity (coefficient of variation of calcium fluctuation in DAP12KI cultures: 115±4% of WT; Fig 2A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Yet, in the presence of 6-cyano-7 nitroquinoxline-2 (CNQX), an AMPAR antagonist, neuronal activity was significantly lower in neurons cultured from mutant as compared with WT littermates (coefficient of variation of calcium fluctuations in DAP12KI cultures: 66±2% of WT; n&gt;600; p&lt;0,0001; Fig 2B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with the enhanced AMPAR/NMDAR currents ratio observed in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>They indicate that the contribution of AMPARs to neuronal activity is increased in DAP12KI neurons cultured in the absence of microglia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>This increased contribution of AMPAR may possibly reflect an increased proportion of excitatory synapses containing AMPA receptors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>To test this, glutamatergic synapses and AMPAR were identified by vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGlut1) and by GluR1 immunoreactivities, respectively (Fig 2C). Figure 2D shows that the proportion of excitatory synapses colocalized with GluR1-positive puncta was significantly increased in cultures from mutant pups as compared with WT pups (n&gt;160; p&lt;0.0001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, neurons from DAP12KI P0 pups cultured in the absence of microglia exhibit an enhanced relative contribution of AMPAR to excitatory transmission, which is compatible with the synaptic phenotype observed in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>This demonstrates that microglial alteration due to DAP12 loss-of-function impacts neurons before birth, with delayed effects on synaptic function. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>In this work, we show that prenatal activation of microglia, when both genetically and pharmacologically induced, has a delayed impact on glutamatergic synaptic function in adult. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that mutation of the microglial gene DAP12 induced an enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP) and modifications of glutamate receptors at synapses formed onto CA1 pyramidal cells [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>In particular, we showed that these synapses displayed a somehow immature phenotype, in which the NMDARs were more sensitive to the NR2B-specific antagonist ifenprodil, and the AMPARs more permeable to calcium as compared with WT mice [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>We have now observed that in DAP12KI mice, these synapses also display a higher ratio of AMPAR versus NMDAR EPSC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Such a correlation between AMPAR/NMDAR composition and properties and AMPAR/NMDAR currents ratio has been reported in another kind of synapses [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>In DAP12KI mice, the increased AMPAR to NMDAR currents ratio may also synergistically result from the increased density of perforated synapses that we measured, since these synapses are especially enriched with AMPARs [23], [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>This increased density was restricted to the medial segment of the apical dendrites of CA1 neurons and may contribute to the EPSCs that we monitored [33], [34]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>We previously proposed that the enhanced LTP in DAP12KI mice may be due to a larger fraction of silent, AMPAR-less, synapses in mutant mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Such hypothesis was based on biochemical analysis of post-synaptic densities (PSD) that showed a decreased content of AMPAR in DAP12KI mice brain as compared with WT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>We did not observe this decrease in our present analysis of hippocampal cultures and hippocampal synapses morphology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>This apparent discrepancy probably results from the fact that in order to get an adequate amount of material, the prior PSD analysis had been performed on whole cortex extracts, and this may have occluded subtle modifications of synaptic AMPARs restricted to the more specific regions under investigation in our current study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Moreover, recent reports in the literature have demonstrated that switching synaptic NR2B-containing NMDARs with those containing NR2A, dramatically reduces LTP [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Indeed, in DAP12KI hippocampus, NMDAR were sensitive to the NR2B-specific antagonist ifenprodil [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Thus, the enhanced LTP previously observed in DAP12KI hippocampus may be the consequence of the modifications of NMDARs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>In order to get an insight into the mechanism linking DAP12 loss-of-function and neuronal phenotype, we characterized the microglial alterations induced by the mutation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>We showed that DAP12KI microglia cultured from P0 pups express higher levels of inflammatory markers such as NOS-2, IL1β, and IL6, as compared with their WT counterparts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>The inflammatory status of DAP12KI was further confirmed by the detection of a transient microgliosis in new-born, but not in adult mice brains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>It has recently been demonstrated that in peripheral macrophages, DAP12 signaling is activator or inhibitor depending on the inflammatory context [14], [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that upon a strong inflammatory stimulus such as a high level of LPS, DAP12 participates in activatory pathways, whereas at a low level of LPS, DAP12 may preferentially recruit inhibitory mediators [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that in the developing brain, DAP12 is a down-regulator of microglial activation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Neurons cultured from DAP12KI or inflamed P0 pups that were grown in a microglia-free and non-inflammatory environment display altered synaptic function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>This demonstrates that prenatal inflammation suffices to alter synaptic function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>However, this does not exclude the possibility that prenatal inflammation also has long-lasting effects on tissue and secondarily impacts neuronal or synaptic dysfunction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>For instance, adult mice born to inflamed mother can display histological alterations [9], [10] or impaired neurogenesis [4], which may result in disturbance of neurotransmission. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Similarly, old DAP12-deficient mice display hypomyelinosis in thalamus [36], [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Such deficiencies demonstrate persistent changes that we have not addressed in the present study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Together with white matter alteration, a synaptic degeneration has been described in the thalamus of DAP12-deficient mice, based on abnormal vesicles accumulations observed by electron microscopy [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>We did not detect morphological alterations of synapses in the hippocampus of DAP12KI by electron microscopy (supplementary data, Fig S1 A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Such a difference between the two studies may be due to differences in age, in the genetic background of the mice, or in the brain regions studied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, the difference may arise from the fact that the vesicle accumulations, described as being a sign of synaptic degeneration [36], were not located in synapses as defined by the apposition of vesicles, presynaptic dense projections, synaptic cleft, and post-synaptic density [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Rather, these accumulations may correspond to features that have been already described and are unrelated to synaptic dysfunction [38]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Prenatal inflammation is known to differentially impact adult neuronal functions, depending on the inflammation-inducing protocol [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>In our study, we found that neurons cultured from maternally-inflamed pups display enhanced basal neuronal activity as compared with control. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>In contrast, basal activity was identical in neurons from DAP12KI and WT pups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>This shows that the genetical and pharmacological inductions of prenatal microglial activation induce similar but not identical synaptic phenotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Such a difference may be due to TNFα, whose mRNA is not upregulated in DAP12KI microglia, but which is a hallmark of inflammation [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>We have now shown that activation of microglia impacts neurons prenatally, with a delayed effect on their synaptic function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Deferred alteration of synaptic function depending on prenatal development has already been observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>For example, synaptic activity can be recorded on neurons from E18 rat hippocampus cultured for two weeks, whereas it is barely detected when neurons are cultured from E16 embryos [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>This indicates that prenatal differentiation of neurons is crucial for the later development of synaptic function. </plain></SENT>
