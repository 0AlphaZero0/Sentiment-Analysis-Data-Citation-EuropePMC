<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Demosponges, the largest class in the phylum Porifera, underwent only the first of these transitions and their mitochondrial genomes display a peculiar combination of ancestral and animal-specific features. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To get an insight into the evolution of mitochondrial genomes within the Demospongiae, we determined 17 new mtDNA sequences from this group and analyzing them with five previously published sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our analysis revealed that all demosponge mtDNAs are 16- to 25-kbp circular molecules, containing 13–15 protein genes, 2 rRNA genes, and 2–27 tRNA genes. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Large variation in mtDNA organization was also observed within the G0 group (order Homosclerophorida) including gene rearrangements, loss of tRNA genes, and the presence of two introns in Plakortis angulospiculatus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>While introns are rare in modern-day demosponge mtDNA, we inferred that at least one intron was present in cox1 of the common ancestor of all demosponges. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Two major evolutionary events occurred early in animal history and shaped the majority of animals, as we know them today: the origin of multicellularity and the origin of bilateral symmetry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The phylogenetic boundaries of these events are well defined among extant taxa and correspond to the traditional groups Metazoa (multicellular animals) and Bilateria (all animal phyla except Porifera, Placozoa, Cnidaria, and Ctenophora). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Multiple genomic changes must have occurred in association with these morphological transitions, and current genome sequencing projects give us the first glimpses into these changes [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the transitions to multicellular and bilaterally symmetrical animals also correlate with multiple changes in mitochondrial genome architecture [3], although the main function of mitochondria themselves remained unchanged. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In particular, the origin of animal multicellularity is associated with the loss of all ribosomal protein genes from mtDNA, the disappearance of most introns, and a large reduction in the amount of non-coding DNA [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The origin of bilaterality correlates with further compaction of mtDNA, multiple changes in the genetic code and the associated losses of some tRNA genes, along with the appearance of several genetic novelties [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Obviously, the picture presented above is an extrapolation of our knowledge of extant organisms into the ancient past and as such can be affected by artifacts of ancestral state reconstruction [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>It is also based on a relatively limited sampling of mitochondrial genomes, especially from non-bilaterian animals, and additional data from Cnidaria, Ctenophora, Porifera, as well as the closely related lineages of eukaryotes (e.g., Choanozoa) are essential to support, expand, or refute it. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Class Demospongiae [6] is the largest (&gt;85% of species) and most morphologically diverse group in the phylum Porifera. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>It contains sponges of various shapes and sizes that occupy both freshwater and marine environments from shallow to abysmal depths and includes such oddities as carnivorous sponges [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Within the extant Demospongiae 14 orders are recognized that encompass 88 families, 500 genera and more than 8000 described species [8], [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Although traditionally three subclasses have been distinguished, two of them do not appear to be monophyletic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Instead, recent molecular studies [10], [11] provide strong support for five major clades within the Demospongiae: Homoscleromorpha (G0) (Homosclerophorida), Keratosa (G1) (Dictyoceratida+Dendroceratida), Myxospongiae (G2) (Chondrosida, Halisarcida, and Verongida), Marine Haplosclerida (G3), and all the remaining groups (G4) (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Our knowledge of mtDNA diversity within the demosponges has been rudimentary, with only five sequences representing 3 of the 5 major groups available [12]–[15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Previous studies revealed that demosponge mtDNA resembles that of most other animals in its compact organization, lack of introns, and well-conserved gene order, but at the same time contains extra genes, including atp9, trnI(cau), trnR(ucu), encodes bacterial-like ribosomal and transfer RNAs, and uses a minimally derived genetic code in protein synthesis [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, additional unusual features found in the mitochondrial genomes of Oscarella carmela [14] and Amphimedon queenslandica [15] suggested that more mitochondrial genomic diversity might exist among the demosponges. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Here we describe complete mitochondrial sequences from 17 species of demosponges and analyze them with five previously published mitochondrial genomes from this group that were available at the time this study was conducted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our sampling covers all recognized order-level diversity within the Demospongiae and provides the first analysis of general evolutionary trends in mitochondrial genome organization for this group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Such a comprehensive approach to the analysis of demosponge mtDNA is needed because, at least in the fossil record, the evolution of demosponges closely mirrors the evolution of all bilaterian animals with the first demosponge fossils appearing in Precambrian deposits and a major radiation occurring in the Lower Cambrian [16], [17]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Our analysis of 22 complete mtDNA sequences representing all 14 orders of demosponges revealed both remarkable conservation and also an extensive diversity in mitochondrial genome organization within this group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Among the features shared among all sampled demosponge mitochondrial genomes are compact organization of the genetic material, similar gene content, well conserved structures of encoded tRNAs, a minimally modified genetic code for mitochondrial translation, and the absence of a single large “control” region characteristic of mtDNA in bilaterian animals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Genomic features that showed substantial variation include the number of tRNA genes, rRNA structures, the presence/absence of introns, and gene arrangements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>In particular, two groups clearly stand out in our analysis with respect to their genome organization: G0 (order Homosclerophorida) and G1 (orders Dictyoceratida, Dendroceratida, and Verticillitida). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>As reported previously, the mitochondrial genome of the homosclerophorid Oscarella carmela contains 44 genes–the largest complement of genes in animal mtDNA–including tatC, a gene for subunit C of the twin arginine translocase that has not been found in any other animal mtDNA, and genes for 27 tRNAs [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the mtDNA sequence of the homosclerophorid Plakortis angulospiculatus determined for this study contains only 20 genes and lacks tatC as well as 19 of the 25 tRNA genes typical for demosponges. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Other differences between these two genomes include distinct gene arrangements (only 4 shared gene boundaries) and the presence of two group I introns in P. angulospiculatus cox1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the estimated genetic distances between these two species are greater than those between many orders of demosponges, indicating an ancient radiation and the presence of extensive genetic diversity within this group. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Mitochondrial genomes of the three species within the G1 group are also unusual. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>These genomes lack all but two tRNA genes (for methionine and tryptophan tRNAs)–a feature previously associated with cnidarian mtDNA [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this is the only group of demosponges where a significant acceleration in the rates of mitochondrial sequence evolution has been detected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>There appears to be no causal connection between these two observations, as the loss of all but two tRNA genes is shared by all three species in the group, while the accelerated sequence evolution is much more pronounced in Dictyoceratida and Verticillitida. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>The retention of trnW(uca) and trnM(cau) as the only tRNA genes in the genome supports our previous inference [29] that these genes are difficult to replace because of the unique role of their products in mitochondrial translation:  is used for the initiation of mitochondrial translation with formylmethionine [30] while  must translate the TGA in addition to the TGG codons as tryptophan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>The presence of such constraints can cause a parallel genomic evolution in independent lineages. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>An unusual mitochondrial genome has been previously reported for the haplosclerid demosponge Amphimedon queenslandica [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>This genome lacks atp9 and at least seven tRNA genes, contains deletions in several protein coding genes, and displays accelerated rates of sequence evolution in both protein and RNA genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Our analysis of three additional species from the same order, Amphimedon compressa, Callyspongia plicifera, and Xestospongia muta, found no similar features in the latter taxa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>These results most likely indicate that A. queenslandica mitochondrial genome has undergone an unusual evolution and is a poor representative of the G3 group, although incorporation of nuclear sequences, such as nuclear Numts [31], in the mtDNA assembly cannot be ruled out. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Given that A. queenslandica has become a model system for the study of demosponge biology, the evolution of its unusual mtDNA should be investigated in more details. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Another interesting result that came out of this study is the discovery of two group I introns in cox1 of P. angulospiculatus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Several lines of evidence, including phylogenetic analysis, the identical location in cox1, a similar extent of genetic divergence to their host genes, and the presence of TGA codons at the same position, support the vertical evolution of one of these introns from the common ancestor shared not only with Tetilla sp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>(order Spirophorida), but also with scleractinian corals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>This in turn suggests that the absence of this intron in most demosponge lineages is due to massive parallel loss. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="?"><plain>While examples of such losses are well known in nuclear genomes [32]–[37], an interesting question posed by this result is why mitochondrial introns are retained so scarcely in demosponges but so commonly in cnidarians? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Finally, this study is interesting in what we did not find–any structures and/or sequences potentially involved in the maintenance and expression of mtDNA. </plain></SENT>
