</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>RNA's ubiquitous role in regulation and development is now understood to be much more important than previously believed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Apart from messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), there are many important enzymatic and regulatory functions of RNA, and it seems clear that we are far from having discovered all non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes (Non-coding RNA [1],[2] is functional RNA that is transcribed, yet does not code for a protein). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Indeed, according to the ENCODE Consortium [3], RNA is “pervasively expressed” in the human genome, with approximately 15% of genomic DNA being transcribed, much of it into RNA of no known function. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The functional diversity of non-coding RNA is enormous, ranging from translating mRNA into proteins via the genetic code (tRNA), to catalyzing the peptidyltransferase reaction in appending an amino acid to the growing peptide (rRNA [4]), to directing the chemical modifications of specific ribosomal nucleotides (snoRNA [5]), to the down-regulation of protein product (miRNA [6]), to gene up- or down-regulation by transcriptional and translational modification (riboswitches [7]), to the regulation of alternative splicing ([8]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>To achieve their function, non-coding RNAs (except for small RNAs such as miRNA) require a structure well suited to their role. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>If we assume that ncRNA sequences have been adapted, or optimized, by evolution to fulfill a specific function, it is natural to believe that their structures have been also optimized or at least conserved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>This observation is the basis for a family of methods for secondary structure determination using multiple sequence alignment and comparative sequence analysis [9]–[12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>RNA is also a molecule governed by fundamental physical laws, and thus folds according to thermodynamic and kinetic principles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Algorithms using experimentally derived free energy parameters [13] for secondary structure prediction have been successfully designed, implemented and applied in mfold [14] and RNAfold [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, a series of methods combining thermodynamic principles with evolutionary information [16]–[19] has appeared in the last few years. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>RNA molecules are not static, forever frozen in a native structure, but rather transition from one low energy structure to another (slightly different) low energy structure, due to thermal fluctuations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>In his seminal work, J.S. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>McCaskill [20] introduced an algorithm to compute the partition function over all secondary structures as well as the base pairing probabilities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>This approach has been significantly extended by Ding and Lawrence [21], who sampled secondary structures from the low energy ensemble. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>There is a growing interest in understanding which nucleotides of structurally important ncRNA are inessential, and may be modified with no phenotypic change, and which nucleotides play a critical role in structure, hence function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Indeed, mutagenesis studies are a popular technique for investigating the structure and function of both RNA and protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>In silico exploration of deleterious mutations in RNA secondary structure have thus far been carried out by exhaustive studies, where an available tool, such as mfold [22], Vienna RNA Package [23], or Sfold [24], etc. is applied successively to each 1-point mutant, then to each 2-point mutant, etc. depending on sequence length and available computational time; see, for instance Barash [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Clearly, this exhaustive technique cannot be used to study the effect of many pointwise mutations in a large sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the current paper describes an efficient algorithm, RNAmutants, to investigate the minimum free energy structure MFEk and Boltzmann low energy ensemble εk of all secondary structures of all k-point mutants, for each value of k. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>In addition to detecting deleterious mutations, RNAmutants could lead to a better understanding of fast-mutating RNA viruses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>By understanding fundamental properties of functional RNAs and their robustness to mutation, there may be ultimate applications of our work to the areas of RNA gene discovery and RNA drug design. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we describe a new thermodynamics-based method for the investigation of the mutational secondary structure landscape of a given RNA sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>State-of-the-art thermodynamics-based, single-molecule methods such as McCaskill's algorithm, use a statistical mechanics framework based on the computation of the partition function over the canonical ensemble of all possible secondary structures on a given sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, methods such as Zuker's algorithm for minimum free energy structure [14], McCaskill's algorithm for the partition function [20], and the sampling method of Ding and Lawrence [24], do not permit any modification of the input sequence during their execution and thus cannot investigate the mutation landscape of a sequence, except by exhaustive enumeration of all mutated sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the highly original work on neutral networks due to Peter Schuster and the Vienna group [26]–[28] reposes on such experiments where RNAfold is applied to all 4n many RNA sequences of length n. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The theory of neutral network is still an active area of research—see the recent review of Cowperthwaite and Meyers [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>It follows that RNAmutants could be useful for further studies of these networks. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="60" pm="?"><plain>Consequently, except for small exhaustive enumeration studies, such as in the work of Barash [25], no group has been able to answer questions like the following. What is energetically the most favorable secondary structure adopted by an arbitrary k-point mutant, possibly subject to preserving the location of specific binding sites and possibly constrained by requiring certain positions to be paired resp. unpaired? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>If an RNA molecule is under evolutionary pressure to adopt a low energy structure, subject to certain constraints (binding site, catalytic core), then which positions are most likely to be mutated and what is the consensus sequence and secondary structure of the low energy ensemble. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>There may be objections to what may seem to be yet another thermodynamics-based RNA structure algorithm that we present in this paper, since it is known that RNA secondary structure prediction algorithms that incorporate comparative genomics (multiple structural alignments) generally predict structure more accurately than do single-molecule, thermodynamics-based algorithms such as mfold, RNAfold, and Sfold. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>See work of Gardner and Giegerich [30], who show for instance the more accurate performance of Pfold, a program of Knudsen and Hein [18] that depends on an explicit evolutionary model and a probabilistic model for structures. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>There are two answers to this objection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>First, our program RNAmutants performs computations and admits biological applications that no other software can realize, regardless of whether the software is based thermodynamics or comparative genomics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Second, recent findings of the encode project consortium [3] indicate that the human genome is “pervasively expressed,” with many RNA transcripts of unknown function having no homology to known RNA families. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>While comparative genomics has successfully been used to investigate the structure and evolution of RNAs for which reliable multiple alignments exist, only thermodynamics-based methods can be applied to novel RNAs, such as those reported by the encode consortium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Given the existence of highly reliable, multiple structural alignments of RNAs of the same class, it makes sense to apply comparative genomics methods, such as Pfold of Knudsen and Hein [18], the phylogenetic stochastic context-free grammar (phylo-SCFG) program EvoFold of Pedersen et al. [11], or the Bayesian MCMC program SimulFold of Meyer and Miklós [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>In the absence of highly reliable multiple alignments, such as with the raw data of the encode consortium, thermodynamics-based algorithms are not just the only alternative, but such algorithms in general perform rather well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Indeed, on average, the predicted MFE structure contains 73% of known base-pairs when tested on domains of fewer than 700 nt; cf. Mathews et al. [31]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>In previous work [32], we introduced a novel formal grammar framework (AMSAG) to compute the δ-superoptimal structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>By δ-superoptimal structure, we mean the minimum free energy (MFE) structure among all sequences ω′ with a string edit cost of at most δ from the input sequence ω (i.e., ω′ such that d(ω,ω′)≤δ for a given edit distance d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Hence, in principle AMSAG can handle any edit operation (e.g., mutation, insertion, and deletion). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>However, in addition to the difficulty of estimating good edit costs, the time required to compute the δ-superoptimal structures can be prohibitive, even for small values of δ. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>To overcome these problems, in subsequent work [33], we refined the problem by restricting our sequence search space to k-mutants (i.e., sequences differing of exactly k mutations with the input sequence). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>This simplification allowed us to design and implement an efficient algorithm to compute the partition function over all secondary structures of all k -point mutants, with respect to the Nussinov energy model [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>(The Nussinov energy model ascribes an energy of −1 per base pair, while ignoring any destabilization due to loops. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the Turner energy model [13] ascribes experimentally measured, context-dependent free energies for base stacking, as well as positive, destabilizing free energies for various types of loops: hairpins, bulges, internal loops and multiloops. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>It is well-known that the Nussinov energy model is too simplistic to permit reasonable applications of the kind presented in this paper.) </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>However, due to AMSAG's generality, it is technically difficult to incorporate the full Turner energy model [13] into the AMSAG framework. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>In order to circumvent these difficulties, we have designed new multiple recursions, allowing for a technical breakthrough to develop RNAmutants, a unified algorithm to compute the minimum free energy structure MFE(k) and partition function Z(k) over all k-point mutants of a given RNA sequence, even admitting constraints of two forms—sequence identity constraints (certain positions, such as those known to be important for protein binding are not allowed to mutate), and structural constraints (certain positions are required to pair or to be unpaired). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>RNAmutants uses the state-of-the-art Turner energy model [13] without dangles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>(A dangle is a single-stranded nucleotide, occurring either 5′ or 3′ to a base pair. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>This energy model corresponds to RNAfold -d 0 in the Vienna RNA Package. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>In a first implementation with dangles, the computational overhead caused by including dangles was so prohibitive that we decided not to implement them in the final version of RNAmutants.) </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Using our partition function, we explore the mutation landscape of a given RNA sequence by sampling not from the uniform distribution of k-point mutants, but rather from the Boltzmann distribution of low energy k-point mutants. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>RNAmutants naturally extends the classical RNA secondary structure model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Instead of considering the set of secondary structures that can be built on the input sequence alone, as do mfold, RNAfold, and Sfold, we consider all secondary structures of all sequences with at most k mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>In other words, given an RNA sequence of length n and an integer k max≤n, we compute the partition function Zk over all secondary structures of all k-point mutants, for all 0≤k≤k max. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>When k = 0, we obtain McCaskill's partition function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>The approach is illustrated in Figure 1. </plain></SENT>

</text></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000124.g001"/></fig></SecTag><p><text><SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>We then extend the range of techniques developed in previous work [32],[33] for mutant RNAs and present a sampling algorithm allowing us to sample mutant sequences, together with their sampled secondary structure, from the low energy ensemble. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>A novelty of our algorithm is to sample mutations according to their weight in the Boltzmann ensemble. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>This result generalizes the RNA secondary structure sampling algorithm of Ding and Lawrence [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>From sampling, we derive a novel method to predict mutations disrupting the secondary structure of the original sequence (a.k.a. deleterious mutations). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>Here, we provide a technical breakthrough far beyond brute force computational techniques in the work of Barash [25] and of Shu et al. [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Since there are , or roughly nk, many k-point mutants of an RNA sequence of length n, any method relying on exhaustive listing of all k-point mutants has only a limited range of applicability. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>We tested our algorithms on six different families of RNA sequences from Hepatitis C and Human Immunodeficiency viruses available in the Rfam database [9], as well as the 3′ UTR of GB virus C. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>We then compared our results with experimental studies [36]–[39], to investigate the robustness of RNA structures and the nature of deleterious mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>We performed five types of computational experiments, thus showing the range of possibilities afforded by RNAmutants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>First, we demonstrate the computational efficiency of RNAmutants by computing the partition function over all possible mutants (i.e., all k-mutants, for 0≤k≤n, where n is sequence length), and by sampling we estimate the probability of mutation of each nucleotide of the given sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Second, we analyze the robustness of RNA structures to point-wise mutations of the wild-type sequence, over a collection of 2806 sequences taken from five different families of RNA elements from hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>From our analysis of HCV and HIV, we make some observations concerning possible application to RNA gene discovery and drug design. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Third, using previously published experimental results [39], we evaluate the accuracy of our predictions of deleterious mutation predictions for the hepatitis C virus cis-acting replication element (HCV CRE). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>We suggest new possible mutation sites which have not been previously detected or tested. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Fourth, we show how our techniques can be used to identify regions that have been constrained during evolution to conserve patterns preserving the (functional) structure of a given RNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>In this fashion we can predict nucleotide sites likely to be under purifying selective pressure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Taken altogether, our applications of RNAmutants provide a better identification and understanding of those critical areas of an RNA secondary structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Finally, by scanning of the 3′ UTR of the GB RNA virus C with a fixed size frame, we show how RNAmutants can be used to perform genome-scale analysis and offer a novel insight inside the genome structure that cannot be achieved through other approaches. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>More specifically, we provide evidence that the sequence has been optimized to preserve evolutionarily conserved stem regions from a deleterious effect of pointwise mutations. </plain></SENT>
