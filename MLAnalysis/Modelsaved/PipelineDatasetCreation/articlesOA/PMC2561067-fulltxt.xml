The main ancestral function of Kunitz-type proteins was the inhibition of a diverse array of serine proteases, while toxic activities (such as ion-channel blocking) were developed under a variety of Darwinian selection pressures. How new functions were grafted onto an old protein scaffold and what effect Darwinian selection pressures had on KTT evolution remains a puzzle.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>Here we report the presence of a new superfamily of KTTs in spiders (Tarantulas: Ornithoctonus huwena and Ornithoctonus hainana), which share low sequence similarity to known KTTs and is clustered in a distinct clade in the phylogenetic tree of KTT evolution. The representative molecule of spider KTTs, HWTX-XI, purified from the venom of O. huwena, is a bi-functional protein which is a very potent trypsin inhibitor (about 30-fold more strong than BPTI) as well as a weak Kv1.1 potassium channel blocker. Structural analysis of HWTX-XI in 3-D by NMR together with comparative function analysis of 18 expressed mutants of this toxin revealed two separate sites, corresponding to these two activities, located on the two ends of the cone-shape molecule of HWTX-XI. Comparison of non-synonymous/synonymous mutation ratios (&#969;) for each site in spider and snake KTTs, as well as PBTI like body Kunitz proteins revealed high Darwinian selection pressure on the binding sites for Kv channels and serine proteases in snake, while only on the proteases in spider and none detected in body proteins, suggesting different rates and patterns of evolution among them. The results also revealed a series of key events in the history of spider KTT evolution, including the formation of a novel KTT family (named sub-Kuntiz-type toxins) derived from the ancestral native KTTs with the loss of the second disulfide bridge accompanied by several dramatic sequence modifications.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>These finding illustrate that the two activity sites of Kunitz-type toxins are functionally and evolutionally independent and provide new insights into effects of Darwinian selection pressures on KTT evolution, and mechanisms by which new functions can be grafted onto old protein scaffolds.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Developing venoms to kill or paralyze prey provides an important means for venomous animals to interact with their environment. Under great Darwinian selection pressure, venomous animals strive to construct more efficient toxins so as to be evolutionarily successful. It was hypothesized that the evolution of the animal venom proteome comprises a series of key events including recruitment of an existing ancestor gene, gene duplications and focal hypermutation <xref rid="pone.0003414-Escoubas1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0003414-Escoubas2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. This process has been of tremendous research interest and considerable debate.</p><p>The Kunitz type motif usually has a peptide chain of around 60 amino acid residues and is stabilized by three disulphide bridges with the bonding pattern of 1&#8211;6,2&#8211;4, 3&#8211;5. This motif was first seen in the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI)-like proteinase inhibitors, which are exceptionally strong inhibitors of serine proteinases (also known as S1A proteases) such as trypsin and chymotrypsin. The structure-function relationships of BPTI-like proteinase inhibitors have been extensively studied. The 3D-structure of BPTI, determined by both crystallography and NMR, reveals an &#945;/&#946;/&#945; structural motif <xref rid="pone.0003414-Deisenhofer1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0003414-Berndt1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> The structure-function relationship analysis of BPTI has shown that a solvent exposed loop (from residue 8 to19) is highly complementary to the enzyme active site (S1 pocket), wherein a P1 residue (Lys15 in BPTI) penetrates deeply and interacts with Asp 189 at the bottom of the SI pocket<xref rid="pone.0003414-Otlewski1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Kunitz type proteinase inhibitors may be a kind of &#8220;old&#8221; molecules because that they are ubiquitous in numerous organisms, including plants, animals and microbes.</p><p>The first Kunitz type toxin (KTT) in animal venom (Swissprot No: P00979) was isolated from snake in 1974. After that, many KTTs were found in various venomous animals, including snakes, lizards, cattle ticks, cone snails and sea anemones <xref rid="pone.0003414-Strydom1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0003414-Schweitz1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Besides with the original function (serine protease inhibition), some of them have the ability to block ion channels, especially the voltage-gated potassium channels, which are essential for regulation of various physiological processes such as blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, host defense and action potential transduction. Therefore, these are of potential value not only for evolutionary research, but also for drug design. The 3D structures of dendrotoxin-K (DTX-K) and dendrotoxin 1 (DTX-1), two typical snake KTTs and the potent potassium channel blockers without inhibitory activities for proteases, have been determined by NMR<xref rid="pone.0003414-Berndt2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0003414-Lancelin1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The molecular architectures of DTXs are essentially identical to the structure of BPTI. The structure-function relationship studies of DTXs reveals that the important amino acid residues responsible for the K<sup>+</sup> channel binding are located in the N terminus and &#946;-turn regions<xref rid="pone.0003414-Katoh1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>Although it has been hypothesized that the old Kunitz type scaffold is recruited by the venomous animals to produce KTTs in their venom during the evolution <xref rid="pone.0003414-Fry1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, some fundamental questions&#8211;for example, whether the dual functions are tightly bound or not; how a new neurotoxic function can be grafted onto an old proteinase scaffold; and what the effect of Darwinian selection pressure on the evolution of the KTTs is&#8211; remain unanswered, possibly because there is limited sequence and three-dimensional structural data for the KTTs. For example, there is only one cone snail KTT, and 6 of 9 cattle tick KTT peptides are fragments according to SwissProt version 51.4, and the lack of nucleic acid sequences (in sea anemone). Additionally, in most cases, evolutionary analyses of KTTs are restricted to one taxonomic group, and systematic comparisons between them are rare<xref rid="pone.0003414-Zupunski1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0003414-Creighton1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Here, we report the first superfamily of KTTs from spiders and discuss the structure and functions of a representative toxin (HWTX-XI) to provide a global view of KTTs evolution across taxonomic groups, as well as clues toward the answer to the foregoing questions.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Purification and amino acid sequence of HWTX-XI</title><p>HWTX-XI was purified using ion-exchange HPLC combined with reverse-phase HPLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003414-g001">Fig. 1A,B</xref>) from the venom of <italic>Ornithoctonus huwena</italic>.

First, the replacement of R21 in BPTI by a smaller residue, S16 reduces steric hindrance and facilitating the approach and interaction of K14 with the negatively charged residue Asp189 at the bottom of the P1 pocket of trypsin. Second, in comparison with the I22 of BPTI, the F17 of HWTX-XI with a larger side chain (phenyl) may provide a broader hydrophobic surface to interact with F41 and K60 of trypsin, which form a hydrophobic pocket. Third, the long side chain of R12 provides a hydrophobic surface and its amino groups fit perfectly the positive pocket formed by the hydroxyls of K145, S146 and G148 in trypsin, and the potential hydrogen bonds between them may strengthen binding to the inhibitor.</p><fig id="pone-0003414-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003414.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Structural comparison between HWTX-XI with BPTI and DTX-K and docking superimposition of HWTX-XI with Trypsin and pore region of KV1.1.</title><p>(A).

This mutation may contribute to the decline of blocking activity. However, the mutation D2K, which was expected to possess potent affinity like DTX-K, increased the activity by only about 4-fold. A possible explanation is that the K residue of the mutant cannot present its side chain to the molecular surface. Another reason for the relatively low blocking activity is that the residues corresponding to W25 and K26 of DTX-K, which may provide a hydrophobic surface for binding to the turret of Kv1.1 subunits are missingin HWTX-XI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003414-g006">Fig. 6 A,C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Discovery of a Superfamily of KTTs in Spiders</title><p>To investigate whether there are other KTTs similar to HWTX-XI in spider venom, we constructed two cDNA libraries of the venom glands of two Chinese bird spiders <italic>O. huwena</italic> and <italic>O. hainana</italic>.

Ecological and molecular evolution evidence supports that they share an ancestor species and derive from the first part of the fourth epoch. In this period, the formation of the Qiong Zhou straits separated them into two groups.</p><p>Sequence alignment of novel cDNA sequences of KTTs indicates that they can be categorized into two groups according to the number of disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003414-g007">Fig. 7B</xref> and Supplemental materials). The first group follows the native Kuntiz architecture, whereas the second has lost the highly conserved cysteine bridge by a C34Y (TGC-&gt;TAC). Members of this group have been designated as sub-Kunitz-type toxins.</p><p>Development of a protein family is an extremely complex process which may include a series of key events such as gene duplication and sequence divergence <xref rid="pone.0003414-Fry2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. To try better to understand the evolution of the spider KTT family, we constructed a phylogenetic tree based on the sequence alignment and the topology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003414-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). On careful examination of these data, we identified several possible key events. First, the loss of two residues (A29, K30 in BPTI) must have occurred after the recruitment events because all tarantula spider KTTs and no other Kunitz type proteins share the feature. These data also suggest that the KTTs of tarantulas might share a single origin. The second event is the replacement of the fourth cysteine residue of classical KTTs such as HWTX-XI by a tyrosine, which eliminates the 2&#8211;4 disulfide bridge to form the sub-Kunitz toxin. The HWTX-XI-IS40 may be a primitive sub-Kunitz toxin because it shares great sequence similarity with classic KTTs. The loss of disulfide bonds was also seen in two cone snail toxins (conkunitzin-S1, S2), tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), ixolaris from the salivary gland of the tick and trophoblast Kunitz domain protein-3 (TK-3) from cow<xref rid="pone.0003414-Dy1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0003414-Bayrhuber1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. It has been reported that a sub-Kunitz type protein can form a hydrophobic core in region A to compensate for the loss of stability provided by the missing disulfide bridge. As a result, loss of the disulfide may not lead to the destruction of the architecture of the Kunitz type molecules<xref rid="pone.0003414-Dy1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The following key events may include a series of sequence divergences. The most significant modification may be the mutations (R12D, K14L, A15R and X16F&#8211; where the X is other residues) in region A and may involve great functional variations. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003414-g007">Figure 7</xref> shows, both <italic>Ornithoctonus huwena</italic> and <italic>Ornithoctonus hainana</italic> have their sub-Kunitz toxin families. High sequence identity between them suggests gene duplication.That they are not shuffled, strongly supports the assumption that the genes for these toxins were constructed independently by two gene duplication events after the species divergence which occurred less than 1.6 MY ago. The last key event is the deletion of the orphan cysteine residue (the second one) in HWTX-XI-IS24. A possible explanation may be the disappearance of strong purifying pressure on the site after its partner was gone.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Evolutionary trends in KTTs</title><p>It is accepted that many toxins have evolved through recruitment events in which a body protein, cellular ancestor protein of toxin who takes effect in body and do notsecrete out, is recruited into the chemical arsenal<xref rid="pone.0003414-Zupunski1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0003414-King1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In reality, there are two models used to explain the recruitment events leading to development of new toxins. In the first one, the toxin inherits its function from an ancient body proteins. In the second models, a new function is grafted onto an ancient body protein after the recruitment event to fulfill the requirement of toxin.</p><p>The KTTs seem to have evolved by way of the second model, in that S1-protease inhibitors are transformed into channel blockers in snakes and spiders. A special feature here is that the new active site is different from and independent of the old one. If we thought the development progress of specific K<sup>+</sup> channel blocker as a chain with four rings from body inhibitors, secreted inhibitor in venoms, double functional toxin and finally to K<sup>+</sup> channel blockers, the comparing of the two regions among them may provide a new insight into how a new function (ion channel blocking) may be grafted onto an old Kunitz protein scaffold. For doing that, we constructed a sequence alignment of 35 distinct Kunitz type proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003414-g008">Fig. 8</xref>) which are categorized into five classes; body trypsin inhibitor (BT), chymotrypsin inhibitor in venoms (CTI), trypsin inhibitor in venoms (TI), double functional toxin (DFT) as well as K<sup>+</sup> channel blocker (KB) of various species based on functional annotations of Swissprot database. The key residues for the two functions are selected out and highlighted manually. These results show clear patterns. C(R/K) s (Where s is a small residue) in region A is shared by all of TIs with the exception of P16344. In the CTIs, the pattern is replaced by C(B)s (where B is a residue with a large side-chain) to fit a broader hydrophobic pocket in the P1 position of chymotrypsin. However, the patterns disappear in the specific K<sup>+</sup> channel blockers. A clear trend of enrichment of basic residues is found in key sites which have been shown to form an interacting surface with the ion channel, including K3, K6, K26 and K28 in DTX-K <xref rid="pone.0003414-Skarzynski1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. This implies that a dramatic modification occurs in region A in order to discard the inhibition function when a DFT is finally transformed to a KB. In region B, the sequence divergence is much higher than in the others. The trend may be the result of an underlying positive Darwinian selection for the construction of the ion channel blocking function.</p><fig id="pone-0003414-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003414.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Representative alignment of five classes of Kunitz-type molecules.</title><p>Different groups classified by function are indicated by colored lines at left: grey, body trypsin inhibitors; blue, chymotrypsin inhibitors in venom; green, trypsin inhibitors in venom; yellow, dual-function toxins; red, K<sup>+</sup> channel blockers.

Two pairs of models (M1/M2 and M7/M8) were used to test whether the neutral models (M1 and M7) or selection models (M2 and M8) are true. The neutral model constrains &#969; for each amino acid site to a value between 0 and 1, where &#969;&lt;0.3 corresponds to purifying selection (selection acting against deleterious mutations) and &#969;&#8202;=&#8202;1 to neutral evolution, whereas the selected models additional allow positively selected (&#969;&gt;1) rate classes. For example, the M1 model (neutral) assumes two classes of sites in proteins: the conserved sites (&#969;&#8202;=&#8202;0) and the neutral sites (&#969;&#8202;=&#8202;1). The M2 model (selection) adds a third class of sites with &#969; as a free parameter, thus allowing for sites with x&gt;1. The M7 model (&#946;) allows sites to have 10 different &#969; ratios in the interval (0, 1), which are calculated from the &#946; distribution with parameters p and q. Model M8 (&#946; and &#969;) adds an extra class of sites to the &#946; (M7) model and allows the sites to have &#969;&gt;1. Usually, the model that fit the data better has greater likelihood scores.</p><p>The results show that the two selected models (M2 and M8) significantly increase the likelihood scores compared with null models in the case of the KTTs of snake and spider, but not the PBTI like body proteins, suggesting adaptive molecular evolution acting on the KTTs at the sequence level. In contrast, the rather low &#969; ratio of body proteins (e.g. &#969;&#8202;=&#8202;0.131 in one ratio model) indicates strong negative selection acting on them (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003414.s010">Table S2</xref> in the supplemental materials).

In the KTTs of snake, residues with a high &#969; ratio (h&#969; residue) cluster in the region A and region B. In spider KTTs, lower h&#969; residues were found. Most of them cluster in region A and none of them are located in region B, with the exception of I1, the N-terminal residue of HWTX-XI (Supplemental materials <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003414.s010">Table S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003414.s011">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003414.s012">S4</xref>).</p><p>As the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003414-g009">Figs 9B and C</xref> show, the molecules involved in interactions with the environment usually have a higher evolutionary rate than their body homologs.

The difference of the distribution of h&#969; residues between tarantula spiders and snakes suggests the distinct functional demands on KTTs and implies a possible reason why snakes, but not spiders, have developed specific K<sup>+</sup> blockers, though the spider KTTs emerged much earlier. K<sup>+</sup> channel-blocking activity is important for paralyzing the prey of both snakes and spiders. The absence of positive Darwinian selection pressure in region B of spider KTTs may explain why no specific channel blocking KTTs were found in spider venom.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We report here a new KTT super-family from the venom of spiders and thedetailed study of the structure-function relationship of HWTX-XI, the representative of the spider KTT family. The 45 cDNA sequences of spider KTTs, which doubles the existing dataset of KTTs, and the identification of the functionally and evolutionally independent activity sites of spider KTTs offer us the possibility to explore the KTT evolution.</p><p>It is well-known that the main function of animal venom is to kill or immobilize prey. New protein functions are therefore beneficial if they result in more effective toxins. The origin and evolution of animal toxin is a very interesting but still a disputed issue. Now people believe that most toxins have developed from recruitment events of genes from some &#8216;old&#8217; protein families, according to the phylogenetic analysis of toxin sequences (mainly from that of snakes) and related body proteins. One hypothesis is that a new function is grafted onto ancient body protein after a recruitment event by gene dublication, focal hypermutation and Darwinian selection. For example, the sarafotoxin, a snake toxin with the cardiac arrest activity, is structurally related to endothelins. Sarafotoxin and endothelin-3 possess about 60% amino acid sequence identify. The major differences between them are to be found within the sequences of the inner loop Cys3-Cys11. Scientists believe that sarafotoxin is evolutionally fromthe ancestral endothelin<xref rid="pone.0003414-Fry1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0003414-Sokolovsky1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Another example is &#945;-bungarotoxin, a snake toxin with the activity of blocking neuromuscular transmission. This toxin is structurally related to an ancestral protein, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor binding LYNX. The sequence difference at the N-terminals of the two proteins is the main cause of the neurotoxicity of the &#945;-bungarotoxin <xref rid="pone.0003414-Fry1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0003414-IbanezTallon1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Our work presented here gives another example. The KTTs transform from S1-protease inhibitors to channel blockers in snakes and spiders. Especially, the new active site is different and independent to the old one. The details of the functional evolution remain unknown. Our study indicated that the process of KTT evolution has probably three stages: old functional molecular, bi-functional toxin and new function toxin.</p><p>However, a comparison of non-synonymous/synonymous mutation ratios (<italic>&#969;</italic>) for the two active sites in spider and snake KTTs reveals that the evolution rates of the two active sites are independent. High Darwinian selection pressure acted on the activity sites for both K<sup>+</sup> channels and serine proteases in snake KTTs but only on the protease site in spider KTTs, suggesting different rates and patterns of KTT evolution. This result indicates that the process of the KTT evolution is very complicated and varying from animal to animal. The reasons for the venomous animals to need protease inhibitors in their venoms and the physiological target of the protease inhibitors still remain unclear to us. It has been proposed that one of the physiological roles of these protease inhibitors is to resist prey proteases to protect their venom protein toxins <xref rid="pone.0003414-Zupunski1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. It seems that both snakes and spiders got the selective pressure driven by prey proteases. Then we have got a question why snakes have developed strong and specific neurotoxic K<sup>+</sup> channel blockers while spiders have developed only the dual-functional KTT with weak K<sup>+</sup> channel blockage activity. We have not got experimental data to answer this question. It is possibly due to the different driving force from the selective pressure. One possible explanation may be that spiders are already equipped with many ICK (inhibitor cystine knot) motif toxins capable of ion channel blocking. For example, based on ATDB database<xref rid="pone.0003414-He1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> search results, the venom of <italic>O. huwena</italic> contains about 50 different ICK toxins including several potent blockers for Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>+</sup>
<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels<xref rid="pone.0003414-Yuan1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In contrast, few ICK motif toxins have been found in snakes and, except for the Kunitz type K<sup>+</sup> channel blockers, no other type K<sup>+</sup> channel blockers have been identified in snakes so far. So it seems that KTTs may comprise the main elements for K<sup>+</sup> channel blocking for snakes. The weak K<sup>+</sup> channel blocking activity of spider KTTs should also be developed under Darwinian selective pressure. It is still not sure how the weak K<sup>+</sup> channel blocking function on the KTTs is beneficial to spiders. We suppose that this weak neurotoxic function may have some synergistic effect with other neurotoxins in the venom, but it need to be proved by experiment data.</p><p>The phylogenetic analysis of the KTTs of different taxonomic groups with that of some BPTI like body proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003414-g009">Figure 9 A</xref>) demonstrated that the development of neurotoxic specific snake KTTs is the later recruitment event than that of spider KTTs. The detailed process of the KTT evolution is still not clear. To better understand the KTT evolution, people need more sequence data of DNA and protein of KTT superfamilies from different venomous animals and more information of the structure-function relationship of KTTs with different functions.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Concluding Remarks</title><p>The present study reports on the dual activity functions and the solution structure of HWTX-XI, a representative Kunitz-type toxin identified for the first time in a tarantula. Structural and functional analyses of 18 mutants revealed two independent binding sites corresponding to the dual activities of HWTX-XI: strong inhibition of serine proteases and weak inhibition of Kv channels. Using HWTX-XI as an example, we discovered a distinct KTT superfamily in two spider species. Comparison of non-synonymous/synonymous mutation ratios (<italic>&#969;</italic>) for each site in spider and snake KTTs as well as in body Kunitz proteins revealed that the evolution rates of the two active sites are independent. High Darwinian selection pressure acted on the binding sites for both Kv channels and serine proteases in snake KTTs but only on the protease site in spider KTTs. No Darwinian selection pressure was detected for the body proteins, suggesting different rates and patterns of evolution. These results not only introduce a new superfamily of KTTs in spiders, but also provide insights into how new functions can be grafted onto old protein scaffolds and how Darwinian selection pressures affected KTT evolution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Collection of Spider Venom</title><p>Adult female specimens of <italic>Ornithoctonus huwena</italic> and <italic>Ornithoctonus hainana</italic> were collected in Guanxi and Hainan province of China respectively.
