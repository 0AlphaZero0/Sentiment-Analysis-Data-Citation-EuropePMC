</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Here we report the presence of a new superfamily of KTTs in spiders (Tarantulas: Ornithoctonus huwena and Ornithoctonus hainana), which share low sequence similarity to known KTTs and is clustered in a distinct clade in the phylogenetic tree of KTT evolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The representative molecule of spider KTTs, HWTX-XI, purified from the venom of O. huwena, is a bi-functional protein which is a very potent trypsin inhibitor (about 30-fold more strong than BPTI) as well as a weak Kv1.1 potassium channel blocker. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Structural analysis of HWTX-XI in 3-D by NMR together with comparative function analysis of 18 expressed mutants of this toxin revealed two separate sites, corresponding to these two activities, located on the two ends of the cone-shape molecule of HWTX-XI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Comparison of non-synonymous/synonymous mutation ratios (ω) for each site in spider and snake KTTs, as well as PBTI like body Kunitz proteins revealed high Darwinian selection pressure on the binding sites for Kv channels and serine proteases in snake, while only on the proteases in spider and none detected in body proteins, suggesting different rates and patterns of evolution among them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The results also revealed a series of key events in the history of spider KTT evolution, including the formation of a novel KTT family (named sub-Kuntiz-type toxins) derived from the ancestral native KTTs with the loss of the second disulfide bridge accompanied by several dramatic sequence modifications. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Developing venoms to kill or paralyze prey provides an important means for venomous animals to interact with their environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Under great Darwinian selection pressure, venomous animals strive to construct more efficient toxins so as to be evolutionarily successful. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>It was hypothesized that the evolution of the animal venom proteome comprises a series of key events including recruitment of an existing ancestor gene, gene duplications and focal hypermutation [1]–[3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>This process has been of tremendous research interest and considerable debate. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The Kunitz type motif usually has a peptide chain of around 60 amino acid residues and is stabilized by three disulphide bridges with the bonding pattern of 1–6,2–4, 3–5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>This motif was first seen in the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI)-like proteinase inhibitors, which are exceptionally strong inhibitors of serine proteinases (also known as S1A proteases) such as trypsin and chymotrypsin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The structure-function relationships of BPTI-like proteinase inhibitors have been extensively studied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The 3D-structure of BPTI, determined by both crystallography and NMR, reveals an α/β/α structural motif [4], [5] The structure-function relationship analysis of BPTI has shown that a solvent exposed loop (from residue 8 to19) is highly complementary to the enzyme active site (S1 pocket), wherein a P1 residue (Lys15 in BPTI) penetrates deeply and interacts with Asp 189 at the bottom of the SI pocket[6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Kunitz type proteinase inhibitors may be a kind of “old” molecules because that they are ubiquitous in numerous organisms, including plants, animals and microbes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The first Kunitz type toxin (KTT) in animal venom (Swissprot No: P00979) was isolated from snake in 1974. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>After that, many KTTs were found in various venomous animals, including snakes, lizards, cattle ticks, cone snails and sea anemones [7]–[10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Besides with the original function (serine protease inhibition), some of them have the ability to block ion channels, especially the voltage-gated potassium channels, which are essential for regulation of various physiological processes such as blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, host defense and action potential transduction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these are of potential value not only for evolutionary research, but also for drug design. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The 3D structures of dendrotoxin-K (DTX-K) and dendrotoxin 1 (DTX-1), two typical snake KTTs and the potent potassium channel blockers without inhibitory activities for proteases, have been determined by NMR[11], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The molecular architectures of DTXs are essentially identical to the structure of BPTI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The structure-function relationship studies of DTXs reveals that the important amino acid residues responsible for the K+ channel binding are located in the N terminus and β-turn regions[13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Although it has been hypothesized that the old Kunitz type scaffold is recruited by the venomous animals to produce KTTs in their venom during the evolution [2], some fundamental questions–for example, whether the dual functions are tightly bound or not; how a new neurotoxic function can be grafted onto an old proteinase scaffold; and what the effect of Darwinian selection pressure on the evolution of the KTTs is– remain unanswered, possibly because there is limited sequence and three-dimensional structural data for the KTTs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>For example, there is only one cone snail KTT, and 6 of 9 cattle tick KTT peptides are fragments according to SwissProt version 51.4, and the lack of nucleic acid sequences (in sea anemone). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Additionally, in most cases, evolutionary analyses of KTTs are restricted to one taxonomic group, and systematic comparisons between them are rare[14], [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the first superfamily of KTTs from spiders and discuss the structure and functions of a representative toxin (HWTX-XI) to provide a global view of KTTs evolution across taxonomic groups, as well as clues toward the answer to the foregoing questions. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>The ω ratio is a measure of selective pressure on a protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>An ω ratio significantly higher than 1.0 is convincing evidence for diversifying selection [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>The presence of a positively selected rate class is detected by likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) for comparing the likelihood of a neutral model with that of a selected model following the suggestions of the PAML manual [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Two pairs of models (M1/M2 and M7/M8) were used to test whether the neutral models (M1 and M7) or selection models (M2 and M8) are true. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>The neutral model constrains ω for each amino acid site to a value between 0 and 1, where ω&lt;0.3 corresponds to purifying selection (selection acting against deleterious mutations) and ω = 1 to neutral evolution, whereas the selected models additional allow positively selected (ω&gt;1) rate classes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>For example, the M1 model (neutral) assumes two classes of sites in proteins: the conserved sites (ω = 0) and the neutral sites (ω = 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>The M2 model (selection) adds a third class of sites with ω as a free parameter, thus allowing for sites with x&gt;1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>The M7 model (β) allows sites to have 10 different ω ratios in the interval (0, 1), which are calculated from the β distribution with parameters p and q. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>Model M8 (β and ω) adds an extra class of sites to the β (M7) model and allows the sites to have ω&gt;1. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the rather low ω ratio of body proteins (e.g. ω = 0.131 in one ratio model) indicates strong negative selection acting on them (Table S2 in the supplemental materials). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>The posterior mean ω values of each site of three groups in Model 3 (discrete) and Model 8 (β &amp; ω) are plotted to indicate the sites under positive selection (Fig. 9B and C).As shown, none of the residues in body proteins have an ω ratio higher than 1.0. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>As the Figs 9B and C show, the molecules involved in interactions with the environment usually have a higher evolutionary rate than their body homologs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>The distribution of hω residues in KTTs, consistent with alignment results that suggest highly positive Darwinian selection pressure, often focuses on the biologically active region that usually interacts with their ligands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>The difference of the distribution of hω residues between tarantula spiders and snakes suggests the distinct functional demands on KTTs and implies a possible reason why snakes, but not spiders, have developed specific K+ blockers, though the spider KTTs emerged much earlier. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>We report here a new KTT super-family from the venom of spiders and thedetailed study of the structure-function relationship of HWTX-XI, the representative of the spider KTT family. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>The 45 cDNA sequences of spider KTTs, which doubles the existing dataset of KTTs, and the identification of the functionally and evolutionally independent activity sites of spider KTTs offer us the possibility to explore the KTT evolution. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>It is well-known that the main function of animal venom is to kill or immobilize prey. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>New protein functions are therefore beneficial if they result in more effective toxins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>The origin and evolution of animal toxin is a very interesting but still a disputed issue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Now people believe that most toxins have developed from recruitment events of genes from some ‘old’ protein families, according to the phylogenetic analysis of toxin sequences (mainly from that of snakes) and related body proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>One hypothesis is that a new function is grafted onto ancient body protein after a recruitment event by gene dublication, focal hypermutation and Darwinian selection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>For example, the sarafotoxin, a snake toxin with the cardiac arrest activity, is structurally related to endothelins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Sarafotoxin and endothelin-3 possess about 60% amino acid sequence identify. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>The major differences between them are to be found within the sequences of the inner loop Cys3-Cys11. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Scientists believe that sarafotoxin is evolutionally fromthe ancestral endothelin[2], [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Another example is α-bungarotoxin, a snake toxin with the activity of blocking neuromuscular transmission. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>This toxin is structurally related to an ancestral protein, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor binding LYNX. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>The sequence difference at the N-terminals of the two proteins is the main cause of the neurotoxicity of the α-bungarotoxin [2], [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Our work presented here gives another example. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>The KTTs transform from S1-protease inhibitors to channel blockers in snakes and spiders. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Especially, the new active site is different and independent to the old one. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>The details of the functional evolution remain unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>Our study indicated that the process of KTT evolution has probably three stages: old functional molecular, bi-functional toxin and new function toxin. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>However, a comparison of non-synonymous/synonymous mutation ratios (ω) for the two active sites in spider and snake KTTs reveals that the evolution rates of the two active sites are independent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>High Darwinian selection pressure acted on the activity sites for both K+ channels and serine proteases in snake KTTs but only on the protease site in spider KTTs, suggesting different rates and patterns of KTT evolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>This result indicates that the process of the KTT evolution is very complicated and varying from animal to animal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>The reasons for the venomous animals to need protease inhibitors in their venoms and the physiological target of the protease inhibitors still remain unclear to us. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that one of the physiological roles of these protease inhibitors is to resist prey proteases to protect their venom protein toxins [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>It seems that both snakes and spiders got the selective pressure driven by prey proteases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>Then we have got a question why snakes have developed strong and specific neurotoxic K+ channel blockers while spiders have developed only the dual-functional KTT with weak K+ channel blockage activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>We have not got experimental data to answer this question. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>It is possibly due to the different driving force from the selective pressure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>One possible explanation may be that spiders are already equipped with many ICK (inhibitor cystine knot) motif toxins capable of ion channel blocking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>For example, based on ATDB database[30] search results, the venom of O. huwena contains about 50 different ICK toxins including several potent blockers for Na+, Ca+ + and K+ channels[31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>In contrast, few ICK motif toxins have been found in snakes and, except for the Kunitz type K+ channel blockers, no other type K+ channel blockers have been identified in snakes so far. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>So it seems that KTTs may comprise the main elements for K+ channel blocking for snakes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>The weak K+ channel blocking activity of spider KTTs should also be developed under Darwinian selective pressure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>It is still not sure how the weak K+ channel blocking function on the KTTs is beneficial to spiders. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>We suppose that this weak neurotoxic function may have some synergistic effect with other neurotoxins in the venom, but it need to be proved by experiment data. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>The phylogenetic analysis of the KTTs of different taxonomic groups with that of some BPTI like body proteins (Figure 9 A) demonstrated that the development of neurotoxic specific snake KTTs is the later recruitment event than that of spider KTTs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>The detailed process of the KTT evolution is still not clear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>To better understand the KTT evolution, people need more sequence data of DNA and protein of KTT superfamilies from different venomous animals and more information of the structure-function relationship of KTTs with different functions. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>The present study reports on the dual activity functions and the solution structure of HWTX-XI, a representative Kunitz-type toxin identified for the first time in a tarantula. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>Structural and functional analyses of 18 mutants revealed two independent binding sites corresponding to the dual activities of HWTX-XI: strong inhibition of serine proteases and weak inhibition of Kv channels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>Using HWTX-XI as an example, we discovered a distinct KTT superfamily in two spider species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>Comparison of non-synonymous/synonymous mutation ratios (ω) for each site in spider and snake KTTs as well as in body Kunitz proteins revealed that the evolution rates of the two active sites are independent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>High Darwinian selection pressure acted on the binding sites for both Kv channels and serine proteases in snake KTTs but only on the protease site in spider KTTs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>No Darwinian selection pressure was detected for the body proteins, suggesting different rates and patterns of evolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>These results not only introduce a new superfamily of KTTs in spiders, but also provide insights into how new functions can be grafted onto old protein scaffolds and how Darwinian selection pressures affected KTT evolution. </plain></SENT>
