</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>High levels of IgE have been considered for many years as markers of parasite and helminth exposure to which they confer resistance [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In Western lifestyle countries with less contact, however, elevated IgE levels are associated with allergic disorders [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Only recently, it has been established that IgE antibodies also play a key role in anti-tumoral defence [3] and are crucial mediators of autoimmune diseases [4], thus challenging the traditional Th1/Th2 dogma. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>High total serum IgE levels are closely correlated with the clinical expression and severity of asthma and allergy [5],[6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The regulation of serum IgE production is largely influenced by familial determinants, and both pedigree- and twin-based studies provided evidence of a strong genetic contribution to the variability of total IgE levels [7],[8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Genetic susceptibility of IgE-responsiveness is likely to be caused by a pattern of polymorphisms in multiple genes regulating immunologic responses[9], but so far only very few loci could be established consistently and robustly, most notable FCER1B, IL-13 and STAT6 [10],[11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Family and case-control studies indicated that total serum IgE levels are largely determined by genetic factors that are independent of specific IgE responses and that total serum IgE levels are under stronger genetic control than atopic disease [8],[12],[13],[14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>An understanding of the genetic mechanisms regulating total serum IgE levels might also aid in the dissection of the genetic basis of atopic diseases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to identify novel genetic variants that affect total IgE levels, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 1,530 German adults and replicated the top signals in altogether 9,769 samples of four independent study populations. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>In this large-scale population-based GWAS with follow-up investigations in 9,769 individuals from 4 independent population-based study samples we show that functional variants of the gene encoding the alpha chain of the high affinity receptor for IgE (FCER1A) are of major importance for the regulation of IgE levels. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>The high affinity receptor for IgE represents the central receptor of IgE-induced type I hypersensitivity reactions such as the liberation of vasoactive mediators including serotonin and histamine, but also for the induction of profound immune responses through the activation of NFkappa B and downstream genes [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>It is usually expressed as a αβγ2 complex on mast cells and basophils, but additionally as a αγ2 complex on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) as shown for dendritic cells and monocytes [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in APCs, IgE-recognition of allergens also leads to facilitated allergen uptake via FCER1 and thereby contributes to a preferential activation of Th2-subsets of T-cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Its expression is substantially influenced by the binding of IgE to either form of the receptor as bound IgE apparently protects the receptor from degradation and thus enhances surface expression without de novo protein synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Of note, binding of IgE in the two different complexes only uses the alpha subunit of the receptor lacking contact sites with the beta or gamma subunits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the expression level of the alpha subunit is crucial for IgE levels on immune cells [18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Previous studies suggested linkage of atopy to the gene encoding the β chain of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FCRER1B) [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>FCER1B plays a critical role in regulating the cellular response to IgE and antigen through its capacity to amplify FCER1 signalling and regulate cell-surface expression [18], and there have been several studies which reported an association of FCER1B variants and atopy-related traits but conflicting results for total IgE [20],[21],[22],[23],[24],[25],[26],[27],[28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>In a more recent study, no association between FCER1B tagSNPs and IgE levels was observed [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>The 500 k random SNP array contained only one SNP within as well as 31 SNPs within a 100-kb region around this gene, which were not significantly associated with total IgE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>However, we cannot rule out that we missed relevant variants in this gene. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>In the present study we identified FCER1A as susceptibility locus in a genome-wide association scan and replicated association of the FCER1A polymorphism rs2427837 with serum IgE levels in a total of 9,769 individuals from 4 independent population-based cohorts with a combined P value of 7.08×10−19. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>This SNP is in complete LD with the FCER1A polymorphism rs2251746, for which we observed a combined P value of 1.85×10−20. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Besides the continuous cycling of the IgE receptor subunits from intracellular storage pools to the surface, there is also a substantial expression of the alpha subunit after stimulation with IL-4 which requires de novo protein synthesis [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>This induction is stimulated by the transcription factor GATA-1, which has a binding site in the putative promoter region of the FCER1A gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Notably, in a previous study with Japanese individuals it could be shown that the minor allele of the polymorphism rs2251746 is associated with higher FCER1A expression through enhanced GATA-1 binding [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>In line with this we observed an increased cell surface expression of FCER1A on IgE-stripped basophils from individuals homozygous for the “G” allele at rs2427837 (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the correlation of FCER1A expression with IgE levels in 320 KORA samples where whole genome blood expression profiles were available revealed no significant effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>However, FCER1A expression showed a significant dependency on IL-4 (P = 0.0087) and GATA-1 expression (P = 1.4×10−4), confirming the known stimulation pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we found a highly significant dependency of FCER1A expression on GATA-2 transcript levels (p = 7.8×10−27). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>While whole blood expression levels could easily obscure the situation in basophils, this finding might indicate a novel regulatory mechanisms of FCER1A expression via GATA-2 [18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>The large (&gt;50 kb) RAD50 gene, which encodes an ubiquitously expressed DNA repair protein, is located within the Th2-cytokine locus on chromosome 5q31, which has been linked with total IgE [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>It contains multiple conserved non-coding sequences with presumed regulatory function [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, evidence has been provided for the presence of a locus control region (LCR) within a 25 kb segment of the 3′ region of this gene, which plays an important role in the regulation of Th2 cytokine gene transcription [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>The core of this LCR is constituted by four RAD50 hypersensitive sites (RHS) in intron 21 (RHS4-6) and 24 (RHS7) [17],[32],[33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>The finding of an association between RAD50 variants and IgE levels is new and biologically compelling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>However, it has to be considered that so far RAD50 has not emerged as candidate, but that several known candidate genes for atopy-related traits map to this region with strong linkage disequlibrium, especially IL13, which is one of the strongest and widely replicated candidate genes [10],[11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Notably, two functional IL13 polymorphisms, IL13-1112CT (rs1800925) in the promoter region and IL13+2044GA (IL13 Arg130Gln, rs20541) in Exon 4, have been shown to be associated with a range of atopy-related disorders. IL13+2044GA (rs20541) did not pass our selection criteria, and IL13-1112CT (rs1800925) is not contained in the Affymetrix 500 K Array Set. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Additional analysis of markers in this region including these two SNPs showed one LD block encompassing the entire RAD50 gene and extending into the IL13 promoter region, whereas rs20541 showed low levels of LD with RAD50 SNPs (Figure S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Thus, we cannot reliably differentiate the specific source of the signal between RAD50 and IL13 in our data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>Functional studies are needed to assess whether RAD50 is a true causal gene and to identify the causal genetic variants modulating IgE levels in this region. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>The identification and positive replication of the STAT6 locus, which is located in one of the most frequently identified genomic regions linked to atopy-related phenotypes [34], serves as positive control for the experiment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Our results confirm previous candidate studies which showed that genetic variants in the gene encoding STAT6, a key regulatory element of the TH2 immune response, contribute to the regulation of total serum IgE [35],[36]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Other previously reported candidate genes for total IgE showed no or only weak signals in our genome-wide scan (Tables S10 and S11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>However, it has to be considered that there are only very few genes that have been associated in the first place to IgE such as STAT6, whereas most reported candidate genes for total IgE were investigated in asthma or eczema cohorts [10],[11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>In addition, there have been queries with regard to replication for many of the genes reported. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Thus, our data obtained in a population-based and ethnically homogeneous sample (South German Caucasians) are not readily comparable with previous candidate gene studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Furthermore some previously implicated variants were covered insufficiently by the 500 k random SNP array (Table S10). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>In summary, in this first GWAS on total IgE FCER1A was identified and replicated as new susceptibility locus at which common genetic variation influences serum IgE levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>In addition, our data suggest that variants within the RAD50 gene might represent additional factors within cytokine gene cluster on chromosome 5q31, emphasizing the need for further investigations in this intriguing region. </plain></SENT>
