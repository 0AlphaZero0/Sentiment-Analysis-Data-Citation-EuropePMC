We have demonstrated that muscle mitochondrial enzyme activities are impaired in septic ICU patients impairing cellular energy balance, which will interfere with muscle function and metabolism. Here we use detailed phenotyping and genomics to elucidate mechanisms leading to these impairments and the molecular consequences.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Utilising biopsy material from seventeen patients and ten age-matched controls we demonstrate that neither mitochondrial <italic>in vivo</italic> protein synthesis nor expression of mitochondrial genes are compromised. Indeed, there was partial activation of the mitochondrial biogenesis pathway involving NRF2&#945;/GABP and its target genes TFAM, TFB1M and TFB2M yet clearly this failed to maintain mitochondrial function. We therefore utilised transcript profiling and pathway analysis of ICU patient skeletal muscle to generate insight into the molecular defects driving loss of muscle function and metabolic homeostasis. Gene ontology analysis of Affymetrix analysis demonstrated substantial loss of muscle specific genes, a global oxidative stress response related to most probably cytokine signalling, altered insulin related signalling and a substantial overlap between patients and muscle wasting/inflammatory animal models. MicroRNA 21 processing appeared defective suggesting that post-transcriptional protein synthesis regulation is altered by disruption of tissue microRNA expression. Finally, we were able to demonstrate that the phenotype of skeletal muscle in ICU patients is not merely one of inactivity, it appears to be an actively remodelling tissue, influenced by several mediators, all of which may be open to manipulation with the aim to improve clinical outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>This first combined protein and transcriptome based analysis of human skeletal muscle obtained from septic patients demonstrated that losses of mitochondria and muscle mass are accompanied by sustained protein synthesis (anabolic process) while dysregulation of transcription programmes appears to fail to compensate for increased damage and proteolysis. Our analysis identified both validated and novel clinically tractable targets to manipulate these failing processes and pursuit of these could lead to new potential treatments.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Yearly about 750,000 people develop severe sepsis in the USA and probably the same amount in Europe. Total mortality for these patients is about 30&#8211;35%, however for those patients with persistent sepsis mortality is &gt;50%. Most patients with persistent sepsis develop multiple organ failure, a syndrome in which several organ systems are malfunctioning. In order for these patients to survive their vital organs need to be supported in the hospitals intensive care unit (ICU). Septic patients treated in the intensive care unit develop skeletal muscle dysfunction which is part of the multiple organ failure syndrome, and this persists after ICU discharge <xref rid="pone.0003686-Banwell1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0003686-Bolton1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0003686-DeJonghe1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0003686-Larsson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0003686-Care1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The nature of this muscle dysfunction includes weakness due to a severe loss of muscle mass and muscle fatigue which is most apparent during weaning of the mechanical ventilation and results in impaired physical capacity during the patient's protracted recovery process <xref rid="pone.0003686-Herridge1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In addition to the long term failure of skeletal muscle function, rapid degeneration in the ICU also impacts on patient acute energy metabolism and this directs the need for concurrent interventions, such as insulin and glucocorticoid therapy, which are principally aimed at improving patient survival <xref rid="pone.0003686-VandenBerghe1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In a previous study <xref rid="pone.0003686-Fredriksson1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> we demonstrated that mitochondrial content was 30&#8211;40% lower and cellular adenine nucleotide homeostasis disrupted (lower ATP and creatine phosphate concentrations) in skeletal muscle of ICU patients suffering from sepsis induced multiple organ failure (MOF).</p><p>Mitochondria are the major mechanism for ATP generation in humans and the observed lower mitochondrial content and cellular energy status will accelerate muscle fatigue and possibly cell death in these septic patients <xref rid="pone.0003686-Dudley1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0003686-Rooyackers1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0003686-Rooyackers2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Indeed, mitochondrial derangements and the subsequent disruption in energy metabolism are associated with multiple organ failure and an increased mortality in critically ill patients <xref rid="pone.0003686-Vanhorebeek1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0003686-Fink1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0003686-Brealey1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.

Mitochondrial protein synthesis and degradation have to be in equilibrium in order for the cell to maintain a constant number of well functioning mitochondria. In this study we hypothesize that the lower mitochondrial content, we found in skeletal muscle of septic patients, is caused by a lower mitochondrial protein synthesis and this would be regulated by lower mitochondrial gene expression. Thus, we examined <italic>in vivo</italic> mitochondrial protein synthesis in skeletal muscle of patients treated in the ICU for sepsis induced MOF and compared this to age matched control subjects. Targeted analysis of gene expression of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) enzymes (both nuclear and mitochondrial encoded), mitochondrial proteases and master transcriptional regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis presented us with a complex picture, where selective transcriptional activation of mitochondrial biogenesis was clearly evident. Finding clear evidence for disrupted coordination of mitochondrial gene expression led us to carryout a global analysis of skeletal muscle phenotype using microarray technology to determine the extent of altered muscle phenotype. Informatic analysis yielded profound evidence for degeneration and loss of muscle specific genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects</title><p>Seventeen patients admitted to the general Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge were included in the study.

Patients were septic according to the Bone criteria <xref rid="pone.0003686-Bone1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Patients younger than 18 years of age, patients with severe liver failure, undergoing dialysis, and patients with impaired coagulation were excluded from the study. As a control group 10 patients undergoing elective surgery at Ersta Hospital (Stockholm) were included. All patients or close relatives gave informed consent to participate in the study. The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 declaration of Helsinki and had received an a priori approval by the Ethical committee of Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden and local ethics approval for gene expression analysis at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, Scotland.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study protocol</title><p>In order to determine the mitochondrial protein synthesis rates an intravenous bolus injection of L- [<sup>2</sup>H<sub>5</sub>] phenylalanine was given to the patients over a period of 10 minutes (45 mg&#215;kg<sup>&#8722;1</sup> body weight, 10 atom% excess (APE)) <xref rid="pone.0003686-McNurlan1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

Muscle biopsies were obtained from the lateral portion of the vastus lateralis muscle, 10&#8211;20 cm above the knee, at 90 and 92 minutes after the bolus injection on the left and right leg respectively. The biopsies were obtained using a Bergstr&#246;m biopsy needle after local anaesthesia in the ICU patients and just after sedation in the control patients. The biopsies were divided into smaller portions, frozen into liquid nitrogen and stored at &#8722;80&#176;C until analysis.</p><p>The muscle biopsies were analyzed for <italic>in vivo</italic> mitochondrial protein synthesis rate, mitochondrial enzyme activities (citrate synthase and complex I and IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain) and a marker of oxidative stress capacity (Superoxide dismutase (SOD)). In addition, mRNA levels were measured using real time qPCR and Affymetrix micro-array analysis. From our previous study it is clear that the between-patient variation of the mitochondrial enzyme measurements is high, therefore measurements in the present study were carried out in both legs to further examine this issue. For the mRNA analyses limited material was available and therefore only one leg was studied in 24 patients (16 septic and 8 controls) for the qPCR and 21 patients (13 septic and 8 controls) for the micro-array analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Measurements of enzyme activities</title><p>Muscle samples were homogenized in a KCL buffer (100 mM KCl, 50 mM Tris/HCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.8 mM ATP and 1 mM EDTA) to obtain a 5% homogenate <xref rid="pone.0003686-Fredriksson1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0003686-Fredriksson2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.

The pellets were subsequently dissolved in 0.3 M NaOH and the protein concentrations of the samples were determined using a DC-protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The proteins were then precipitated and washed twice in 4% (w/v) SSA. The remaining pellets were hydrolyzed at 110&#176;C for 24 hours in 6 M HCl.

The dried protein hydrolysates were dissolved in 220 &#181;l of 0.5 M sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.3) and filtered through a 0.22 &#181;m centrifugal tube. Phenylalanine standards containing 0&#8211;0.114 APE (atom percent excess) were dissolved in the same amount of the sodium citrate buffer. Samples and standards were decarboxylated in L-tyrosine decarboxylase to convert phenylalanine into phenylethylamine at 50&#176;C over night. Subsequently, 100 &#181;l of 6 M NaOH was added and after centrifugation at 16,000&#215;g, the samples were extracted in ether and then in 0.1 M HCl and dried. The samples were derivatized in 25 &#181;l MTBSTFA [N-methyl-N-(t-butyldimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide]/ethyl acetate(1/1, v/v) at 60&#176;C for 1 hour. The ratio of [<sup>2</sup>H<sub>5</sub>]-phenylethylamine and phenylethylamine was determined by GC-MS (Agilent 5973n; Agilent technologies, Stockholm, Sweden). Ions m/z 180 (m+2) and m/z 183 (m+5) were analyzed.

The nuclear encoded subunits of mitochondrial enzymes citrate synthase (CS var1 and 2), complex IV (COXIV) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDHA) were measured. For the mitochondrial-encoded genes, subunits of complex I (mtND4, mtND6) and complex IV (mtCO1) and cytochrome B (mtCYB) were measured. In addition, transcription factors NRF-1 and NRF-2&#945;/GABP as well as coactivators PGC-1&#945; and -1&#946; were quantified. These transcriptional regulators control the expression of nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins. To further examine factors which directly regulate mtDNA encoded genes, we determined TFAM, TFB1M and TFB2M expression. In addition, given our previous data, we quantified several mitochondrial protease genes, two that are part of the AAA proteases family and located in the inner membrane of the mitochondria (YME1L1 and SPG7/paraplegin) and two located in the mitochondrial matrix (LON and CLPP).</p><p>Total RNA was isolated from muscle samples using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Stockholm, Sweden) and quantified using a Nano-drop spectrophotometer. cDNA was prepared from 1 &#181;g of RNA using random hexamer primers and reverse transcription reagents (Applied biosystems) in a final volume of 40 &#181;l. Gene expression was quantified in triplicates as previously described <xref rid="pone.0003686-Timmons1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Oligonucleotide primers were designed using a primer design centre (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.probelibrary.com/">http://www.probelibrary.com/</ext-link>) and synthesized by Invitrogen (Stockholm, Sweden). To avoid amplification of nuclear DNA the primers were designed to amplify across exon-exon boundaries. Mitochondrial DNA contamination can not be excluded using this procedure and a &#8216;contamination test&#8217; was therefore performed. Total RNA was utilized instead of cDNA using primers towards a mitochondrial-encoded gene (MTCO1) and the resulting amplification plot was used to indicate the amount of mtDNA contamination. The mtDNA contamination was negligible (less than 3%) and thus had no impact on the analysis. The delta C<sub>T</sub> (cycle threshold) values, calculated based on correction to 18sRNA, were calculated for each sample and statistical analysis was applied to this raw data. The linear value of each patient was then compared to the mean of all the control values to get an estimate of the mean increase/decrease and the variation between the samples.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Affymetrix Microarray</title><p>Hybridization, washing, staining and scanning of the arrays were performed according to manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix, Inc. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.affymetrix.com/">http://www.affymetrix.com/</ext-link>). The Array design can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.affymetrix.com">https://www.affymetrix.com</ext-link>. We utilized the Affymetrix U133+2 array platform with RNA preparations. Data presented in the paper was quality controlled using the Microarray Suite software (MAS 5.0). All array data were normalized through implementations of the MAS5 algorithm, to a global scaling intensity of 100. As a mean to control the quality of the individual arrays, all arrays were examined using hierarchical clustering to identify outliers prior to statistical analysis in addition to the standard quality assessments including scaling factors and housekeeper 5&#8242;/3&#8242; ratios. No array failed these standard quality assessment procedures although patient 9 was a clear &#8216;outlier&#8217;. Nevertheless, patient 9 did not influence the global gene expression analysis, while for the qPCr analysis (using a separate RNA/Analysis technology) patient 9 did demonstrate the highest expression value for NRF2 (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">results</xref>) indicating that this patient's gene expression status was genuinely altered to a much greater extent.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Array analysis strategies</title><p>We have previously demonstrated that it can be difficult to predict the impact of applying arbitrary filtering criteria prior to statistical analysis <xref rid="pone.0003686-Larsson2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. We therefore relied on several statistical models to present, analyze and interpret our data with and without arbitrary pre-filtering of gene lists. The microarray data was subjected to global normalization using the Robust Multi-Array Average expression measure (RMA) Bioconductor (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioconductor.org">www.bioconductor.org</ext-link>) and the output compared with MAS5.0. On this occasion 90% of RMA identified genes were found in the MAS5 data set while analysis of the smaller RMA data set provided a very similar result (in terms of Gene ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes). Thus, we used MAS5.0 for the remaining analysis as the point of array analysis is to generate a large yet robust data set. There is some argument that using the MAS5.0 generated present-absent calls can improve the sensitivity of the differential gene expression analysis <xref rid="pone.0003686-Choe1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. We chose to remove probe sets where they were declared &#8216;absent&#8217; across all chips. The normalized log2-file was analyzed with the Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) in R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM/">http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM/</ext-link>). SAM provides a list of &#8220;significant&#8221; genes and attempts to estimate of the false discovery rate (FDR), which represents the percentage of genes that could be identified by chance. SAM assign a score to each gene/probe set as an index of relative difference between groups. For the data presented in the manuscript, genes were considered significantly changed in ICU patients, when a delta value corresponding to the number of false significant genes of 5% (q-value), and an average fold change of 2, was achieved. For the pathway analysis a stricter statistical cut-off was utilized (1% FDR), while presented pathways were colored by 1.5 FC and 5% FDR so that the robust trends within pathways could be visualized. Finally, due to lack of sufficient RNA please note we did not profile the two patients with the very high protein synthesis rates on Affymetrix arrays and thus these patients did not drive nor inform the array analysis.</p><p>We used the web-based bioinformatics tool, Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ingenuity.com">http://www.ingenuity.com</ext-link>), which is based on &gt;1.7 Million published articles, to discover networks regulated in the skeletal muscle of ICU patients, compared with age matched controls. IPA is a knowledge database generated from the peer-reviewed scientific publications that enables discovery of biological networks in gene expression data, determining the functions most significant to those networks. Gene name identifiers or Affymetrix probe set ID's were uploaded into IPA and queried against all other genes stored in the IPA knowledge database. Each Affymetrix probe set ID was mapped to its corresponding gene identifier in the IPA knowledge database. Probe sets representing genes having direct interactions with genes in the IPA knowledge database are called &#8220;focus&#8221; genes, which were then used as a starting point for generating functional networks. Each generated network is assigned a score according to the number of differentially regulated focus genes in our dataset. These scores are derived from negative logarithm of the <italic>P</italic> indicative of the likelihood that focus genes found together in a network due to random chance. Scores of 14 or higher have 99.9% confidence level of significance. In reporting our findings we focus on networks with a substantially higher confidence limit and thus represent strong evidence for a given biological pathway being activated in ICU patients. It should be noted however that while the database extends the interpretation beyond mRNA transcript levels (as network genes don't have to be differentially expressed at the mRNA level) the database is finite and reflects current knowledge.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Detection of microRNA hsa-mir-21 expression by using real-time PCR</title><p>MicroRNA expression was analysed using the Taqman&#174; MicroRNA assays developed by Applied Biosystems that detects mature miRNA.

None of the mitochondrial and nuclear genes, encoding for mitochondrial related enzymes were significantly different between patients and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003686-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Further, while there was greater variation for the mtDNA-encoded genes than for the nuclear encoded oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes the tendency was for up regulation. Assembly of mitochondria networks involves hundreds of gene products and while OXPHOS related mRNA expression may have been stable in patients, disruption of regulators of mitochondrial organelle/network formation could also result in loss of function. Surprisingly, the proposed master regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis; NRF1, PGC1&#945; and PGC1&#946; were unchanged, however NRF2&#945;/GABP expression was 67% higher in the septic patients (p&#8202;=&#8202;0.0163; t-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003686-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Convincingly, the mtDNA regulating factors TFAM, TFB1M and TFB2M were all increased significantly (by 109, 108 and 72% respectively) and these nuclear encoded genes are regulated by NRF2&#945;/GABP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003686-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Thus while we clearly demonstrated decreased mitochondrial enzyme activities, this was not due to lack of mRNA coding for OXPHOS proteins. Rather, increased expression of several of the transcriptional regulators of biogenesis suggests that there was a clear yet partially effective stimulus for mitochondrial biogenesis. This did not, however, result in an increased synthesis of mitochondria but rather only selective activation of NRF2&#945;/GABP and NRF2&#945;/GABP target genes. However, the ICU patients were treated with insulin therapy to overcome hyperglycemia <xref rid="pone.0003686-VandenBerghe1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and experimental hyperinsulinaemia has been shown to increase the expression of some oxidative phosphorylation genes <xref rid="pone.0003686-Stump1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. It therefore occurred to us that the insulin therapy may be responsible for alterations in NRF2&#945;/GABP and that such changes were not specific to MOF. We analysed the response of NRF2&#945;/GABP to exogenous insulin <italic>in vivo</italic> in humans and using a muscle cell line model. First we examined the expression of NRF2&#945;/GABP in the C2C12 muscle cell line, exposed to supra-physiological levels of insulin and we could not detect any induction of NRF2&#945;/GABP expression or its target genes TFB1M and TFB2M (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003686.s001">Figure S1</xref>), suggesting that increased NRF2&#945;/GABP and NRF2&#945;/GABP target gene expression in the ICU patients was not a consequence of the insulin therapy but rather some more specific response to altered mitochondrial function. We also observed a reduction in PGC1&#945; mRNA in insulin treated C2C12 cells, consistent with the <italic>in vivo</italic> study by Southgate et al <xref rid="pone.0003686-Southgate1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In addition, to verify that insulin would not increase NRF2&#945;/GABP <italic>in vivo</italic> we utilised RNA derived from a previously published <xref rid="pone.0003686-Stephens1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> hyperinsulineamia clamp study in healthy volunteers (5 hrs, 149.2+/&#8722;6.9 mIU&#215;l<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) and we found that NRF2&#945;/GABP and PGC1&#945; mRNA expression was unaltered compared with control (data not shown). It appears unlikely that the robust activation of NRF2&#945;/GABP and target genes in ICU patients reflects the insulin therapy. Connectivity analysis was carried out using NRF2&#945; (GABPA and GABPB) and Affymetrix data (See below) further illustrates the response of some NRF2&#945;/GABP related genes (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003686.s002">Figure S2</xref>). We also evaluated if mitochondrial located proteases were activated. Genes encoding for the mitochondrial proteases LON and CLPP demonstrated an increase in the patients compared to controls of 48 and 39% respectively (P&#8202;=&#8202;0.0029 and 0.0166 respectively; t-test) while the AAA metalloprotease subunits paraplegin (SPG7) and YME1L1 genes did not differ between the patients and controls. These results support the idea that in muscle of patients with sepsis, deregulated mitochondrial biogenesis may promote mitochondrial proteases expression to cope with failure in coordinated protein formation. However, the substantial loss of skeletal muscle mitochondrial content appears disproportionate compared with the global yet incomplete activation of biogenesis (See below) and thus it was important to identify the molecular signals coordinating these gross alterations in muscle phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Affymetrix analysis of ICU patient skeletal muscle shows a large number of genes that are differentially expressed, with the majority up regulated</title><p>To establish a more global analysis of muscle phenotype we subjected the muscle samples to Affymetrix gene array analysis followed by our comparative array analysis strategy <xref rid="pone.0003686-Timmons2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0003686-Timmons3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The data discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE13205 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?accGSE13205">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?accGSE13205</ext-link>). The micro-array analyses were initially used to obtain a more global picture of the mitochondrial genes in skeletal muscle during sepsis. In addition, this allowed us to generate a detailed picture of ICU patient muscle status and also facilitated a direct comparison with various animal models which have been developed to study muscle wasting and inflammation <xref rid="pone.0003686-Lecker1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0003686-Sacheck1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> to aid future drug discovery efforts. This later analysis allows us to infer associations between changes in patient muscle with specific programmes activated by muscle wasting or muscle disuse - data that would otherwise not be possible to generate, given the critical status of such individuals. This enormously valuable analysis should also help further validate these animal models for drug target validation purposes.</p><p>We found that 2080 probe sets (corresponding to 1457 unique genes/identifiers) were up-regulated in ICU patients, compared with control subjects (&gt;2 fold change with a 5% FDR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003686.s006">Supplemental data sheet S1</xref>). We found fewer down regulated genes, with 783 significant probe sets representing 525 unique genes/identifiers (&gt;2 fold change with a 5% FDR). Examination of the Affymetrix expression data allowed us to take a more global view on the regulation of <italic>mitochondrial</italic> gene expression. From a list of 342 genes annotated as being &#8216;mitochondrial&#8217; on the U133+2 micro-array chip, expression of 82 genes were regulated in muscle of the septic patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003686.s007">Supplemental data sheet S2</xref>). Of these 82 genes, only 8 were down regulated and remarkably 74 were up regulated. From the down regulated genes only one was a specific component of the OXPHOS machinery (NADH dehydrogenase 1 subunit C1). Within the up regulated genes, the largest change observed was for the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase gene, with a 16-fold increased expression. This result is remarkably consistent with the increased activity of the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase protein activity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003686-t002">Table 2</xref>). Thus analysis of the mitochondrial gene responses, as detected using the Affymetrix platform, strongly supports our conclusion that activation of many but not all mitochondrial genes occurred; a potentially adaptive, yet clearly ineffective, reponse at maintaining mitochondrial capacity.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Gene ontology analysis of Affymetrix analysis identifies broad molecular programmes activated in ICU patient skeletal muscle</title><p>To capture a broad assessment of the molecular processes represented by the &#8764;2000 modulated genes, we utilised gene ontology (GO) analysis <xref rid="pone.0003686-Hosack1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. We found that regulation of apoptosis, proteosome function, ion homeostasis and kinase signalling were modulated and these appeared to us as rather predictable findings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003686.s006">Supplemental data sheet S1</xref>). Gene ontology analysis of the down regulated list indicated that there was a dramatic loss of unique muscle related gene expression demonstrating that the patient muscle tissue was undergoing a de-differentiation process. Down regulated genes also indicated a loss of expression of numerous extracellular matrix gene ontology groups, which are known to be central to skeletal muscle remodelling and gain in physiological capacity <xref rid="pone.0003686-Timmons2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0003686-Timmons4" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Thus, despite the lack of change in global protein synthesis, the types of protein being synthesised are most probably extremely different in the skeletal muscle of ICU patients.</p><p>As we wish to intervene to prevent the loss of muscle tissue function, it is important to determine which biological pathways were regulating this shift in muscle phenotype.

It also facilitates discussion of the utility of such models and whether they accurately represent human muscle wasting disorders. Secondly, we utilised Ingenuity pathway analysis to establish which signalling processes or unique gene-networks may be coordinating the altered tissue phenotype (Ingenuity IPA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ingenuity.com">http://www.ingenuity.com</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Altered atrogen expression, described in catabolic animal models, are similar in the septic patients, except for the energy metabolism genes</title><p>In two recent publications, common genes up regulated or down regulated in animal models with muscle wasting have been identified <xref rid="pone.0003686-Lecker1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0003686-Sacheck1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.

Pathway analysis revealed that the animal model atrogens formed several networks, of which estradiol was highlighted as a molecular regulator (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003686.s008">Supplemental Figure S3</xref>). In support of this novel re-analysis of the data from the Goldberg laboratory, it has been demonstrated that estrogen status regulates muscle recovery from atrophy <xref rid="pone.0003686-McClung1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and in the ICU patients ERS1 (estrogen receptor 1) was 3-fold down regulated.

The ICU patients displayed a variable and non-significant 50% increase in the mature mir-21 expression levels (p&#8202;=&#8202;0.13), see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003686-g004">Figure 4</xref> insert, contrasting with the primary transcript. This suggests to us that suppressed microRNA processing or export may be occurring, representing a plausible mechanism explaining global loss of coordinated muscle gene expression and thus worthy of further investigation. This is especially plausible as Gene ontology analysis of the predicted targets of mir-21 suggest it should inhibit genes involved in ubiquitin ligase and JAK-STAT activity, both which were processes shown to be significantly up regulated in the transcriptomes of the patients.

While some mitochondrial enzymes activities were 25&#8211;49% lower in skeletal muscle of patients treated in the ICU for sepsis induced multiple organ failure in comparison with a control group of similar age it was abundantly clear that this was not due to either a global reduction in mitochondrial gene transcripts or to impaired <italic>in vivo</italic> total mitochondrial protein synthesis. Our initial analysis demonstrated a selective activation of NRF2&#945;/GABP and its target genes suggesting partial activation of mitochondrial biogenesis, while global analysis of 342 mitochondrial genes supported this interpretation. Comparative array analysis discovered that while many atrophy and inflammation responses are conserved across species, the metabolic gene responses in rodent models do not represent a response seen in ICU patients. This is particularly important, as gene expression profiling without consideration of physiological context can produce misleading conclusions <xref rid="pone.0003686-Timmons2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.

However, neither appears to be true. Firstly, the <italic>in vivo</italic> mitochondrial protein synthesis in the septic ICU patients was not different from that in the control subjects, indicating that sufficient mRNA template existed for translation. Secondly, targeted qPCR analysis demonstrated that the expression of several nuclear encoded oxidative phosphorylation genes did not differ between the groups, while there was a trend for up-regulation of mtDNA encoded oxidative phosphorylation genes and global analysis identified &gt;80 modestly up regulated nuclear encoded mitochondrial related genes. Critically, this pattern of gene expression differs markedly from muscle unloading in humans <xref rid="pone.0003686-Timmons1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and from animal models of atrophy-sepsis, indicating that our findings are not driven by inactivity nor are they adequately represented by preclinical models. These results indicate for the first time, that the observed lower mitochondrial content in muscle of septic ICU patients with multiple organ failure is not due to a general decrease in mitochondrial gene expression or failure in the protein synthesis process.</p><p>The balance between the biogenesis pathways and the rate of mitochondrial protein degradation regulates tissue mitochondrial content.

The nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins are regulated by NRF1, NRF2&#945;/GABP as well as PGC1&#945; and &#946;, while mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription is greatly influenced by TFAM, TFB1M and TFB2M <xref rid="pone.0003686-Gleyzer1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0003686-Falkenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>.

We also determined that the selective activation of NRF2&#945;/GABP was unlikely to be caused by exogenous insulin. The inability of mitochondrial protein synthesis to sustain mitochondrial capacity may therefore reflect a lack of coordinated expression of all the transcription factors needed for an increased mitochondrial biogenesis. The reason for the lack of coordinated increase in mitochondrial biogenesis genes in these patients needs to be elucidated and may ultimately be manipulated to improve patient outcome.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Regulation of protein synthesis and potential alterations in microRNA processing</title><p>It has previously been reported that mitochondrial protein synthesis and gene expression are decreased in septic rats <xref rid="pone.0003686-Rooyackers2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0003686-Callahan1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Like our present comparative analysis, this supports the idea that rodent models may be inappropriate for studying mitochondrial dynamics. The unchanged mitochondrial protein synthesis rates are in line with the synthesis rates of other muscle proteins in the septic ICU patients. The very characteristic loss of total muscle protein in these patients is also accompanied by normal synthesis rates of total muscle protein <xref rid="pone.0003686-Tjader1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> while our transcriptomics indicates that the actual proteins being made, will clearly be substantially different from control skeletal muscle.

While the partners of EIF4E, EIF4A1 (Helicase), EIF4G1 (scaffold protein) and EIF3S10 were all up-regulated in the ICU patients, EIF4E is unchanged at the mRNA level. In combination with the increased expression of the tRNA synthetases, MARS, LARS and RARS it would appear that a substantial yet incomplete attempt was made to promote muscle protein synthesis, similar to that observed for the mitochondria. This appears to have failed perhaps reflecting a lack of up-regulation of EIF4E, however, EIF4E is not considered to be regulated to a great extent, at the mRNA level <xref rid="pone.0003686-Richter1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, and thus further analysis is merited. Overall, it is clear that the lack of gross changes in <italic>in vivo</italic> protein dynamics must obscure critical alterations in specific protein formation, such that combing protein measurements with global transcriptomics provides a powerful solution to understanding the nature of tissue remodelling in multiple organ failure patients.</p><p>When looking for novel regulators of altered protein production from mRNA, microRNA's as global regulators of protein synthesis are of great interest <xref rid="pone.0003686-Filipowicz1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. In the ICU patients, we found a compelling 500% increase in the precursor for mir-21 (pri-mir-21). When we measured the mature form of mir-21, we observed no significant change in mir-21 levels (50% increase, p&#8202;=&#8202;0.13) in skeletal muscle of ICU patients when compared with controls. This is important as it has been recently identified that reduction in PTEN expression could be a compensatory mechanism to prevent muscle protein degradation <xref rid="pone.0003686-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref> and mir-21 is a validated target of PTEN <xref rid="pone.0003686-Meng1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. Mature mir-21 is processed from a 3,433 long nucleotide pri-mir-21 <xref rid="pone.0003686-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. Thus, despite the substantial increase in the mir-21 precursor, only modest changes in mature miRNA occurred.</p><p>Interestingly, IL-6 is activated in ICU patients <xref rid="pone.0003686-Leonidou1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> and has been reported to increase mir-21 in tumour cell lines mediated via STAT3 <xref rid="pone.0003686-Hennig1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. The IL-6 receptor increases in skeletal muscle in response to both acute <xref rid="pone.0003686-Keller1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref> and chronic <xref rid="pone.0003686-Keller2" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref> stimuli, suggesting an increased responsiveness to IL-6. We detected a 10-fold increase in the IL-6 receptor in skeletal muscle of ICU patients, when compared with healthy controls, along with a 1.8-fold increase in STAT-3, the intracellular mediator of IL-6 signalling. This suggests an increased sensitivity to IL-6 and an increased IL-6 response in the ICU patients and this may explain the substantial increase in transcription of the precursor for mir-21. Whether global processing of microRNA's has been disrupted in ICU patients merits further analysis. It would appear, from this initial analysis, that there is substantial transcriptional drive to promote mir-21 expression, while some aspect of the miRNA biogenesis pathway limits substantial production of this translational blocking RNA species.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Clinical impact for the patient</title><p>The loss of muscle mass and function has a profound affect on mortality and morbidity, not only in the septic ICU patients included in this study but also in other diseases with more chronic muscle wasting e.g. cancer, kidney failure and COPD. In the septic patients the loss of muscle mass as well as mitochondrial content are not due to an overall decrease in their synthesis rates. A obvious conclusion from this is that the losses are driven by increased degradation and that therapeutic aims should be focussed on modulating inappropriate degradation. However the present data suggest that a different spectrum of protein will be synthesised in these patients, and this implies that the precise profile of proteins being synthesised is altered and thus targeting protein degradation is not necessarily a logical strategy.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>A potential limitation of the present study is the heterogeneity of the included patients. Patients were included at different days of ICU treatment (range from 1&#8211;42 days). It is possible that the mitochondrial derangements are different at different phases of disease. However, it is not certain that the duration of ICU stay represents different phases of the disease. Often patients treated in the ICU have been ill for a while before, whereas others arrive to the ICU early after the initial insult. It is therefore difficult to see length of ICU stay as a measure of time of disease. However when the patient with a shorter ICU stay (&lt;6 days) were compared with those with a longer stay (&#8805;6 days) no significant difference were observed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003686-t003">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003686-t004">4</xref>). Also post-hoc analyses not including the 2 patients with extreme long ICU treatment (35 and 42 days) showed exactly the same changes in comparison with the controls as when including all patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003686-t003">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003686-t004">4</xref>).

We tried to include a patient population with severe sepsis/septic shock induced multiple organ failure. Patients not recovering from an initial sepsis develop multiple organ failure requiring ICU treatment. The patients we included were not in their septic shock anymore and had developed multiple organ failure making them rather comparable. However a few patients with SOFA scores below 3 were included not fulfilling the criteria for multiple organ failure. Again post-hoc analyses comparing the ICU patients with SOFA score over 3 with the controls gave exactly the same changes and conclusions as before (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003686-t003">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003686-t004">4</xref>). These post-hoc analyses show that this apparently heterogeneous group of ICU patients behave rather consistent with regard to mitochondrial changes and gene expression in skeletal muscle. Another possible confounding factor is the different treatments that the patients receive. When performing studies in actual ICU patients we are dealing with reality and this can not be changed for clinical reasons. Treatment with corticosteroids is the one most discussed in relation to muscle dysfunction. However when we compared the micro-array changes in our patients with the changes induced with methylprednisole treatment in rats only a 1&#8211;2% of the ICU regulated genes were affected in both the patients and the rat model <xref rid="pone.0003686-Almon1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>, indicating that corticosteroid treatment in the ICU patients contributes little to the observed changes. However affects of other treatments can not be excluded.</p><p>Another limitation of the study is the isolation of mitochondria done for measuring the enzyme activities and the synthesis rates of mitochondrial protein. The sequential centrifugations used to isolate the mitochondria mainly isolate intact mitochondria and not the damaged mitochondria. Also this procedure isolated mainly the subsarcolemmal mitochondria from skeletal muscle and not the intramyofibrillar mitochondria. So when measuring the enzyme activities in the isolated mitochondria this represents mainly intact subsarcolemmal mitochondria. This selection of one subpopulation of the mitochondria is most likely also the explanation for the different values obtained for complex I and IV activities expressed per citrate synthase activity in the whole muscle and the isolated mitochondria. Also the increased complex IV activity in the isolated mitochondria and not in the whole muscle could be explained by this. Both the fractional synthesis rates of the mitochondria and the mitochondrial SOD activity can not be measured differently than in the isolated mitochondria. It is possible that the synthesis rates in the non-isolated mitochondria are decreased in the patients. However the gene expression data (both from the qPCR analyses and the micro-array) do support a normal synthesis as measured in the isolated mitochondria.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrated that while the skeletal muscle of septic ICU patients with multiple organ failure have reduced mitochondrial content, this is not associated with a gross failure in biogenesis of mitochondria since both <italic>in vivo</italic> protein synthesis and mitochondrial related mRNA abundance were sustained. However, loss of coordination of key elements of mitochondrial biogenesis was apparent, such that maturation of mitochondrial and mitochondrial networks may have still been compromised, resulting in activation of some specific mitochondrial matrix proteases. Further, in this first ever analysis of the global transcriptional responses in ICU patients, we find a substantial loss of muscle specific genes, a global oxidative stress response related to most probably cytokine signalling, altered insulin related signalling and a substantial overlap between patients and muscle wasting/inflammatory animal models. Failure to process mir-21 may have contributed to the activation of these signalling pathways, while such impairment hints at a wider problem with miRNA formation and hence control of tissue phenotype. Finally, we were able to demonstrate that the phenotype of skeletal muscle in ICU patients is not merely one of inactivity, it appears to be an actively remodelling tissue, influenced by several mediators, all of which may be open to manipulation with the aim to improve clinical outcome</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0003686.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Expression of mitochondrial transcription factors in C2C12 cells with and without insulin.

Blue/Red hybrids are genes identified in the data base where the protein is actually at least two different genes and 1 sub-unit is down, while the other is up.</p><p>(0.83 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0003686.s005.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0003686.s006"><label>Supplemental data sheet S1</label><caption><p>SAM results</p><p>(3.61 MB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0003686.s006.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0003686.s007"><label>Supplemental data sheet S2</label><caption><p>Expression of mitochondrial genes from the micro-aray analysis.</p><p>(0.09 MB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0003686.s007.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0003686.s008"><label>Supplemental data sheet S3</label><caption><p>Comparison of expression of atrogens identified in muscle of catabolic and disuse animal models (common to all models) and septic patients.</p><p>(0.05 MB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0003686.s008.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0003686.s009"><label>Supplemental data sheet S4</label><caption><p>Gene network lists.</p><p>(0.10 MB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0003686.s009.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0003686.s010"><label>Supplemental data sheet S5</label><caption><p>Canonical Network lists.</p><p>(0.06 MB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0003686.s010.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the excellent nursing skills of Viveka Gustavsson at Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Nina Johansson, Ann-Sofie Andersson and Ami Bylund at Ersta Hospital.
