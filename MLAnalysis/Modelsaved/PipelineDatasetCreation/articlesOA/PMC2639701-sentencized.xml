<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>16S rDNA gene sequencing is often used as an alternative method to define microbes at species level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Protein coding genes having high variability has been successfully used to differentiate taxa that cannot be identified solely on the basis of 16S rDNA sequences e.g., heat shock protein (hsp65) [3], hsp70, ATPase-ß-subunit, RNA polymerases and recombinase (recA) [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In addition, partial rpoB sequences have been applied to classify members of the genus Mycobacterium [3], [5]; gyrB gene sequences have been used to define Acinetobacter members [6]; Mycobacterium [7]; Pseudomonas [8] and Shewanella [9], gyrA gene for defining Bacillus subtilis and related taxa [10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Members of the genus Bacillus comprise gram-positive, spore-forming, rod-shaped, aerobic bacteria. Bacillus species are phenotypically and genotypically heterogenous [11], [12]. Bacillus represents microbes of high economic, medical and biodefense importance such as bio-pesticides [13] and biofuels [14]–[16], pathogens [17], [18]. Bacillus thuringiensis is currently used for the biological control of insects and in crop protection [19]. B. subtilis strains produce a broad spectrum of bioactive peptides with great potential for biotechnological and biopharmaceutical applications [20]. Bacillus licheniformis strains also produce a variety of peptide antibiotics such as bacitracin [21], [22], bacteriocin [23] and are also known to contaminate industrial processes [24]–[26] and cause food poisoning [27], [28]. Bacillus spores are being used as human and animal probiotics despite the fact that studies now indicate extensive mislabeling of constituent Bacillus strains [29], [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is becoming increasingly clear that a more rigorous selection process is required for Bacillus probiotic candidates [31], [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Because of these divergent characteristics, questions arise concerning intra species diversity that could differentiate isolates of potential economic importance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>It is for these reasons that 11 closely related Bacillus are among the 29 Bacillales sequenced so far (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Bacterial systematics began long before the discovery of DNA as the heritable material. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Bacteria were originally classified largely on the basis of phenotype, morphology, ecology and other associated metabolic characteristics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Bacterial taxonomy has been a tedious, esoteric and uncertain discipline. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Some excitement was brought in by the team led by Dr. Carl Woese. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>They provided a detailed insight into bacterial phylogeny by exploiting molecular biology in an innovative manner [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Genomic discoveries are posing a challenge to the classical bacterial systematics [34]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The most common molecular ecological techniques applied to assess the bacterial diversity and to analyze the genetic relationships between Bacillus species are based on genome fingerprinting [34]; DNA-DNA re-association studies [35], [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Rep-PCR has been shown to be a useful technique in the subtyping of Bacillus species [37], [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, protein coding genes such as gyrA and rpoB exhibit much higher genetic variation and have been used for the classification of closely related taxa within the B. subtilis group [10], [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The highly discriminating power of these genes has also been used to assess intraspecies diversity of B. licheniformis [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In general, 16S rDNA sequences are used in bacterial classification as a frame work for species delineation e.g., in Bacillus [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The genetic relationship and the phylogeny among organisms are analysed on the basis of molecular chronometer, the ribosomal operon, especially the 16S and 23S rDNA genes [42], [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Since these genes are much conserved among microbes, they cannot be used to unambiguously discriminate at the species level [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>With respect to the ribosomal genes, the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) between the 16S and 23S rDNA genes are hypervariable and can display polymorphisms especially in regions not implicated in rDNA maturation [43]–[48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Several species resembling Bacillus species have been described but these new species cannot be phenotypically differentiated from the bona fide members. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Recent advances in the areas of genomics and proteomics have provided excellent opportunities to exploit genome sequence databases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Since the beginning of the genomic era the phylogenetic relationships among bacteria has been done on the basis of 16S rDNA gene Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP), such as for Streptococcus aeruginosa and S. adjacens [49]; Pseudomonas aeruginosa [50]; Borrelia [51]; Lactobacillus [52]; Helicobacter [53] and Bacillus [54]. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Species demarcation of some Bacillus isolates is quite complex, since many isolates don't provide characteristic reactions that are considered typical of that species [62], [63]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Although diversity identification is based on the use of a range of different morpho-physiological and chemical parameters as well as genetic analysis to tentatively identify the isolates to the species level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>For example, the API system only allows the identification of 19 of the best identified and most common species and therefore fails to identify a number of isolates [31]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The various studies have emphasized the need to reclassify certain species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Ash et al., [42] analysed 51 species of Bacillus and found that they fell into five distinct grouping based on 16S rDNA sequences, which they believed, “clearly represent separate genera”. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>A few of the sporulating aerobes proved to be sequenced outliers, which might represent the nuclei of other hitherto unrecognized genera. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>This marked the beginning of a new era in the reorganization for the genus Bacillus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>It is so far a continuous process, since several new genera have been defined from organisms previously known as Bacillus [64]: Alicyclobacillus, Aneurinibacillus, Brevibacillus, Geobacillus, Gracibacillus, Paenibacillus, Salibacillus, Ureibacillus and Virgibacillus. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Three species of the Bacillus cereus group (B. cereus, Bacillus anthracis and B. thuringiensis) have a marked impact on human activity. B. cereus and B. anthracis are important pathogens of mammals, including humans, and B. thuringiensis is extensively used in the biological control of insects [68]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>In B. cereus group the chromosomes of the sequenced members are extremely similar. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>The number of genes unique to one species is quite limited and often represents metabolic adaptations [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Although B. anthracis can be distinguished from B. cereus on the basis of biochemical tests [69], however, certain isolates on the periphery such as the pathogenic B. cereus G9241 [70] cannot be properly classified unless it is checked for the plasmid pX01, which is native to B. anthracis [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Since comparisons of chromosomal contents are not able to easily distinguish different members of B. cereus group - B. cereus, B. anthracis and B. thuringiensis, one may have to look for some more easily recognizable markers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Based on the phylogenetic homogeneity, 86 strains of B. thuringiensis could be closely clustered together in four different groups (Bt group I-IV) at a DNA similarity rate of 93% [54]. B. thuringiensis is closely related to B. anthracis and Bacillus mycoides and is regarded as a subvariant of B. cereus based on genotypic data [12], [71], [72]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Demonstration of the high genetic relatedness of B. thuringiensis, B. anthracis and B. cereus has led to the suggestion, that these are members of a single species of B. cereus sensu lato [48], [72], [73]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Overall genetic studies have shown that B. cereus and B. thuringiensis are essentially identical [74]. B. anthracis can be distinguished from B. cereus and B. thuringiensis through microbiological and biochemical tests. B. anthracis isolates are non-hemolytic, non-motile, penicillin sensitive, susceptible to γ-phage and produce a poly-γ-D-glutamic acid capsule [70]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The classification and taxonomic separation of members of B. cereus group is rather difficult even with modern molecular tools. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Analysis of large culture collections of B. cereus, B. anthracis and B. thuringiensis by AFLP and MLST [70], [75], [76] have identified a class of organisms containing toxigenic B. cereus and B. thuringiensis that are closely related to B. anthracis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>These isolates were phylogenetically distinct from environmental B. cereus and B. thuringiensis [75] and might represent the closest ancestor B. anthracis. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Presently, the difficult part lies in confirming the significance of the sequence clusters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Such organisms have almost identical 16S rDNA sequences (99.2 to 99.6% sequence similarity) [42], [77]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Comparative sequence analysis for the gyrA gene, which codes for DNA gyrase subunit A of 7 representatives of B. subtilis and allied taxa provided a frame work for their rapid and accurate classification and identification [10], [65] divided B. subtilis in to two subspecies, namely B. subtilis subsp. subtilis and B. subtilis subsp. spizizenii on the basis of cell wall chemistry and DNA-DNA relatedness data. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Recent taxonomic studies indicate that B. licheniformis is closely related to Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and B. subtilis on the basis of comparisons of 16S rDNA and 16S–23S ITS nucleotide sequence Lapidus et al., [81] and Xu and Cote [82] recently constructed a physical map of the B. licheniformis chromosome using a PCR approach and established a number of regions of co-linearity where gene content and organization were conserved with the B. subtilis genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>The close relationship between B. licheniformis and B. halodurans compared to B. subtilis has been shown on the basis of i) replication terminator protein (rtp), which is lacking in B. licheniformis [80] and B. halodurans [83]; ii) putative transposase of B. licheniformis shows close relation to B. halodurans [80], [83]; iii) the 27 predicted extracellular proteins encoded by B. licheniformis ATCC 14580 genome that are not found in B. subtilis 168 [80]; iv) two gene clusters involved in cellulose degradation and utilization were discovered in B. licheniformis and there are no counterparts in B. subtilis 168. </plain></SENT>
