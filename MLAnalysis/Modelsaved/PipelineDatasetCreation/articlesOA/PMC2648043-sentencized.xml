</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pancreatic beta cells are essential for rapid and precisely controlled responses to changes in blood glucose levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Disturbance of their function leads to diabetes mellitus, a disease characterized by hyperglycemia and several other complications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Given that diabetes affects millions of people worldwide, recent research efforts have focused on devising cell-based strategies to promote beta cell survival and function, for either organ regenerative purposes or islet transplantation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>One such research focus is the extracellular matrix (ECM) and their receptors, the integrins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In addition to controlling morphogenetic decisions during development, maintaining homeostasis and providing a physical basis for the spatial organization of cells (Thiery et al. 2003), integrin-ECM interactions influence a variety of cellular behaviours including growth, differentiation and function (Boudreau and Jones 1999; Bouvard et al. 2001; Brakebusch and Fassler 2005; Coppolino and Dedhar 1999; Danen and Sonnenberg 2003; French-Constant and Colognato 2004; Juliano et al. 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A family of glycoproteins, integrins are composed of individual α and β subunits which non-covalently link to form distinct heterodimeric receptors (Berman et al. 2003; Boudreau and Jones 1999; Coppolino and Dedhar 1999; Danen and Sonnenberg 2003; Lee and Juliano 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Their unique bi-directional signaling properties enable them to integrate exterior and interior environments of a cell and, thus, they influence a plethora of cellular processes including changes in migration, differentiation, proliferation and gene expression (Berman et al. 2003; Boudreau and Jones 1999; Bouvard et al. 2001; Brakebusch and Fassler 2005; Coppolino and Dedhar 1999; Danen and Sonnenberg 2003; French-Constant and Colognato 2004; Juliano et al. 2004; Lee and Juliano 2004). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In the field of islet cell biology, several studies have demonstrated that integrin-ECM interactions are critical for survival, differentiation and function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In isolated canine islets, disruption of integrin-ECM relationships induced apoptosis and enhanced the trans-differentiation of islets to a ductal phenotype (Wang and Rosenberg 1999; Wang et al. 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, culturing these islets on fibronectin and collagen I matrices restored islet survival (Wang and Rosenberg 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Embedding isolated human adult islets in type I collagen gels increased insulin secretory responses (Montesano et al. 1983), while culturing human beta cells on bovine corneal endothelial matrix increased basal and stimulated insulin secretion levels (Kantengwa et al. 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the culturing of rat islets on laminin-5 also increased insulin secretory responses (Hammar et al. 2004), while human fetal beta cells demonstrated significant increases in insulin secretion upon glucose stimulation and a reciprocal decline in insulin content when exposed to vitronectin and collagen IV matrices (Kaido et al. 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these studies emphasize the importance of specific integrin-ECM relationships in potentiating beta cell survival and function. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>β1 integrin and its associated α subunits constitute the largest integrin subfamily (Brakebusch and Fassler 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Particular importance has been placed on these integrins as they orchestrate the majority of changes in beta cell behaviours and heavily influence alterations in hormone expression and secretion (Bosco et al. 2000; Kaido et al. 2004; Kantengwa et al. 1997, Wang et al. 2005; Yashpal et al. 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated the spatial and temporal expression patterns of β1 integrin and its associated α3, α5 and α6 subunits in the developing human fetal and pre- and post-natal rat pancreas (Wang et al. 2005; Yashpal et al. 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, integrins αVβ1 and α1β1 have been shown to facilitate human fetal islet cell adhesion, motility and insulin secretion on vitronectin and collagen IV matrices, respectively (Cirulli et al. 2000; Kaido et al. 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Similarly, integrins α3β1 and α6β1 increase rat and human adult islet cell adhesion and spreading, respectively, augmenting cell survival and insulin secretion (Bosco et al. 2000; Kantengwa et al. 1997). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The above findings have characterized the role of integrin-ECM relationships in islet cells; however the consequences of these interactions in the beta cell remain largely unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Moreover, specialized interactions between integrin receptors and specific matrix proteins, which enhance the survival and function of beta cells, has not been thoroughly studied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The goal of the present study was to characterize the αβ1 integrin expression pattern in INS-1 pancreatic beta cells, a highly differentiated rat insulinoma cell line, which has been described as physiologically similar to native beta cells (Asfari et al. 1992; Janjic and Wolheim 1992; Yang et al. 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Alterations in beta cell behaviours, including adhesion, spreading, viability, proliferation and function were also examined, following exposure to various matrix proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Through immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR and western blotting, we identified seven α subunits, α1-6 and αV, of which α3, α4 and α6 co-immunoprecipitated with the β1 integrin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Among these heterodimers, α3β1 was most highly expressed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Therefore, common ligands for this integrin, including fibronectin, laminin and collagen I and IV, were all tested. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Our results revealed that both collagen matrices increased integrin-dependent attachment and spreading, enhanced INS-1 cell viability and proliferation, and increased FAK phosphorylation and focal adhesion contact assembly, when compared to fibronectin, laminin and control conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Moreover, culturing INS-1 cells on these collagen matrices enhanced insulin expression and increased basal insulin release as well as insulin secretion following a high glucose challenge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>These observations provide us with a better understanding of integrin-ECM relationships that can be manipulated for improving beta cell-based therapies for the treatment of diabetes. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>The present study characterizes the αβ1 integrin expression pattern in INS-1 cells and demonstrates that integrin-dependent attachment to collagens I and IV are important for survival and function of the beta cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>INS-1 cells cultured on collagens I and IV showed remarkable increases in cell adhesion and spreading, paralleled by increases in INS-1 cell viability and proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Moreover, an increase in focal adhesion contact assembly and FAK phosphorylation were observed in INS-1 cells cultured on collagen I or IV, when compared to other matrices tested and control. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Integrin-dependent attachment to collagen I and IV also enhanced the expression of Pdx-1 and insulin mRNA and protein, and resulted in increased basal insulin release and insulin content in the cells, as well as augmented glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these findings indicate that specific interactions between integrin and collagen matrices are essential for the survival and function of INS-1 beta cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>The important role of the β1 subfamily of integrins in regulating beta cell survival and function has been well established. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>We have previously characterized the spatial and temporal expression patterns of the β1 integrin and its associated subunits α3, α5 and α6 in the pre- and post-natal rat pancreas and during human fetal pancreatic development (Wang et al. 2005; Yashpal et al. 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>In the present study, using immunohistochemical, western blotting and qRT-PCR approaches, we identified seven α subunits associated with the β1 integrin in INS-1 cells, and determined that α3β1 is the most highly expressed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Pleiotrophic binding of the α3β1 integrin to various matrix proteins suggests that its associations with the ECM would highly influence beta cell activities: fibronectin, laminin, and collagens I and IV have been previously described as ligands of the integrin α3β1 (Coppolino et al. 1995; Delwel et al. 1994). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that INS-1 cells preferentially adhere to and spread on collagens I and IV in comparison to fibronectin and laminin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Although both collagen matrices augment cell viability and proliferation, exposure to collagen IV maximally increased the number of viable and BrdU-labelled cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Molecular scaffolds which link the intracellular actin cytoskeleton with signaling proteins have been shown to promote adhesion, protect against apoptosis and enhance cell function (Berman et al. 2003; Boudreau and Jones 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>In INS-1 cells, matrices collagen I and IV improved focal contact assembly and increased FAK phosphorylation, indicating that these collagen matrices are essential for the survival of beta cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Functional analyses of these integrin-ECM interactions demonstrated increased insulin expression, basal insulin release and secretion in response to high doses of glucose when INS-1 cells were exposed to collagens I and IV in comparison to fibronectin or laminin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Although both collagen matrices enhanced insulin release at low and high doses of glucose, the insulin secretory response was much higher in cells cultured on collagen IV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>In support of our findings, Kaido et al. reported that collagen IV greatly stimulates insulin release from human fetal islet cells in comparison to collagen I, fibronectin and laminin (Kaido et al. 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>The findings of this study, along with our results demonstrate that attachment of beta cells to collagen matrices promote beta cell function. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>The findings of the present study demonstrate that INS-1 cell survival and function and α3β1 gene expression are increased on collagen I and IV, indicating that cell culture on collagen matrices stimulates both inside-out and outside-in signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Perturbing the α3β1 integrin decreased INS-1 cell adhesion, spreading and viability on both collagen I and IV, and reduced Pdx-1 and insulin expression, revealing that α3β1 integrin interactions with collagen matrices are critical for beta cell survival. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>The positive effects of culturing islets in either two or three-dimensional collagen I matrices have been previously documented. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Montesano et al. (1983) developed a three-dimensional culture module where dispersed human islet cells were seeded on collagen I matrices and subsequently overlaid with an additional layer of collagen I. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Embedding these islet cells allowed for their re-aggregation into organoids that resembled native islets (Montesano et al. 1983). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Similarly, culturing canine, rat and human fetal islets on collagen I increased cell adhesion (Wang et al. 1999; Wang et al. 2005; Yashpal et al., 2005), stimulated basal insulin secretory responses from canine islets and reduced cell death (Wang et al. 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>These findings are congruent with the results in the present study, which reinforce the concept that there are beneficial effects of collagen I on beta cell survival and function. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>The majority of studies have highlighted the importance of traditional matrix proteins found in the islet, including fibronectin, laminin and collagen I. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>All three of these matrices have been shown to aid in the attachment of islet cells and augment insulin release following isolation (Hammar et al. 2004; Kaido et al. 2006; Wang et al. 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Although a major basement membrane constituent, collagen IV is a less well-studied matrix protein in islet cell biology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>In situ, collagen IV is found in the basement membrane of intra-islet blood vessels (Kaido et al. 2004; Van Deijnen et al. 1994), and beta cells are closely associated with these structures (Lammert et al. 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>The importance of collagen IV has been demonstrated by Kaido et al. (2004), who reported increased adhesion and migration of human fetal beta cells on this matrix protein (Kaido et al. 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our previous studies have revealed the co-localization of collagen IV with the α3 integrin in human fetal pancreatic islets, suggesting that interactions between αβ1 integrins and collagen IV have developmental and functional implications in vivo (Wang et al. 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Taken together with the findings in the present study, interactions between collagen IV and αβ1 integrins are essential for the survival and function of beta cells, and should be further explored in islet cell biology. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>In summary, in the present study we have characterized the αβ1 integrin expression in the INS-1 pancreatic beta cell line and demonstrated how integrin-dependent adhesion to various ECM constituents, including fibronectin, laminin, collagen I and collagen IV, regulate beta cell survival and function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Our analyses provide insight into integrin-ECM associations that augment beta cell function in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>The identification and manipulation of such critical factors will be important in deriving optimal islet-based therapies for the treatment of diabetes. </plain></SENT>
