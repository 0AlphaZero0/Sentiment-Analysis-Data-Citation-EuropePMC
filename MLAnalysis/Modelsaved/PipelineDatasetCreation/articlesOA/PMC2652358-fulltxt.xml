Although virtual screening (VS) against a crystal or relaxed receptor structure is an established method to identify potential inhibitors, the more dynamic changes within binding sites are neglected. To accommodate full receptor flexibility, we use AutoDock4 to screen the NCI diversity set against representative receptor ensembles extracted from explicitly solvated molecular dynamics simulations of the neuraminidase system. The top hits are redocked to the entire nonredundant receptor ensemble and rescored using the relaxed complex scheme (RCS). Of the 27 top hits reported, half ranked very poorly if only crystal structures are used. These compounds target the catalytic cavity as well as the newly identified 150- and 430-cavities, which exhibit dynamic properties in electrostatic surface and geometric shape. This ensemble-based VS and RCS approach may offer improvement over existing strategies for structure-based drug discovery.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement><funding-source>National Institutes of Health, United States</funding-source></funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>jm8001197</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>jm-2008-001197</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Avian influenza has received worldwide attention due to its rapid global spread via migratory birds and the growing number of human cases.

NA, a membrane-bound homotetrameric enzyme, releases viral paricles by cleaving terminal sialic acid (SA) residues on the host cell surface proteoglycans, bound by HA.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>) As the NA active site is relatively well-conserved, it became a good target for structure-based antiviral drug development.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>) Commercial inhibitors such as zanamivir and oseltamivir are stockpiled by various countries in case of a pandemic outbreak. While both drugs are successful in treating several human cases,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>) drug-resistant strains have quickly emerged due to antigenic drift.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup></p><p>In 2006, Russell et al. reported the first crystal structures of a group-1 NA (N1), which revealed the existence of a &#8220;150-cavity&#8221; that, under various crystallization conditions, closed upon ligand binding to the active site through movement of the 150-loop.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>) To further probe the structure and dynamics of N1, explicitly solvated molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the tetrameric N1 systems with (holo) or without (apo) oseltamivir bound were performed.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>) The simulations indicated that the flexibility of the 150-loop may be even greater than previously anticipated and that the dynamics of the neighboring 430-loop also influenced the topology of the binding site.</p><p>More recently, representative conformations of the N1 binding site (including the flexible 150- and 430-loop regions), extracted from a clustering analysis of the N1 MD simulations, were used for computational solvent mapping (CS-Map), which assessed the binding affinity of small, solvent-sized probe molecules within these areas.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>) The mapping analyses revealed the presence of novel druggable hot spots in the 150- and 430-loop regions, providing further support for the feasibility of developing high-affinity inhibitors capable of binding these areas. Such inhibitors may be applicable to the group-1 NA&#8217;s including N1, N4, N5, and N8, which have nearly identical active site regions,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>) but not necessarily group-2 enzymes (N2, N3, N6, N7, and N9), which appear to lack such well defined cavities.</p><p>Structure-based drug discovery has made significant progress in the past 30 years,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>) benefiting from recent advances in high performance and distributed grid computing.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>) However, the drawbacks are well documented (reviewed in refs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>)), and only in the past decade have methods able to treat receptor flexibility been developed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> A related challenge is the identification of drug leads out of large compound libraries through receptor-based virtual screening (VS). VS is a widely used method that has been shown to be successful in a variety of studies, although it also has many shortcomings (reviewed in refs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>)). The treatment of receptor flexibility within the scope of VS is still in its infancy and a very active area of research, as it is widely accepted that receptor flexibility plays an important role in molecular recognition. The use of multiple experimentally derived protein structures in VS has been shown to effectively improve enrichment factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> and, most recently, aid in the discovery of novel compounds active against the p53 tumor repressor.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>)</p><p>The relaxed complex scheme (RCS), a hybrid computational method that combines the advantages of docking algorithms with dynamic structural information provided by MD simulations, has been successfully applied to a number of systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> Recently, raltegravir became the first FDA approved drug targeting HIV integrase,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>) and the treatment of receptor flexibility with MD simulations played a critical role in understanding the mechanism of action for this new class of inhibitors.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>) During MD simulations of the integrase enzyme in complex with the known inhibitor 5CITEP, a new pocket adjacent to the binding site was revealed, and docking of ligands into this new area indicated favorable binding.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>) The development of compounds capable of binding to both the original binding site and the new cavity, so-called &#8220;butterfly&#8221; compounds, formed the basis for this new class of integrase inhibitors.</p><p>In this work, we build upon these recent advances and present a novel, systematic, <italic>in silico</italic> lead identification strategy, with the goal of taking full receptor flexibility into account in the lead identification and scoring stages. VS experiments are carried out against the NCI diversity set (NCIDS) on a set of eight N1 representative receptor structures,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>) consisting of two crystal structures and the three most dominant cluster-representative receptor structures as extracted from the explicitly solvated apo and holo MD simulations.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>) The use of the most dominant MD-generated structures systematically incorporates a broader range of receptor configurations into the hit identification process, in contrast to screening the crystal structures alone. We anticipate that for very flexible receptors, such as N1, the incorporation of this variable structural information may identify new drug leads. Indeed, comparison of the cluster representative structures suggests that the remarkable flexibility of the 150- and 430-loops results in correspondingly different 150-, 430-, and binding site cavities.</p><p>This novel VS approach is further combined with the RCS, a lead validation and refinement technique in which the top <italic>N</italic> hits are redocked to the entire nonredundant receptor ensemble and rescored. Ultimately, we report 27 experimentally available compounds that are predicted to have a binding affinity equal to or better than four known N1 antivirals. Importantly, half of these compounds would have been neglected based on the crystal structure VS scores alone. Examination of the interactions of these top hits within the NA active site region reveals different classes of compounds with binding preference to the 150-, 430-, and catalytic cavities. Several compounds are predicted to interact with key residues across two cavities and may provide novel bridging compound scaffolds. We anticipate that this ensemble-based virtual screen with relaxed complex scheme (EVSRCS) approach may contribute to better structure-based drug design strategies for very flexible receptors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><title>Materials And Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Apo System Setup</title><p>Details of the simulation setup without any ligand bound are as previously described.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>)Briefly, the apo system was built with the avian H5N1 NA crystal structure <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="2HTY">2HTY</ext-link>.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>) Protonation states for histidine residues were defined at an apparent pH 6.5 using the PDB2PQR web server.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>) All crystallographically resolved water oxygen positions were retained in the apo system, as well as Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, which are required for optimal NA function.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>) To mimic experimental inhibition assay conditions, a 150 mM NaCl salt bath was introduced.

Briefly, for the apo and holo simulations, each chain of the tetramer was extracted at 10 ps intervals over the 40 ns simulation. The resulting 1.6 &#215; 10<sup>4</sup> trajectory structures for each simulation were superimposed using all C<sub>&#945;</sub> atoms to remove overall rotation and translation. The RMSD-clustering was performed on the subset of 62 residues that line the entire binding-site area, which we define here as the binding-site residues: 117&#8722;119, 133&#8722;138, 146&#8722;152, 156, 179, 180, 196&#8722;200, 223&#8722;228, 243&#8722;247, 277, 278, 293, 295, 344&#8722;347, 368, 401, 402, and 426&#8722;441. These residues were clustered into batches of similar configurations using the atom-positional RMSD of all atoms (including side chains and hydrogens) as the similarity criterion. A cutoff of 1.3 &#197; was chosen after evaluation of the dependence of cluster populations against the total number of clusters found for each simulation using a cutoff in the range 1.0&#8722;1.5 &#197;. The central member cluster structure, the structure within the cluster having the smallest RMSD to all other structures within the cluster (i.e., the centroid), was chosen as the cluster representative structure. Fifty-one clusters were obtained for the apo system, and 27 clusters for the holo system, the three most dominant configurations represented about 21%, 20%, and 19% and 38%, 22%, and 14% of the apo and holo ensembles, respectively.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>) In Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, we indicate the time points that correspond to each of the central member cluster structures.

Still, the question remains whether the reduced set of cluster representative structures are biologically relevant. We have used the set of known inhibitors to investigate the behavior of the system. As shown in Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, some configurations, e.g., 3.41, 29.68 ns, seem unfavorable to all the inhibitors, with as much as 5 kcal/mol difference observed for zanamivir. It is also evident that the three most dominant clusters, which correspond to 2.65, 5.76, and 22.02 ns, do not always have the lowest binding energy, which is often found in clusters with less than 0.01% of the total population of MD snapshots. However, considering that the dominant configurations are most likely to be encountered by a ligand, we conjecture that the dominant clusters will be good candidates to represent the diversity of configurational space, within the sampling limitations of the MD simulations.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.1.2"><title>Rescoring the Top Hits</title><p>The top compounds were redocked into the entire, nonredundant holo-ensemble. There are several reasons to use the holo-enzyme. First, the oseltamivir-bound holo-ensemble accounts for ligand-induced effects on the binding site. Second, any inhibitors may have to compete for the binding site with a favored natural substrate already bound. Third, the holo ensemble contains oseltamivir, an analogue of the natural substrate SA. In fact, from this study, as shown in Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B, the Apo-1 cluster representative has oseltamivir bound at the 150-cavity, albeit with a higher binding energy (&#8722;7.22 kcal/mol) This further suggests that the holo ensemble is more appropriate to use for rescoring the hits. Last, the choice to use a holo-ensemble has also been shown to perform well in other works on the RC methodology(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>) and the discovery of inhibitors against an RNA editing ligase in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, the parasite responsible for African sleeping sickness.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">58</xref>) The latter study used the QR-factorization method to extract a nonredundant ensemble of MD snapshots and the RCS for rescoring of hits from a VS against a single crystal structure.</p><p>A preliminary study using the known set of inhibitors indicated that the weighted harmonic mean method is able to rank the controls relative to one another for three out of the four inhibitors (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The natural substrate SA ranks closely to DANA, with oseltamivir and zanamivir correctly ranked with higher affinity. The exception is peramivir, which is ranked lower than what is expected based on its experimental IC<sub>50</sub> values. Closer examination of the N8 with peramivir bound (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="2HTU">2HTU</ext-link>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>) and the docking pose of peramivir in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="2HTY">2HTY</ext-link> revealed no differences in the position and orientation of the ligand (data not shown). It is possible that the current docking condition does not account for stabilizing interactions conferred by the solvent, water molecules, or other potential ligand induced conformational changes. On the other hand, the standard error (&#8722;2 kcal/mol) of AutoDock4 may be the limiting factor and the rescoring and reranking would be able to discriminate the true differences between some hits. This is consistent with the general observation that docking programs are good at separating the binders from nonbinders, but poor at ordering the hits based on their affinity.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref>) However, by taking into account the different distributions of the cluster size, giving more weight to the clusters with more substantial populations in the calculation of the mean binding energy, the weighted harmonic mean method may be able to improve the rankings, and may offer an interesting area for future methodological development.</p><p>For example, for each compound, we have examined the ensemble minimum binding energy, the lowest value from one of the three most dominant clusters, and the RC minimum binding energy, from the cluster with the lowest binding energy of all the 27 clusters (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Eleven out of the 27 compounds had the ensemble minimum in the most abundant cluster, but only one of which, compound <bold>10</bold>, had a RC minimum also in an abundant cluster. Overall, six out of 27 compounds had the ensemble minimum and RC minimum occurring in abundant clusters. The co-occurrence of ensemble minimum (lowest binding energy of one of the top three clusters) and the RC minimum (lowest possible observed energy) may indicate that a highly abundant configurational space (i.e., ensemble of substates) is also favored by the ligand for most stable interaction. In fact, four out of the six co-occurrences occurred for compounds ranked within the top 10 hits, and all six ranked within the top 20 hits. In terms of binding energy, four out the six had identical binding energy between the ensemble minimum and RC minimum; the other two had binding energy differing less than 1 kcal/mol. Although the most populated structures may be most relevant to the initiation of binding events, it seems unlikely that they would be truly precatalytic states.</p><p>Some compounds that score poorly in the crystal-structure-only screen score well when MD structures are used, demonstrating the advantages of using MD structures to expand the description of the receptor&#8217;s structure. Conversely, other compounds that score well in the crystal-structure-only screen move down the list when the MD structures are included (e.g., compound <bold>21</bold>) (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). This reordering happens for two reasons: first, because other compounds move up the list by producing better binding energies, and second, because some compounds produce a significantly worse binding energy when the MD structures are included. For example, compound <bold>21</bold> appears to move down the list due to a combination of both reasons mentioned above. Other compounds rank better in the MD structures and thus move up the list. Closer examination of compound <bold>21</bold> reveals that its position in the 430-cavity is compromised when the 430-loop opens during the MD simulation; as the loop opens, compound <bold>21</bold> loses contact with several stabilizing residues and thus the affinity is reduced. Therefore, loop motion and the subsequent interactions gained and/or lost is the cause of many compounds&#8217; movements up and/or down the reranked list.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.1.3"><title>Rescoring a Larger List of Hits</title><p>In <xref rid="note1"/>, we noted that the cutoff of &#8722;9.25 kcal/mol meant that peramivir and DANA would not have been selected. On the other hand, when these compounds were rescored together with the other top hits, taking into account all the lowest binding energies regardless of the size of the most populated cluster, peramivir and DANA actually ranked better than some of the top hits. These data suggest that, given the current standard error of 2 kcal/mol for AutoDock4, and the somewhat arbitrary nature of the 25% cutoff, the weighted harmonic mean or some improved knowledge-based heuristics may be applied to rescore an expanded list of hits and potentially recover some lost hits (i.e., false negatives).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><title>Dynamic Nature of N1 Active Site</title><p>The MD simulations offer representative conformations of the protein beyond what is provided by the static crystal structures alone, and they offer a possible description of the energy landscape where ligand&#8722;receptor interactions take place. The visual examination of the electrostatic surface maps for the different cavities, the various 150- and 430-loop configurations, and the SASA analyses indicate that at the monomer level, the N1 active site is highly dynamic.</p><sec id="sec4.2.1"><title>Electrostatic Gradient and Substrate Movement</title><p>At the monomeric level, the dynamic opening and closing of the 150- and 430-cavities, with the corresponding change in the electrostatic field, may help target and orient the appropriate substrate to the catalytic site. In Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B, oseltamivir interacts in the 150-cavity of the Apo-1 cluster representative structure, which represents a population size of about 20%. In Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, oseltamivir is very stably found in the SA cavity of the holo clusters. It is possible that the open 150-cavity provides an initial binding site, helping to guide the substrate into contacts with the catalytic residues through further closing motion of the 150-loop. Both crystallographic evidence and the MD simulations indicate that this closed 150-loop is stabilized by oseltamivir in the active site,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> primarily through interactions with D151 and R152. Collectively, these observations may suggest that the closed substate is preferred when ligands are bound in the active site.</p><p>Interestingly, on the other side of the 430-cavity is an area known to be a second SA binding site in N9(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref>) and N2,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">61</xref>) with hemadsorption activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">63</xref></sup> Notably, sialic acid (in the boat, chair, or twist conformation) shows a preference to bind near this alternate site or the 430-cavity in 12 out of 18 docking experiments, albeit with lower energy and, often, lower clustering percentage than the SA cavity (data not shown). Moreover, the electrostatic surface potential maps indicate that this alternate SA binding site may exhibit a weak negative electrostatic potential. Therefore it is possible that this alternate site acts to attract SA or to extend its interactions with the N1 binding site. The comparatively stronger electrostatic potential in the SA cavity may provide an electrostatic gradient to steer SA into the requisite catalytic location. The effect of electrostatics is well-known to play an influential role in controlling the diffusion of substrates into charged active site areas, as shown in the acetylcholinesterase system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref65">65</xref></sup> More extensive electrostatic calculations are required to test this hypothesis in the N1 system.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2.2"><title>Hot Spots for Ligand&#8722;Protein Interactions</title><p>Previously, a CS-Map analysis on the N1 cluster representative structures assessed the druggability of the newly defined areas identified in the MD simulations.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>) Using a complementary computational physics-based approach, CS-Map identified suitable sites for potential ligand interactions, which were presented as probe clusters near the 150- and 430-loop regions. The consensus approach adopted in the CS-Map analysis indicates that despite protein motion, the existence of hot spots over the binding site may persist, and that these areas may be relevant for drug discovery and design, as has also been shown through a variety of other methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref66">66</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref70">70</xref></sup> The work we present here provides support for the CS-Map analysis through the docking of the NCIDS compound library to these novel hot spots (Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

The individual hits to each cavity may offer good starting points for hit to lead optimization, especially for those interested in using fragment-based approaches. Compounds that are predicted to bridge two cavities simultaneously are especially interesting, particularly those that bridge either the 430- or 150-cavity to the SA cavity. In theory, these compounds should interfere with the binding of SA to the catalytic residues, represented in italics in Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, while providing additional selectivity for N1 through binding to the 150- or 430-cavities. Clearly, these compounds will require further optimizations because their current binding energies and predicted <italic>K<sub>i</sub></italic>&#8217;s are not necessarily higher than those compounds that only interact with a single cavity. However, they provide an initial set of experimentally testable predictions regarding the capability of any compounds to bind to these newly identified, druggable areas.

None of the 27 top hits are predicted to make contacts to H274. Compound <bold>1</bold> makes a nonbonded contact to N294 in Holo-1; no other hits do. In addition, the E276D mutation has been shown to confer resistance without sacrificing the viability or genetic stability of the virus.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref72">72</xref>) E276 is located directly in the sialic acid cavity and illustrates that even a subtle reduction in side chain length can be enough to confer resistance, further underscoring the need to develop new antivirals that target alternate areas such as the 150- and 430-cavities. Other mutations have been identified in group-2 neuraminidases (N2, N9) and influenza type-B viruses, but it is often observed that mutant residues in one group are unrelated to those in another.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref73">73</xref>) Furthermore, when mutations from N2 are introduced into H5N1, they result in significantly reduced viral viability.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref74">74</xref>)</p><p>Another intriguing consideration is that the inhibitor does not necessarily need to make contact with the mutated residues in order for it to confer resistance. For example, oseltamivir does not make immediate contacts with H274, but the mutation to tyrosine very likely causes tertiary changes in the protein that affect oseltamivir binding. Additionally, it has been shown that changes in the HA glycosylation patterns can confer antiviral resistance in an NA-independent manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref76">76</xref></sup> Although our understanding of the complex interplay of interactions that confer resistance is incomplete, these factors can still be considered in the selection and design of N1 antivirals.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Through eight different virtual screens of the NCI diversity set, which employed structures taken from crystallographic studies as well as representative structures from apo and holo MD simulations, 27 drug-like ligands have been identified, which are predicted to bind with high affinity to avian influenza N1. Fourteen of these compounds are unique hits that would not have been found based on the crystal structure screens alone, and they include compounds that bind to flexible loop regions unseen in the crystal structures. Importantly, the docking of thousands of compounds to the N1 binding site elucidated specific regions of high ligand-binding affinity in the flexible 150- and 430- cavities. These cavities and the residue contacts observed among the top hits strongly agree with the location of hot spots and residues predicted to mediate receptor&#8722;ligand interactions by a recent CS-Map analysis. The top hits are validated and ranked through redocking experiments into a set of structures representing the holo ensemble within the RCS framework. This novel strategy for identifying NA inhibitors may facilitate the design of better drugs in the fight against global pandemic influenza and be applicable in structure-based drug discovery initiatives.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>L.S.C, D.X., W.W.L., and P.W.A. are supported by NIH P41 RR08605 (to P.W.A.) and TATRC W81XWH-07-2-0014 (to W.W.L. and P.W.A.).
