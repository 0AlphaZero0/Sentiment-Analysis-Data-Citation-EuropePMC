<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus that the World Health Organization fears may cause a pandemic in humans comprises strains from the subtype H5N1 of influenza type A.(1) Subtypes of influenza virus are named based on the observed combinations of two viral surface membrane glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA)aaAbbreviations: VS, virtual screening; RCS, relaxed complex scheme; RC, relaxed complex; MD, molecular dynamics; HA, hemagglutinin; NA, neuraminidase; CS-Map, computational solvent mapping; NCIDS, National Cancer Institute diversity set; EVSRCS, ensemble-based virtual screen with relaxed complex scheme; DANA, 2,3-didehydro-2-deoxy-N-acetyl neuraminic acid; SA, sialic acid; RMSD, root-mean-square deviation; NBCR, National Biomedical Computational Resource; PRAGMA, Pacific Rim Application and Grid Middleware Assembly; CSF4, Community Scheduler Framework; APBS, Adaptive Poisson−Boltzmann Solver; NSC, National Service Center; VMD, visual molecular dynamics; NAMD, not another molecular dynamics; SASA, solvent accessible surface area.  and neuraminidase (NA), with 16 and 9 types known to date, respectively.(2) Three historical pandemic flu viruses were caused by H1N1 (1918), H2N2 (1957), and H3N2 (1968). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>HA is involved in the attachment of viral particles to host cell surface glycoproteins, whereas NA plays a role in the release of newly synthesized viral particles (for a recent review, see ref (3)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>NA, a membrane-bound homotetrameric enzyme, releases viral paricles by cleaving terminal sialic acid (SA) residues on the host cell surface proteoglycans, bound by HA.(4) As the NA active site is relatively well-conserved, it became a good target for structure-based antiviral drug development.(5) Commercial inhibitors such as zanamivir and oseltamivir are stockpiled by various countries in case of a pandemic outbreak. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>While both drugs are successful in treating several human cases,(6) drug-resistant strains have quickly emerged due to antigenic drift.7,8 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In 2006, Russell et al. reported the first crystal structures of a group-1 NA (N1), which revealed the existence of a “150-cavity” that, under various crystallization conditions, closed upon ligand binding to the active site through movement of the 150-loop.(9) To further probe the structure and dynamics of N1, explicitly solvated molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the tetrameric N1 systems with (holo) or without (apo) oseltamivir bound were performed.(10) The simulations indicated that the flexibility of the 150-loop may be even greater than previously anticipated and that the dynamics of the neighboring 430-loop also influenced the topology of the binding site. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>More recently, representative conformations of the N1 binding site (including the flexible 150- and 430-loop regions), extracted from a clustering analysis of the N1 MD simulations, were used for computational solvent mapping (CS-Map), which assessed the binding affinity of small, solvent-sized probe molecules within these areas.(11) The mapping analyses revealed the presence of novel druggable hot spots in the 150- and 430-loop regions, providing further support for the feasibility of developing high-affinity inhibitors capable of binding these areas. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Such inhibitors may be applicable to the group-1 NA’s including N1, N4, N5, and N8, which have nearly identical active site regions,(9) but not necessarily group-2 enzymes (N2, N3, N6, N7, and N9), which appear to lack such well defined cavities. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Structure-based drug discovery has made significant progress in the past 30 years,(12) benefiting from recent advances in high performance and distributed grid computing.(13) However, the drawbacks are well documented (reviewed in refs (14,17)), and only in the past decade have methods able to treat receptor flexibility been developed.18–25 A related challenge is the identification of drug leads out of large compound libraries through receptor-based virtual screening (VS). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>VS is a widely used method that has been shown to be successful in a variety of studies, although it also has many shortcomings (reviewed in refs (26) and (27)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The treatment of receptor flexibility within the scope of VS is still in its infancy and a very active area of research, as it is widely accepted that receptor flexibility plays an important role in molecular recognition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The use of multiple experimentally derived protein structures in VS has been shown to effectively improve enrichment factors28,29 and, most recently, aid in the discovery of novel compounds active against the p53 tumor repressor.(30) </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The relaxed complex scheme (RCS), a hybrid computational method that combines the advantages of docking algorithms with dynamic structural information provided by MD simulations, has been successfully applied to a number of systems.22,23,31 Recently, raltegravir became the first FDA approved drug targeting HIV integrase,(32) and the treatment of receptor flexibility with MD simulations played a critical role in understanding the mechanism of action for this new class of inhibitors.(33) During MD simulations of the integrase enzyme in complex with the known inhibitor 5CITEP, a new pocket adjacent to the binding site was revealed, and docking of ligands into this new area indicated favorable binding.(34) The development of compounds capable of binding to both the original binding site and the new cavity, so-called “butterfly” compounds, formed the basis for this new class of integrase inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In this work, we build upon these recent advances and present a novel, systematic, in silico lead identification strategy, with the goal of taking full receptor flexibility into account in the lead identification and scoring stages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>VS experiments are carried out against the NCI diversity set (NCIDS) on a set of eight N1 representative receptor structures,(31) consisting of two crystal structures and the three most dominant cluster-representative receptor structures as extracted from the explicitly solvated apo and holo MD simulations.(10) The use of the most dominant MD-generated structures systematically incorporates a broader range of receptor configurations into the hit identification process, in contrast to screening the crystal structures alone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>We anticipate that for very flexible receptors, such as N1, the incorporation of this variable structural information may identify new drug leads. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Indeed, comparison of the cluster representative structures suggests that the remarkable flexibility of the 150- and 430-loops results in correspondingly different 150-, 430-, and binding site cavities. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>This novel VS approach is further combined with the RCS, a lead validation and refinement technique in which the top N hits are redocked to the entire nonredundant receptor ensemble and rescored. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Ultimately, we report 27 experimentally available compounds that are predicted to have a binding affinity equal to or better than four known N1 antivirals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Importantly, half of these compounds would have been neglected based on the crystal structure VS scores alone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Examination of the interactions of these top hits within the NA active site region reveals different classes of compounds with binding preference to the 150-, 430-, and catalytic cavities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Several compounds are predicted to interact with key residues across two cavities and may provide novel bridging compound scaffolds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>We anticipate that this ensemble-based virtual screen with relaxed complex scheme (EVSRCS) approach may contribute to better structure-based drug design strategies for very flexible receptors. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>The top compounds were redocked into the entire, nonredundant holo-ensemble. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>There are several reasons to use the holo-enzyme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>First, the oseltamivir-bound holo-ensemble accounts for ligand-induced effects on the binding site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Second, any inhibitors may have to compete for the binding site with a favored natural substrate already bound. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Third, the holo ensemble contains oseltamivir, an analogue of the natural substrate SA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>In fact, from this study, as shown in Figure 2B, the Apo-1 cluster representative has oseltamivir bound at the 150-cavity, albeit with a higher binding energy (−7.22 kcal/mol) This further suggests that the holo ensemble is more appropriate to use for rescoring the hits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Last, the choice to use a holo-ensemble has also been shown to perform well in other works on the RC methodology(31) and the discovery of inhibitors against an RNA editing ligase in Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite responsible for African sleeping sickness.(58) The latter study used the QR-factorization method to extract a nonredundant ensemble of MD snapshots and the RCS for rescoring of hits from a VS against a single crystal structure. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>A preliminary study using the known set of inhibitors indicated that the weighted harmonic mean method is able to rank the controls relative to one another for three out of the four inhibitors (Figure 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>The natural substrate SA ranks closely to DANA, with oseltamivir and zanamivir correctly ranked with higher affinity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>The exception is peramivir, which is ranked lower than what is expected based on its experimental IC50 values. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>It is possible that the current docking condition does not account for stabilizing interactions conferred by the solvent, water molecules, or other potential ligand induced conformational changes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the standard error (−2 kcal/mol) of AutoDock4 may be the limiting factor and the rescoring and reranking would be able to discriminate the true differences between some hits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the general observation that docking programs are good at separating the binders from nonbinders, but poor at ordering the hits based on their affinity.(59) However, by taking into account the different distributions of the cluster size, giving more weight to the clusters with more substantial populations in the calculation of the mean binding energy, the weighted harmonic mean method may be able to improve the rankings, and may offer an interesting area for future methodological development. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>For example, for each compound, we have examined the ensemble minimum binding energy, the lowest value from one of the three most dominant clusters, and the RC minimum binding energy, from the cluster with the lowest binding energy of all the 27 clusters (Figure 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Eleven out of the 27 compounds had the ensemble minimum in the most abundant cluster, but only one of which, compound 10, had a RC minimum also in an abundant cluster. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>The co-occurrence of ensemble minimum (lowest binding energy of one of the top three clusters) and the RC minimum (lowest possible observed energy) may indicate that a highly abundant configurational space (i.e., ensemble of substates) is also favored by the ligand for most stable interaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>In fact, four out of the six co-occurrences occurred for compounds ranked within the top 10 hits, and all six ranked within the top 20 hits. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>This reordering happens for two reasons: first, because other compounds move up the list by producing better binding energies, and second, because some compounds produce a significantly worse binding energy when the MD structures are included. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>For example, compound 21 appears to move down the list due to a combination of both reasons mentioned above. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Closer examination of compound 21 reveals that its position in the 430-cavity is compromised when the 430-loop opens during the MD simulation; as the loop opens, compound 21 loses contact with several stabilizing residues and thus the affinity is reduced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Therefore, loop motion and the subsequent interactions gained and/or lost is the cause of many compounds’ movements up and/or down the reranked list. </plain></SENT>
