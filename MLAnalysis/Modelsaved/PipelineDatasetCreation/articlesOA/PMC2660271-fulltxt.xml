Adenylyl cyclase 8 (AC8) is a Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulated isoform that displays a selective regulation by capacitative Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (CCE), the process whereby the entry of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into cells is triggered by the emptying of intracellular stores. This selectivity was believed to be achieved through the localization of AC8 in lipid raft microdomains, along with components of the CCE apparatus. In the present study, we show that an intact leucine zipper motif is required for the efficient <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation of AC8, and that this <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation is important to target AC8 into lipid rafts. Disruption of the leucine zipper by site-directed mutagenesis results in the elimination of <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated forms and their exclusion from lipid rafts. Mutants of AC8 that cannot be <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated are not demonstrably associated with rafts, although they can still be regulated by CCE; however, raft integrity is required for the regulation of these mutants. These findings suggest that raft localized proteins in addition to AC8 are needed to mediate its regulation by CCE.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>lipid rafts</kwd><kwd>leucine zipper</kwd><kwd>capacitative Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry</kwd><kwd><italic>N</italic>-glycosylation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges.

Adenylyl cyclase type 8 (AC8) typifies the membrane-bound enzymes in that it is susceptible to regulation by a number of stimulatory and inhibitory factors, which underpins its role in homeostatic integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r55">55</xref>). AC8 is primarily expressed in the brain; it is very prominent in the hippocampus and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>), and it is stimulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> acting through calmodulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, in nonexcitable cells, the regulation of AC8 by cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) is orchestrated by a selective dependence on capacitative Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (CCE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>), the process whereby Ca<sup>2+</sup> enters the cell in response to the depletion of internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, either directly by phospholipase C-linked agonists or passively, by pharmacological inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) reuptake pumps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>). Other means of elevating [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, such as release from internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, or non-capacitative entry mechanisms such as those triggered by 1-oleyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) and arachidonic acid, are ineffective at stimulating AC8 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>). This selectivity of AC8 for CCE, over other means of elevating [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, has been proposed to reflect a close apposition with CCE channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>).</p><p>The cellular basis for the dependence of AC8 on CCE is still uncertain, but it is believed to at least partly reflect a colocalization of AC8 with CCE entry sites within specialized microdomains of the plasma membrane (PM), the lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>). Lipid rafts are variously considered to be static or dynamic domains of the membrane that are enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids. Lipid rafts can form invaginations of the PM caused by constrictions organized by polymers of the protein caveolin, which are referred to as &#8220;caveolae&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r53">53</xref>). Rafts and caveolae, either passively or actively, accumulate a subset of membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>). However, it must be acknowledged that a universal consensus of precisely how this concentration of signaling molecules is achieved, or even its regulatory significance, is not agreed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>). Candidate CCE components such as stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and transient receptor potential channels, as well as Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive ACs, receptors, and G proteins, have been detected in lipid rafts following biochemical separation of membrane extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>). The localization of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive ACs in rafts as an essential component of their regulation by CCE, is suggested since the disruption of rafts by cholesterol extraction with methyl-&#946;-cyclodextrin (M&#946;CD) ablates the regulation of AC8 by CCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>), without affecting the CCE process. Thus an essential part of understanding the regulation of AC seems to rely on understanding its trafficking and organization in the PM. Because ACs are complex molecules, of over 1,200 amino acids, comprising two repeated cassettes of six-transmembrane spanning domains interspersed with two separated catalytic interfaces, this topic has received little attention. The first paper on this subject showed that the two six-transmembrane domains must associate to traffic the molecule to the PM, and in so doing they bring the two catalytic domains into functional apposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>). Subsequently, the cytoplasmic domains of both AC5 (a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-inhibitable species) and AC8 were revealed to be critical for targeting to rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). However, nothing else is known regarding the mechanisms through which ACs are targeted to specific cellular compartments.</p><p>In the present study, the trafficking and assembly of AC8 into raft domains of the PM has been addressed, with particular regard to the role of oligomerization and <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation. A leucine zipper motif is seen to play a key role in preventing mistargeting of the enzyme; a multistep process is revealed including a central role for <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation. Furthermore, the necessity for the integrity of lipid rafts for the regulation by CCE of AC8 is clarified.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p>Cell culture materials, protein-G-Sepharose 4B, tunicamycin, M&#946;CD, cholesterol, and sphingomyelinase from <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).

The AC8 species running above the 212-kDa molecular mass marker are compatible with dimers or oligomers of AC8 that resist the denaturing conditions imposed by the resuspension of the crude membrane preparations in 1% SDS-containing buffer and the SDS-PAGE process. The finding of more than one molecular species of AC8 raises the question of whether all of these proteins are targeted to the same cellular compartment and/or represent functional AC8.</p><p>That AC8 can exist as dimers/oligomers accords with previous findings, which suggested that ACs form higher-order complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>). AC5 and AC6 appear to form heterodimers, since NH<sub>2</sub>-terminally myc-tagged AC5 can coimmunoprecipitate NH<sub>2</sub>-terminally FLAG-tagged AC6 when coexpressed, and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>). Moreover, AC5 has been shown to heterodimerize with AC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>). The regulatory significance of AC dimer formation was further underlined when Chen-Goodspeed and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>) demonstrated that dimer formation is required for AC5 regulation by the &#945;-subunit of G<sub>s</sub>.</p><p>Two further species of AC8 appear at approximately 150 and 125 kDa (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), which are compatible with <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated and nonglycosylated monomeric AC8, respectively. It has previously been established that AC8 is <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated and its primary structure has several putative <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>) although these have never been directly addressed. Exposure of crude HEK-293 membranes expressing AC8 to <italic>N</italic>-glycosidase F (which removes <italic>N</italic>-linked glycans from proteins) affected the migration of both the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated monomers and dimers of AC8 (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>); the band migrating at &#8764;150 kDa effectively disappeared, and the band at 125 kDa became more pronounced. These findings strongly suggest that the band migrating at &#8764;150 kDa represents an <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated monomer of AC8, while the band migrating at &#8764;125 kDa corresponds to a unglycosylated monomer.</p><p>Since even after <italic>N</italic>-glycosidase F treatment the AC8 band was still somewhat diffuse, we considered the possibility that some core glycosylation resisted the enzymatic treatment. To address this possibility, we treated some membranes from cells expressing AC8 triple <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation mutant (see Fig. 4 for details) with <italic>N</italic>-glycosidase F. The product of this treatment appears identical to the deglycosylated band of AC8 (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). Consequently, we conclude that the removal of glycans is complete. (In trying to reconcile the rather diffuse <italic>N</italic>-glycosidase F-treated lower-molecular-weight band with the sharper lower-molecular-weight band in controls, it may be worth noting that the former band is a deglycosylated mature protein product, whereas the latter is probably an immature unglycosylated protein.)</p><p>To exclude the possibility that apparent dimers were a consequence of heterologous overexpression, we asked whether dimers would be observed in an endogenous setting. Crude membranes were prepared from mouse cerebellum, a rich source of AC8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>) and compared with a positive control (crude membranes from HEK-293 cells stably expressing AC8). AC8 was detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Higher-molecular-weight forms were observed in both cases (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>).</p><p>To prove that AC8 forms dimers, HA- and FLAG-tagged versions of AC8 were constructed. These proteins were coexpressed in HEK-293 cells and subjected to immunoprecipitation with either anti-FLAG-or anti-HA-antibodies and detection with anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibodies on Western blots (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>D</italic> and <italic>E</italic>). These data clearly show mutual association of the differently tagged forms and therefore the formation of AC8 dimers.</p><p>These experiments showed that multiple species of AC8 molecules are expressed. We endeavored to characterize the relative importance of these species of AC8 in terms of both the targeting of AC8 to microdomains of the PM and the regulation of AC8 by CCE.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Disruption of the leucine zipper motif of AC8 leads to loss of activity and impairs N-glycosylation.</title><p>A striking feature of mammalian ACs is their possession of a leucine zipper motif, which is remarkably conserved among all AC isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>) (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). The significance of this feature of ACs has never been addressed experimentally. Leucine zippers are protein-protein interaction motifs composed of a heptad repeat of amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>). The &#8220;ABCDEFG rule,&#8221; based on the structure of classical leucine zippers (for example, those of the c-Jun protein; <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>), holds that positions A and D of the heptad are occupied by hydrophobic amino acids (in bold in <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>), with leucines being particularly frequent in position D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>). Positions E and G, on the contrary, are occupied by charged amino acids (underlined in <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). All of the above rules are met by the leucine zipper motif of c-Jun and other &#8220;classical&#8221; leucine zipper motifs (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). Modified leucine zipper motifs observe the above rules to a lesser degree. In <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref> the reported modified leucine zipper motifs of A-kinase anchoring protein-79 (AKAP-79) and AKAP-18 are shown in which, despite a more lax adherence to those rules (for example, not all amino acids at position D are leucines), the mediation of the interaction with other leucine zipper partners is still preserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>). <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref> shows the structure of the leucine zipper of AC8, which displays the classical leucine zipper motif.</p><p>Given the role of leucine zippers in protein-protein interactions and their conservation across AC isoforms, we considered the possibility that the leucine zipper motif of AC8 might play a role in oligomerization and/or protein-protein interaction and, thereby, influence its cellular targeting.</p><p>To reveal a possible role of leucine zippers in AC8, the motif was disrupted by site-directed mutagenesis. The critical leucines in position D of the heptad were progressively replaced with alanines (L/A mutants), up to a mutant in which all four leucines of the motif were replaced (L439A; L432A, L439A; L432A, L439A, L446A; L432A, L439A, L446A, L453A; these mutants for the sake of simplicity are also referred to as L/A1, L/A2, L/A3, and L/A4, respectively). To our surprise, the disruption of the leucine zipper motif did not significantly change the relative levels of AC8 dimers as seen by immunoblotting (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). This strongly suggests that the leucine zippers are not responsible for the dimer formation. However, there was a dramatic reduction in the levels of the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated monomeric species of AC8 (the band running at 150 kDa), whereas the signal for the unglycosylated species increased (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). Given this dramatic consequence to mutations of the leucine zipper motif, we asked whether there were consequences for the activity of the AC8 in terms of regulation by CCE (in vivo) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin (in vitro). Whereas wild-type AC8 (WT-AC8) was robustly stimulated by CCE, all of the mutants were inactive, both in vitro (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>) and in vivo (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>D</italic></xref>). The dramatic effect of the leucine zipper mutations on both the <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation and activity of AC8 strongly implicated the importance of <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation for both the regulation and targeting of AC8, whereas the relevance of dimeric/aggregated forms to activity seems uncertain.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Leucine zipper mutants of AC8 localize outside of lipid rafts.</title><p>Previous studies revealed the essential residence of AC8 in lipid rafts for regulation by CCE, so we considered the possibility that the AC8 leucine zipper mutants might be excluded from lipid rafts. Consequently, HEK-293 cells transiently expressing either WT-AC8 or leucine zipper mutants were lysed by resuspension in 0.5 M bicarbonate buffer, pH 11.5, and subsequent sonication; this procedure breaks the cellular membranes in small fragments, stripping them of peripheral membrane and cytosolic proteins, and forming sheets of membranes, while at the same time preserving the integrity of the lipid bilayer with its integral membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>). The membrane fragments obtained were fractionated by isopycnic centrifugation on a discontinuous sucrose gradient to separate low-density lipid rafts/caveolae enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids, from high-density membranes. Raft membranes can be enriched in caveolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>), whereas non-raft membranes are enriched in &#946;-adaptin, a subunit of the PM adaptor complex of clathrin-coated pits and vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>). When lipid raft and non-raft membranes were separated in different fractions, the monomeric <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated species of AC8 clearly cosedimented with the raft marker, caveolin (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>E</italic><sub>1</sub></xref>). In contrast, the monomeric unglycosylated AC8 forms were enriched in non-raft membranes, along with &#946;-adaptin. In contrast to WT-AC8, the monomers of the leucine zipper AC8 mutants were predominantly enriched in non-raft membranes (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>E</italic><sub>2</sub> and <italic>E</italic><sub>3</sub>). The observations that the leucine zipper mutants appear no longer to be <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated and are excluded from lipid rafts suggest that <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation is responsible for raft-targeting and thereby the susceptibility to regulation by CCE.</p><p>To examine further the cellular distribution of an exemplar leucine zipper mutant (L/A1), we placed a fluorescent enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) tag upstream of the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus. This construct, when examined by fluorescence confocal microscopy, is excluded from the PM and localizes intracellularly in a reticular pattern closely resembling ER staining (Fig. 4<italic>F</italic>).</p><p>In our in vivo experiments, the design is such that stores are passively depleted with the SERCA inhibitor, TG, which triggers Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through CCE, upon the addition of extracellular CaCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>). However, to confirm that the effects were specifically mediated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through CCE channels and not by other means of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, we assessed in vivo cAMP accumulation and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the presence or absence of 2-APB, a specific inhibitor of CCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>). The experiments demonstrated a 60% inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in the presence of 2-APB (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>G</italic></xref>, black trace), as compared with DMSO control (gray trace). When these conditions were applied to the effect of CCE on AC8, the 2-APB-induced reduction in Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry was associated with a 60% inhibition of CCE-stimulation of AC8 activity, which directly confirms the role of CCE currents in the stimulation of AC8 activity (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>F</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Pharmacological inhibition of N-glycosylation of AC8 does not inhibit its activity.</title><p>To address directly whether <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation influences the raft-targeting and regulation of AC8, pharmacological tools were employed to inhibit the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation of AC8.</p><p>HEK-293 cells stably expressing AC8 were treated in vivo with drugs that interfere at different steps of the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylating pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>), and then membranes were fractionated into raft and non-raft fractions. Tunicamycin blocks the transfer of <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-glucosamine-1-phosphate (GlcNAc-1-P) from UDP-GlcNAc (UDP-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine) to dolichol phosphate in the first step of glycoprotein synthesis and therefore completely prevents the synthesis of all <italic>N</italic>-linked glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r50">50</xref>). Treatment with tunicamycin in vivo modified the subsequent migration properties of AC8 on SDS gels (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>) analogous to the in vitro removal of <italic>N</italic>-linked glycans using <italic>N</italic>-glycosidase F (compare with <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Upon tunicamycin treatment, the majority of AC8 migrates at 125 kDa (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>), which is compatible with the unglycosylated form of AC8 obtained with <italic>N</italic>-glycosidase F, rather than the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated 150 kDa species (cf. <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).

Given that following tunicamycin treatment, little of the AC8 appears in the light fractions, an increase in the more nonglycosylated AC8 might have been expected in the heavy fractions. The fact that this is not the case indicates that some of the AC8 must have been degraded. This is not surprising given that glycoproteins require carbohydrates for enhanced stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>). Nevertheless, AC8 is still fully active following tunicamycin treatment, indicating that, despite any degradation, sufficient levels of AC8 remained to generate a maximal response to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, both in vivo and in vitro (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p><p>More surprising was the fact that cells treated with tunicamycin were still responsive to CCE, given that the localization of AC8 in lipid rafts was considered essential for regulation by CCE.

As mentioned previously, it is also not possible to be convinced that glycosylation inhibitors are fully effective at precluding the glycosylation of all of the AC8. A more direct strategy therefore was adopted of generating mutants of AC8 that could not be <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated and testing their responsiveness to CCE in vivo. Such mutants ensure that none of the AC8 expressed is <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated, and the generation of these mutants circumvents the issues arising from the use of pharmacological inhibitors of <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation.</p><p>Three different asparagines are predicted to be <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated on AC8, N814, N818, and N885 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>).

Confocal analysis of live HEK-293 cells expressing EGFP-AC8 showed predominant PM targeting (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). PM targeting was verified by the substantial overlap in signals from cells where the PM had been labeled with CellMask Deep Red PM stain (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>).

These experiments revealed that the triple <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation-defective mutant of AC8 is fully responsive to CCE. Differences in maximal activities between the products of the transfected constructs can be attributed to modest differences in the levels of expression of the transfected enzymes. [A representative immunoblot is presented, where crude membranes prepared from the relevant HEK-293 cells were loaded in triplicate.

The NH<sub>2</sub>-terminally EGFP-tagged versions of WT AC8 and AC8<sup>N814Q/N818Q/N855E</sup> are also fully responsive to CCE (data not shown), which shows that the EGFP tag has no artifactual effects on their regulation.</p><p>The functional analysis of the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation-defective mutant of AC8 reinforces the data obtained with the pharmacological inhibitors, i.e., that <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation of AC8 is not necessary for the regulation of its enzymatic activities (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3<italic>B</italic></xref> and <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">4<italic>D</italic></xref>). Following tunicamycin treatment, the amount of AC8 in rafts was dramatically reduced (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>) and the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation-defective mutant of AC8 is mainly, if not exclusively, concentrated outside of rafts (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>). These data strongly suggest that <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation is a key element for the targeting of AC8 to lipid rafts. However, the fact that the AC8 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation-defective mutant can respond to CCE, despite its localization in non-raft membranes, was quite surprising, given the current view of the stimulation of AC8 by CCE, which envisages colocalization of AC8 and CCE channels in the same lipid raft microdomain.</p><p>The cholesterol-depleting agent M&#946;CD is widely employed to disrupt lipid rafts in cultured cells, because the bulky and hydrophobic cholesterol molecules of the membrane are extracted by the cavity of the cyclodextrin ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>). The residence of AC8 in lipid rafts was previously believed to be essential for its regulation by CCE, since disruption of rafts by M&#946;CD caused the loss of CCE responsiveness of AC8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>). Thus, in the light of our new findings, we compared the consequences for the regulation by CCE of wild-type and <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation mutant AC8 following M&#946;CD treatment. As expected, disruption of lipid rafts with M&#946;CD fully ablated the regulation of WT AC8 by CCE (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). Disruption of lipid rafts by M&#946;CD also results in a dramatic reduction of the levels of monomeric AC8 in lipid rafts, accompanied by an increase of monomeric AC8 in non-raft membranes (cf. <italic>fraction 2</italic> vs. <italic>7</italic> in <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). Strikingly, however, the regulation of the triple <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation mutant by CCE was also ablated by M&#946;CD treatment (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). This latter result is quite surprising, given that the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation-deficient mutant does not demonstrably reside in lipid rafts (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>). To address the possibility that M&#946;CD was exerting nonspecific effects unrelated to its extraction of cholesterol, cells were also treated with M&#946;CD/cholesterol complexes to restore cholesterol levels to M&#946;CD-treated cells. This latter treatment substantially restored sensitivity to CCE of both the WT and triple glycosylation mutant (cf. <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). Interestingly, the experiment further reveals that M&#946;CD treatment causes the basal, unstimulated activity of both AC8 species to be significantly higher than in control cells (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0005), which might suggest the dissociation of a raft-based protein that inhibits AC8 activity (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). Even in the M&#946;CD/cholesterol-treated cells, some residue of elevated basal activity remained. Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements in cell populations loaded with Fura-2 established that CCE was unaffected by the M&#946;CD treatment (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref>).</p><p>As an independent means of assessing the importance of raft integrity to the regulation of both WT and mutant AC8 by CCE, cells were treated with sphingomyelinase (an enzyme with sphingomyelin-specific phospholipase C activity), which, through degrading sphingomyelins, allows cholesterol to be reassimilated from the PM into the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>). Sphingomyelinase treatment resulted in a directly analogous increase in basal activity of both AC8 forms and a loss of stimulation by CCE (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>inset</italic>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This study has been the first to attempt to address the targeting and regulation of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated AC and a possible role of the leucine zipper in this process. Overall, the data suggest an essential role of <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation in the targeting of AC8 to lipid rafts and additionally that AC8 can respond to CCE even when residing outside of lipid rafts.</p><p>Initially, we endeavored to explore whether the leucine zipper motif present in the C1a domain of AC8 served a functional role in promoting the multimeric assembly and/or targeting of AC8. Mutagenesis (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>) showed that the integrity of the leucine zipper motif is important for promoting efficient <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation of monomeric AC8, while multimeric species persisted (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). Indeed, it turns out that the leucine zipper motif (spanning residues 429&#8211;458) is contained within the C1a catalytic domain of AC8, between the key aspartate residues (D416 and D460) that coordinate Mg<sup>2+</sup> atoms in the catalytic site (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). From the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of AC5, which is highly (60%) homologous to that of AC8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">51</xref>), it is clear that in the mature structure of associated C1a and C2a domains no leucine zipper coiled coil three-dimensional structure can be adopted. All of the leucines belong to the same &#945;-helix, are orientated toward the deep part of the C1a domain, and are involved in interactions with the side chains of other amino acids, so that they are not exposed to the surface and are not available for interactions with side chains of amino acids of other proteins. Therefore, it seems likely that during the processing of ACs the leucine zipper sequences are a basis for interaction with chaperone molecules, and that by such an interaction the correct trafficking of the protein is controlled. In this regard, it is known that one of the molecular mechanisms whereby chaperones act is through the interaction of coiled coils with hydrophobic regions of unfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>). Mutation of the leucine zipper residues results in forms that are unglycosylated and are excluded from lipid rafts (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>E</italic></xref>), and, indeed, they do not even reach the PM (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>F</italic></xref>) and so are grossly mistargeted. These data led us to speculate that <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation of AC8 is required for, or reflects, the targeting of AC8 into lipid rafts.</p><p>A combination of mutagenesis studies and experiments using specific inhibitors of <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation revealed that <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation is not required for the regulation of AC8 by Ca<sup>2+</sup> in vitro. This was somewhat unexpected because <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation has previously been shown to influence the regulatory properties of AC6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r56">56</xref>). However, <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation does affect the targeting of AC8. Although confocal microscopy revealed that <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation was not required to target AC8 to the PM (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>), fractionation studies showed that, unlike AC8, the AC8 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation-deficient mutant was excluded from lipid rafts (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>). The cytoplasmic domains of AC8 were previously demonstrated to be important for raft targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). Those data led us to propose that protein-protein interactions involving the cytoplasmic domains of AC8 govern targeting into lipid raft domains. However, the AC8 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation-deficient mutant possesses intact cytoplasmic domains, and yet it is excluded from lipid rafts. It is therefore possible that <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation is important for the mediation of any protein-protein interaction (possibly through the cytoplasmic domains) that targets AC8 into rafts.</p><p>Despite being apparently excluded from lipid rafts, the AC8 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation-deficient mutant is fully responsive to CCE (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>D</italic></xref>). This was a surprise, since it was previously believed that the residence of AC8 in lipid rafts was necessary for its regulation by CCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>). This conclusion had been based on experiments in which the regulation of AC8 by CCE was lost following the disruption of rafts using M&#946;CD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>). Indeed, again in the present study, M&#946;CD treatment ablated the wild-type AC8 response to CCE (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). Furthermore, we now show that M&#946;CD treatment moves AC8 out of rafts (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). However, the regulation of the non-raft-residing <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation mutant of AC8 was also ablated following M&#946;CD treatment. These data raise a number of possibilities. <italic>1</italic>) The AC8 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation mutant depends on the integrity of lipid rafts to respond to CCE, despite not being localized directly&#8212;or measurably by these methods&#8212;within them. Protein-protein interactions have previously been implicated in the targeting of AC8 into lipid raft domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). It is conceivable that the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation-deficient mutant of AC8 still associates loosely with lipid raft associated proteins through such an interaction, an interaction that is destroyed following M&#946;CD treatment. This model could also help explain the increase in the basal activity that is observed following M&#946;CD treatment with the AC8 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation-deficient mutants and wild-type AC8, for instance, reflecting a direct or indirect association between AC8 and a putative lipid raft associated protein, which exerts a tonic inhibitory influence on basal activity. <italic>2</italic>) Lipid rafts are not static structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>), and it is conceivable that AC8 moves between raft and non-raft membranes. Our fractionation studies reveal a biochemical&#8212; necessarily artificial&#8212;snapshot of the membrane distribution of AC8, which cannot address the dynamics of AC8-raft association. It is therefore possible that, unlike the wild-type AC8, the AC8 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation-deficient mutant associates with lipid rafts but is more mobile/dynamic in these associations, which makes it harder to detect its presence in biochemically isolated raft domains. Techniques such as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) could compare the relative mobility of wild-type AC8 and the AC8 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation-deficient mutant. <italic>3</italic>) A final possibility is that M&#946;CD exerts a nonspecific effect, which is independent of lipid raft integrity, and that raft localization is not at all implicated in the regulation of AC8 by CCE. This possibility seems to be excluded by the reversibility of the M&#946;CD effect by treating depleted cells with an M&#946;CD/cholesterol mixture (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). Mimicking of the M&#946;CD ablation of CCE responsiveness by the sphingomyelinase treatment (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>inset</italic>) speaks very strongly to the critical role of the lipid environment in maintaining responsiveness to CCE. Sphingomyelinase, by producing ceramide and phosphorylcholine, allows cholesterol to be removed from the PM less harshly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>) and strongly underlines the importance of these cholesterol/sphingomyelin platforms for the integrity of the CCE-AC8 interaction.</p><p>The present study has illuminated the trafficking and function of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive adenylyl cyclase. The leucine zipper turns out to be a critical targeting motif, although the protein or chaperones with which it may associate to ensure its appropriate processing remain to be determined. Clearly, if this motif is mutated, AC8 is not processed&#8212;or <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated&#8212;appropriately. Further down the chain, <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation seems essential for stable raft localization; however, demonstrably stable, or biochemically robust, raft association is not essential for the regulation of AC8 by CCE. Consequently, we are refining our understanding of raft association of AC8 so that whereas the integrity of lipid rafts continues to be essential, transient or ephemeral associations may be adequate to allow the regulation of AC8 by CCE.</p></sec><sec><title>GRANTS</title><p>This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust.
