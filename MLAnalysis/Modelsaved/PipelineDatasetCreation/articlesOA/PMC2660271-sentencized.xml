<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adenylyl cyclase 8 (AC8) is a Ca2+ stimulated isoform that displays a selective regulation by capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE), the process whereby the entry of Ca2+ into cells is triggered by the emptying of intracellular stores. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Adenylyl cyclase type 8 (AC8) typifies the membrane-bound enzymes in that it is susceptible to regulation by a number of stimulatory and inhibitory factors, which underpins its role in homeostatic integration (55). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>AC8 is primarily expressed in the brain; it is very prominent in the hippocampus and cerebellum (21, 32), and it is stimulated by Ca2+ acting through calmodulin (3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, in nonexcitable cells, the regulation of AC8 by cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) is orchestrated by a selective dependence on capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE) (13), the process whereby Ca2+ enters the cell in response to the depletion of internal Ca2+ stores, either directly by phospholipase C-linked agonists or passively, by pharmacological inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) reuptake pumps (39). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Other means of elevating [Ca2+]i, such as release from internal Ca2+ stores, or non-capacitative entry mechanisms such as those triggered by 1-oleyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) and arachidonic acid, are ineffective at stimulating AC8 activity (13, 14, 30, 44). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>This selectivity of AC8 for CCE, over other means of elevating [Ca2+]i, has been proposed to reflect a close apposition with CCE channels (13, 19). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The cellular basis for the dependence of AC8 on CCE is still uncertain, but it is believed to at least partly reflect a colocalization of AC8 with CCE entry sites within specialized microdomains of the plasma membrane (PM), the lipid rafts (13, 48). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Lipid rafts are variously considered to be static or dynamic domains of the membrane that are enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Lipid rafts can form invaginations of the PM caused by constrictions organized by polymers of the protein caveolin, which are referred to as “caveolae” (52, 53). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Rafts and caveolae, either passively or actively, accumulate a subset of membrane proteins (24, 41, 46). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>However, it must be acknowledged that a universal consensus of precisely how this concentration of signaling molecules is achieved, or even its regulatory significance, is not agreed (7, 20, 26, 28, 33). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Candidate CCE components such as stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and transient receptor potential channels, as well as Ca2+-sensitive ACs, receptors, and G proteins, have been detected in lipid rafts following biochemical separation of membrane extracts (7, 22, 29, 38, 48). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The localization of Ca2+-sensitive ACs in rafts as an essential component of their regulation by CCE, is suggested since the disruption of rafts by cholesterol extraction with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) ablates the regulation of AC8 by CCE (15, 48), without affecting the CCE process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Thus an essential part of understanding the regulation of AC seems to rely on understanding its trafficking and organization in the PM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Because ACs are complex molecules, of over 1,200 amino acids, comprising two repeated cassettes of six-transmembrane spanning domains interspersed with two separated catalytic interfaces, this topic has received little attention. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The first paper on this subject showed that the two six-transmembrane domains must associate to traffic the molecule to the PM, and in so doing they bring the two catalytic domains into functional apposition (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the cytoplasmic domains of both AC5 (a Ca2+-inhibitable species) and AC8 were revealed to be critical for targeting to rafts (8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>However, nothing else is known regarding the mechanisms through which ACs are targeted to specific cellular compartments. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the trafficking and assembly of AC8 into raft domains of the PM has been addressed, with particular regard to the role of oligomerization and N-glycosylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>A leucine zipper motif is seen to play a key role in preventing mistargeting of the enzyme; a multistep process is revealed including a central role for N-linked glycosylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the necessity for the integrity of lipid rafts for the regulation by CCE of AC8 is clarified. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>However, the fact that the AC8 N-glycosylation-defective mutant can respond to CCE, despite its localization in non-raft membranes, was quite surprising, given the current view of the stimulation of AC8 by CCE, which envisages colocalization of AC8 and CCE channels in the same lipid raft microdomain. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>The cholesterol-depleting agent MβCD is widely employed to disrupt lipid rafts in cultured cells, because the bulky and hydrophobic cholesterol molecules of the membrane are extracted by the cavity of the cyclodextrin ring (36). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>The residence of AC8 in lipid rafts was previously believed to be essential for its regulation by CCE, since disruption of rafts by MβCD caused the loss of CCE responsiveness of AC8 (48). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Thus, in the light of our new findings, we compared the consequences for the regulation by CCE of wild-type and N-glycosylation mutant AC8 following MβCD treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>As expected, disruption of lipid rafts with MβCD fully ablated the regulation of WT AC8 by CCE (Fig. 5A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Disruption of lipid rafts by MβCD also results in a dramatic reduction of the levels of monomeric AC8 in lipid rafts, accompanied by an increase of monomeric AC8 in non-raft membranes (cf. fraction 2 vs. 7 in Fig. 5B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, however, the regulation of the triple N-glycosylation mutant by CCE was also ablated by MβCD treatment (Fig. 5A). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the experiment further reveals that MβCD treatment causes the basal, unstimulated activity of both AC8 species to be significantly higher than in control cells (P &lt; 0.0005), which might suggest the dissociation of a raft-based protein that inhibits AC8 activity (Fig. 5A). </plain></SENT>

</text></p></sec></sec></SecTag><SecTag type="DISCUSS"><sec><title><text><SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>This study has been the first to attempt to address the targeting and regulation of a Ca2+-regulated AC and a possible role of the leucine zipper in this process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Overall, the data suggest an essential role of N-glycosylation in the targeting of AC8 to lipid rafts and additionally that AC8 can respond to CCE even when residing outside of lipid rafts. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Initially, we endeavored to explore whether the leucine zipper motif present in the C1a domain of AC8 served a functional role in promoting the multimeric assembly and/or targeting of AC8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Mutagenesis (Fig. 2B) showed that the integrity of the leucine zipper motif is important for promoting efficient N-linked glycosylation of monomeric AC8, while multimeric species persisted (Fig. 2B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Indeed, it turns out that the leucine zipper motif (spanning residues 429–458) is contained within the C1a catalytic domain of AC8, between the key aspartate residues (D416 and D460) that coordinate Mg2+ atoms in the catalytic site (Fig. 4A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>From the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of AC5, which is highly (60%) homologous to that of AC8 (51), it is clear that in the mature structure of associated C1a and C2a domains no leucine zipper coiled coil three-dimensional structure can be adopted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>All of the leucines belong to the same α-helix, are orientated toward the deep part of the C1a domain, and are involved in interactions with the side chains of other amino acids, so that they are not exposed to the surface and are not available for interactions with side chains of amino acids of other proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it seems likely that during the processing of ACs the leucine zipper sequences are a basis for interaction with chaperone molecules, and that by such an interaction the correct trafficking of the protein is controlled. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>In this regard, it is known that one of the molecular mechanisms whereby chaperones act is through the interaction of coiled coils with hydrophobic regions of unfolded proteins (31, 45). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Mutation of the leucine zipper residues results in forms that are unglycosylated and are excluded from lipid rafts (Fig. 2E), and, indeed, they do not even reach the PM (Fig. 4F) and so are grossly mistargeted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>These data led us to speculate that N-glycosylation of AC8 is required for, or reflects, the targeting of AC8 into lipid rafts. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>A combination of mutagenesis studies and experiments using specific inhibitors of N-glycosylation revealed that N-glycosylation is not required for the regulation of AC8 by Ca2+ in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>This was somewhat unexpected because N-glycosylation has previously been shown to influence the regulatory properties of AC6 (56). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>However, N-glycosylation does affect the targeting of AC8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Although confocal microscopy revealed that N-glycosylation was not required to target AC8 to the PM (Fig. 4B), fractionation studies showed that, unlike AC8, the AC8 N-glycosylation-deficient mutant was excluded from lipid rafts (Fig. 4C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>The cytoplasmic domains of AC8 were previously demonstrated to be important for raft targeting (8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Those data led us to propose that protein-protein interactions involving the cytoplasmic domains of AC8 govern targeting into lipid raft domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>However, the AC8 N-glycosylation-deficient mutant possesses intact cytoplasmic domains, and yet it is excluded from lipid rafts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>It is therefore possible that N-glycosylation is important for the mediation of any protein-protein interaction (possibly through the cytoplasmic domains) that targets AC8 into rafts. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Despite being apparently excluded from lipid rafts, the AC8 N-glycosylation-deficient mutant is fully responsive to CCE (Fig. 4D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>This was a surprise, since it was previously believed that the residence of AC8 in lipid rafts was necessary for its regulation by CCE (48). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>This conclusion had been based on experiments in which the regulation of AC8 by CCE was lost following the disruption of rafts using MβCD (48). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>Indeed, again in the present study, MβCD treatment ablated the wild-type AC8 response to CCE (Fig. 5A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we now show that MβCD treatment moves AC8 out of rafts (Fig. 5B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>However, the regulation of the non-raft-residing N-glycosylation mutant of AC8 was also ablated following MβCD treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>These data raise a number of possibilities. 1) The AC8 N-glycosylation mutant depends on the integrity of lipid rafts to respond to CCE, despite not being localized directly—or measurably by these methods—within them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>Protein-protein interactions have previously been implicated in the targeting of AC8 into lipid raft domains (8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>It is conceivable that the N-glycosylation-deficient mutant of AC8 still associates loosely with lipid raft associated proteins through such an interaction, an interaction that is destroyed following MβCD treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>This model could also help explain the increase in the basal activity that is observed following MβCD treatment with the AC8 N-glycosylation-deficient mutants and wild-type AC8, for instance, reflecting a direct or indirect association between AC8 and a putative lipid raft associated protein, which exerts a tonic inhibitory influence on basal activity. 2) Lipid rafts are not static structures (26, 41), and it is conceivable that AC8 moves between raft and non-raft membranes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>Our fractionation studies reveal a biochemical— necessarily artificial—snapshot of the membrane distribution of AC8, which cannot address the dynamics of AC8-raft association. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>It is therefore possible that, unlike the wild-type AC8, the AC8 N-glycosylation-deficient mutant associates with lipid rafts but is more mobile/dynamic in these associations, which makes it harder to detect its presence in biochemically isolated raft domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>Techniques such as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) could compare the relative mobility of wild-type AC8 and the AC8 N-glycosylation-deficient mutant. 3) A final possibility is that MβCD exerts a nonspecific effect, which is independent of lipid raft integrity, and that raft localization is not at all implicated in the regulation of AC8 by CCE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>This possibility seems to be excluded by the reversibility of the MβCD effect by treating depleted cells with an MβCD/cholesterol mixture (Fig. 5A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>Mimicking of the MβCD ablation of CCE responsiveness by the sphingomyelinase treatment (Fig. 5A, inset) speaks very strongly to the critical role of the lipid environment in maintaining responsiveness to CCE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>Sphingomyelinase, by producing ceramide and phosphorylcholine, allows cholesterol to be removed from the PM less harshly (34) and strongly underlines the importance of these cholesterol/sphingomyelin platforms for the integrity of the CCE-AC8 interaction. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>The present study has illuminated the trafficking and function of a Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>The leucine zipper turns out to be a critical targeting motif, although the protein or chaperones with which it may associate to ensure its appropriate processing remain to be determined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>Clearly, if this motif is mutated, AC8 is not processed—or N-glycosylated—appropriately. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>Further down the chain, N-glycosylation seems essential for stable raft localization; however, demonstrably stable, or biochemically robust, raft association is not essential for the regulation of AC8 by CCE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>Consequently, we are refining our understanding of raft association of AC8 so that whereas the integrity of lipid rafts continues to be essential, transient or ephemeral associations may be adequate to allow the regulation of AC8 by CCE. </plain></SENT>
