<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The four distinct dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1 to DENV-4) belong to the family Flaviviridae and are among the most important vector-borne pathogens of humans, causing up to 100 million cases annually. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The only sylvatic DENV serotype that has been isolated in Africa is DENV-2. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic data suggests that sylvatic DENV are the ancestors of those viruses that now circulate endemically in human populations [2]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>Notably, our molecular clock analyses suggest that DENV-2 may been in Malaysian monkeys for at least 60 years. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>It is also noteworthy that this sylvatic isolate of DENV-2 was associated with severe disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Specifically, the virus was isolated from a single patient with DHF who had been on vacation in an area of the country where large numbers of dengue cases have been reported. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Further, the sentinel monkey study site of Rudnick and colleagues was located in the same general area along the southern slopes of the Main Range in peninsula Malaysia, where the patient spent the 4 weeks prior to onset of illness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Although we were unable to ascertain if the sylvatic DENV-2 we isolated was circulating widely in the area our patient visited, the potential for a re-introduction of ancestral DENV2- into the human population should be evaluated [1]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of a sylvatic dengue virus causing DHF, providing a unique opportunity to investigate whether this strain can cause DHF in non-human primates either as a primary or secondary infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Non-human primates have been utilized to study some aspects of dengue infection, but in general the read-outs have been the level of viremia as well as other non-specific indicators of the establishment of an infection, together with the production of neutralizing antibodies [14]–[16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>In addition, the infecting viruses have not been of sylvatic origin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>The identification of this sylvatic strain provides hope of being able to induce features of DHF such as thrombocytopenia, vascular leakage and hemoconcentration. </plain></SENT>
