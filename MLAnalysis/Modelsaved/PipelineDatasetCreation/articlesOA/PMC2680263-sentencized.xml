</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Drug treatments for overactive bladder (OAB) may fail because of non-adherence or discontinuation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>These issues are frequently observed in clinical practice and were exemplified in a recent evaluation of both the extended-release (ER) and immediate-release formulations of the most commonly used antimuscarinic agents for OAB, oxybutynin and tolterodine, in a regional managed healthcare plan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>One of the conclusions was that persistence overall was low and more patient-reported data on outcomes of OAB drug therapy are needed to improve understanding of non-adherence and discontinuations (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In particular, the patient's perception of effectiveness and tolerability may be a useful tool to predict whether patients stay on treatment or not. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Amongst newer antimuscarinic agents, darifenacin has been identified as having particularly high in vitro selectivity for the M3 muscarinic receptor subtype thought to be responsible for detrusor contraction (2,3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The efficacy, tolerability and safety of darifenacin in the treatment of OAB are well-established. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>For some OAB patients, switching to another antimuscarinic could potentially achieve improvement in their symptoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>However, data demonstrating that patients already dissatisfied with one particular OAB treatment may benefit from the use of another agent are often lacking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Here, we evaluated patient reports of treatment benefit and satisfaction with treatment, clinical efficacy, tolerability and safety parameters during darifenacin treatment in an open-label, 12-week study in patients who had expressed dissatisfaction with efficacy and/or side effects with prior treatment with ER formulations of oxybutynin or tolterodine for OAB. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>These data are supplemented by a novel measure of patient satisfaction, a variable which, in clinical practice, can be directly related to patient adherence and persistence with therapy across diverse medical specialities. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>In this study involving patients who expressed dissatisfaction with prior OAB treatment with oxybutynin ER or tolterodine ER because of insufficient efficacy or tolerability problems or both, open-label darifenacin administration for 12 weeks resulted in improvements in patient perceptions of their bladder condition that correlated with improvements in clinical symptoms (micturition frequency, urgency and UUI episodes). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>These improvements were accompanied by a favourable tolerability profile, resulting in a large majority of patients (approximately 86%) reporting satisfaction with darifenacin treatment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>The improvements observed in this study were comparable to those previously reported in other studies with antimuscarinic agents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>For example, the mean PPBC score decreased from baseline 4.6 to 3.1 after 12 weeks of darifenacin treatment in the present study, and from 4.4 to 2.9 after 12 weeks of solifenacin treatment in the VOLT study (5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>In addition, the reductions in micturition frequency, urgency and UUI episodes were comparable to those seen in the previous darifenacin studies using the same dosing regimen (6,7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>OAB symptom improvements in our study were also comparable to the findings reported in the VESlcare Efficacy and Research Study US (VERSUS) study, in which patients dissatisfied with tolterodine treatment were switched to solifenacin (8), and a long-term extension study in which patients were permitted to switch to open-label solifenacin following double-blind tolterodine treatment (9). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>The incidence and nature of AEs reported in this study were consistent with those reported in earlier clinical trials with darifenacin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>These results are further supported by high levels of persistence with darifenacin therapy and well-maintained treatment benefit in previous long-term studies (over 2 years in duration) (10,11). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>This open-label study also evaluated levels of patient satisfaction via the use of a novel exploratory satisfaction scale (PSTB questionnaire), which was designed to resemble real-life questions posed by a physician. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Patients were required to recall their experiences of previous antimuscarinic treatment at baseline, while PSTB responses were recorded at the end of darifenacin treatment to determine whether these patients expressing dissatisfaction with their previous antimuscarinic achieved satisfaction with darifenacin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>PSTB results indicated that more than 85% of patients expressed satisfaction with darifenacin treatment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Patient satisfaction can be regarded as an important indicator of the quality of care across diverse medical specialities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Satisfaction with treatment is influenced by a combination of many factors, which go beyond traditional measures assessed in clinical trials (i.e. improvement in symptoms, and the type, frequency and severity of side effects). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Interest in patient perceptions of the efficacy of their treatment has grown in recent years, resulting in the recent development by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of guidance for the pharmaceutical industry on the assessment of patient-reported outcomes in clinical trials (12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Despite this, a consensus on the best approach to assessing treatment satisfaction in clinical practice is yet to be reached. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>This study presents a novel method to assess patient satisfaction directly, which takes into account the real-life clinical situations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>In the majority of patients (65.8%), previous treatment was still ongoing at the time of study entry, but in the remaining cases, previous treatment could have been discontinued up to a year before study entry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>In clinical practice, visits to the physician commonly occur at intervals of 6–8 weeks or longer, and consequently, the physician may not see the patient within 1 week after a patient’s decision to terminate treatment (the period recommended for FDA analysis). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Under these circumstances, the physician must rely on the patient’s recall of his or her treatment satisfaction, in a similar manner to the conduct of the present study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the PSTB questionnaire provided a snapshot of patient perceptions of darifenacin treatment at study end, resembling the situation encountered in routine physician visits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>However, administering the questionnaire during a single visit does not permit assessment of change in treatment perception over time (or between one treatment and the next), and this novel scale would benefit from further validation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>There are some weaknesses in this study that should be noted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Patient satisfaction seen in this study may reflect a response to a change in treatment, rather than the specific drug per se, coupled with satisfaction arising from a perceived improvement in overall care and increased monitoring associated with participation in a clinical study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>The drug costs of the previous treatments may also have contributed to the lower satisfaction with the previous therapy, compared with free treatment provided during clinical trial participation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>A longitudinal study design with consecutive treatments and accurate recording of patient perceptions of outcomes immediately after terminating each treatment would be required to address accurately the question whether more patients are satisfied following darifenacin treatment than with their previous treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>As the discontinuation of prior ER antimuscarinic treatment could have taken place up to 1 year before entry into the present study, patient recall of satisfaction with the prior therapy may be unreliable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>However, despite the low numbers of patients still receiving their previous antimuscarinic therapy at study entry (before washout), primary outcomes in this subset and the total study population were almost identical. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>It would also be of interest to determine whether patients switching to darifenacin remain satisfied with continued treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Similarly, further studies are warranted to determine whether the proportion of satisfied patients and the duration of satisfaction differ between antimuscarinic treatments. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>The PSTB was developed with patient input and piloted with patients to ensure that patients understood the questionnaire items and that the items measured parameters that were relevant to patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>However, it has not been thoroughly validated as per the FDA draft guidance for developing new patient-reported outcomes in clinical trials (12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed to establish the validity and reliability of the PSTB. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Patient-reported outcome measures are increasingly being viewed as important measures of treatment success, and indeed some have been described as better than objective measures (such as urodynamic testing) for gauging treatment efficacy (13,14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>The present study utilised both a well-known, validated instrument (the PPBC) and a novel exploratory questionnaire (the PSTB), with both tools indicating significant levels of benefit from darifenacin treatment relative to baseline, regardless of the previous treatment received. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>These tools are particularly important for observing outcomes from the patient’s perspective, as they reflect subjective views of treatment impact on all aspects of daily living and individuals vary substantially in their desired outcomes and priorities or goals of treatment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the findings of this study indicate that darifenacin 7.5/15 mg qd treatment can be associated with significant improvements from baseline in OAB symptoms and patient's perception of treatment outcome in patients who have expressed dissatisfaction with prior ER antimuscarinic therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Thus, darifenacin provides a valuable treatment option for such patients. </plain></SENT>
