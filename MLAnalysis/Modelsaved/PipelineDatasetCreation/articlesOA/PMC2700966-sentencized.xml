</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Fragment-based drug discovery relies on a simple premise: identify small-molecule fragments that bind to a target region of the protein and then evolve or link them to create a larger high-affinity molecule. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>To a first approximation, the binding free-energies of fragments bound in non-overlapping poses are additive [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Therefore, linking two such fragments with millimolar affinities (4 kcal*mol−1) will yield a single molecule with micromolar affinity (8 kcal/mol), which is of sufficient affinity to serve as a “hit” for lead optimization [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Since the chemical space spanned by small fragments is orders of magnitude smaller than that spanned by molecules of sufficient size to be hits, it becomes feasible to screen a fragment library representative of the full extent of chemical space [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Nature imposes an upper limit on the contribution per ligand heavy atom to the binding free-energy [4], commonly referred to as “ligand efficiency” (LE) [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>This limit means that even the best fragments (LE 0.4–0.5 kcal*mol−1 per heavy atom [3]) still have weak affinities for their targets, making their screening by traditional assays difficult. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Consequently, fragment-based drug discovery relies on sensitive biophysical methods to detect fragment binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Among these methods are NMR spectroscopy (“SAR-by-NMR”) [6] and x-ray crystallography [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>These two methods additionally benefit from the fact that they yield structural information about fragment binding poses, which is useful for confirming that two fragments indeed bind to two adjacent sites and can be productively linked. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Despite their utility, there are significant time, labor, and materials costs associated with experimental fragment-based drug discovery approaches. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Computational approaches to fragment-based drug discovery hold out the promise of mitigating the costs of experimental fragment-based drug discovery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Currently, in computational approaches the protein is assumed to be rigid and fragments sample the surface of the rigid protein using an energy function that models the solvent environment as a continuum [8]–[12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>As a result, these methods are limited in their ability to accurately account for protein conformational heterogeneity and solvation effects, contributions that are essential to compute free energies of binding [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In reality, proteins can accommodate ligands by undergoing conformational changes [14],[15], and water plays an important role in protein∶ligand binding affinity [16]–[18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Significant advances have been made toward incorporating protein flexibility, for example by screening against multiple different rigid protein conformations [19]–[21], and toward more accurate modeling of solvation effects in energy functions [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, approximations used in computational approaches to date can still limit the accuracy of fragment placement and scoring, and, ultimately, the determination of the most suitable fragment for a selected region of the protein. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>All-atom explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins give an atomic-level-of-detail description of the motions of both protein and water atoms at relevant temperature and pressure [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>MD samples a Boltzmann distribution of thermally accessible protein conformations, and with the ability of MD to reach the nanosecond timescale, the sampled conformations can include changes in sidechain dihedral angles as well as loop motions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, MD simulation-based methods are able to determine the absolute binding free energy of a ligand to a protein to, in the best cases, within RT of the experimental value [15], [24]–[32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>However, such MD free-energy calculations are computationally expensive, limiting MD simulations from being used directly for high-throughput in silico screening. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Toward overcoming present limitations in fragment-based computational drug design we describe a new method that combines ideas from experimental fragment-based drug discovery with all-atom explicit-solvent MD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The method (SILCS: Site Identification by Ligand Competitive Saturation) involves computationally immersing a protein in an aqueous solution simultaneously containing different types of small molecules, with each at a concentration of ∼1 M. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The protein+small molecule+water system is then subjected to multiple MD simulations allowing for competitive binding of the small molecules to the protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Snapshots from the MD trajectories are combined to generate 3D probability maps (FragMaps) that reveal what types of functionalities bind most strongly to different parts of the protein surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Because they are generated from MD simulations, SILCS FragMaps incorporate both protein mobility, with a Boltzmann distribution of conformations, and atomic-level solvation effects, thereby yielding FragMaps that represent rigorous free energy distributions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Notably, the method requires minimal time, labor, and materials compared to experimental approaches. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>As a test case, SILCS FragMaps were generated for the BTB domain of the BCL-6 oncoprotein [33],[34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The SILCS FragMaps, from MD simulations initiated using the BCL-6 conformation in the BCL-6∶SMRT protein∶peptide cocrystal, recapitulate the pattern of aliphatic, aromatic, hydrogen bond donor, and hydrogen bond acceptor interactions seen at the BCL-6∶SMRT cocrystal interface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Additionally, these same FragMaps also recapitulate the interaction pattern seen in the BCL-6∶BCOR protein∶peptide cocrystal, which has important differences arising from sequence and structure variation in the C-terminal halves of the SMRT and BCOR peptides. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the simulations sample the BCL-6 His116 sidechain conformation seen in the BCL-6∶BCOR cocrystal, a conformation that is required for hydrogen bonding with BCOR Ser508 and significantly different from that in the SMRT-bound BCL-6 MD starting conformation, emphasizing the ability of the presented approach to account for protein flexibility. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>The SILCS methodology is as follows: immerse the protein in a high-concentration (∼1 M) aqueous solution of multiple small molecules, run multiple nanosecond-length MD simulations of the composite protein+small molecule+water system, compute probability maps for small molecule and water binding around the protein for each simulation, and combine probability maps of the same type from all simulations to generate a single probability map (FragMap) of each fragment type. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Once generated the FragMaps have the potential to be used to qualitatively inform the assembly of an inhibitor or as docking grids for high-throughput in silico screening. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Two important aspects of the methodology to consider prior to generation and analysis of the FragMaps are the choice of small molecules and overcoming small molecule aggregation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="s2a"><title><text><SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Choice of small molecules </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The majority of moieties on drug-like molecules that target proteins fall into four classes: aliphatic, aromatic, hydrogen bond donor, and hydrogen bond acceptor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>This reflects the relatively limited chemical diversity of amino acid sidechains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Salt bridges between two amino acids are a special case of hydrogen bonding, since the interaction is never directly between two charged heavy atoms but between a negatively-charged oxygen and the proton on a positively-charged nitrogen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Fragment libraries generated from existing drugs and drug-like molecules reflect this limited diversity, being largely composed of hydrogen bond donors consisting of amides, hydrogen bond acceptors of carbonyls and ethers, hydrophobic groups of small-length aliphatic chains, and aromatic/cyclic groups of benzene [35]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>The first goal in the choice of small molecules for use in this initial implementation of SILCS was to minimize the set of fragments so as to be able to maximize their individual concentrations, which in turn maximizes binding and helps convergence on the MD timescale. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>To this end, a minimalist small-molecule set was selected that contains hydrophobic aliphatic moieties, aromatic moieties, hydrogen bond donors, and hydrogen bond acceptors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Propane was chosen to represent hydrophobic aliphatic groups because the termini are small enough to fit into cavities only large enough to accommodate a methyl group, while the molecule itself is large enough to disrupt the hydrogen bonding structure of water so as to induce strong hydrophobic binding [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Additionally, unlike longer-chain alkanes, propane is essentially a rigid body excepting the rotation of the two terminal methyl groups, and thus convergence of internal degrees of freedom is not an issue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Benzene was selected to represent aromatic groups as it occurs in over 40% of drug-like compounds and is four times more common than the next most-common aromatic moiety [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Finally, water was used as a small molecule that contains both hydrogen bond donating and accepting capabilities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Water is at a concentration of 55 M in solution and also has no internal conformational degrees of freedom, again promoting convergence on the MD timescale. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Other small-molecule possibilities for hydrogen bond donors and acceptors include acetone, formaldehyde, and small amides, but these would necessarily be at much lower concentrations than water, hindering convergence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Additionally, they contain several different functionalities, such as the methyl groups in acetone and the combined hydrogen bond donor and acceptor moieties in an amide, which can make binding analysis more difficult. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>The second goal in a choice of small molecules for use in SILCS was to minimize their sizes to maximize convergence, both by facilitating reversible binding on the MD timescale and allowing for fast diffusion through the bulk solvent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Even with a high-ligand efficiency, i.e. 0.4 kcal*mol−1 per heavy atom, fragments consisting of 3–6 heavy atoms will have binding affinities of only 1.2 to 2.4 kcal*mol−1 (100 millimolar to 10 millimolar). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>While such weak binding affinity can be a liability in an experimental approach as it may push the limits of detection, it is an asset in the SILCS approach, allowing for ligand exchange from a binding site on the MD timescale, facilitating the implementation of a competitive in silico binding assay. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Another benefit of molecules having only 3–6 heavy atoms is that their high diffusion rates lead to quick mixing and rapid translation to different regions of the protein surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Thus, small molecules of minimal molecular size are beneficial both because of rapid binding exchange with the protein and rapid diffusion around the protein. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>It should be emphasized that the SILCS approach is amenable to a wide range of fragment-like small molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>The fragment molecules selected for the present study were chosen for computational expediency, as proof-of-principle, and because they represent a minimal set that includes aliphatic, aromatic, hydrogen bond donor, and hydrogen bond acceptor moieties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Larger fragments and/or fragments with a greater diversity of functional groups may prove useful in developing a more fine-grained classification of preferred functionalities beyond simply aliphatic, aromatic, hydrogen bond donor, and hydrogen bond acceptor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>These may encompass different types of hydrogen bonding groups such as ethers, amides, amines, esters, and carbonyls, as well as heterocyclic aromatics and molecules with halides, to name some possibilities. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title><text><SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Overcoming small-molecule aggregation </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>To ensure binding of small low-affinity molecules, a high concentration (∼1 M) of each small molecule is used in the simulations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>However, a simulation of a solution of 1 M propane and 1 M benzene in water is prone to severe hydrophobic aggregation, as seen in the intermolecular carbon…carbon (C…C) radial distribution function g(r), which traces the relative probability of observing this pair of atoms at a given separation distance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>The C…C g(r) has a large peak at 5 Å (Figure 1A , “no repulsion”), associated with the distance between carbons in two fragments that are in direct contact. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>This trace slowly decays with increasing distance, reflecting the fact that in an aggregate in water, it is much more likely to have two hydrophobic fragments adjacent to each other than at a larger separation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Such aggregation drastically reduces the effective concentration of the fragments, which in turn hampers sampling of the protein surface and prevents SILCS FragMap convergence. </plain></SENT>

</text></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000435.g001"/></fig></SecTag><p><text><SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Because SILCS is a computational approach, it is possible to modify the interactions between hydrophobic/aromatic fragments to prevent aggregation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>This can be done by introducing a repulsive interaction energy between fragments that comes into effect only when two fragments come closer than a given interaction distance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>This repulsive interaction energy is only applied to selected fragment∶fragment interactions, while all fragment∶water, fragment∶protein, water∶water, water∶protein, and protein∶protein interactions remain unperturbed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>For convenience, the repulsive interaction is implemented using the Lennard-Jones force field term [37] by adding an additional massless particle to the geometric center of each benzene molecule and the central carbon of each propane molecule. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>These particles serve as interaction sites for the inter-fragment repulsive interaction energy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Lennard-Jones parameters (ε = −0.01 kcal/mol; R min = 24.0 Å) combined with a switching function [38] operating between 5 Å and 8 Å yield an energy vs. distance profile that is purely repulsive (Figure 1B ). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>With this additional repulsive interaction energy in effect, even at very high concentrations the small molecules will not aggregate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Thus, in the simulation of 1 M propane and 1 M benzene in water, the g(r) contact peak at 5 Å disappears, indicating the lack of direct intermolecular C…C contacts, and the flat g(r) trace at larger distances indicates a homogeneous distribution of molecules in solution (Figure 1A , “with repulsion”). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>In principle, such a repulsive term can make hydrophobic fragments that associate with the protein surface compete unphysically with other directly adjacent hydrophobic fragments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>For example, the form of the repulsive potential (Figure 1B ) will prevent the formation of a stacked benzene dimer in a binding pocket. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>It will, however, allow for two benzene molecules to simultaneously bind unimpeded in two adjacent pockets on the protein surface. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>The BTB domain of the BCL-6 protein was chosen as a test case for the SILCS method because of several favorable properties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>The first is that it has two-fold symmetry, with two identical symmetry-related binding sites [33], allowing for measuring convergence of fragment sampling by analyzing the two-fold symmetry in the SILCS FragMaps. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>A second reason is that the binding of native ligands to the two binding sites shows no cooperativity [33]; thus, the binding sites are independent of each other and the occupancy of one site will not affect the occupancy of the other. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>A third reason is that two known ligands for BCL-6, SMRT and BCOR, are peptides 17 amino-acids in length that bind in extended conformations to the same groove over a large contact-area [33],[34], allowing for comparison of FragMaps over a large portion of the protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Fourth, there is thermodynamic data available from competition assays using single-residue alanine or glycine-substituted analogs of these two peptides for every position in each peptide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Fifth, SMRT and BCOR have different binding modes in the BCL-6 peptide-binding cleft and lack sequence similarity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>The different binding modes include BCL-6 sidechains in the binding cleft assuming different conformations in the presence of SMRT vs. BCOR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>And finally, BCL-6 has clinical importance because of its association with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and competitive inhibitors that bind to the BCL-6 peptide-binding cleft may have therapeutic applications. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Convergence of the SILCS FragMaps was facilitated by the selection of propane, benzene, and water as the “fragments,” by the use of ∼1 M propane and benzene concentrations, and by combining results from 10 independent 5-ns SILCS MD simulations (see Methods). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>The two-fold symmetry of the BCL-6 protein with its two symmetric binding sites and non-cooperative binding allows for using two-fold symmetry in the FragMaps as a measure of convergence. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>SILCS FragMaps, when visualized as isosurfaces in conjunction with a protein (e.g. Figures 4– 6), may potentially be used to guide the development of inhibitors at a particular site on the protein surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>The FragMaps contain information about protein flexibility and atomically-detailed solvation effects as they impact fragment binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the relative importance of interactions is represented by the values of the histogram counts in the 3D FragMap histograms, thus inhibitors can be optimally designed by targeting overlap with high-probability regions in the FragMaps. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>This can be done in an interactive, qualitative fashion, for example by informing the extension of small-molecule binders with known binding poses into larger, higher-affinity molecules that encompass nearby high-probability regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, this can be done in an automated, quantitative manner by taking the natural logarithm of the probabilities and multiplying by –RT; the resultant free-energy maps can be used as docking grids for high-throughput in silico docking of drug-like compound libraries, with an additional map of the protein atoms incorporated into a penalty function to account for steric clash between docked compounds and the protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>With this latter approach, some care must be taken regarding the direct interpretation of FragMaps in terms of free energies due to alterations to the chemical potential of bulk water, which is used to generate hydrogen bond donor and acceptor maps, arising from the high concentration of fragments. </plain></SENT>
