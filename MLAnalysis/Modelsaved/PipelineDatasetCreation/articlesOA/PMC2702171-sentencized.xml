<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, most of what is known about invertebrate immunity has been restricted to immune effector cells and little information is available on the immune responses of other tissues or organs. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In metazoans, the immune system is usually associated with specialized cells that are found distributed in the vascular system and within most tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Human lymphocytes and invertebrate hemocytes/coelomocytes are examples of circulating cells specialized in immune defense. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, certain organs are also known to participate in immune responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>For example, the human liver is associated with innate responses and its role as an immune organ is being increasingly investigated [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In teleost fishes, the kidney is an important immune organ where B-lymphocytes originate and differentiate [3] and in humans it is the subject of numerous studies on autoimmune disease and transplantation immunology [4], [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Even organs not commonly associated with immunity can respond to an immune challenge and participate in the immune response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>For example, the central nervous system is clearly affected by the immune state of the organism, playing a role in controlling body temperature and other immuno-modulatory responses [6], [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Likewise, in invertebrates, immune cells can be produced in definite lymphoid-like organs, i.e. the fat body of insects [8], but in some groups it has been shown that the immune function is shared or distributed by organs and tissues in different areas of the body (internal epithelia, gastric and excretory tissues) [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The digestive tract comprises one of these organs that play an active role in the immune response as a barrier against pathogens that might be present or even harbored within its luminal cavity [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, mucosal immunity is even more active than systemic immunity due to the overwhelming antigenic load that enters daily in the form of food antigens and commensal bacteria [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Additionally, circulating immune cells are able to infiltrate the gut tissues participating in intestinal immune reactions, as occurs with vertebrate lymphocytes and very likely with invertebrate coelomocytes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Studies of immune systems in non-vertebrates have been limited to certain metazoan groups, being the class Echinoidea of the phylum Echinodermata one of the most comprehensively studied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Being deuterostomes, echinoderms comprise the sister group of chordates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Thus, studies of the echinoderm immune responses are important in determining the evolution of the immune system in metazoans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In echinoderms the main immune effector cells are the coelomocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>While no definite lymphoid organ has been found, the source of coelomocytes has been pointed towards the axial organ, the haemal system, the polian vesicles, the dermal connective tissue or the coelomic epithelia [12], [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In recent years, the molecular basis of echinoderm immune systems has been greatly advanced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In particular, two types of data have been generated of importance to echinoderm immunity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>First, is the publication of the sea urchin genome that has provided insight into the echinoid immune repertoire. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Some of the findings have changed our paradigms about comparative immunity [14], [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Second, is the identification of genes expressed in sea urchin coelomocytes following immune challenge with bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Some examples of immune system associated molecules include: complement molecules, lectins, serine proteinase inhibitors, scavenger receptors (SRCRs), cytoskeletal proteins, clotting molecules and the highly variable family of effector molecules 185/333 [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>However, studies of the echinoderm immune system have been mainly limited to the study of only one of the echinoderm classes, the Echinoidea, and mostly to the expression of immune genes by one cell type, the coelomocytes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The present study uses another echinoderm species, the sea cucumber Holothuria glaberrima, to identify molecules expressed in the intestine upon immune activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the sea urchin (Echinoidea), sea cucumbers are members of the class Holothuroidea, which diverged from the echinoids between 500–600 million years ago [22], thus providing for comparative analyses with the sea urchin and for the identification of new molecules associated with echinoderm immune responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Our work is based on a database of over 7000 expressed sequenced tags (ESTs) isolated from three cDNA libraries of intestinal tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>In previous publication we reported the presence of several immune-related genes in the EST database: a serum amyloid A (SAA) protein [23], three serine proteinase inhibitors, a C-type lectin, a transglutaminase, several fibrinogen-like proteins, a ferritin, and proteins of the transferrin superfamily, to name a few. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>We also showed that these molecules are expressed by coelomocytes and that some of them are induced following an LPS challenge, thus confirming their role as immune molecules [24]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>We have now used microarray technology to study the expression of these ESTs by establishing a profile of genes expressed in the intestine following an LPS challenge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Our results show that 50 genes are differentially expressed between the intestines of naïve and LPS challenged animals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Some of these belong to diverse functional categories: metal ion metabolism/transport, cellular metabolism, cytoskeleton function, and defense/recognition. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>When compared to our previous study in coelomocytes [24], the differences in gene expression profiles are evident, reflecting the way each tissue (intestine vs. coelomocytes) respond towards an immune challenge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>These data not only provide important information on the role of the intestine in immune responses but also increase our knowledge on the molecular evolution of the immune system. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>We have induced the activation of the immune system in holothurians by a systemic injection with LPS and focused on the response of the intestinal tissues in terms of gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>Gene expression was assessed using microarray technology showing that at least 50 genes are differentially expressed between intestines of LPS-injected and vehicle-injected controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the most used immune-activating substance, whose effects are not only seen in lymphocytes (and related immune cells) but in other tissues as well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>A classical example is the induction of fever in mammals, in which a systemic (intra-peritoneal or intravenous) injection of LPS provokes central nervous system responses leading to an increase in body temperature as well as other behavioral changes [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Thus, LPS has been widely used as a tool to study immune-responsive genes in vertebrates and invertebrates, and even in plants [35], [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>Additional evidence from invertebrate models shows the effect of LPS on the expression levels of immune genes in different tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>For example, LPS induces the expression of a tachylectin-related protein in the gut of amphioxus [37], an anti-LPS factor in the lymphoid organ of prawn [38], TNFα homologues in the pharynx of Ciona [39] and in the gills of a mollusk [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>In addition, a previous publication from our group showed the up-regulation of an holothurian homologue of the Serum amyloid A (SAA) gene in the intestine after an LPS injection [41]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Observed variations might then be due to biological changes/variation or small (undefined) differences between the treatments. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>However, there are limits to the microarray detection and this is obvious when we observed the expression profiles of immune genes with lower signal intensities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>The apparent differential expression between normal and LPS injected animals was not significant using in the microarray analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>However, other more sensitive techniques, such as RT-PCR, or Northern blots, demonstrated differential expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>This also appears to be the case for holothurian Serum Amyloid A gene (SAA). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>This gene had been previously shown by our group to be induced by LPS in the intestine using Northern blots [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Although the microarray statistical analysis did not show a significant change, when we compared the SAA probe intensities between LPS and control intestines, the LPS-treated animals showed an average intensity 3 times greater than the controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, the intensity of these spots was not sufficiently high to be statistically significant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>This is concordant with our northern blot data [41] showing that expression of this gene in the LPS-treated intestine although higher than in controls is still quite low. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the microarray results might be biased toward those genes that show high intensities (high expression) and therefore the real number of differentially expressed sequences might be higher than those determined by the microarray. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>The sea urchin MYP was first identified as a vitellogenin, due to its presence in the egg and the yolk platelet [42], [43], [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>This protein does not fit the profile of a common vitellogenin however, mainly because it is not restricted to females, is not developmentally regulated [43], [45], and it accounts for 50% of the total protein content in the coelomic fluid [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>Its presence in the coelomic fluid suggests a possible immune function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the sea urchin MYP (and also the holothurian) possesses transferrin-like domains, which can bind iron and other metal ions; in vitro assays have demonstrated that the sea urchin MYP binds iron [46] and zinc [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Since iron is an essential element for bacterial metabolism, the binding capacity of MYP gives it bacteriostatic properties. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>Three genes for metabolic enzymes were found to be differentially expressed according to the array, Ahcy, Gnmt and Gapdh. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>The first two are key enzymes that regulate cellular transmethylation reactions due to the inhibition of other methyltransferases by their substrates and product [49], [50], [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of transmethylation reactions mostly affects the efficiency of gene expression, from the methylation of the promoters, cap formation, the stability and export of mRNA, to the initiation of translation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>The induction of Ahcy and Gnmt mRNAs by LPS in intestinal tissues could indicate an increase in transmethylation metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>This increment could indirectly reflect an increase in gene expression, methylation, and de-methylation of DNA and cell proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>Ahcy also has been implicated in chemotaxis [52] and immune function [53], two roles that also fit the profile of this holothurian homologue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>In Dyctiostelium and human neutrophils, this protein is asymmetrically distributed towards the front of chemotacting cells, and its inhibition impairs chemotaxis [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Therefore, up-regulation of Ahcy may be indicative of increasing chemotaxis in intestinal cells of the holothurian. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>However, experiments to determine the spatial expression and localization of this gene are needed to corroborate this hypothesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, experiments in rat and mouse, link Ahcy to immune activation of T-cells and macrophages, and its inhibition reduces inflammation and impairs t-cell proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>This is mostly due to the high dependence of T-cells on methylation reactions for proliferation and maturation and the interaction of Ahcy with second messengers in macrophages that regulate their activation and phagocytic activity [53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>These processes can also occur in holothurians, suggesting an immune role for Ahcy in activation of phagocytic coelomocytes or perhaps proliferation of other cell types in the intestine. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>In contrast with Ahcy and Gnmt, the other metabolic enzyme gene, Gapdh appeared down-regulated on the microarray. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>GAPDH is an enzyme that catalyzes the sixth step of glycolysis for energy production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>In addition to this metabolic function, GAPDH has also been implicated in several non-metabolic processes, including transcription activation [54], initiation of apoptosis [55], and ER to Golgi vesicle shuttling [56]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>GAPDH also acts as a reversible metabolic switch during oxidative stress; its inactivation temporarily re-routes the metabolic flux towards the production of more NADPH, as is needed by some antioxidant systems [57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>Since LPS causes oxidative stress [58], [59], the holothurian intestine could respond to a bacterial challenge by down-regulating GAPDH expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>A similar response was also found in Drosophila hemocytes, where GAPDH levels were found to be reduced across different LPS doses [60]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>However, more evidence is still needed to confirm the expression patter of holothurian GAPDH, first, at the protein level to effectively prove a downregulation of GAPDH, and second, testing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production to verify oxidative stress in the intestine after LPS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>Although the RT-PCR validation of this expression profile was not statistically significant, a tendency towards down-regulation is evident. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>Two genes in this category were found to be down-regulated in LPS-treated intestines: alpha-actinin (Actn) and an isoform of actin identified as Actin 1 in H. glaberrima (Hg_Act1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>Actin proteins are highly conserved cytoskeletal proteins found all over the eukaryote domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>They are important cytoskeletal proteins involved in a broad range of cellular processes, from movement to cell division [61], [62], [63]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>Alpha-actinin is an actin-binding protein that cross-links actin filaments [64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>It is involved in stabilization of cell junctions and as a link between the cytoskeleton and transmembrane proteins [65]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>Chicken alpha-actinin has also been found to be down-regulated in intestinal lymphocytes after challenge with two protozoa [66], suggesting that a similar mechanism may be occurring in the sea cucumber. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>Several actin-binding proteins were downregulated in Drosophila hemocytes activated with LPS [67], indicating that immune cells may responding to LPS by remodeling the cytoskeleton. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>The expression profile of these two cytoskeletal proteins in the holothurian suggests two hypotheses: First, that down-regulation of this actin isoform may be indicative of changes in cytoskeleton dynamics, probably the disassembling of the actin network; and second, down-regulation of alpha-actinin may be related to changes in cell adhesion and motility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>A study about cell de-adhesion dynamics showed that this process requires changes in stress fibers and focal adhesions, which includes the loss of certain structural proteins, being alpha-actinin one of them [68]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>These changes may occur in the cells of the coelomic epithelium that are in direct contact with the coelomic fluid (where the LPS was injected) or in wandering coelomocytes residing in the intestinal tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>These cytoskeletal changes could be linked to chemotaxis of local coelomocytes and/or detachment of adherens junctions of some intestinal cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>Another link can be made to the phagocyte increase after LPS challenge, where some of these cells might be detaching from the intestinal coelomic epithelium and migrating to the coelom. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>Previously, we reported 7 ESTs with fibrinogen-like domains that may be part of the immune repertoire of H. glaberrima [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>One of these ESTs (PNLP17D06) was found to be up-regulated in the intestine after LPS injection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>The fibrinogen-like domain is present in other proteins besides fibrinogen, i.e. ficolins, tenascins, angiopoietins, fibrinogen-related proteins (FREPs) to name a few. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>With the current sequence information for the holothurian fib-like proteins it was still not possible to determine the identity for each of the 7 ESTs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>However, it is very likely that these proteins may have an immune role. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>The induction of PNLP17D06 in the intestine by LPS corroborates this. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>The fibrinogen-like domain has the ability to interact with other protein domains, and several proteins with this domain have recognition capabilities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>Some of them take part in immune responses in several organisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>For example, ficolins have lectin-like properties through their fibrinogen-like domain, and they participate in innate immune reactions [69]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>FREPs play an important role in the innate immune response of snails and mosquitoes against pathogens [70], [71], vertebrate FREPs also have immune functions, taking part in acute phase reactions and regulatory T-cell activity [72], [73]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>Therefore this holothurian EST (PNLP17D06) bearing the fib-like domain, may represent an example of one of these molecules, exerting its intestinal function of recognizing pathogens. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>This gene, DD104 which remains fairly uncharacterized, is readily induced by a bacterial challenge and injury in sea urchin coelomocytes [74] and by LPS in holothurian coelomocytes [24] and intestine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>The differences in coelomocyte expression between species might be due to the immunological status of the animals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>In the sea urchin experiments, animals were kept in the lab for at least six months until they reached an immunoquiescent status. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>In our experiments, animals were obtained directly from the field, kept in the lab for a week and then immune activated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is possible that our animals are partially immune activated in nature and thus no differences are observed for some of the genes that were found to be activated in the immunoquiescent sea urchins when exposed to LPS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>Another possibility is that the seawater injection used in the controls provoked an immune response per se. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>This has been documented in sea urchin, where the injury of the injection along with ionic changes due to the sea water entry into the coelom, can mimic the effects of a bacterial infection [75]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="355" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine (29) of these sequences did not have a recognizable open reading frame (ORF), these may represent untranslated regions (UTRs) for long transcripts whose ORFs were not incorporated when the library was done, or may also be regulatory non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) which may be regulating the expression of other genes [76], [77]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="356" pm="."><plain>Eight of the 29 ESTs had a polyadenylation signal confirming that they are 3′UTRs. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="358" pm="."><plain>The remaining 21 ESTs need further sequence characterization to determine if they are part of a longer UTR or if they are ncRNAs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="359" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the fourteen (14) remaining ESTs did show a recognizable ORF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="360" pm="."><plain>The conceptual translation of these ORFs did not result in sequences with domains or motifs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="361" pm="."><plain>Thus, these sequences may correspond to unconserved protein regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="362" pm="."><plain>More sequence information is needed to either find a domain or sequence that helps identify them or characterize them as novel genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="363" pm="."><plain>These unknown sequences represent an excellent opportunity to find immune-related genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="364" pm="."><plain>In fact the 185/333 family of genes in the sea urchin were initially found as an unknown EST (encoding for an uncharacterized protein) after sequencing clones from a cDNA library of LPS-activated coelomocytes [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="365" pm="."><plain>Further analysis revealed a complex and dynamic family of transcripts with unmistakable immune functions that appears to be echinoderm (and maybe echinoid) specific [78], [79]. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="367" pm="."><plain>Finally, we cannot possibly suggest that our results comprise all the intestinal genes associated with the immune response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="368" pm="."><plain>First, because we only used one immune activator (LPS) and one time point for comparison. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="369" pm="."><plain>Second, because we are comparing animals collected from their natural habitats to the same group of animals following an LPS injection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="370" pm="."><plain>Although we have previously shown that these animals respond to LPS by increasing their phagocytosis up to 25% [23] (thus they are still capable of increasing their immune activation) they might be partially immune activated in nature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="371" pm="."><plain>Third, because the probes on the microarray chip were limited to around 7000 ESTs obtained from our cDNA libraries, and other immune genes might be present in the holothurian genome. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="375" pm="."><plain>We have shown that a systemic injection of LPS in the sea cucumber H. glaberrima provokes changes in the expression of several intestinal transcripts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="376" pm="."><plain>This expression profile seems to be organ-specific when compared to expression profiles of coelomocytes activated with LPS in both the holothurian or in the sea urchin. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="377" pm="."><plain>Genes that were up-regulated by LPS in the holothurian intestine include: Myp, a gene related to iron transport, which may be involved in intestinal immune responses by acting as an iron-sequestering bacteriostatic protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="378" pm="."><plain>Also, two genes for proteins involved in transmethylation metabolism, Ahcy and Gnmt. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="380" pm="."><plain>LPS also induced the expression of a fibrinogen-related protein gene, which acting as a pattern recognition protein may be synthesized to recognize pathogens. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="381" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, LPS injection caused downregulation of the mRNA levels for GAPDH, perhaps as a response to oxidative stress induced by LPS. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="383" pm="."><plain>These cytoskeletal changes may be directed towards cell detachment, and increased mobility perhaps by intestinal cells migrating towards the coelomic cavity, where the challenge was presented. </plain></SENT>
