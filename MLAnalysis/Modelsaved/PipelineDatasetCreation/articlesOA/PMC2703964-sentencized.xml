</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With growing need of monoclonal antibodies and vaccines, B cell epitope prediction has become more and more desirable especially for new proteins isolated from pathogens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A lot of efforts have been put for this purpose, but primarily on continuous epitopes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, crystallographic studies have shown that most of the epitopes in protein antigens are discontinuous (1), while only a few methods have been designed for this condition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>For instance, the first server CEP was erected in 2005 by introducing ‘accessibility of residues’ based on the 3D nature of the antigen proteins (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, DiscoTope prediction method was designed by combining propensity scale matrixes with the spatial proximity and surface exposure (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Recently, BEpro improved DiscoTope method by introducing spatial attribute of half sphere exposure (3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>While these tools provided a lot of help in designing molecular experiments, benchmark and reviews have shown that the prediction of spatial epitope remained difficult for protein antigens (4,5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>As being pointed out, the possible improvement could lie in new features characterizing 3D structures of epitope and better training data (4). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This article introduces a new computational server, SEPPA, for spatial epitope prediction of protein antigens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In the method of SEPPA, a novel concept of ‘unit patch of residue triangle’ is introduced to better describe local spatial context in protein antigen surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Typical network parameter of spatial clustering coefficient is also incorporated to reflect the 3D characteristic of epitopes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In addition, comprehensive training data of non-redundant spatial epitopes is curated from PDB database (6) with unique representatives covering the vast diversity of known epitopes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>SEPPA was rigorously trained by 82 antigen–antibody protein complexes, which contained 84 unique epitopes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>One hundred and nineteen independent spatial epitopes of protein antigens were collected as testing dataset. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Surface residues were those with more than 1 Å2 SASA, while those with SASA loss in binding of more than 1 Å2 were classified as epitope residues. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Four hundred and fifty five combination patterns of subgroups were observed out of 13 × 13 × 13 for unit patches. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Propensity index (trii) of the unit patch pattern i is calculated as the ratio of the number of pattern i among all epitope unit patches (fi*/Σi fi*) compared with that ratio in the non-epitope unit patches (fi/Σi fi): 1 where fi* is the number of unit patch pattern i in epitope unit patches, while Σi fi* is the number of all epitope patches. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>By default thresholds, CEP, DiscoTope and BEpro produced average estimated AUC values (defined as (sensitivity+specificity)/2) of 0.521, 0.601 and 0.563, respectively. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Generally there are two strategies to define epitope residues from the structures of immune complexes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>One adopts the change of SASA between unbound and bound state of antigen structures to define epitope residues, while the other picks up a distance cutoff between antigen and antibody atoms in complexes, e.g. 4 Å in DiscoTope (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>SEPPA took the first strategy; the distance cutoff one was also simulated to inspect the robustness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Results indicated that these two strategies had given similar results to the performance of SEPPA (data is not shown). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Currently, a parameter of 4 Å was chosen in the definition of unit patch of residue-triangle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Considering that the majority of atom contacts occur at &lt;5 Å (11), different distances of 4, 5 and 6 Å were put under test in our work and 4 Å was found to give the best results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the cutoff for neighborhood was set to be 15 Å because of the following calculation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Cutoff ranges from 5 to 20 Å were scanned according to their impact on prediction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the most stable performance was achieved at 15 Å under training data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Thus, this value was selected as the neighborhood cutoff. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>ROC curve is often applied to evaluate the performance of predictive methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>In our case, however, CEP is categorized as a discrete classifier, which does not produce the prediction scores. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Thus a ROC curve could not be generated for CEP but the AUC value could be estimated as (sensitivity + specificity)/2 following the method of Julia et al. (4), which is also applicable for other three tools under their respective default thresholds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Since the ROC curve and AUC value are highly correlated, we assume that the estimated AUC value could be an alternative vector to compare the performance of those tools in our work. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>From this work, the concepts of ‘unit patch of residue triangle’ and ‘clustering coefficient’ seem to make major contribution to the effective prediction of spatial epitopes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>As being frequently suggested, epitope residues function as a whole on antigen surface during antibody binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, the concept of ‘unit patch of residue triangle’ just describes the minimum moiety of surface patches which can better reflect the local spatial context on antigen exterior. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Thus SEPPA makes prediction based on both the residual context and the spatial compactness of neighboring residues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Since the propensity index is derived from statistics of training data, these data are very important as well to be representative and unique. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>With more and more structural data accumulated, we believe that SEPPA would be increasingly improved by incorporating further refined features of spatial epitopes. </plain></SENT>
