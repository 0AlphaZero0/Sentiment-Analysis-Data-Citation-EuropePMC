</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Central to the organization of the enzymatic machinery that replicates and repairs DNA in cells are the sliding clamp proteins, like the prokaryotic β-clamp and the eukaryotic PCNA (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen) [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These ring-shaped structures can interact with a large number of enzymes (See [3, 4] for recent updates) and orchestrate their activities during DNA replication and repair. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Sliding clamps are uniquely designed to meet three critical needs in DNA synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>First, they tether DNA polymerases to the template, thus providing them with high processivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Second, over the immense length of chromosomal DNA, sliding clamps are recruiting devices that provide a binding surface to target enzymes to active centers of DNA synthesis and repair. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Finally a third, less understood function, point to their involvement as molecular beacons of newly replicated DNA, thus acting as signals to postreplicative repair systems or the higher-order regulatory apparatus that coordinates cell cycle progression. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Protein clamps are typically homodimeric or homotrimeric structures, like the β-clamp or PCNA, respectively, with the monomers binding each other in a head-to-tail fashion and completing a circle (See Fig. 1) [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Recently heterotrimeric clamps have been found in archaea associated with replicative polymerases [6], and in higher organisms involved in checkpoint, like the RHR or 911 complex (Rad9-Hus1-Rad1) [7, 8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, across all life forms and despite limited or no sequence between them, sliding clamps are always composed of six domains with a characteristic fold [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>A continuous layer of pleated sheet structure is the backbone of the ring, and a set of 12 α-helices line the inside of the clamp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Sliding clamps have two distinct faces with very different electrostatic properties [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The major site of interaction of clamps with partners is via a hydrophobic pocket between the two domains of each monomer (in PCNA) or domains 2 and 3 (in the β-clamp). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Contacts have been also observed on the interconnector loop (only in PCNA) or the extreme C-terminal peptide of the clamp. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Since sliding clamps are co-factors of numerous proteins involved in the metabolism of DNA, interaction with sliding clamps can be a critical point of regulation of the activities of these enzymes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>For example, processivity is increased up to 100-times when DNA polymerases are bound to sliding clamps and therefore changes in the affinity of the interaction could be a way by which the activity of the polymerase is regulated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Indeed, as described later, an internal switch within the DNA polymerase III complex in E. coli modulates the affinity with the β-clamp and this is the mechanism by which the polymerase regulates its processivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, in eukaryotic replication machineries the modification of either the sliding clamp or the binding surface of the partner enzyme often serves as a regulatory mechanism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Thus, ubiquitylation and sumoylation of PCNA have been described as transient modifications that serve to switch polymerases during the DNA damage response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of PCNA-binding domains has been observed in numerous proteins involved in DNA replication, such as the cell-cycle regulator p21, Fen1, RFC, Pol δ and DNA ligase and this modification directly affects the interaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Thus, the process of engagement and disengagement with sliding clamps may be a way of controlling protein function. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Regulation of sliding clamp binding is important in view of the fact that their concentration in the cell is likely to be limiting if compared to the concentration of proteins that bind to them, especially if it is assumed that only DNA-bound clamps are ‘active’. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>It has been estimated that there are only about 200-300 β-clamps in a E. coli cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In eukaryotes PCNA expression is itself regulated and its levels are cell-cycle dependent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>It seems unlikely that each enzyme uses its own sliding clamp exclusively, but rather that individual sliding clamps are trafficked by various proteins, either concurrently or sequentially. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Numerous in vivo studies using microscopy and fluorescence have shown that PCNA clusters in regions of the chromosome that are being actively replicated, and that it co-localizes with polymerases and DNA repair enzymes [11, 12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>In the last decade we have learned that proteins use similar ways of interacting with sliding clamps but that use distinct mechanisms in the regulation of these interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In what follows I will review our knowledge of the structural details of how sliding clamps interact with their ligands, as provided by crystallography and biochemical studies, and then analyze in turn each of the emerging themes of regulatory mechanisms outlined above. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec></SecTag><sec><title><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>BINDING AND AFFINITY OF PROTEIN LIGANDS TO SLIDING CLAMPS </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Most proteins interact with clamps via residues in their N- or C-terminal regions [13] although internal binding sites are also critical in many cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>In prokaryotes the β-clamp consensus motif QLxLF has been recognized but is often poorly conserved and seems to be absent in a number of β-binding proteins [14, 15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the consensus motif QxxLxxFF is present with minor variations in most PCNA-binding proteins [3, 13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Since the proteins that harbour these motifs belong to many disparate structural families, these short sequences probably reflect convergent evolution for sliding-clamp binding. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The first detailed analysis of the binding surface of a clamp protein and its partner was that of the complex of human PCNA bound to a 22-residue C-terminal peptide of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21 [16, 17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The p21 peptide uses a extensive array of contacts in binding to PCNA, interacting with the interconnector loop, the hydrophobic pocket and C-terminal residues of the clamp [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The C-terminus of p21 is disordered in solution and, in addition to PCNA, binds to a number of other ligands, including calmodulin and the oncoprotein SET [18, 19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Relative affinities to these various ligands could be regulated by phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of p21 [20]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The structure of a 11-residue C-terminal peptide of phage RB69 DNA polymerase in complex with its cognate clamp, the gp45 protein, has also been reported [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Although the interacting surface is much less extensive than in the case of p21, the peptide targets an analogous hydrophobic crevice on the clamp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Attachment via a flexible peptide allows the polymerase to remain tethered to the clamp while alternating between the spatially distant polymerizing and exonuclease modes of DNA binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Another example of a polymerase interacting with its clamp has been recently provided by the structures of the C-terminal, ‘little finger’, domain of E. coli DNA polymerase IV and the β-clamp [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>As with p21 and RB69, hydrophobic residues at the extended C-terminal peptide of Pol IV (in this case an ‘LGL’ motif) insert themselves in the surface pocket between domains 2 and 3 of the β-clamp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>A distinctive feature observed in the Pol IV-β-clamp structure is a second binding surface that localizes to the interface between the two clamp monomers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>A more recent crystal structure of Dpo4, the homologous Pol IV of Sulfolobus solfataricus, bound to its cognate clamp has given support to the idea that bound sliding clamp ligands often adopt highly flexible conformations [23]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>A number of highly revealing studies of the enzymes involved in Okazaki fragment processing have shown multiple conformations of enzymes bound to PCNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The interaction of Fen1 to PCNA has been studied using peptides [24] and the whole protein [25], indicating that the binding site is complex and consisting of extensive contacts near the interconnector loop and the C-terminus of PCNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The binding site contains a hinge region that gives the complex high flexibility, and is highly reminiscent of that found in the case of p21 bound to PCNA [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The structure and dynamics of the interaction between Sulfolobus solfataricus DNA ligase and the heteromeric PCNA present in organism has been described [26], and that of a peptide of yeast ligase I (Cdc9) and PCNA [27]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Yet another class of structural insights has been provided by sliding clamps complexed to clamp loaders like the γ-complex or RFC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Clamp loaders are pentameric structures that are designed to bind an unloaded sliding clamp (i.e., not topologically bound to DNA) and, in an ATP-dependent reaction, break the ring and place it around DNA at specific sites [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>The structure of the Escherichia coli δ subunit of the γ-complex complexed to a monomeric β-clamp shows that δ binds to β via two sites: first, an internal sequence (69-QAMSLF-74) that resembles the β-binding motif found in a number of other proteins interacts with the hydrophobic pocket between domains 2 and 3 of the clamp; the second contact is between α4 of δ and a loop on the β-clamp which as a result becomes restructured [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>These contacts are important for opening and loading of the ring, and additional contacts of other subunits of the pentameric γ-complex have been demonstrated (See below) [28, 29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, biochemical studies have shown that in yeast RFC at least two subunits, RFC1 and RFC3, bind PCNA tightly [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>These RFC subunits, like δ, bind PCNA via an internal sequence and contains conserved hydrophobic residues that have been predicted to interact with the hydrophobic pocket on the ring [30]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Pentameric clamp loaders are highly conserved, reflecting an ancient mechanism of interaction and handling of the sliding clamps [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>In archaeal organisms the homologous RFC contains only two types of subunits, RFC-L and RFC-S, with a stoichiometry of 1:4 [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>The crystal structure of a 11-residue C-terminal peptide derived from Pirococcus furiosus RFC-L bound to PfuPCNA has been reported, showing an arrangement very similar to peptides bound to other clamps [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>An extended region of acidic residues adjacent to the consensus binding box is important for binding to the clamp [33]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>In general, although interaction with the hydrophobic pocket often represents a strong anchoring site used by clamp loaders and clamp-interacting proteins, other interactions at distinct sites on the rings are usually observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Detailed studies of the affinity of ligands for the sliding clamps have been performed using peptides of the binding protein as models [15, 18, 34, 35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>However, the in vivo and functional relevance of these studies is often difficult to interpret due to the differences in affinity expected depending on whether DNA is present, or if the sliding clamp is topologically bound to DNA or not. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Two main themes emerge from the structural studies of sliding clamp complexes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Firstly, all complexes studied to date (in viral, archaeal, bacteria or eukaryotic systems) interact with the hydrophobic pocket on the same side of PCNA or the β-clamp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>This often involves the two main hydrophobic and/or aromatic residues present in the sliding clamp motifs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Secondly, clamp binding is often highly flexible and the various dynamic conformations are dependent on DNA structure, which probably ultimately regulates the affinity of the interaction. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Crystallographic studies have shown us insightful close-ups of the interactions between clamps and their partners. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>In what follows I will describe the knowledge, mainly biochemical, of the processes and the context in which these dynamic interactions take place. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>LOADING OF CLAMPS ON DNA </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Sliding clamps are opened and placed on DNA in ATP-dependent reactions by multisubunit complexes named clamp loaders [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>The biochemistry of these enzymes has been studied in considerable detail for the case of the phage T4 gp44/62, E. coli’s γ-complex, and archeal and yeast RFC complexes [36-38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Despite some distinct peculiarities of each clamp loader, the mechanism of loading of the clamp is very similar in all cases and it involves conformational changes in the clamp loader that couple ATP binding to binding to the clamp in solution, and ATP hydrolysis to its loading and release on a DNA primed site [9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>In E. coli the γ-complex (consisting of the γ3δδ’ subunits) first binds the β-clamp in solution through strong contacts with the δ subunit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>However, this only happens when three molecules of ATP have been bound by the γ-complex [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>The δ subunit binds to the β-clamp via a α-helix (α4) which undergoes major conformational changes involving rotation of four hydrophobic residues [28, 29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>In the absence of ATP α4 of δ interacts strongly with the δ’ subunit (via residues Trp61 and Phe62) and the β-clamp binding residues (Leu73 and Phe74) are sequestered on the surface of δ, unable to bind to the β-clamp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>However, upon ATP binding, residues Trp61 and Phe62 loose their interaction to δ’ and Leu73 and Phe74 are projected and exposed, binding directly on the hydrophobic pocket of the β-clamp [28, 29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Upon binding to primed DNA and hydrolysis of ATP, the process is reversed and the clamp is released already topologically bound to DNA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Therefore the strong interaction of the clamp loader with the β-clamp is regulated tightly by conformational changes on the main interacting component, the δ subunit, which depend on ATP binding and hydrolysis and recognition of DNA structure by the clamp loader. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Analogous conformational changes are thought to operate in the case of the archaeal [39] or the eukaryotic clamp loaders [30, 36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of human RFC by CamKII [40] and cyclin-dependent kinases has been reported [41], in both cases leading to a reduction in its affinity for PCNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>The detailed mechanism and consequences of phosphorylation of RFC are not clear, but they indicate that modulation of the affinity of RFC for PCNA could be used by the cell cycle regulatory machinery to regulate DNA replication and other DNA metabolic processes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>CONTROL OF PROCESSIVITY OF REPLICATIVE DNA POLYMERASES </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>The high processivity of the DNA polymerases that replicate the chromosome is achieved via their binding to sliding clamps. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>However, in recent years it has become clear that this interaction, rather than being static and permanent, could have a half-life substantially shorter than what could be expected from the measurements of processivity of the polymerases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>In a series of elegant kinetic experiments using the phage T4 replication system as a model, it has been shown that each DNA polymerase molecule is replaced by another one at a rate of about every 10 seconds during chromosomal DNA replication (this would result in about 90 exchanges per replicated chromosome in vivo) [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>The replacement of the DNA polymerases is efficient because the sliding clamp allows the simultaneous binding of at least two polymerases, which favors a quick engagement of the second on with the 3’-terminus of the DNA when the first one disengages from it. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Thus, the term ‘dynamic processivity’ has been suggested to reflect the fact that the overall processivity of a reaction may depend on the enzymatic actions of a number of individual DNA polymerase molecules coordinated by the same sliding clamp [42, 43]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>If an analogous mechanism of DNA polymerase exchange occurs in bacterial or eukaryotic systems remains to be demonstrated, but a related switch has been observed in the thermophilic euryarchaean Pyrococcus abissy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>During chromosomal replication in this organism DNA polymerases belonging to different families take up successively the PCNA sliding clamp after it has been loaded on DNA by the clamp loader [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>Pol D binds to PCNA left by the clamp loader (RCF) and extends the RNA primer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Then, Pol D is replaced by the replicative polymerase Pol B which contains a strong PCNA binding site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>The switch is required because Pol B would not be able to extend from a RNA primer efficiently [44]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="103" pm="?"><plain>How do processive replicative DNA polymerases release from the sliding clamp? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>In E. coli, a mechanism for quick disengagement of DNA polymerase III (Pol III) from the clamp has been proposed when the lagging-strand DNA polymerase recycles to a new primer during Okazaki fragment synthesis, a switch that occurs every 2-3 seconds during chromosomal synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="?"><plain>How does the polymerase lose its tight grip on its β-clamp at the end of each Okazaki fragment? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>The alpha catalytic subunit of Pol III can make at least two contacts with the β-clamp, one internal (920-QADMF-924) and another one at the extreme C-terminus of the protein (1154-QVELEF-1159) [14, 15, 45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>As discussed in the previous section, both sites have been proposed to be important for processivity of the polymerase, although biochemical and crystallographic data suggest that the internal one could be better positioned for interaction with the clamp during elongation [45, 46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>The C-terminal site of alpha also binds tightly to another subunit of the replisome, the τ subunit of the gamma complex [47, 48], which regulates its processivity [49, 50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>The C-terminal domain of the τ subunit binds to single-stranded and double-stranded DNA [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that the τ subunit could compete with the β-clamp for binding to the C-terminal binding site on α. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Indeed, in the presence of a primed template the affinity of τ for the C-terminus of α is low, but increases dramatically (&gt;20-fold) in its absence or in the presence of double-stranded DNA [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Therefore during processive elongation the α subunit could be engaged with the β-clamp via C-terminal residues, which are then sequestered by τ when the complex reaches the double-stranded DNA of the downstream Okazaki fragment and τ-C ‘senses’ the absence of ssDNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>This DNA-sensing effect can be observed with a minimal system of just τ-C and a synthetic peptide containing the C-terminal 20 amino acids of the α subunit, indicating that these are the minimal players in a ‘processivity switch’ underlying the dissociation of α from the sliding clamp [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Recent crystallographic data obtained by the Steitz laboratory, however, have challenged this view and suggest that it is the C-terminal domain of the α subunit itself, which contains an OB fold which selectively only binds to ssDNA [46], could sense the nature of the DNA substrate and, via the τ subunit a conformational change on α, induce the processivity switch [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Although speculative given the absence of structural data for the τ subunit (or the highly flexible C-terminal region of the α-subunit of Pol III), these two scenarios hint at possible mechanisms by which a processivity switch could be established. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Given the complex and dynamic nature of the interaction of Pol III with the sliding clamp, however, much remains to be discovered about the interactions of these proteins. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>The eukaryotic replication fork has not been explored in sufficient detail to analyze the binding and release of DNA polymerases from the sliding clamp PCNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>A recent study showed that perhaps an intrinsic conformational change on DNA polymerase δ allows it to sense the double stranded DNA and release itself from the DNA to jump to the next primed template during Okazaki fragment synthesis [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>This ‘collision release’ model, however, was tested on a highly simplified system and critical effects of other subunits of the replisome on the processivity of the polymerase cannot be ruled out. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>It should be noted that, in addition to the moving platform that the sliding clamps provide, additional scaffolds are provided in the replisome in which to which DNA polymerases attach themselves. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>In E. coli a second scaffold is provided by the provided by the γ/τ-complex which coordinates the actions of the leading and lagging DNA polymerases [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>On a different system, phage T7 DNA polymerase uses the factor thiorredoxin instead than a sliding clamp to substantially increase its processivity but in addition it binds to a DNA helicase in order to remain associated to the replication fork [53-55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>In this way several T7 DNA polymerases can switch at the fork by simply alternation of those already bound to the DNA helicase [54]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Nature’s solution to this problem is to allow the transient action of a specialized polymerase that can overcome the damage (translesion synthesis, or TLS). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>These polymerases have less stringent active sites that allow them to accommodate various types of bulky lesions and therefore are often much less accurate (low-fidelity) than replicative DNA polymerases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>TLS polymerases display common features and structural elements, and they all belong to the Y-family of polymerases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which TLS polymerases take over extension of a primer 3’-end from a replicative DNA polymerase is based on their relative affinity for the sliding clamp. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Pol IV binds to the β-clamp at the same position on the clamp as Pol III [15, 57] but since the β-clamp can accommodate two ligands at the same time, both polymerases can simultaneously bind the same sliding clamp [58]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>The mechanistic basis of this reaction was evidenced by the determination of the structure of a domain of Pol IV bound to the β-clamp [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>The complex showed that Pol IV could interact with the sliding clamp via a highly flexible hinge that allows the protein to bind to the clamp in two distinct conformations: one extended in which Pol IV does not interact with DNA and would not clash sterically with Pol III bound to the same clamp, and one in which Pol IV would bend over DNA, take over the 3’-end from Pol III to extend the damaged template. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Once the damaged DNA block is overcome, Pol III takes over again the 3’-end to resume high-fidelity, processive synthesis [58]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>This model has been further supported by recent crystallographic work of the full-size Sulfolobus solfataricus Pol IV bound to its cognate clamp [23]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>In E. coli this process is achieved by DNA polymerase I, which contains a 5’-3’ exonuclease activity within the molecule that digests the RNA primer, and by DNA ligase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Both of these enzymes bind to the β-clamp [70, 71] but it is unknown if their actions are coordinated by it. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus the DNA ligase, the nuclease Fen1 and a DNA polymerase can bind with distinct affinity to each subunit of the heterotrimeric PCNA present in this organism, showing that simultaneous binding to the sliding clamp could be possible and suggesting tight coordination of these enzymes via PCNA [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>In eukaryotes numerous recent studies have highlighted the role of PCNA in coordinating the activities of Pol δ and Fen1 during lagging strand DNA synthesis [24, 72, 73]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that perhaps PCNA somehow rigidifies the enzyme or allows it to distort and kink DNA [76], as observed for Fen1 [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>In the closed conformation DNA ligase forms with PCNA two stacked rings with extensive contacts, and this perhaps would preclude other proteins from binding to the clamp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Perhaps this is related to the fact that ligation of DNA is typically the last step in Okazaki fragment processing or DNA repair reactions, and no subsequent binding to PCNA by other factors is required [26, 75, 77]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>It is unclear how PCNA coordinates the handoff of the enzymes implicated in Okazaki fragment processing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>DNA structure could dictate the various conformational switches that must take place for the three enzymes to perform their functions, but the mechanistic details are unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Given the extensive contacts made by these enzymes with the sliding clamp [24, 26, 27], it is interesting to consider the question of how the different ligands sever their binding surfaces to the clamp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>As in the case of translesion synthesis, protein modification seems to be the answer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Fen1 is phosphorylated by PCNA-bound Cdk1-Cyclin A in late S-phase, leading to its release from PCNA [78]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Likewise, human DNA ligase phosphorylation in multiple sites is cell-cycle dependent and results in its release from replication sites, but the effects of this modification on PCNA affinity are unclear [79-81]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, an interaction between human DNA ligase I and the clamp loader RFC has been reported which inhibits ligation, but this effect is reduced by binding of DNA ligase to PCNA [82]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>The critical involvement of sliding clamps on DNA repair pathways has been well documented, where they act to orchestrate the enzymatic activities required for DNA damage recognition and processing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>The mismatch repair pathway corrects errors introduced by the replication machinery and it has received intense scrutiny in the last decade [83]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>The sensors of DNA mismatches, the MutS in E. coli or the MSH proteins of eukaryotes, can interact with the β-clamp or PCNA, respectively [70, 84]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>In the case of MutS two interaction sites have been proposed: a weak one at the N-terminal, mismatch-binding, region of the protein, and one strong at the C-terminal region of the protein [14, 85, 86]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Recent studies of the Bacillus subtilis MutS-β-clamp interaction show that that β-clamp promotes the stabilization of MutS at mismatches via the C-terminal binding site, suggesting that mismatch recognition and β-clamp binding are tightly coupled to target MutS to active replication sites [86]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the binding site of eukaryotic MSH3 or MSH6 to PCNA is located at the extreme N-terminus of these proteins [84, 87-89]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that PCNA could stimulate the preferential binding of MSH2-MSH6 to DNA containing mismatches [87], but recent structural data of the PCNA-binding domain, which shows this domain as highly flexible, seems to argue against this idea [88-90]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>E. coli’s MutL and its eukaryotic homolog MLH1 also interact with the β-clamp and PCNA, respectively [91, 92]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>MutL is a multifaceted protein which acts as a ‘matchmaker’ among the mismatch repair factors and that, as revealed by crystallography, can undergo major conformational changes [93, 94]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>The interaction between MutL and the β-clamp seems to require binding of MutL to single-stranded DNA, a natural ligand of MutL [85, 94]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>In addition, the interactions of MutL to the β-clamp and MLH1 to PCNA have been tentatively mapped using peptides to an internal loop (Loop 2) that undergoes a conformational change during the ATPase cycle of this protein [85, 94]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>This loop is exposed to binding to the sliding clamp in the nucleotide-free MutL, but buried inside the N-terminal domain of MutL when the protein is bound to ATP, suggesting a possible on-off switch for the interaction [94]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>The function of these contacts is unknown, but they point towards a highly dynamic interaction in which protein affinity is ultimately modulated by DNA structure and ATP-induced conformational changes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, a recent study has shown that yeast PCNA is essential in orienting the endonuclease activity present in MLH1-PMS1 complexes to discontinuous strands of DNA [95]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Hundreds of millions of years of evolution have perfected the biosynthetic machinery by adding, from bacteria to the vertebrates, successive and ever more sophisticated layers of complexity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Ultimately, however, orchestration of the myriad biochemical events that take place during DNA synthesis relies on sequential and finely-tuned protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions of specialized protein modules that perform particular functions in an orderly, thermodynamically favorable, manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="?"><plain>How is it ensured that only the required enzymes coordinate their functions and activities at the replication fork at a given time and place? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Part of the answer is given by the observed ability of different enzymes to organize themselves on proteins that accept multiple ligands and act as scaffolds for sequential enzymatic reactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Within the replisome, at least three such scaffolds have been suggested in the literature: sliding clamps, the sliding clamp loaders [43], and the DNA helicase [54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Of these, the sliding clamps show the highest versatility and universality. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>An understanding of what governs attachment or detachment from the sliding clamps is therefore a critical aspect of the study of the multi-enzymatic reactions that drive DNA replication and repair. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>As reviewed here, cells employ a variety of means to modulate affinity for clamps, but in most systems studied to date the detailed mechanism remains to be analyzed (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>In prokaryotic systems a combination of conformational changes in the enzyme, ultimately brought about by specific DNA structures and coupled to ATPase activity, seems to be a widespread mechanism of controlling binding to sliding clamps. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, posttranslational modification of the interacting surfaces is the typical way by which eukaryotic systems modulate access of the various ligands to the PCNA ring. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>A field that requires more investigation relates to how are clamps removed from DNA, as we don’t clearly know what factor or factors are responsible for this process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>The clamp loader (γ-complex or RFC) could be responsible or, as it has been proposed, one of the newly identified variants of RFC [1]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>The diversity of proteins that interact with the β-clamp and PCNA makes sliding clamps one of the most trafficked elements in the cell protein network. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Future work is likely to focus on the solving of additional crystal structures of complexes of sliding clamps and their partner proteins, perhaps in combination with relevant DNA structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>The analysis of the architecture of the ternary complexes of sliding clamps bound to active enzymes engaged with their natural substrates should be the goal because it is probably different in the absence of DNA substrate. </plain></SENT>
