The comparative role of symbiont type in holobiont fitness in relation to host genotype or the environment, however, is largely unknown.

Growth and survival of juvenile corals were monitored for 31&#8211;35 weeks, after which their thermo-tolerance was experimentally assessed. Our results showed that: (1) <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> type was the most important predictor of holobiont fitness, as measured by growth, survival, and thermo-tolerance; (2) growth and survival, but not heat-tolerance, were also affected by local environmental conditions; and (3) host population had little to no effect on holobiont fitness. Furthermore, coral-algal associations were established with symbiont types belonging to clades A, C and D, but three out of four symbiont types belonging to clade C failed to establish a symbiosis.

The algal endosymbionts are photosynthetically active, and provide up to 95% of the energy requirement of the coral host <xref rid="pone.0006364-Muscatine1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In return, the coral host offers protection from predation and an environment with increased inorganic nutrients <xref rid="pone.0006364-Muscatine2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The success of coral reefs and their capacity to thrive in oligotrophic tropical waters has been heavily dependent on this partnership. The coral-zooxanthellae symbiosis is very sensitive to increases in temperature, however, and changes of as little as 1&#176;C above the average summer maximum can lead to a breakdown of the symbiosis. This breakdown results in expulsion and/or degradation of the algal partner causing the phenomenon known as coral bleaching (reviewed by Coles and Brown <xref rid="pone.0006364-Coles1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>). When bleaching is severe, and the symbiosis is unable to re-establish itself, the coral dies.</p><p>The genus <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> is highly diverse and consists of eight phylogenetic clades with each containing multiple subclades/types <xref rid="pone.0006364-Coffroth1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0006364-Stat1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Scleractinian corals form symbioses with members of six of these clades (A&#8211;D, F, G), but predominantly with those of clades A&#8211;D <xref rid="pone.0006364-Baker1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006364-Goulet1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. This genetic diversity is reflected functionally in traits that vary with symbiont type, such as growth and thermal tolerance of the holobiont, as well as the photosynthetic response of both <italic>in</italic> and <italic>ex hospite</italic> zooxanthellae <xref rid="pone.0006364-IglesiasPrieto1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0006364-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Although several previous studies have experimentally controlled for host and environmental factors, no study to date has compared the performance of coral symbioses with varying symbiont and host genotypes under different environmental conditions in the field, nor the extent to which holobiont traits are affected by either the host or symbiont <xref rid="pone.0006364-Bhagooli1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006364-Baird1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006364-Bhagooli2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. A better understanding of genotype x environment interactions is essential for predicting the potential of the holobiont to acclimatize to global warming through changes in the algal symbiont community <xref rid="pone.0006364-Baker2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0006364-Fautin1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and adaptation through selection on coral holobiont traits <xref rid="pone.0006364-Day1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>Most corals produce zooxanthella-free larvae, with each generation acquiring algal symbionts anew from the environment <xref rid="pone.0006364-Richmond1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Multiple <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> types are typically taken up by juvenile corals <xref rid="pone.0006364-Little1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006364-Coffroth2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, with mostly one type becoming dominant over time <xref rid="pone.0006364-Goulet1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006364-Goulet2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The other types are often not lost completely, but are reduced to low abundances or background densities that can persist throughout adult life <xref rid="pone.0006364-Mieog1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Changes in the <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> population of adult corals may be realized, therefore, through an increase in the relative abundance of these background types. For example, sub-lethal bleaching events can result in changes in the proportion of different algal types leading to dominance of the association by more thermo-tolerant <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> types <xref rid="pone.0006364-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Alternatively, adult corals may take up exogenous symbionts from the water column to establish a new symbiosis. This process has been documented under experimental conditions for anemones <xref rid="pone.0006364-Kinzie1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and octocorals <xref rid="pone.0006364-Lewis1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, but is expected to be more restricted in scleractinian corals <xref rid="pone.0006364-Coffroth3" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Symbiont change within a coral population can theoretically also stem from uptake of a new symbiont type from one generation to the next <xref rid="pone.0006364-Baird2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, but this has not been documented experimentally.</p><p>Here, we present results from a reciprocal grow-out experiment involving two populations of the common scleractinian coral <italic>Acropora millepora</italic> from two thermally contrasting, inshore environments on the Great Barrier Reef (Magnetic Island and the Keppel Islands). Individuals from each location were allowed to spawn in the laboratory to produce azooxanthellate juveniles, which were subsequently exposed to six different <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> types from three phylogenetic clades (A/C2* mixture, C1, C2, C&#8226; and D). The new holobionts were then returned to the field and fitness parameters measured over 31+weeks. The data show that the holobiont fitness traits growth, survival and thermal tolerance are differentially affected by the source population of the coral host, symbiont type and environmental factors, and that trade-offs between these fitness traits vary with environmental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Establishment and stability of symbioses with the different algal partners</title><p>Newly settled, azooxanthellate polyps of <italic>A. millepora</italic>, which had been offered six different symbiont types, successfully established symbioses with <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> types C1, D and C2*/A in juvenile cohorts originating from both the Magnetic Island and Keppel Islands populations.

<italic>A. millepora</italic> juveniles associated with <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> A were the least thermo-tolerant of the three coral-<italic>Symbiodinium</italic> associations tested, based on their inability to maintain the association at Magnetic Island and experimental evidence of greatest impact of heat stress on <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> A corals, i.e.: the sharp increase in Q recorded for KKA corals (not seen in KKC1/MKC1 or KKD corals), their bleached appearance, and large reductions in Fv/Fm and relative symbiont densities. Although subtle, the combined results from experiments 1 and 2 indicated that C1 corals are less thermo-tolerant than the D corals in this species. In experiment 1, the larger increase in Q of the C1 corals in the 32.5&#176;C treatment indicated a stronger stress response for this group compared to the D corals. This interpretation was supported by earlier and stronger reduction in Fv/Fm and a larger number of bleached colonies at the end of the experiment for C1 corals than for D corals. However, the relative zooxanthella densities were similarly reduced for all coral groups, indicating that all groups exhibited a bleaching response. At the lower cumulative heat-stress level of experiment 2, relative symbiont densities indicated that the C1 but not the D corals bleached to some extent, but no significant difference in thermo-tolerance between the C1 and D corals was evident from the Q or Fv/Fm measurements (although different trends were visible, see below). Both apparent inconsistencies may be explained by the fact that samples for relative symbiont density determinations were taken one day after the last PAM-measurements, leading to a stronger heat-stress effect on symbiont density than on fluorescence. Alternatively, loss of symbiont cells due to heat-stress may have preceded large responses in the fluorescent parameters. Whatever the cause, the difficulty in separating the thermo-tolerance of C1 and D indicates that the differences are small.</p><p>The consistently lower Q of C1 corals compared to D corals at relatively low levels of accumulated heat-stress during heat-stress experiment 1 resulted from a decrease in Q of C1 corals as an initial response to the temperature increases. The relative symbiont density measurements and visual assessments indicated that these (temperature-induced) differences were unrelated to bleaching. The early increase in Q at 32.5&#176;C for D corals in experiment 2 (after the initial drop for all groups) to higher values than for C1 corals during relatively low levels of accumulated heat-stress was similarly uncorrelated with bleaching, as were the increasing trends in KKA and KKD at 31&#176;C. The increase in Q for C1 corals (exp. 2) at higher accumulated heat-stress (last four days) however was correlated with decreased symbiont densities. Because Q takes into account both the photochemical and non-photochemical processes <xref rid="pone.0006364-IglesiasPrieto2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, temperature affects Q in multiple ways and the changes in this parameter may therefore not always be related to heat-stress, especially when they occur at low levels of accumulated heat-stress and remain at low values. For instance, dark reaction enzymes of photosynthesis increase the rate of catalyzed reactions with temperature (up to temperatures causing protein damage) <xref rid="pone.0006364-KarakoLampert1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, and a reduction in closed reaction centres with increasing temperature under the same irradiance could therefore be expected. Importantly, these effects may differ between symbiont types. We would therefore suggest that Q data are better interpreted as a change over time (and with accumulative heat-stress), and assessed in conjunction with other parameters, such as symbiont densities and visual assessments.</p><p>We were unable to raise holobionts with the generalist symbiont type C2 (Lajeunesse <italic>sensu</italic> C3), one of the main symbiont types on the GBR <xref rid="pone.0006364-vanOppen1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0006364-LaJeunesse2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.

Each experimental group was represented by one tile per tank, and the number of coral juveniles on each tile ranged from 10 to 70 (average of 25). Further details are given in the Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006364.s001">Materials and Methods S1</xref>. Due to the limited light field, the experimental set-up could accommodate a maximum of four groups. In order to assess the thermo-tolerance of the maximum number of coral groups, two successive experiments were performed.</p><sec id="s4d1"><title>Experiment 1</title><p>Performed in May-June 2006, this experiment involved the coral groups MMC1, MKC1, MMD and MKD. Juvenile corals were acclimated at 27 &#176;C (the ambient temperature at Magnetic Island in autumn) for 10 days with increasing photoperiod from 5L&#8758;19D to 8L&#8758;16D. The temperature was raised to the target temperatures over a period of three days (27&#176; (control), 30.5&#176;, 31.5&#176; and 32.5&#176;) and maintained for 18 days. During the experiment, the photo-period was further increased in two steps (Day 8 and 16) to 10L&#8758;14D.</p></sec><sec id="s4d2"><title>Experiment 2</title><p>Four additional coral groups, KKA, KKC1, KKD and MKC1, were heat-stressed in July 2006. Only three temperature treatments were performed because an insufficient number of colonies was available for four treatments. Juvenile corals were acclimated at 22&#176;C (the approximate ambient temperature at the Keppel Islands in early spring) for 9 days with an increasing photo-period starting at 3L&#8758;21D to 10L&#8758;14D. At the end of the acclimation period, the temperature was raised to the target temperatures over a period of seven days (27&#176; (control), 31&#176; and 32.5&#176;) and maintained for 15 days. Due to technical issues constraining the maximum temperature difference between treatments, the control group temperature was increased to 27&#176;C.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Photosynthetic performance</title><p>Photosynthetic performance (as an indicator of thermal stress) was assessed using a MAXI-imaging PAM (MAXI-iPAM; Walz, Germany). Details are given in the Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006364.s001">Materials and Methods S1</xref>. Briefly, the maximum and effective quantum yields (Fv/Fm and F/Fm', respectively) were measured, and the excitation pressure over photosystem II (Q) was calculated according to the formula described by Iglesias-Prieto <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0006364-IglesiasPrieto2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p><p>Q is a highly informative measure for photosynthetic performance that takes into account both the photochemical and non-photochemical processes <xref rid="pone.0006364-IglesiasPrieto2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. It provides an indication of the ratio between open and closed reaction centres of photosystem II under the experimental irradiance level: a value of close to zero indicates that most of the reaction centres are open, suggesting light-limitation; a value close to one indicates that almost all reaction centres are closed, suggesting photo-inhibition. Although still poorly understood, thermal bleaching of corals is inherently associated with an accumulation of excitation pressure within PSII <xref rid="pone.0006364-Smith2" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006364-Jones2" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Therefore, increases in Q over time to unusually high values, under constant light levels and accumulating heat-stress, are indicative of chronic photoinhibition and, therefore, a bleaching response <xref rid="pone.0006364-Abrego1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Real-time PCR and visual assessment</title><p>Six juvenile colonies were taken per experimental group/treatment (2 per tank) before heating started (experiment 2 only) and one day after the last PAM measurements, to determine relative <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cell densities. For this, the real-time PCR assay based on actin genes and described in Mieog <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0006364-Mieog2" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref> was followed, using SDS-based DNA extraction and normalization to coral surface area. New real-time PCR primers for <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> type A were developed following the method described in Mieog <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0006364-Mieog2" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. More information about the real-time PCR assay is given as supporting information (Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006364.s001">Materials and Methods S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006364.s002">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006364.s006">Fig. S2</xref>). Densities were expressed in relative rather than absolute numbers, avoiding the estimation of DNA extraction efficiencies and actin gene copy numbers. This method assumes that extraction efficiencies were equal for all samples. <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> densities of the pre-stress (only available in the second heat-stress experiment) or control treatments were set to 100%.</p><p>Mortality unrelated to bleaching, which may have been caused by accidental abrasion of the coral juveniles during the cleaning of the tiles, was judged by the presence of patchy tissue necrosis. These individuals were immediately removed to avoid the spreading of any disease and were not included in the data. All colonies were visually scored at the end of the experiment as healthy, pale, or bleached. The red color of the terracotta tiles was used as a color reference, and the data was conservatively analyzed with an emphasis on bleached vs healthy/pale.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>For growth, mean colony surface areas were compared between coral groups. Colony surface areas were averaged per tile side to facilitate analyses and to be conservative. In the first test, all groups (except KKA) were compared at T&#8202;=&#8202;31 weeks. KKA was left out of this analysis because no other A group was present to test for host population or environmental effects. The data for MMC1 and MMD were interpolated per tile side to T&#8202;=&#8202;31 weeks by curve-fitting the data using all time points. The T&#8202;=&#8202;31 data were log-transformed to correct for heteroscedacity of variances. A general linear model ANOVA was used, specifying the following fixed terms: Symbiont type, Host population, Outplant location, Symbiont type*Outplant location, Symbiont type*Host population.</p><p>To further analyze the effect of the three <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> types on growth at the Keppel Islands, a repeated measure model ANOVA was run on all data points (T&#8202;=&#8202;6, 13 and 31 weeks). Data were averaged per tile side and log-transformed as before. Symbiont type was specified as the (fixed) predictor, with Time as the Within-Subjects factor. When a significant Symbiont type effect was found, a Fisher <italic>post hoc</italic> test was performed to determine which symbiont types were different.</p><p>Survival was analyzed for each outplant location with Kaplan-Meyer log-rank tests. As no satisfactory method of interpolation could be established for the survival data, pairwise comparisons of host populations were used for the groups outplanted to Magnetic Island (MMC1 x MMD and MKC1 x MKD) to test for an effect of Symbiont type. For the Keppel Islands, all groups were included in a first test for Symbiont type. Upon finding a significant effect, pairwise comparisons were performed to establish where the differences were located.</p><p>Analyses of the laboratory heat-stress experiments utilized PAM-fluorometry data and symbiont density data. Separate analyses were performed for each experiment since the stress-levels differed. Q fluorescence data was arcsine transformed and analyzed using repeated measures model ANOVAs. To correct for differences in colony number per tile, average Q values per tile were calculated. For experiment 1, a full factorial approach was used with Time as the Within-Subjects factor. The following fixed terms were specified: Temperature, Symbiont type, Host population. For experiment 2 the data were analyzed in two steps: first, KKC1 and MKC1 were analyzed, with Time as the Within-Subjects factor and Outplant location as the (fixed) predictor. If no significant differences were found, all groups were included in a second analysis with Time as the Within-Subjects factor and Temperature and Symbiont type specified as (fixed) predictors.</p><p>
<italic>Symbiodinium</italic> density data were square-root transformed and analyzed using factorial ANOVAs.
