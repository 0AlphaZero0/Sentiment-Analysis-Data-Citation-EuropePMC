</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Offspring of the coral, Acropora millepora, from two thermally contrasting locations, were experimentally infected with one of six Symbiodinium types, which spanned three phylogenetic clades (A, C and D), and then outplanted to the two parental field locations (central and southern inshore Great Barrier Reef, Australia). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Growth and survival of juvenile corals were monitored for 31–35 weeks, after which their thermo-tolerance was experimentally assessed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that: (1) Symbiodinium type was the most important predictor of holobiont fitness, as measured by growth, survival, and thermo-tolerance; (2) growth and survival, but not heat-tolerance, were also affected by local environmental conditions; and (3) host population had little to no effect on holobiont fitness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, coral-algal associations were established with symbiont types belonging to clades A, C and D, but three out of four symbiont types belonging to clade C failed to establish a symbiosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Associations with clade A had the lowest fitness and were unstable in the field. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The obligate symbiosis between reef-building corals and unicellular algae of the genus Symbiodinium, commonly referred to as zooxanthellae, is a key feature of tropical coral reefs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The algal endosymbionts are photosynthetically active, and provide up to 95% of the energy requirement of the coral host [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In return, the coral host offers protection from predation and an environment with increased inorganic nutrients [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The success of coral reefs and their capacity to thrive in oligotrophic tropical waters has been heavily dependent on this partnership. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The coral-zooxanthellae symbiosis is very sensitive to increases in temperature, however, and changes of as little as 1°C above the average summer maximum can lead to a breakdown of the symbiosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>This breakdown results in expulsion and/or degradation of the algal partner causing the phenomenon known as coral bleaching (reviewed by Coles and Brown [3]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>When bleaching is severe, and the symbiosis is unable to re-establish itself, the coral dies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The genus Symbiodinium is highly diverse and consists of eight phylogenetic clades with each containing multiple subclades/types [4]–[6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Scleractinian corals form symbioses with members of six of these clades (A–D, F, G), but predominantly with those of clades A–D [7], [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>This genetic diversity is reflected functionally in traits that vary with symbiont type, such as growth and thermal tolerance of the holobiont, as well as the photosynthetic response of both in and ex hospite zooxanthellae [9]–[16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Although several previous studies have experimentally controlled for host and environmental factors, no study to date has compared the performance of coral symbioses with varying symbiont and host genotypes under different environmental conditions in the field, nor the extent to which holobiont traits are affected by either the host or symbiont [11], [17], [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>A better understanding of genotype x environment interactions is essential for predicting the potential of the holobiont to acclimatize to global warming through changes in the algal symbiont community [19]–[21] and adaptation through selection on coral holobiont traits [22]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Most corals produce zooxanthella-free larvae, with each generation acquiring algal symbionts anew from the environment [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Multiple Symbiodinium types are typically taken up by juvenile corals [13], [24], with mostly one type becoming dominant over time [8], [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The other types are often not lost completely, but are reduced to low abundances or background densities that can persist throughout adult life [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Changes in the Symbiodinium population of adult corals may be realized, therefore, through an increase in the relative abundance of these background types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>For example, sub-lethal bleaching events can result in changes in the proportion of different algal types leading to dominance of the association by more thermo-tolerant Symbiodinium types [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, adult corals may take up exogenous symbionts from the water column to establish a new symbiosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>This process has been documented under experimental conditions for anemones [10] and octocorals [28], but is expected to be more restricted in scleractinian corals [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Symbiont change within a coral population can theoretically also stem from uptake of a new symbiont type from one generation to the next [30], but this has not been documented experimentally. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Here, we present results from a reciprocal grow-out experiment involving two populations of the common scleractinian coral Acropora millepora from two thermally contrasting, inshore environments on the Great Barrier Reef (Magnetic Island and the Keppel Islands). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Individuals from each location were allowed to spawn in the laboratory to produce azooxanthellate juveniles, which were subsequently exposed to six different Symbiodinium types from three phylogenetic clades (A/C2* mixture, C1, C2, C• and D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The new holobionts were then returned to the field and fitness parameters measured over 31+weeks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The data show that the holobiont fitness traits growth, survival and thermal tolerance are differentially affected by the source population of the coral host, symbiont type and environmental factors, and that trade-offs between these fitness traits vary with environmental conditions. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>We could only assess developmental plasticity in thermal tolerance after laboratory acclimation, as the two other traits were measured in the field. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>A. millepora juveniles associated with Symbiodinium A were the least thermo-tolerant of the three coral-Symbiodinium associations tested, based on their inability to maintain the association at Magnetic Island and experimental evidence of greatest impact of heat stress on Symbiodinium A corals, i.e.: the sharp increase in Q recorded for KKA corals (not seen in KKC1/MKC1 or KKD corals), their bleached appearance, and large reductions in Fv/Fm and relative symbiont densities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Although subtle, the combined results from experiments 1 and 2 indicated that C1 corals are less thermo-tolerant than the D corals in this species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>In experiment 1, the larger increase in Q of the C1 corals in the 32.5°C treatment indicated a stronger stress response for this group compared to the D corals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>This interpretation was supported by earlier and stronger reduction in Fv/Fm and a larger number of bleached colonies at the end of the experiment for C1 corals than for D corals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>However, the relative zooxanthella densities were similarly reduced for all coral groups, indicating that all groups exhibited a bleaching response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>At the lower cumulative heat-stress level of experiment 2, relative symbiont densities indicated that the C1 but not the D corals bleached to some extent, but no significant difference in thermo-tolerance between the C1 and D corals was evident from the Q or Fv/Fm measurements (although different trends were visible, see below). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Both apparent inconsistencies may be explained by the fact that samples for relative symbiont density determinations were taken one day after the last PAM-measurements, leading to a stronger heat-stress effect on symbiont density than on fluorescence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, loss of symbiont cells due to heat-stress may have preceded large responses in the fluorescent parameters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Whatever the cause, the difficulty in separating the thermo-tolerance of C1 and D indicates that the differences are small. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>The consistently lower Q of C1 corals compared to D corals at relatively low levels of accumulated heat-stress during heat-stress experiment 1 resulted from a decrease in Q of C1 corals as an initial response to the temperature increases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>The relative symbiont density measurements and visual assessments indicated that these (temperature-induced) differences were unrelated to bleaching. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>The early increase in Q at 32.5°C for D corals in experiment 2 (after the initial drop for all groups) to higher values than for C1 corals during relatively low levels of accumulated heat-stress was similarly uncorrelated with bleaching, as were the increasing trends in KKA and KKD at 31°C. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>The increase in Q for C1 corals (exp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>2) at higher accumulated heat-stress (last four days) however was correlated with decreased symbiont densities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Because Q takes into account both the photochemical and non-photochemical processes [39], temperature affects Q in multiple ways and the changes in this parameter may therefore not always be related to heat-stress, especially when they occur at low levels of accumulated heat-stress and remain at low values. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>For instance, dark reaction enzymes of photosynthesis increase the rate of catalyzed reactions with temperature (up to temperatures causing protein damage) [40], and a reduction in closed reaction centres with increasing temperature under the same irradiance could therefore be expected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Importantly, these effects may differ between symbiont types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>We would therefore suggest that Q data are better interpreted as a change over time (and with accumulative heat-stress), and assessed in conjunction with other parameters, such as symbiont densities and visual assessments. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>We were unable to raise holobionts with the generalist symbiont type C2 (Lajeunesse sensu C3), one of the main symbiont types on the GBR [41]–[43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>However, it is known that both C1 and D are more common than C2 at relatively warm, inshore locations [41], [44], C2 confers a 1–1.5°C lower thermo-tolerance in adult A. millepora than D [12], and both C1 and D increased in relative abundance at the expense of C2 after a natural bleaching event [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Taken together, this strongly suggests that C2 confers a significantly lower thermo-tolerance to A. millepora than either C1 or D. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Its relative tolerance in comparison to A remains to be determined. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has been suggested that members of the clade A lineage may be more adapted to a free-living life-style and have opportunistic interactions with cnidarian hosts such as corals, which may more resemble parasitism [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>This conclusion was based on (1) the relative rarity of coral-clade A associations (e.g. [42]), (2) the presence of clade A in corals with a reduced health [49]–[51], (3) low carbon translocation to hosts when in symbiosis with clade A compared to clade C [49], (4) low diversity within clade A, suggesting an opportunistic lifestyle [49], and (5) clade A symbionts outcompete other clades in culture [52]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>The inability of C• (C15 sensu Lajeunesse et al.

<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>We have no explanation for these results, and can only hypothesize that (1) the physical conditions of our experimental setup were unfavorable for C2 and C2*, and/or (2) Symbiodinium C2 and C2* are taken up at a later developmental stage in nature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the ‘uninfected’ juveniles that were outplanted to the Keppel Islands mostly took up Symbiodinium D in the first few months and no Symbiodinium C2 was found in any of the genotyped samples, supporting the hypothesis that developmental stage might play a role in establishment of the C2/C2*-symbioses. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>C1 and D corals of A. millepora are both relatively thermo-tolerant (with D corals slightly more thermo-tolerant), and Symbiodinium A is a poor symbiotic partner for A. millepora with opportunistic characteristics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Trade-offs between thermo-tolerance and growth/survival rate vary between A. millepora-Symbiodinium associations, and differing environmental conditions can weaken or strengthen these trade-offs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>The results of this study support the notion that symbiont shuffling [7], [21] is likely to play a major role in the response of this species to global warming. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>However, care has to be taken not to overestimate the potential of this response, as it is more likely that symbiont shuffling would only buy time rather than save this coral species from the impacts of climate change (see also [26], [27], [59]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>The main question to be addressed now is how representative these findings are for other corals species, including other species within the genus Acropora. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>Photosynthetic performance (as an indicator of thermal stress) was assessed using a MAXI-imaging PAM (MAXI-iPAM; Walz, Germany). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Details are given in the Supporting Materials and Methods S1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>Briefly, the maximum and effective quantum yields (Fv/Fm and F/Fm', respectively) were measured, and the excitation pressure over photosystem II (Q) was calculated according to the formula described by Iglesias-Prieto et al. [39]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Q is a highly informative measure for photosynthetic performance that takes into account both the photochemical and non-photochemical processes [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>It provides an indication of the ratio between open and closed reaction centres of photosystem II under the experimental irradiance level: a value of close to zero indicates that most of the reaction centres are open, suggesting light-limitation; a value close to one indicates that almost all reaction centres are closed, suggesting photo-inhibition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Although still poorly understood, thermal bleaching of corals is inherently associated with an accumulation of excitation pressure within PSII [62], [63]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Therefore, increases in Q over time to unusually high values, under constant light levels and accumulating heat-stress, are indicative of chronic photoinhibition and, therefore, a bleaching response [34]. </plain></SENT>
