</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Plant cell walls are the most abundant renewable resource of photosynthetically fixed carbon. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This lignocellulosic biomass is poised to become the primary source for the production of liquid biofuels (Herrera 2006; Himmel et al. 2007; Pauly and Keegstra 2008a, b; Ragauskas et al. 2006; Somerville 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The recalcitrance of plant cell wall materials to cost-effective and efficient degradation, however, poses a major impediment for their use in the production of transportation fuels and chemicals (Pauly and Keegstra 2008b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Plant cell walls have a heterogeneous and complex hierarchical structure, which is primarily made up of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The detailed structure of plant cell walls, especially at the ultrastructural level, however, remains to be fully elucidated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Yet, such a detailed knowledge is required to understand the specific chemical and physical obstacles to breakdown. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Lignin is a complex and irregular poly-phenylpropanoid heteropolymer present in the cell walls of vascular plants, and, after cellulose, is the second most abundant natural polymer (Boerjan et al. 2003; Dixon and Reddy 2003; Fukushima 2001; Ralph et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Lignin is essential for structural integrity of the cell wall and stiffness and strength of the stem and root; it waterproofs the wall enabling transport of water and solutes through the vascular system, and it is involved in protecting plants against pathogens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>As a direct result of the chemical and structural properties tailored for these functional roles, lignin in particular becomes problematic to the postharvest deconstruction of lignocellulosic biomass. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>For example, in biomass conversion for biofuels, lignin inhibits saccharification in processes aimed at producing simple sugars for fermentation to ethanol (Ralph et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The effective use of plants for industrial purposes is in fact largely dependent on the extent to which the plant cell wall is lignified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the removal of lignin is a costly and limiting factor (Chiang 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Therefore, lignin has become a key plant breeding and genetic engineering target in order to improve cell wall conversion. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Wood is one of the possible feedstocks for the commercial production of cellulosic ethanol (Herrera 2006; Ragauskas et al. 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Genetic engineering of trees has generated substantial interests aiming at the development of genotypes with improved wood traits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In wood of transgenic Populus tremuloides, reduction of lignin has been achieved through the suppression of the monolignol pathway gene encoding 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL) by antisense inhibition (Hu et al. 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Low lignin wood offers potentials for improved biomass conversion into fermentable sugars. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Analytical tools that permit the accurate rapid characterization of plant cell walls become increasingly important for evaluating specific traits associated with a large number of breeding populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Accurate investigation of specific chemical characteristics of lignocellulosic materials can be difficult since extractive procedures for the isolation of native components are inevitably destructive, bringing about significant chemical and structural modifications (Atalla and Agarwal 1985, 1986; Fukushima 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Analytical chemical in situ methods are, thus, invaluable tools for the compositional and structural characterization of lignocellulosic materials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Some of these techniques, e.g., high-resolution solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (Yelle et al. 2008), near-infrared (NIR), mid-infrared, and Raman spectroscopy, can afford non-destructive and comparatively inexpensive measurements with minimal sample preparation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>NIR spectroscopy was introduced as a rapid analysis tool for characterizing the bulk chemical properties of transgenic aspen wood (Yamada et al. 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Most recently, the rapid analysis of lignin monomer composition in hybrid poplar by a streamlined thioacidolysis procedure and NIR reflectance-based prediction modeling was established enabling medium- to high-throughput screening (Robinson and Mansfield 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Raman spectroscopy was shown to be well suited to give insights into both the composition and the structure of lignocellulosic materials (Agarwal 1999, 2008; Agarwal and Ralph 1997; Atalla and Agarwal 1985, 1986); it has multi-phase sensitivity and it is label-free and non-invasive in nature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Raman spectroscopy enabled the study of changes in lignin structure in the xylem of stems of genetically manipulated tobacco plants (Stewart et al. 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>It also permitted in situ quantification of the aromatic-ring-conjugated ethylenic structures of lignin in spruce wood (Agarwal and Ralph 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Raman microscopy was used on wood samples, coupling the spectral analysis with spatial resolution (Atalla and Agarwal 1985, 1986; Roder et al. 2004; Roder and Sixta 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Confocal Raman microscopy facilitated the chemical imaging of poplar (Gierlinger and Burgert 2006; Gierlinger and Schwanninger 2006) and spruce wood cell walls (Agarwal 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>It enabled the in situ study of the spatial distribution and orientation of cell wall polymers, in particular cellulose and lignin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The potential of Raman microscopy and Raman imaging in plant research was discussed in detail in a recent review (Gierlinger and Schwanninger 2007). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Here, we use confocal Raman microscopy to acquire and compare chemical images of wild type and lignin-deficient transgenic Populus trichocarpa (black cottonwood) wood cross-sections. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The coding sequence of Ptr4CL3 was cloned into a modified binary vector pBI121 in an antisense orientation with respect to a CaMV double 35S promoter to replace the GUS gene. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The Raman bands are attributable primarily to the major wood polymers found in poplar, i.e., cellulose, xylan, glucomannan, and lignin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Band assignments are given in the literature (Agarwal 1999; Agarwal and Ralph 1997; Atalla and Agarwal 1986; Gierlinger and Schwanninger 2006; Himmelsbach et al. 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>It is noted that in the region between 1,600 and 1,700 cm−1 the vastly dominant spectral contribution stems from lignin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>There are three peaks at 1,605, 1,628, and 1,665 cm−1, highlighted in the inset of Fig. 1, which are useful markers of lignin (Agarwal 1999) (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>These lignin bands are significantly reduced in intensity in the as4CL-12 transgenic wood compared to the wild type. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>It was shown that the relative spectral contributions of different lignin units are not only dependent on concentration but also on pre-resonance Raman and conjugation effects (Agarwal 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of the intensity decrease in all three bands, however, is clearly indicative of an overall reduction in lignin content in as4CL-12, which is consistent with the chemical analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the overall carbon content, estimated from the C–H stretching bands between 2,800 and 3,100 cm−1, is comparable for both samples. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>The basic morphology of the measured cell walls in the wild type (Fig. 2a) and as4CL-12 (Fig. 2d) becomes apparent in the chemical images based on the composite C–H stretching bands, i.e., integrating the intensity over the range from 2,775 to 3,125 cm−1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>The spatial distribution of lignin is visualized by integrating the intensity from 1,550 to 1,700 cm−1 (Fig. 2b, e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>In wild-type wood, there is strong contrast between morphologically distinct cell wall regions due to different lignin signal intensity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>High lignin signal intensity is observed in the cell corners (CC) and, somewhat less, in the compound middle lamellae (CML) (Fig. 2b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>The results are consistent with earlier studies of lignin distribution in the xylem of gymnosperms and angiosperms by Raman microscopy (Agarwal 2006; Gierlinger and Burgert 2006; Gierlinger and Schwanninger 2006), UV microscopy (Koch and Kleist 2001), energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (Westermark et al. 1988), and interference and fluorescence microscopy (Donaldson et al. 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Within the S2 wall layer of the fibers less, yet not insubstantial, amounts of lignin are observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>The S2 layer of vessels shows stronger lignin signal than the S2 layer of fibers, as noted previously (Gierlinger and Burgert 2006). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>While the relative lignin signal intensity is still higher in the CC and CML than in the S2 layer, there is a clear overall reduction of lignin compared to the wild type. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>In the S2 wall layer of the fibers, lignin is significantly depleted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>This is further illustrated by the comparison of the C–H and lignin band intensity profiles of line cuts across cell walls in the wild type and as4CL-12 (Fig. 2c, f). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Measurements on a second transgenic line, as4CL-4 (15.0% lignin content), gave comparable results to those of as4CL-12 (Supplementary Figure). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Owing to the in situ chemical sensitivity and the specific chemical attributions of the lignin bands (Table 1) (Agarwal and Ralph 2008), it is possible to further dissect the spatial lignin distribution both within and between samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>While the 1,605 cm−1 band is due to aryl ring stretching and thus is a more general lignin marker, the 1,628 cm−1 band is indicative of coniferaldehyde and the 1,665 cm−1 band of coniferyl alcohol and coniferaldehyde (Agarwal 1999; Agarwal and Ralph 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>For the wild-type sample, the chemical image based on the 1,605 cm−1 band is shown in Fig. 3a. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>The highest lignin signal intensity is observed in CC, followed by CML and the cell walls of vessels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Also, variability of lignin signal intensity is found to some extent within CC, CML and S2, especially from fiber to fiber. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>There is substantial similarity between the spatial distributions of the 1,628 and 1,665 cm−1 bands (data not shown) and that of the 1,605 cm−1 band, especially for the 1,665 cm−1 band and somewhat less for the 1,628 cm−1 band. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>In order to glean more subtle differences, images for band ratios were obtained. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>In the image showing the ratio of the 1,628 cm−1 to the 1,605 cm−1 band (Fig. 3c), a relative increase of coniferaldehyde is observed, especially in the cell walls of vessels and, to a lesser degree, in CC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>The heterogeneity in the band ratio intensity is a direct evidence of the spatially distinct chemical composition of lignin. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Raman spectroscopy has a high sensitivity for detecting ring-conjugated ethylenic units (Agarwal 1999; Agarwal and Ralph 2008), which are present at low concentrations mainly as coniferaldehyde and coniferyl alcohol residues. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Examining the lignin Raman bands in the spectral region between 1,600 and 1,700 cm−1, an overall reduction in lignin signal intensity in the as4CL-12 transgenic poplar sample relative to the wild type was detected, which is consistent with the results from a wet chemical analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Importantly, differences in lignin localization were visualized in situ in a label-free manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Lignin was found to be significantly reduced in the S2 wall layers of the transgenic poplar fibers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Given that most wood biomass is in the S2 layer of fibers, this finding may have important implications toward addressing biomass recalcitrance to degradation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>By analyzing the three lignin bands at 1,605, 1,628, and 1,665 cm−1 in more detail, it was possible to further dissect the spatial lignin distribution both within and between samples. </plain></SENT>
