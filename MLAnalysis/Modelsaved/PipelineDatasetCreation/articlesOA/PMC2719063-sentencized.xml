<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Survival depended on persistence of p59Fyn function in the naïve T cells, because in its absence the half-life of the cells was reduced 4-5-fold, and the cells also gained extreme sensitivity to blockade of IL-7:IL-7Rα interactions [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Basal TCRξ phosphorylation was substantially reduced in T cells lacking p56Lck, but it was undetectable when both p56Lck and p59Fyn were missing [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Together with data from other studies [19], [21], [49]–[57] these results indicate that TCR and IL-7 receptor signaling are essential for the survival of naïve T cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>By contrast, p56Lck deficiency (or combined p56Lck and p59Fyn deficiency) was found to have no detectable impact on the survival of memory T cells except in the presence of IL-7 receptor blockade, in which case CD4+ memory T cells, but not CD8+ T cells, showed impaired survival [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>We show here that Treg cells persist in the absence of both p56Lck and p59Fyn, and in this respect they are therefore more similar to memory T cells than to naïve T cells. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Both Lck and Lck/Fyn mice were, however, free of obvious disease throughout a year-long observation period and we noted no increase in unexpected fatalities in the mutant groups relative to controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Evidence that the mice were nonetheless undergoing immune responses due to impaired Treg cell function included mild lymphadenopathy (Figure 3) and increased frequencies of CD44hiCD25−CD4+ T cells (Figure 7C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>These latter T cells lacked expression of activation markers, and were not actively proliferating, indicating that the immune responses that created them were not ongoing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>The majority of them had undergone Ox40-cre-mediated inactivation of p56Lck (data not shown) providing a straightforward explanation for why they were not acutely activated, and suggesting that they were the product of clonal expansion that was likely terminated at the point when OX40 was induced. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Although the absence of disease in the mutant mice limited their usefulness for studying disease suppression by Treg cells, it was an obvious advantage for studying the Treg cell-intrinsic consequences of a loss of TCR signaling in the absence of complicating immunopathology. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>This was immediately evident at the cell surface (Figures 7 and 9) where the loss of p56Lck function correlated with dramatic changes in the display of several molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Most notably, compared to control cells, there was upregulation of Ly-6C and downregulation of CD103, CD200, CCR6, CD5, CD71, GITR, CD5, CD44 and CTLA4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Consistent with decreased levels of surface and intracellular molecules that influence migration to tissues and high levels of surface CD62L, Treg cells that had lost p56Lck function were under-represented in tissues and the spleen, but were present in normal frequencies in the lymph nodes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Whereas gene expression and distribution in the body were abnormal in p56Lck-deficient Treg cells, we found no obvious defects in p56Lck-sufficient cells in the same mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Thus, the changes observed were intrinsic to Treg cells that had undergone Ox40-cre-mediated recombination and were not the result of systemic effects. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Under normal conditions, Treg cells can be subdivided into those that have a ‘naïve-like’ phenotype and those that have an ‘effector/memory’ phenotype [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Activation of the former causes at least some of them to differentiate into the latter and to mobilize from the lymph nodes to tissues and inflamed sites [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>The correlation we have described between changes in gene expression and redistribution of Treg cells lacking p56Lck function are entirely consistent with this and indicate that the mobilization of Treg cells to tissues is a dynamic process that is strongly dependent on persistent TCR stimulation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>A large fraction of genes showed similar changes in expression in both Treg cells and conventional T cells following p56Lck inactivation (Figure 6B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>These included genes that are well-characterized as being responsive to the TCR signal such as those encoding Egr-1, Egr-2, Egr-3, CD81, CD83, CD200, ALCAM, RANKL, and Stra13. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>It also included genes for CD137, CD44, Tieg1 and NRP1, variation in the expression of which has been correlated with Treg cell function [65]–[69]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Genes that were substantially affected in regulatory but not conventional T cells included those encoding Myosin-6, Egr-3, PD-1, Ptger2, Galnt14, Tox, RGS10, LIP1, Ly6f, Txk, and Tec. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>We noted that among an independently-derived list of Treg signature genes [40], approximately 20% were differentially expressed in the mutant Treg cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>While this indicates that a substantial part of the Treg phenotype (measured at the population level) is dependent on persistent TCR signaling, it also shows that perhaps the majority of the Treg gene expression pattern is independent of this. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>In particular, we found that although there was a modest reduction in FoxP3 transcript levels, this decrease was not readily apparent by intracellular staining for FoxP3 protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Thus, sustained FoxP3 expression in Treg cells, like that of many other Treg signature genes, was relatively insensitive to loss of the TCR signal. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Two of the more striking consequences of p56Lck inactivation in Treg cells were the upregulation of Ly-6C and myosin-6 expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>The former is a cell surface molecule of unclear function that has the capacity to influence lymphocyte homing, while the latter is an actin-based motor with unusual properties [45], [70]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Upregulation of both molecules was initially detected in the microarray analysis, but was subsequently confirmed by FACS and real-time RT-PCR respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Although the significance of the upregulation of these genes in the mutant Treg cells remains to be established, it is possible that monitoring their expression (and that of other genes identified in this study) could be exploited as a means to identify cells in nonmutant populations of Treg cells that are experiencing less TCR signaling than other cells in the same populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Such a discrimination might reveal unexpected relationships between self-responses and Treg cell function. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>In almost all of the circumstances we examined, the absence of p59Fyn had no evident additive effect to the inactivation of p56Lck. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Thus, Treg cells were present at the same average frequency in all locations in both Lck and Lck/Fyn mice, and their cell surface phenotype was indistinguishable in both cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>The only difference we noted between the two types of mice was in the reduced frequency of memory phenotype CD25− CD4+ T cells in the lymph nodes of Lck/Fyn compared to Lck mice (Figure 7C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>This decrease was associated with an increased apparent selection against cells with loss of p56Lck (Figure 7D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>p56Lck and p59Fyn have partially overlapping functions at the CD4−CD8− double-negative stage of development in the thymus [28], [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>They also both positively regulate Erk activation in naïve CD4+ T cells in response to TCR ligation [71] and they are at least partially redundant in regulating naïve T cell survival [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, they phosphorylate distinct substrates and there is evidence that p59Fyn may be more important for attenuation of T cell signaling than for its propagation particularly in CD8+ T cells [72]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Thus, the absence of a more profound consequence of the double deficiency is not unexpected given the primacy of p56Lck in positive regulation of TCR signaling. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we have shown here that inactivation of p56Lck – and thus the TCR signal – incapacitates Treg cells and results in changes in their gene expression program. </plain></SENT>
