</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Although the global incidence of tuberculosis (TB) is declining, drug resistance is rapidly emerging and spreading.1 Insufficient control measures have led to a drastic increase in the prevalence of drug-resistant strains and, more importantly, the degree of drug resistance; in certain high-burden countries the nature of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) has rapidly evolved from incidental to epidemic.1 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The production of new and more effective antibiotics partially addresses this problem, but without a more detailed comprehension of the molecular mechanisms that lead to successful (M)DR strains, these new compounds may also be quickly rendered ineffective by the generation of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Isoniazid and rifampicin are the two most commonly used anti-TB drugs and the backbone of any successful TB treatment programme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>MDR-TB is consequently defined as TB that is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Monoresistance to isoniazid is significantly more prevalent than monoresistance to rifampicin and MDR-TB; based on the most recent data it is estimated that 13.3% of all TB cases globally involve isoniazid monoresistance, versus 0.6% rifampicin monoresistance and 5.3% MDR-TB cases.1 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Shortly after the introduction of isoniazid in the 1950s, the first resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis mutants were isolated and it was observed that many of these strains had reduced catalase activity.2 It was first assumed that deletion of katG, coding for the only identified catalase–peroxidase in M. tuberculosis, was the main mechanism responsible for resistance to isoniazid.3 However, subsequent studies demonstrated that, although conferring high levels of resistance, this is not the primary mechanism.4–7 Although any mutation reducing KatG activity results in resistance, relatively few mutations in katG account for the majority of isoniazid resistance in clinical isolates; resistance to isoniazid is primarily conferred by the mutations katG-S315T (45%–75%) and inhA-C(-)15T (15%–25%).8–13 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Biochemical and in vitro studies have shown that the most prevalent mutant, katG-S315T, still retains a significant part of its catalase activity,7,14–17 which appears to be sufficient for the preservation of virulence.18,19 Strains carrying this mutation typically have an intermediate (1–5 mg/L) level of resistance to isoniazid,11,15,20,21 since KatG has reduced abilities to activate isoniazid, but has not completely lost this function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the regulatory region of inhA usually lead to a low-level resistance (0.2–1.0 mg/L).15,21 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Mutations that lead to complete loss of function of KatG, such as deletions, insertions or other frameshifts, are found in a small proportion of the isoniazid-resistant strains.22 On average, partial or complete katG deletion mutants are reported in only ∼5% of resistant isolates,13,15,20,23,24 but higher proportions have been reported on occasion.5,6 Additionally, strains with isoniazid resistance due to deletion of the katG gene are less likely to be clustered than strains with the katG-S315T mutation, a mutation significantly associated with successful dissemination.12,13,25,26 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Isolates resistant due to inactivation of KatG often have additional mutations in the regulatory region or coding sequence of ahpC, coding for an alkylhydroperoxidase.27,28 Originally, researchers assumed these mutations were alternative mechanisms of isoniazid resistance,29,30 but subsequent studies showed that the majority of the mutations in ahpC or the intergenic region oxyR-ahpC were compensating for the loss of katG function.31,32 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>It is frequently assumed that the mutation rate for isoniazid resistance is ∼100 times higher than for rifampicin and, consequently, that isoniazid resistance precedes resistance to rifampicin in the development of MDR-TB. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, there are no empirical grounds for these assumptions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>We therefore studied the emergence of isoniazid resistance in vitro, making use of well-characterized M. tuberculosis laboratory strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>We determined the in vitro mutation rate to isoniazid and characterized spontaneous isoniazid-resistant mutants by sequencing, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA)33 and comparative genome hybridization (CGH). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to shed more light on the molecular mechanisms leading to the development of MDR-TB, we initially screened in vitro-selected isoniazid-resistant mutants of M. tuberculosis strain MTB72, using different concentrations of isoniazid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>None of the characterized strains carried the mutations that are predominantly responsible for isoniazid resistance in clinical isolates [katG-S315T or inhA-C(-)15T]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a large proportion of the resistant clones acquired resistance to isoniazid by deletion of katG, a genotype that is rarely observed in clinical isolates. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>However, the dramatic difference between the in vivo and in vitro spectrum of isoniazid resistance mutations suggests that an in vivo mutation rate for isoniazid resistance equal to or potentially lower than the rifampicin resistance rate (∼10−8 mutations/cell division) is much more feasible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate the importance of genetic characterization of mutants before results obtained in the laboratory are extrapolated to the clinical setting. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>KatG protects bacteria from the oxidative burst encountered when M. tuberculosis cells reside in macrophages or granuloma.18,38 In vitro conditions are significantly less challenging, not in the least because of the extracellular catalases in the medium, protecting the bacteria from harmful reactive oxygen species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>We speculated that these protective culture conditions allowed for the observed high in vitro prevalence of ΔkatG mutants, which are highly resistant to isoniazid, but susceptible to oxidative insult.28,31,38 However, addition of 50 mM H2O2 did not alter the spectrum of mutations (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Attempts to select isoniazid-resistant mutants from mycobacteria grown in medium without added catalase have been unsuccessful, as bacterial growth of the wild-type strain MTB72 was inadequate in medium without catalase. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Conditions that seemed to have an effect on the proportion of katG deletion mutants, but not on the presence of katG-S315T or inhA-C(-)15T mutants, were selection of mutants with low levels of isoniazid (0.4–2.0 mg/L, Tables 2 and 3) and growth/selection in human macrophages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>The average proportion of ΔkatG mutants selected with 20 mg/L was 65% (39/60), with 1 mg/L was 55% (42/77) and with 0.4 mg/L was 28% (8/29, Tables 2 and 3), suggesting that ΔkatG mutants are more likely to be highly resistant. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Moreover, from the mutants selected with 0.4 mg/L isoniazid that had an MIC between 0.4 and 2.0 mg/L, only 10% (3/30, Table 3) had a deletion in the katG region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Growth in THP1 cells reduced the proportion of deletion mutants, selected with 1 mg/L isoniazid, to 20% (12/59, Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>These results show that it is possible to reduce the proportion of deletion mutants under specific conditions, but even in strains selected under these conditions neither of the two most prevalent clinical mutations were identified. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>None of these 179 isolates acquired either of the targeted mutations; thus, the prevalence of these mutations in vitro was &lt;0.6% (&lt;1/179, 95% CI 0%–1.6%) under the conditions described. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Similar results were also obtained with strain H37Rv (&lt;3.3%), suggesting that this is a general phenomenon, rather than a strain-specific effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>This observation is also supported by the absence of reports of spontaneous in vitro isoniazid-resistant mutants that carry clinical mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>In fact, we are aware of only one study that reports the selection of an isoniazid-resistant katG-S315T mutant,21 but this mutant was acquired after a mouse was infected and treated with isoniazid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>It is possible that none of the selection conditions we used were suitable for the selection of the targeted mutations, perhaps because further adaptation is required to obtain an MIC &gt; 0.4 mg/L. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>However, this would be true for all previous reports of in vitro studies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>The general assumption is that isoniazid resistance in vivo is much more widespread due to a higher mutation rate, particularly in katG.39 Indeed, the M. tuberculosis katG gene is located within a genetically unstable region,40 suggesting an increased propensity for mutation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Based on this instability, one would expect to observe a whole spectrum of katG mutations in resistant clinical isolates, but in practice the majority of clinically resistant strains contain the same mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>However, the genetic instability of the katG region is a likely explanation for the high prevalence of ΔkatG mutants in our and other laboratory studies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>The empirical evidence for the high mutation rate hypothesis is extracted from a few studies in which fluctuation assays with isoniazid were performed.37 These studies report a significantly higher mutation rate for isoniazid compared with that for rifampicin, although mutants were not genetically characterized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>We obtained similar results for the in vitro mutation rates when selecting with isoniazid and rifampicin (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>However, we suspect that this does not explain the high prevalence of isoniazid resistance in vivo, since none of the isoniazid-resistant mutants we screened carried the mutations that are most frequently observed in clinical isolates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>In fact, merely two or three mutations account for isoniazid resistance in the majority of resistant clinical isolates.8–13 For rifampicin resistance there are three rpoB mutations that are seen in 80%–95% of clinical isolates.9,41−43 The in vivo mutation rate for isoniazid resistance is therefore more likely to be similar to or lower than the rate for rifampicin resistance, as was also suggested by others.44 This would still lead to a higher prevalence of isoniazid-monoresistant isolates if one takes into account that isoniazid has been used to treat TB much longer than rifampicin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>In addition, isoniazid has been regularly administered as monotherapy, whereas rifampicin is almost exclusively part of a combination therapy, thereby reducing the chances of drug resistance. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Previously, researchers have shown that a whole spectrum of different ΔkatG mutants can be found both in vitro and in vivo.13,15,40,45 In our study, partial deletions of the katG gene close to the 5′ terminus would not have been detected with the methods used, possibly resulting in an underestimation of the deletion mutants present. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>The few in vitro studies on isoniazid resistance that have been performed have indeed determined that the majority of the mutants were catalase-negative.45 Furthermore, one group of researchers have implicitly stated that almost all in vitro isoniazid mutants identified in their laboratory were ΔkatG strains, regardless of the concentrations of isoniazid used.44 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Throughout the course of this work, only two isoniazid-resistant mutants were identified that contained point mutations in the katG gene: one mutant acquired a TGG(W)→CGG(F) mutation in codon 321; and the other an ACT(T)→ATT(I) mutation in codon 271. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Neither of these mutations has been observed in clinical isolates, although other mutations in codon 321 have been reported and associated with very low quantities of KatG, and, therefore, significantly reduced catalase/peroxidase activity.7,16,22 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>In fact, there is evidence that isoniazid resistance does not always precede rifampicin resistance in the development of MDR in clinical settings. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>In a recent report, a rifampicin-monoresistant M. tuberculosis strain was disseminated and subsequently acquired isoniazid and other drug resistance via the common resistance mechanisms, including katG-S315T.47 Moreover, a recent outbreak in London started with an isoniazid-resistant strain, but upon dissemination the strain acquired rifampicin resistance via unusual mutations in rpoB.48 This is interesting as the genetic background of bacteria probably plays a role in the evolutionary routes they can and will follow. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>The presence of pre-existing drug resistance mutations can be of influence on the acquisition of additional drug resistance36 and several studies have shown that different genotypes of M. tuberculosis appear to have different preferred resistance mechanisms.12,13,49–51 Similar observations were made in our laboratory and by others.35,52 The occurrence of atypical drug resistance mutations may therefore be an indication of suboptimal genetic routes or unusual conditions. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Earlier, we had determined that RB14H5 has a non-functioning catalase–peroxidase in addition to a double mutation in rpoB, which moderately increases the stress levels.36 Remarkably, strain RB14H5 had acquired a 49 kbp deletion, spanning 47 genes including the complete katG gene, but nonetheless it remained viable in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>We are aware of only one other report of a strain with an equally large deletion in the katG region.40 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Strain RB14H5 acquired three other SNPs in addition to the major deletion and the drug resistance mutations (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>It is unknown if these SNPs are adaptive mutations or more opportunistic ‘hitchhike’ mutations and whether results obtained are representative of the in vivo situation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>The genetic analysis of bacteria is generally focused on previously identified targets, such as genes involved with antibiotic resistance or repetitive sequences for fingerprinting purposes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>One consequence of this bias is that additional mutations elsewhere in the genome are missed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Isogenic strains generated in the laboratory may not be as isogenic as assumed and new phenotypes may consequently be attributed to the wrong mutation.53 CGH allows the whole genome to be screened for additional mutations that may have occurred in a strain of interest compared with the wild-type template. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>It would be interesting to compare clinical strains in this fashion, for instance sequential isolates obtained from a single patient. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Additionally, CGH can be valuable in detecting drug resistance-conferring mutations;54 in some geographical locations up to 25% of clinical strains have acquired isoniazid resistance via unidentified mechanisms.10,13,39,43 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>The present study shows that characterization of in vitro mutants is essential in order to draw accurate conclusions and that results obtained in the laboratory are not automatically applicable to the in vivo situation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Combined MLPA and CGH analysis of representative clinical isolates should be used to elucidate preferred routes to MDR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Based on our results it can be concluded that the high in vitro mutation rate for isoniazid resistance is not a satisfactory explanation for the widespread isoniazid resistance found in clinical isolates, as there is no substantial evidence that the in vivo mutation rate for isoniazid resistance is significantly higher than that for rifampicin resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the outcomes of our study in combination with reports of others lead us to question the current view that development of a successful MDR strain predominantly begins with isoniazid monoresistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>A more detailed study of the genetic mechanisms by which M. tuberculosis strains adapt to their environment is warranted, hopefully leading to identification of genotypes or drug resistance profiles that are most likely to result in virulent strains. </plain></SENT>
