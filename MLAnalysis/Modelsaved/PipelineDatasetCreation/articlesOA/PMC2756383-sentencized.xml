</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Changes in light quantity and quality provide important environmental stimuli to plants to adapt their growth and morphology (for recent review see Jiao et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Different classes of photoreceptors have evolved that enable plants to sense light of different wavelengths. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among these are the cryptochromes, flavin-type photoreceptors that are active at the blue end of the spectrum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A cryptochrome-encoding gene could first be cloned from Arabidopsis thaliana (Ahmad and Cashmore 1993) and the developmental functions of this photoreceptor are also best studied in this model species. A. thaliana actually has two highly similar and well-characterised cryptochromes, AtCRY1 and AtCRY2, and a third less characterised one, AtCRY3 (Chen et al. 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>AtCRY1 and AtCRY2 are known to control inhibition of hypocotyl elongation, cotyledon and leaf expansion (Ahmad and Cashmore 1993; Lin et al. 1998), induction of anthocyanin synthesis (Ahmad et al. 1995), flowering time (Guo et al. 1998; Mockler et al. 1999) and the circadian clock (Somers et al. 1998; Devlin and Kay 2000). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Intrinsic to light signalling are transcription factors, necessary to effectuate changes in development through activation and repression of specific downstream genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Well-studied examples in A. thaliana are HY5 and its homologs HYH and HFR1, transcription factors known to be involved in both cryptochrome-mediated blue light and phytochrome-mediated far-red light signalling (Mathews 2006; Vandenbussche et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>At least two highly similar cryptochrome genes with redundant function also exist in the genome of Physcomitrella patens, PpCRY1a and PpCRY1b (Imaizumi et al. 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Their transcripts can be detected in protonema and gametophores at low levels and their proteins are found in the nucleus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Protonema represents the filamentous stage in the life cycle of P. patens and is characterised by two different cell types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The chloronema cells, on average 100 μm in length and dividing every 10–12 h, harbour many chloroplasts, which suggests a function in energy supply. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The caulonema cells, however, are believed to function mainly in habitat capture as they are pale green, on average 250 μm in length and divide once every 5–6 h (Schumaker and Dietrich 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Both cell strands grow by tip growth and produce side branches in the dependence of light. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Whereas protonemata grown in darkness or far-red light do not branch, blue light and red light synergistically strongly induce branch formation (Uneaka et al. 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the ppcry1a/1b double disruptant was found to be repressed in side branch formation, thereby underlining the role of the cryptochrome blue-light receptors in the control of moss development (Imaizumi et al. 2002; Ichikawa et al. 2004). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Transcription factors involved in light signalling in P. patens have not been reported to date. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In a first effort to uncover the developmental role of the plant specific SBP-box transcription factors in the moss P. patens, we obtained disruptant lines with phenotypes opposite to those of the ppcry1a/1b disruptants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>SBP-box genes encode proteins recognizing and binding specific DNA-sequences through the evolutionary conserved SBP-domain (Klein et al. 1996; Yamasaki et al. 2004; Birkenbihl et al. 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>They are found in moderately sized families from the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to mono- and eudicots as rice and A. thaliana. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Based on mutant phenotypes, SBP-box genes have been found to be involved in lateral organ development (Moreno et al. 1997; Wang et al. 2005), developmental phase transitions (Cardon et al. 1997; Wu and Poethig 2006; Gandikota et al. 2007), fertility (Unte et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2007), fruit ripening (Manning et al. 2006), fungal toxin sensitivity (Stone et al. 2005) and copper-signalling (Kropat et al. 2005). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Here we report that loss-of-function of the P. patens SBP-box genes PpSBP1 and PpSBP4 (Riese et al. 2007) results in an enhanced branching phenotype and that these, and closely related moss paralogs, become strongly upregulated in a cryptochrome disruptant line. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Based on our results we propose that in moss SBP-box transcription factors of the LG1-subfamily are negatively regulated by the blue-light receptor PpCRY and as such involved in phototransduction. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>It may be noted from the data presented in Fig. 4, that the moderate reduction of PpSBP1 and PpSBP4 transcript levels in response to blue light does not quantitatively reflect their strongly elevated levels in the ppcry1a/1b double disruptant. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>If this holds true in P. patens, it may explain why PpSBP1 transcript levels responded much stronger to the extended photoperiod than PpSBP4, since mRNA levels of the latter are also less influenced by red and far-red light. </plain></SENT>
