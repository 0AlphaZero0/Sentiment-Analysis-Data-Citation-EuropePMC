<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited mental retardation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This syndrome is caused by mutations in the fragile X mental retardation-1 (FMR1) gene (OMIM *309550); in most patients, this gene contains an expanded CGG repeat in the 5′-untranslated region [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Alleles with a repeat number less than 59 do not expand to full mutation upon a single transmission [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It was initially thought that there are no phenotypic effects in individuals with repeats in the premutation range, that is, between 59 and 200. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, the recent reports have identified a degenerative disease caused by such repeats, namely, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome in older individuals and premature ovarian failure in women [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The premutation allele is unstable, and the repeat region tends to expand while being transmitted to the next generation via a carrier mother. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Once there is a transition to full mutation, that is, the FMR1 has a repeat region of more than 200 CGG repeats, the repeat region and the surrounding CpG islands become hypermethylated, rendering the gene transcriptionally inactive [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>To date, there is no curative treatment for this disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, establishment of a correct diagnosis of FXS can not only reduce the stress and frustration of a parent at not knowing the cause of a child's developmental delay, but also facilitate early intervention, thereby benefiting the patients [4–6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Due to its X-linked nature, FXS is predominantly observed in males. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>It is rather difficult to clinically diagnose FXS in young boys because its phenotypic manifestations are nonspecific and variable [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Therefore, some clinicians prefer to use a simple molecular test to screen boys suspected of having this disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>One of the frequently used tests is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the FMR1 CGG-repeat region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Moreover, because it is relatively easy to collect and transport bloodspot samples on filter paper, they are often used for molecular screening purposes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>If the PCR results are inconclusive, confirmation tests need to be performed [7–9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>However, in such cases, it is difficult to verify whether the bloodspot samples contain the methylated FMR1 promoter; this is mainly because of the limited amount of DNA that can be isolated from bloodspots. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Southern blot hybridization (SBH) is currently the golden standard for confirmation diagnosis of FXS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>It can not only detect/exclude the fully expanded repeats, but also check the methylation status of the CGG repeats and the surrounding CpG dinucleotides in the FMR1 gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Methylation-sensitive PCR is another commonly used method for verifying the aforementioned methylation status. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>However, in addition to being extremely labor and time consuming, these methods often require an amount of DNA more than what can be obtained from bloodspot samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Generally, more than 1 μg of high-molecular-weight DNA is required for SBH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Methylation-sensitive PCR is a very specific method; although the sensitivity of this method has been reported to be as high as 1 ng [10], many studies have reported the use of more than 500 ng of DNA for a reliable assessment [11–14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>This is because the DNA sample is subject to significant degradation during the bisulfite conversion process [15], and additional sample loss occurs during the subsequent removal of the bisulfite and desulfonation steps [16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Recently, 3 articles reported a novel assay for detecting methylated sequences of interest in samples with 1 ng or less DNA [17–19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Polypeptides containing methyl-CpG-binding domains (MBDs) have been used in the abovementioned studies to specifically retain methylated DNA sequences in a solid matrix. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The methylated sequence(s) of interest could then be detected using a variety of techniques. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>We thus developed a similar assay, namely, methyl-CpG-binding PCR (MB-PCR) [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In this study, we first determined the optimal conditions for this assay for reliably distinguishing between the control DNA samples with and without methylated FMR1 promoters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Next, we tested the reliability of this assay in a blinded manner by examining bloodspot samples obtained from 100 males, including 24 with FXS. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>The most important step in this experiment was to determine the optimal NaCl concentration of the binding buffer; this is critical for enhancing the specificity of the MBD complex to distinctly bind with FMR1 alleles with different methylation statuses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>We used 2.5 ng of the universally methylated or unmethylated DNA samples for the optimization experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>After MspI or MseI digestion, each cleaved DNA sample was added to a binding buffer that contains different concentrations of NaCl ranging from 100 mM to 700 mM; it was then loaded in an MBD-coated PCR well. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>The results of PCR amplification are shown in Figure 3(a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Where no stringency washes were performed, the PCR products of all samples digested by the same enzyme showed similar intensities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>The MspI-digested samples exhibit slightly stronger intensity of the amplification products than MseI-digested ones. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Where stringency washes were performed, the PCR products of all the universally unmethylated samples were not discernible, except in the case of a week yield in an MseI-digested sample for which a low-stringency wash with 100 mM NaCl was performed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, the PCR products of many of the universally methylated samples showed variable intensities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>In general, the intensity of PCR products decreases gradually with an increase in NaCl concentration in the stringency wash. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>The optimal NaCl concentrations in the stringency washes that helped in reliably distinguishing between methylated and unmethylated samples ranged from 100 nM to 500 nM in the case of the MspI-digested samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>However, the range for the MseI-digested samples narrowed down to 200–300 nM. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Next, we examined the results of using a methylation-sensitive enzyme (BstUI) alone and in combination with MspI or MseI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Addition of BstUI can remove most of the unmethylated alleles in test samples, thus reducing the chances of false-positive results in MB-PCR [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>However, when BstUI alone is used, no discernible PCR yield was observed (Figure 3(b), top panel). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with the MB-PCR results shown in Figure 3(a), suggesting that the BstUI-digested fragments were most likely too long to be easily trapped by the MBD complex under such washing conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, PCR using DNA cleaved with MseI or MspI yielded rather specific results, regardless of whether BstUI digestion was performed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the sensitivity of PCR with MspI digestion was higher than that with MseI digestion. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity of MB-PCR </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>As expected, when DNA was cleaved using MspI alone, the detection sensitivity of methylated FMR1 promoter in the FXS samples improved gradually with increasing number of MB-PCR cycles (Figure 4(a)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the NaCl concentrations in the stringency washes also affect the detection sensitivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>The results revealed that the minimum amount of DNA required for unequivocal detection of specific products in 45 cycles of MB-PCR amplification is 0.5 ng and 1.0 ng when stringency washes are performed with 300 mM and 400 mM NaCl, respectively. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Next, we evaluated if the optimized MB-PCR can reliably detect males with the mosaic form of FXS who often have expanded FMR1 alleles in either the methylated or unmethylated states. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>We thus simulated such mosaic samples by mixing 0.5 ng of the DNA from an FXS male having a nonmosaic methylation pattern with different amounts of DNA from a non-FXS male, ranging from 2.5 ng to 160 ng. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Discussion </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>MBD polypeptides are the core elements of this MB-PCR assay and other similar methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>The family of vertebrate MBD proteins comprises MeCP2, MBD1, MBD2, MBD3, and MBD4 [25, 26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>MeCP2 was the first protein applied to an affinity matrix to specifically retain the sequences that are highly methylated [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>However, since the use of MeCP2 requires A/T-rich sequences adjacent to the methylated CpG dinucleotides for efficient DNA binding, all methods based on MeCP2 affinity might be biased towards certain CpG motifs [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>The main MBD protein used in this study was MBD2b, because MBD2 exhibits a higher affinity for CpG-methylated DNA than other MBD proteins [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>MBD2b is the isoform of MBD2a that lacks the N-terminal region of the 152 amino acids proximal to the MBD [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>MBD3L1 itself lacks the ability to bind methylated DNA but can interact with MBD2b and enhance its binding affinity for methylated sequences [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Because the MBD3L1-interaction domain has been mapped to the C-terminal end of MBD2b, the entire MBD2b protein (29.1 kD) should be used in MB-PCR [17], instead of the truncated MBD domain (7 kD) used in the other related studies [18, 19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Other factors critically determining the sensitivity and specificity of this assay are the NaCl concentration of the binding buffer and the method used for DNA cleavage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>The former must be determined by performing a series of titration tests. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>In this study, we found that the best optimal NaCl concentration of the binding buffer was between 300 and 400 mM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>The optimal NaCl concentration values reported in 3 other similar studies analyzing different targets ranged from 700 mM [17] and 400 mM [18] to 50 mM [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>DNA cleavage has often been performed by sonication or restriction enzyme digestion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>The former appears to be ineffective in samples with limited amount of DNA; hence, we compared the results of the MB-PCR assay by using 3 restriction enzymes alone or in combination with others. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>The results of this comparison experiment reveal that, for groups of samples with diminished amounts of DNA, the MspI-based group provides consistently stronger product signals than the group based on MseI digestion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>When DNA is cleaved using MseI or MspI digestion, the FMR1 fragments that cover the primers used in this study are 1633 bp and 141 bp long, respectively (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>It seems likely that the longer DNA fragments are more easily removed from the MBD complex during subsequent washing steps. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Under the conditions optimized previously, the MB-PCR could reliably distinguish DNA samples of the FXS group from those of the non-FXS group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>However, this assay cannot be used to detect FXS in females, because the FMR1 allele in the inactivated X chromosome(s) of females is mostly methylated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>In-house preparation of MBD proteins makes the test more cost effective, provided that the requisite facilities are available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>The proteins can be freeze-stored and used as stocks, and the entire test can be completed within a few hours. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Notably, the minimum amount of DNA required for the test is only 0.5 ng, which can be easily obtained from a bloodspot sample. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Even when mixing 0.5 ng of DNA from an FXS male with a 320-fold-concentrated DNA sample (160 ng) from a non-FXS male, the detection sensitivity and specificity of MB-PCR remains unchanged. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the results of an FXS case (Figure 5, lane 4), it is plausible to believe that this assay is reliable in detecting FXS males with mosaic methylation patterns, who account for approximately 12–41% of male FXS patients [30, 31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, these results also suggest that the reliability of MB-PCR is retained when it is used to screen DNA samples pooled from many male subjects. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>As demonstrated in this study, MB-PCR is a simple and affordable test to rapidly elucidate the methylation status of the FMR1 promoter in the bloodspots. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>This test would be particularly useful for the samples that show a negative or decreased PCR signal during initial screening. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>The bloodspot samples that showed negative results in the PCR screening test (e.g., lane 5, Figure 5) were often confirmed to be FXS-positive by using either SBH or MB-PCR (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Negative PCR results are also possibly observed in samples carrying a large-sized premutation in or deletion of a related FMR1 region, although such cases were not observed in our study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Decreased PCR signals may be attributed to the presence of a mosaic form of FXS or to a medium-sized premutation or simply to an artifact of the sample DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Taking into consideration the cases we have confirmed with SBH, we find that the interpretational uncertainty of these cases could be greatly reduced, when the IL1B gene is included as a comparative PCR control for the evaluation of the quantity and quality of bloodspot DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Those samples that exhibit decreased PCR yield intensity for FMR1 but not for IL1B, like that in lane 4, are often confirmed to be FXS-positive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>If the subjects carry a medium-sized premutation allele (e.g., lane 3, Figure 5), the PCR products of FMR1 often have a decreased intensity but increased size; the corresponding amplification intensity of IL1B is often strong. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the cases exhibiting similar decrease in yields for both FMR1 and IL1B, (e.g., lane 6, Figure 5) are often FXS-negative. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>According to the Best Practice Guidelines for Molecular Analysis in Fragile X Syndrome provided by The European Molecular Genetics Quality Network (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.emqn.org/emqn/">http://www.emqn.org/emqn/</ext-link>), the golden standard of the diagnosis of the FXS is SBH, which detects not only methylation but also methylation mosaics, expansions of the FMR1 CGG repeat, and deletions of the FMR1 promoter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Compared with the SBH results, we demonstrated that the MB-PCR could detect all 24 FXS males in the blind examination of 100 bloodspot samples, with 100% sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Similar detection power has been reported in methylation-sensitive PCR using methylated FMR1 alleles [11–14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>However, this method could not be easily applied to the bloodspot samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Further, SBH cannot be used to analyze samples with DNA at a nanogram level thus far. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Hence, in combination with screening PCR, MB-PCR can accelerate and simplify the detection of FXS in males. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>In the case of negative results in both tests, the subjects may have a large-sized premutation or deletion of a related FMR1 region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>For the case of the former condition, many studies have used different PCR methods to verify the expanded CGG repeats [32–36]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we demonstrated for the first time that the MB-PCR is a simple and inexpensive test and can accelerate and simplify the detection of FXS in males by rapidly verifying the FMR1 promoter methylation in bloodspots. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>In-house preparation of MBD proteins makes the test more cost-effective. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>The freeze-stored proteins can be used as stocks, and the entire test can be completed within a few hours. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Under the optimized conditions, the minimum amount of DNA required for the test is only 0.5 ng, and the detection sensitivity is not hampered at this concentration even after mixing it with a 320-fold-concentrated sample containing unmethylated alleles (160 ng). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Since individuals with 2 or more X chromosomes generally have methylated FMR1 alleles, MB-PCR cannot be used to detect FXS in females. </plain></SENT>
