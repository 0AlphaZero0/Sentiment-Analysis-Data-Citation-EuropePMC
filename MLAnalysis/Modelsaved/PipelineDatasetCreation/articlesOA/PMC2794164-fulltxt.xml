Although totally <italic>in vitro</italic> display methods, such as ribosome display and mRNA display, have the advantages of larger library sizes and quicker selection procedures compared with phage display, their applications have been limited to single-chain Fvs due to the requirement for linking of the mRNA and the nascent protein on the ribosome. Here we describe a different type of totally <italic>in vitro</italic> method, DNA display, that is applicable to heterodimeric Fab fragments: <italic>in vitro</italic> compartmentalization in water-in-oil emulsions allows the linking of an oligomeric protein and its encoding DNA with multiple ORFs. Since previously used emulsions impaired the synthesis of functional Fab fragments, we modified conditions for preparing emulsions, and identified conditions under which it was possible to enrich Fab fragments 10<sup>6</sup>-fold per three rounds of affinity selection. Furthermore, we confirmed that genes encoding stable Fab fragments could be selected from a Fab fragment library with a randomized hydrophobic core in the constant region by applying heat treatment as a selection pressure. Since this method has all advantages of both phage display and totally <italic>in vitro</italic> display, it represents a new option for many applications using display methods.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Due to their highly diverse and specific antigen-binding ability, monoclonal antibodies are widely used in many areas, from basic research to industrial and therapeutic applications. <italic>In vitro</italic> selection of recombinant antibodies using antibody-display methods is an effective tool for obtaining these monoclonal antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In particular, the totally <italic>in vitro</italic> display methods such as ribosome display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) and mRNA display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) have the advantage of permitting speedy selection from large libraries. However, these methods link the genotype and phenotype on the ribosome, so that they are only applicable to single-chain Fvs (scFvs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), and cannot be applied to oligomeric proteins such as whole IgGs or even heterodimeric Fab fragments. Selection of oligomeric proteins, Fab fragments in particular, has only been carried out with partially <italic>in vitro</italic> display methods, such as phage display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) and yeast-surface display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), which have limitations arising from the need to use <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> or yeast during the process. Compared to the commonly used scFv, Fab fragments have no artificial sequence and contain the constant region, being more antibody-like. Also, because the constant region stabilizes the whole Fab fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), the Fab fragment is more stable than the scFv in most cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Therefore, a novel display method for totally <italic>in vitro</italic> selection of Fab fragments would be very useful.</p><p>In this study we adopted a DNA display method, STABLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14">12&#8211;14</xref>), to establish a procedure that combines the merits of both of these display methods, i.e. one that would be totally <italic>in vitro</italic> and also applicable to oligomeric proteins. STABLE relies on <italic>in vitro</italic> compartmentalization in water-in-oil emulsions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and the streptavidin-biotin linkage. Since the DNA (genotype) and transcribed/translated protein (phenotype) are compartmentalized in a single micelle, a DNA with multiple ORFs can be linked to the corresponding and properly formed oligomeric protein. We first investigated the conditions of this DNA display method to optimize it for the enrichment of Fab fragments by affinity selection, and then successfully carried out a totally <italic>in vitro</italic> selection from a Fab fragment library with a randomized hydrophobic core in the constant region.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>DNA construction</title><p>The oligonucleotide sequences used are listed on <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. The Heavy chain (H-chain) and Light chain (L-chain) genes of an anti-fluorescein Fab fragment were constructed by two steps of PCR using KOD-plus DNA polymerase (Toyobo). First, the variable and constant region were each constructed. The variable region was extracted by PCR from scFv c12 with mutations H-D101N and L-H94Y (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) using primers PFLVH-F and VH-R for the V<sub>H</sub> domain (variable region of H-chain) and primers PFLVL-F and VL-R for the V<sub>L</sub> domain (variable region of L-chain). The constant region was assembled by overlap-extension PCR using primers VHR-F, CHmyc-R and oligonucleotides synCH1&#8211;3 for the C<sub>H1</sub> domain (constant region 1 of H-chain) and primers VLR-F, CLFLAG-R and oligonucleotides synCL1&#8211;3 for the C<sub>L</sub> domain (constant region of L-chain). Second, the variable region and constant region were assembled by overlap-extension PCR using primers Universal and mycT7-R or primers Universal and FLAGT7-R to make the H- and L-chain genes, respectively. The final PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), making an H-chain gene containing a T7 promoter, a Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence, and an ORF for the V<sub>H</sub> domain, C<sub>H1</sub> domain and a c-myc tag; and an L-chain gene containing a T7 promoter, an SD sequence, and an ORF for the V<sub>L</sub> domain, C<sub>L</sub> domain and a FLAG tag.

First, the variable region and constant region were extracted by PCR. From scFv421 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), primers P421VH-F and 421VHCHF-R or primers P421VL-F and 421VLCLF-R were used to extract the V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> domains, respectively, and from the constructed anti-fluorescein Fab fragment gene, primers CH-F and myc-R or primers CL-F and FLAG-R were used to extract the C<sub>H1</sub> domain and C<sub>L</sub> domain, respectively. Second, the variable region and constant region were assembled by overlap-extension PCR, using the same procedure as for the anti-fluorescein. The final PCR products were also cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector.</p><p>The final streptavidin-fused Fab fragment gene construct was made by overlap-extension PCR using KOD-plus DNA polymerase. The H- and L-chain genes described above and a low GC content streptavidin gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) were assembled by overlap-extension PCR using primers Universal and FLAGT7-R.

The genes were named anti-fluoFab-STA for anti-fluorescein and anti-p53Fab-STA for anti-p53. From these genes, PCR was carried out with primers Univ-F and T7-R to make non-biotinylated template DNA and primers PCBUniv-F and PCBT7-R to make photo-cleavable biotinylated template DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).

First, four different DNA fragments, H-L124, H-L141S179V181, L-F118 and L-V133L135 were constructed from an anti-fluoFab-STA gene by PCR with KOD-plus DNA polymerase using two primers, Universal and HL124-R, HL141-F and HS179V181-R, x-F and LF118-R, and LV133L135-F and FLAGT7-R, respectively. These four fragments were mixed in equimolar amounts and assembled by overlap-extension PCR with primers PCBUniv-F and PCBT7-R to make biotinylated template DNA.

Fab fragments were expressed by transcribing and translating 0.5 pmol of the PCR products with the PURE system S&#8211;S for 2 h at 37&#176;C. Meanwhile, a fluorescein-immobilized plate was prepared by adding 150 pmol of biotinylated fluorescein and 100 &#181;l of Block Buffer to a Streptavidin C8 Transparent plate (Nunc) and shaking it for 1 h at room temperature. The plate was then washed with 200 &#181;l of TBST (TBS with 0.1% Tween 20) 10 times and blocked with 200 &#181;l of Block Buffer by shaking it for 1 h at room temperature. Separately, the expressed Fab fragments were diluted into 100 &#181;l of Block Buffer containing 0&#8211;20 nM fluorescein as a competitor. If heat denaturation was necessary, this solution was then heated at one of 8 equally spaced points between 38.7 and 71.2&#176;C for 10 min. The sample was then centrifuged at 15 000 r.p.m. for 10 min at 4&#176;C and 90 &#181;l of the top layer was recovered. When the competitor was added, the sample was pre-incubated at 4&#176;C for 1 h.

First we constructed a DNA encoding two ORFs, a streptavidin-fused H-chain and an L-chain (for details, see &#8216;Materials and Methods&#8217; section). The streptavidin-fused H-chain, which is the larger molecule, was placed upstream to make up for the lower expression efficiency. Although <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> depicts only one biotin attached to the end of the DNA, the actual construct had biotin on both ends, increasing the avidity; since streptavidin forms a tetramer, possibly as many as eight copies of Fab fragments were displayed per DNA. The DNA library is <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed/translated in emulsions to form DNA-displayed Fab fragments. These DNA-displayed Fab fragments are selected by the target antigen and then the linker between the biotin and DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) is cleaved by exposure to UV radiation at &gt;300 nm, allowing elution of the DNA of the selected Fab fragments. The selected DNA is either amplified by PCR with biotinylated primers for further selection or sequenced to identify the selected Fab fragments.
<fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Scheme of <italic>in vitro</italic> selection of Fab fragments using DNA display. Step 1: The template DNA has two ORFs (a streptavidin-fused H-chain gene and an L-chain gene), one T7 promoter (T7) and two ribosomal binding sites (SD). The DNA library is biotinylated through a photo-cleavable linker and compartmentalized in water-in-oil emulsions containing an <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription/translation system. Step 2: In each micelle, a streptavidin-fused H-chain and an L-chain are expressed, forming a Fab fragment and linked to the corresponding DNA <italic>via</italic> streptavidin-biotin linkage. Step 3: DNA-displayed Fab fragments are recovered from the emulsion and subjected to <italic>in vitro</italic> antigen selection. Step 4: Selected DNA-displayed Fab fragments are exposed to UV irradiation at &gt;300 nm to cleave the DNA for elution. Step 5: Selected DNA is amplified by PCR with biotinylated primers to make templates for the next round of selection. Step 6: After a suitable number of rounds of selection, the selected DNA is cloned and sequenced to identify the selected Fab fragments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkp776f1"/></fig></p></sec><sec><title>Improvement of DNA display for Fab fragments</title><p>In this study, we used an <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription/translation system optimized for synthesis of proteins containing disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). First, we confirmed the synthesis and function of streptavidin-fused model Fab fragments (anti-fluorescein and anti-p53 antibodies) by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Bands of both streptavidin-fused H-chain (43 kDa) and L-chain (24 kDa) were detected at positions corresponding to the appropriate molecular weight in the presence of &#946;-mercaptoethanol, while a band near 90 kDa was detected in the absence of &#946;-mercaptoethanol, indicating that Fab fragments with disulfide bonds are properly formed. These Fab fragments also bound to their antigens and retained antigen-binding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). DNA&#8211;protein conjugate formation for these Fab fragments proceeded with an efficiency of over 95% (data not shown).
<fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Confirmation of cell-free synthesis and function of streptavidin-fused Fab fragments. The template DNA for anti-fluorescein or anti-p53 Fab fragments was <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed/translated and subjected to pull-down assay (see &#8216;Materials and Methods&#8217; section) with fluorescein or p53 C-terminal peptide-immobilized beads, respectively. The input fraction before binding (I), the output fraction after binding with antigen-immobilized beads (O) and the output fraction after binding with mock beads with biotin (M) were resolved by 12.5% SDS&#8211;PAGE and detected by western blotting. Anti-myc mAb was used to detect the streptavidin-fused H-chain (upper) and anti-FLAG mAb was used to detect the L-chain (lower). Samples including &#946;-mercaptoethanol (&#946;-ME, +) showed higher mobility.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkp776f2"/></fig></p><p>These model antibodies were used in a model affinity selection experiment, in which anti-fluorescein was used as a positive control and anti-p53 as a negative control. When these DNA-displayed Fab fragments were generated separately under emulsified or non-emulsified conditions, mixed together, and subjected to a single round of affinity selection with fluorescein-immobilized beads, DNA-displayed Fab fragments generated inside the emulsions showed greatly decreased DNA enrichment efficiency (&#8764;10%) and could only be enriched a few-fold (data not shown). The emulsion preparation procedure was presumed to have impaired the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription/translation system and/or destabilized the synthesized Fab fragments as a result of the presence of the surfactants and/or the stirring processes (the procedures used to prepare the emulsions are described in &#8216;Materials and Methods&#8217; section). Therefore, we examined the conditions of the method in detail in order to obtain a practical enrichment efficiency for Fab fragment DNA.</p><p>The following three changes resulted in marked improvement of the DNA enrichment efficiency compared with the original conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). (i) BSA was added to the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription/translation system and resulted in a 1.5-to-2-fold improvement; it may have acted as a &#8216;bulk&#8217; protein and prevented the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription/translation system and/or the synthesized Fab fragments from becoming trapped and denatured at the oil/water interface of the micelles, (ii) The stirring time was reduced from 3 to 0.5 min; this resulted in a 1.5-to-2-fold improvement. Reducing the stirring time may have reduced the physical strain on the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription/translation system, (iii) The surfactant was changed from Tween 20 to Tween 80, which resulted in a 2-to-2.5-fold improvement. Since Tween 20 and Tween 80 have different effects on protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), changing the surfactant to Tween 80 may have increased the stability of the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription/translation system and/or the synthesized Fab fragments, although the actual mechanism was not established. When all three changes were made, an improvement in DNA enrichment efficiency of approximately 10-fold was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).

Considering the uniqueness of Fab fragments, we altered seven amino-acid residues from the hydrophobic interface of the C<sub>H1</sub> domain and the C<sub>L</sub> domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) to random hydrophobic amino acids encoded by the NTK codon (Phe, Leu, Ile, Met or Val). Previous reports have indicated that alteration of the hydrophobic core results in a change of stability and activity of various proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22 B23">20&#8211;23</xref>). The DNA library was constructed on the base of anti-fluorescein and was <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed/translated, and then the antigen-binding activity and heat stability were compared with those of the wild-type anti-fluorescein. There was a change in heat stability, and randomization decreased antigen-binding activity above 58&#176;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B), though there was no significant change at room temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). This is possibly because the structure of the hydrophobic core could be maintained by various hydrophobic amino acids at room temperature, but more stringent combinations of hydrophobic amino acids were needed to maintain the structure at higher temperatures. Thus, we applied heat treatment as a selection pressure for <italic>in vitro</italic> selection of the randomized library of the constant region. There have been other reports where heat treatment has been applied as a selection pressure, although in those cases, mutations were introduced in variable regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).

Three rounds were suggested to be sufficient, because the library consists of 8 &#215; 10<sup>5</sup> (=5<sup>7</sup>) mutants and the wild type, whose antigen-binding activity is unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A), showed &#8764;10<sup>6</sup>-fold enrichment per three rounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).

By introducing heat treatment as a selection pressure, we expected that unstable variants would be eliminated and stable variants selected. Consequently, arbitrarily chosen variants selected with heat treatment had improved heat stability compared to the initial randomized library, though the stability did not greatly exceed that of wild-type anti-fluorescein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). The altered residues had nothing particular in common, suggesting that a range of sequences is acceptable to maintain the structure of the hydrophobic core, in agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22">20&#8211;22</xref>).

This finding that alteration of the hydrophobic core in the constant region did not greatly affect the affinity is reasonable, because (i) there was no particular selection pressure on dissociation in this study, e.g., the presence of competitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) or lowered concentration of antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) during selection, (ii) the altered constant region is apart from the antigen-binding variable region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), and (iii) mutations associated with affinity maturation are most likely to be found in the CDRs of the variable region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, it was confirmed that DNA display was able to select Fab fragment candidates according to the designed procedure. We also found that the hydrophobic core in the constant region shows tolerance to mutations. Possibly a different strategy is needed in order to obtain a more stable Fab fragment. Previous studies in which hydrophobic cores were altered also did not obtain enhanced variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22">20&#8211;22</xref>), and introducing mutations at locations other than hydrophobic cores may be more effective. For example, there has been one report in which mouse IgG1 Fab fragments with increased stability were obtained when a hydrophilic residue in the cavity of the constant region was replaced with a hydrophobic residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). A random mutagenesis strategy throughout the whole constant region would be compatible with <italic>in vitro</italic> selection of stable variants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Comparison of DNA display with other antibody-display methods</title><p>Various display methods have been used to select recombinant antibody genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>), but most of them have been designed to select scFvs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26 B27 B28">26&#8211;28</xref>). Display methods selecting recombinant antibodies other than scFvs are phage display and yeast-surface display, in which Fab fragments are selected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). However, due to the use of living organisms, these methods suffer limitations related to transfection efficiency and culture time. Totally <italic>in vitro</italic> display methods can overcome these limitations. The DNA display method described here is the first totally <italic>in vitro</italic> method to be applicable to oligomeric Fab fragments.
<table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><p>Comparison of DNA display with other antibody-display methods</p></caption><table-wrap-foot><fn id="TF4"><p>CAD, covalent antibody display.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>A disadvantage of DNA display based on <italic>in vitro</italic> compartmentalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) may be the relatively low concentration of DNA in a micelle. Since the average diameter of a micelle is 4 &#181;m, the average volume would be 0.03 pl, in which the DNA would be present at 50 pM concentration. However, even if only a single copy of Fab fragment was formed in a micelle, the subnanomolar concentration of DNA and protein is still high enough to allow efficient formation of DNA&#8211;protein conjugates due to the subpicomolar affinity of streptavidin and biotinylated DNA. Also, since there are abundant antigen molecules immobilized on beads for <italic>in vitro</italic> selection, the recovery efficiency is not greatly influenced by the low concentration of DNA-displayed Fab fragments. In this study, the recovery efficiency of DNA-displayed Fab fragment, calculated from the input amount and recovered amount of positive DNA in the model experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), turned out to be &#8764;1%. The low concentration of DNA-displayed Fab fragments would influence the effective library size. To allow DNA display to handle even larger library sizes, we are currently working on increasing the concentration of DNA in a micelle by combining emulsion PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) with DNA display.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Industrial Technology Research Grant Program (03A01007a) from the NEDO (New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization) of Japan; Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (19360377) from the JSPS (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science).
