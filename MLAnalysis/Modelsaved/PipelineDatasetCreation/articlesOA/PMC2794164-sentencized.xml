</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Due to their highly diverse and specific antigen-binding ability, monoclonal antibodies are widely used in many areas, from basic research to industrial and therapeutic applications. In vitro selection of recombinant antibodies using antibody-display methods is an effective tool for obtaining these monoclonal antibodies (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In particular, the totally in vitro display methods such as ribosome display (2) and mRNA display (3,4) have the advantage of permitting speedy selection from large libraries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, these methods link the genotype and phenotype on the ribosome, so that they are only applicable to single-chain Fvs (scFvs) (5,6), and cannot be applied to oligomeric proteins such as whole IgGs or even heterodimeric Fab fragments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Selection of oligomeric proteins, Fab fragments in particular, has only been carried out with partially in vitro display methods, such as phage display (7) and yeast-surface display (8), which have limitations arising from the need to use Escherichia coli or yeast during the process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Compared to the commonly used scFv, Fab fragments have no artificial sequence and contain the constant region, being more antibody-like. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Also, because the constant region stabilizes the whole Fab fragment (9,10), the Fab fragment is more stable than the scFv in most cases (10,11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a novel display method for totally in vitro selection of Fab fragments would be very useful. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In this study we adopted a DNA display method, STABLE (12–14), to establish a procedure that combines the merits of both of these display methods, i.e. one that would be totally in vitro and also applicable to oligomeric proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>STABLE relies on in vitro compartmentalization in water-in-oil emulsions (15) and the streptavidin-biotin linkage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Since the DNA (genotype) and transcribed/translated protein (phenotype) are compartmentalized in a single micelle, a DNA with multiple ORFs can be linked to the corresponding and properly formed oligomeric protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>We first investigated the conditions of this DNA display method to optimize it for the enrichment of Fab fragments by affinity selection, and then successfully carried out a totally in vitro selection from a Fab fragment library with a randomized hydrophobic core in the constant region. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>The scheme for in vitro selection of Fab fragments using DNA display is shown in Figure 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>First we constructed a DNA encoding two ORFs, a streptavidin-fused H-chain and an L-chain (for details, see ‘Materials and Methods’ section). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>The streptavidin-fused H-chain, which is the larger molecule, was placed upstream to make up for the lower expression efficiency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Although Figure 1 depicts only one biotin attached to the end of the DNA, the actual construct had biotin on both ends, increasing the avidity; since streptavidin forms a tetramer, possibly as many as eight copies of Fab fragments were displayed per DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>The DNA library is in vitro transcribed/translated in emulsions to form DNA-displayed Fab fragments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>These DNA-displayed Fab fragments are selected by the target antigen and then the linker between the biotin and DNA (17) is cleaved by exposure to UV radiation at &gt;300 nm, allowing elution of the DNA of the selected Fab fragments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>The selected DNA is either amplified by PCR with biotinylated primers for further selection or sequenced to identify the selected Fab fragments. Figure 1.Scheme of in vitro selection of Fab fragments using DNA display. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Step 1: The template DNA has two ORFs (a streptavidin-fused H-chain gene and an L-chain gene), one T7 promoter (T7) and two ribosomal binding sites (SD). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>The DNA library is biotinylated through a photo-cleavable linker and compartmentalized in water-in-oil emulsions containing an in vitro transcription/translation system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Step 2: In each micelle, a streptavidin-fused H-chain and an L-chain are expressed, forming a Fab fragment and linked to the corresponding DNA via streptavidin-biotin linkage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Step 3: DNA-displayed Fab fragments are recovered from the emulsion and subjected to in vitro antigen selection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Step 4: Selected DNA-displayed Fab fragments are exposed to UV irradiation at &gt;300 nm to cleave the DNA for elution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Step 5: Selected DNA is amplified by PCR with biotinylated primers to make templates for the next round of selection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Step 6: After a suitable number of rounds of selection, the selected DNA is cloned and sequenced to identify the selected Fab fragments. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>When these DNA-displayed Fab fragments were generated separately under emulsified or non-emulsified conditions, mixed together, and subjected to a single round of affinity selection with fluorescein-immobilized beads, DNA-displayed Fab fragments generated inside the emulsions showed greatly decreased DNA enrichment efficiency (∼10%) and could only be enriched a few-fold (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>The emulsion preparation procedure was presumed to have impaired the in vitro transcription/translation system and/or destabilized the synthesized Fab fragments as a result of the presence of the surfactants and/or the stirring processes (the procedures used to prepare the emulsions are described in ‘Materials and Methods’ section). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we examined the conditions of the method in detail in order to obtain a practical enrichment efficiency for Fab fragment DNA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>The following three changes resulted in marked improvement of the DNA enrichment efficiency compared with the original conditions (Figure 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>(i) BSA was added to the in vitro transcription/translation system and resulted in a 1.5-to-2-fold improvement; it may have acted as a ‘bulk’ protein and prevented the in vitro transcription/translation system and/or the synthesized Fab fragments from becoming trapped and denatured at the oil/water interface of the micelles, (ii) The stirring time was reduced from 3 to 0.5 min; this resulted in a 1.5-to-2-fold improvement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Reducing the stirring time may have reduced the physical strain on the in vitro transcription/translation system, (iii) The surfactant was changed from Tween 20 to Tween 80, which resulted in a 2-to-2.5-fold improvement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Since Tween 20 and Tween 80 have different effects on protein stability (19), changing the surfactant to Tween 80 may have increased the stability of the in vitro transcription/translation system and/or the synthesized Fab fragments, although the actual mechanism was not established. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>When all three changes were made, an improvement in DNA enrichment efficiency of approximately 10-fold was observed (Figure 3). Figure 3.Changes of enrichment efficiency for Fab fragment DNA under various conditions for emulsion preparation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>One round of affinity selection with fluorescein-immobilized beads (see ‘Materials and Methods’ section) was carried out from a DNA mixture of 10 anti-p53 to 1 anti-fluorescein Fab fragment gene and the enrichment efficiency of anti-fluorescein DNA was compared with the original conditions (white bar: containing no BSA in the in vitro transcription/translation system, having a stirring time of 3 min to prepare the emulsion, and using Tween 20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>The enrichment efficiency was calculated by dividing the relative amount of positive control DNA after selection by that before selection. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Under the modified emulsion preparation conditions, micelles with a diameter range of 2–6 µm, with a sharp peak at around 4 µm, were produced. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Under the improved conditions, iterative rounds of affinity selection were carried out for fluorescein-immobilized beads from a mixture of 105 anti-p53 to 1 anti-fluorescein Fab fragment gene. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Considering the uniqueness of Fab fragments, we altered seven amino-acid residues from the hydrophobic interface of the CH1 domain and the CL domain (Figure 5) to random hydrophobic amino acids encoded by the NTK codon (Phe, Leu, Ile, Met or Val). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Previous reports have indicated that alteration of the hydrophobic core results in a change of stability and activity of various proteins (20–23). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>The DNA library was constructed on the base of anti-fluorescein and was in vitro transcribed/translated, and then the antigen-binding activity and heat stability were compared with those of the wild-type anti-fluorescein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>There was a change in heat stability, and randomization decreased antigen-binding activity above 58°C (Figure 6B), though there was no significant change at room temperature (Figure 6A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>This is possibly because the structure of the hydrophobic core could be maintained by various hydrophobic amino acids at room temperature, but more stringent combinations of hydrophobic amino acids were needed to maintain the structure at higher temperatures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Thus, we applied heat treatment as a selection pressure for in vitro selection of the randomized library of the constant region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>There have been other reports where heat treatment has been applied as a selection pressure, although in those cases, mutations were introduced in variable regions (24,25). Figure 5.Randomized residues of the hydrophobic core of the constant region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Seven residues from the hydrophobic interface of the CH1 domain and the CL domain was picked up by referring to the 3-D structure of an anti-thyroid peroxidase Fab fragment (PDB ID: 1VGE), which has the same constant region as the one used in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>The residues are heavy chain Leu124, Leu141, Ser179, Val181 and light chain Phe118, Val133, Leu135 [numbering according to Kabat et al. (30)]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>(A) Antigen binding activity at room temperature was measured by ELISA (see ‘Materials and Methods’ section). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>The absorbance at 450 nm (reference at 655 nm) of the wild type was used for normalization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>(B) Heat denaturation curves of the wild type (solid line) and the library (dotted line) were measured by heat-denaturation ELISA (see ‘Materials and Methods’ section). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>The absorbance at 450 nm (reference at 655 nm) of each sample heated at 38.7°C was used for normalization. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>After three rounds of affinity selection for fluorescein-immobilized beads with and without heat treatment (10 min at 63°C), 18 variants from each situation were sequenced (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Three rounds were suggested to be sufficient, because the library consists of 8 × 105 (=57) mutants and the wild type, whose antigen-binding activity is unchanged (Figure 6A), showed ∼106-fold enrichment per three rounds (Figure 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>The heat-denaturation curves for arbitrarily chosen variants selected without heat treatment (Figure 7A) had a broad distribution around the denaturation curve of the randomized library (Figure 6B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>By introducing heat treatment as a selection pressure, we expected that unstable variants would be eliminated and stable variants selected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Consequently, arbitrarily chosen variants selected with heat treatment had improved heat stability compared to the initial randomized library, though the stability did not greatly exceed that of wild-type anti-fluorescein (Figure 7B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>The altered residues had nothing particular in common, suggesting that a range of sequences is acceptable to maintain the structure of the hydrophobic core, in agreement with previous reports (20–22).

<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Heat-denaturation ELISA was performed as described in ‘Materials and Methods’ section. The absorbance at 450 nm (reference at 655 nm) of each sample heated at 38.7°C was used for normalization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>(A) The curves of N-1, N-3, N-5, N-6 and N-13 (Table 2) are plotted in blue, red, yellow, green and purple, respectively. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>The Kd values of some of the chosen variants, including the wild type, were determined and they all had a similar value of ∼2 nM (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>This finding that alteration of the hydrophobic core in the constant region did not greatly affect the affinity is reasonable, because (i) there was no particular selection pressure on dissociation in this study, e.g., the presence of competitor (5) or lowered concentration of antigen (8) during selection, (ii) the altered constant region is apart from the antigen-binding variable region (10), and (iii) mutations associated with affinity maturation are most likely to be found in the CDRs of the variable region (5,8,25). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, it was confirmed that DNA display was able to select Fab fragment candidates according to the designed procedure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>We also found that the hydrophobic core in the constant region shows tolerance to mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Possibly a different strategy is needed in order to obtain a more stable Fab fragment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Previous studies in which hydrophobic cores were altered also did not obtain enhanced variants (20–22), and introducing mutations at locations other than hydrophobic cores may be more effective. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>For example, there has been one report in which mouse IgG1 Fab fragments with increased stability were obtained when a hydrophilic residue in the cavity of the constant region was replaced with a hydrophobic residue (9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>A random mutagenesis strategy throughout the whole constant region would be compatible with in vitro selection of stable variants. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Various display methods have been used to select recombinant antibody genes (Table 3), but most of them have been designed to select scFvs (2,5,6,26–28). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Display methods selecting recombinant antibodies other than scFvs are phage display and yeast-surface display, in which Fab fragments are selected (7,8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>However, due to the use of living organisms, these methods suffer limitations related to transfection efficiency and culture time. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>The DNA display method described here is the first totally in vitro method to be applicable to oligomeric Fab fragments. Table 3.Comparison of DNA display with other antibody-display methodsCAD, covalent antibody display. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>A disadvantage of DNA display based on in vitro compartmentalization (15) may be the relatively low concentration of DNA in a micelle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Since the average diameter of a micelle is 4 µm, the average volume would be 0.03 pl, in which the DNA would be present at 50 pM concentration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>However, even if only a single copy of Fab fragment was formed in a micelle, the subnanomolar concentration of DNA and protein is still high enough to allow efficient formation of DNA–protein conjugates due to the subpicomolar affinity of streptavidin and biotinylated DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Also, since there are abundant antigen molecules immobilized on beads for in vitro selection, the recovery efficiency is not greatly influenced by the low concentration of DNA-displayed Fab fragments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>In this study, the recovery efficiency of DNA-displayed Fab fragment, calculated from the input amount and recovered amount of positive DNA in the model experiment (Figure 3), turned out to be ∼1%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>The low concentration of DNA-displayed Fab fragments would influence the effective library size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>To allow DNA display to handle even larger library sizes, we are currently working on increasing the concentration of DNA in a micelle by combining emulsion PCR (29) with DNA display. </plain></SENT>
