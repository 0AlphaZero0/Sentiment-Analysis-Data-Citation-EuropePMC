<italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> that contain the High Pathogenicity Island (HPI), which encodes the siderophore yersiniabactin, display increased virulence. This increased virulence may be explained by the increased iron scavenging of the bacteria, which would both enhance bacterial growth and limit the availability of iron to cells of the innate immune system, which require iron to catalyze the Haber-Weiss reaction that produces hydroxyl radicals. In this study, we show that yersiniabactin increases bacterial growth when iron-saturated lactoferrin is the main iron source. This suggests that yersiniabactin provides bacteria with additional iron from saturated lactoferrin during infection. Furthermore, the production of ROS by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, monocytes, and a mouse macrophage cell line is blocked by yersiniabactin, as yersiniabactin reduces iron availability to the cells. Importantly, iron functions as a catalyst during the Haber-Weiss reaction, which generates hydroxyl radicals. While the physiologic role of the Haber-Weiss reaction in the production of hydroxyl radicals has been controversial, the siderophores yersiniabactin, aerobactin, and deferoxamine and the iron-chelator deferiprone also reduce ROS production in activated innate immune cells. This suggests that this reaction takes place under physiological conditions. Of the tested iron chelators, yersiniabactin was the most effective in reducing the ROS production in the tested innate immune cells. The likely decreased bacterial killing by innate immune cells resulting from the reduced production of hydroxyl radicals may explain why the HPI-containing <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> are more virulent. This model centered on the reduced killing capacity of innate immune cells, which is indirectly caused by yersiniabactin, is in agreement with the observation that the highly pathogenic group of <italic>Yersinia</italic> is more lethal than the weakly pathogenic and the non-pathogenic group.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>
<italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> is regarded not only as a potential bioterrorism threat, but also as a re-emerging pathogen <xref rid="pone.0008240-Senior1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. To combat this potential threat, understanding the pathogenesis of <italic>Yersinia</italic> species is crucial. <italic>Yersinia</italic> spp. can be divided into a high-pathogenicity group (<italic>Y. pestis</italic>, <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic>, and <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic> biogroup 1B), a low-pathogenicity group (<italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic> biogroups 2 to 5), and a non-pathogenic group (<italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic> biogroup 1A) on the basis of the lethal infectious dose in a mouse model <xref rid="pone.0008240-Pelludat1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008240-Rakin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Of these groups, only the high-pathogenicity group contains the High Pathogenicity Island (HPI) <xref rid="pone.0008240-Pelludat1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008240-Rakin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. This HPI is generally adjacent to the type III secretion system secreted <italic>Yersinia</italic> outer proteins (Yops), an essential factor for the full virulence of <italic>Y. pestis</italic> in mammals <xref rid="pone.0008240-Bearden1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0008240-Smiley1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.

<xref rid="pone.0008240-Bach1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0008240-Schubert3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Similar to <italic>Yersinia</italic> spp., <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> isolates that contain the HPI are more virulent than isolates that lack the island <xref rid="pone.0008240-Bearden1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008240-Schubert3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0008240-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Furthermore, the HPI was highly associated with an <italic>Enterobacter hormaechei</italic> outbreak strain (EHOS) that caused a nation-wide outbreak in The Netherlands <xref rid="pone.0008240-Paauw1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0008240-Paauw3" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The HPI encodes for an effective siderophore, yersiniabactin. Yersiniabactin is synthesized by a complex assembly line in which YbtS, YbtE, HMWP1, HMWP2, and YbtU are essential proteins <xref rid="pone.0008240-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008240-Pfeifer1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. HMWP1 and HMWP2 (High Molecular Weight Protein 1 and 2) are 350 and 230 kDa proteins that are encoded by <italic>irp1</italic> and <italic>irp2</italic>, respectively <xref rid="pone.0008240-Guilvout1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008240-Suo1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In addition to these factors, other genes are involved in the regulation and transport of yersiniabactin, such as the <italic>fyuA</italic> gene, which encodes the yersiniabactin receptor.</p><p>Yersiniabactin facilitates iron uptake, which is essential for bacterial growth. In an environment with very limited free iron, such as the human body, where most iron is bound to proteins, bacterial expression of the HPI genes has been shown to be elevated <xref rid="pone.0008240-Chauvaux1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008240-Hsieh1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>Iron plays an important role in the innate immune system. With the exception of a very limited amount of free iron, in mammals most iron is found incorporated into complex molecules, such as hemin, or bound to transferrin and lactoferrin. During infection, polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) upregulate lactoferrin production, which reduces the availability of free iron for bacteria and increases the availability of lactoferrin-containing iron for PMNs <xref rid="pone.0008240-Levay1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. PMNs release the lactoferrin-containing iron into their phagocytic vacuoles where iron(II) can function as a catalyst to produce hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) from hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and superoxide anions (O<sup>&#8211;</sup>

However, conclusive evidence that the Haber-Weiss takes place under physiological conditions and that hydroxyl radicals are produced is lacking <xref rid="pone.0008240-Roos1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The endogenous production of hydroxyl radicals by PMNs is in doubt because the specificity of the experiments has been questioned, and it has been argued that exogenous iron in the buffers used during <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments could catalyze the production of hydroxyl radicals rather than endogenous production in PMNs <xref rid="pone.0008240-Britigan1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Whether monocytes or monocyte-derived macrophages are also dependent upon iron provided by lactoferrin for the production of hydroxyl radicals is unclear, but they are able to produce hydroxyl radicals when activated, where exogenous Fe(III) can serve as a catalyst <xref rid="pone.0008240-Britigan2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008240-Forman1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p><p>The aim of our study was to investigate the possible role of yersiniabactin in virulence.</p><p>Growth experiments with a wild-type, yersiniabactin-producing strain (E4) and a yersiniabactin-negative <italic>irp2</italic> mutant derived from E4 were performed to determine which human-derived iron source was beneficial for the growth of yersiniabactin-producing bacteria. Eighty percent iron-saturated lactoferrin supported the growth of the wild-type E4, but not the <italic>irp2</italic> mutant. Because the increased virulence of yersiniabactin-producing bacteria could not solely be explained by the increased iron uptake and growth, we hypothesized that yersiniabactin may affect the innate immune system <xref rid="pone.0008240-Schubert1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Previous work has demonstrated a dual role for another siderophore, deferoxamine: deferoxamine provided iron to <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic> and modulated the innate immune system <xref rid="pone.0008240-Chambers1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008240-Ewald1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Furthermore, we hypothesized that PMNs use iron for the production of hydroxyl radicals <xref rid="pone.0008240-Clifford1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Therefore, we speculated that yersiniabactin may also play a role in reducing the innate immune response. This hypothesis was investigated by testing the effect of yersiniabactin and other iron chelators on the ROS production of activated innate immune cells. Of the tested iron chelators, ROS production by innate immune cells was most inhibited by yersiniabactin.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Dual Role for Yersiniabactin</title><p>Based on the observed increase in the virulence of HPI-positive isolates, it has been suggested that in addition to providing iron to bacteria, the HPI also contributes to the increased virulence of HPI-containing <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>. To study the possible role of yersiniabactin in virulence, a knockout EHOS strain was successfully constructed. The disruption of the <italic>irp2</italic> gene was verified by DNA sequencing (Accession number: FN421462).

When the supernatant from wild-type bacterial cultures grown in iron-containing medium was used for the GFP assay, the production of GFP was not upregulated, demonstrating that yersiniabactin production is dependent on iron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008240-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).

The siderophore produced by <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, yersiniabactin, is a highly effective iron chelator that provides iron to the bacteria during infection. In this study we demonstrate that the growth of a yersiniabactin-producing strain of <italic>E. hormaechei</italic> was enhanced compared to a knockout strain in which the yersiniabactin production was disrupted in medium where iron-saturated lactoferrin is the main iron source. In media with hemin or holo-transferrin as the main iron source, yersiniabactin provided no additional benefit, probably because the tested strain, <italic>E. hormaechei</italic>, contains additional iron uptake systems.</p><p>Because it has been suggested that iron is important in the production of ROS, we investigated if yersiniabactin and other iron chelators influenced the production of ROS.</p><p>Yersiniabactin and other iron chelators reduced ROS production in PMNs, monocytes, and a mouse macrophage cell-line (J774A.1), which suggests that the decreased amount of iron available for the PMNs was responsible for the reduced ROS production. This is likely due to competitive binding for iron between yersiniabactin and iron-binding proteins produced by mammals. However, as yersiniabactin is a more effective iron chelator than lactoferrin or transferrin, the equilibrium is in favor of yersiniabactin, thereby blocking the iron supply to cells of the innate immune system. The connection between reduced iron uptake and reduced production of ROS by PMNs has been previously shown for deferoxamine and deferiprone <xref rid="pone.0008240-Ewald1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008240-Glickstein1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. However, this also suggests that iron is necessary for the majority of ROS production by PMNs, monocytes, and macrophages. This also suggests that the Haber-Weiss reaction occurs and that hydroxyl radicals are formed after activation of these innate immune cells. Clearly, innate immune cells (PMNs, monocytes, and macrophages) produce endogenous hydroxyl radicals.</p><p>Myeloperoxidase catalyzes the conversion of hydrogen peroxide to hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which is thought to be the primary compound responsible for oxidative killing <xref rid="pone.0008240-Roos1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Surprisingly, however, myeloperoxidase deficiency does not lead to susceptibility to bacterial infections <xref rid="pone.0008240-Roos1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>; the endogenous production of hydroxyl radicals by innate immune cells could potentially explain this observation.</p><p>Several siderophores were tested: yersiniabactin, aerobactin, deferoxamine, as well as the iron-chelator deferiprone. Among these, yersiniabactin was the most effective in reducing ROS production by human PMNs, human monocytes, and the mouse macrophage-like cell-line J774.1A. Clearly, yersiniabactin is highly effective in reducing the innate immune responses of the host. Previous studies have shown that the presence of HPI increased the virulence of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Yersinia</italic> species in mice <xref rid="pone.0008240-Bearden1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008240-Schubert3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008240-Carniel1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008240-Brem1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. In both a mouse bubonic model and a primary pneumonic mouse model, bacterial genes involved in the detoxification of ROS were down-regulated, indicating no ROS response targeted the bacteria. In contrast, the expression of yersiniabactin-iron uptake-system genes were strongly up-regulated <xref rid="pone.0008240-Lathem1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008240-Sebbane1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. These results, combined with the results presented in this study, suggest that yersiniabactin reduces ROS production, most likely hydroxyl radical production in particular, in innate immune cells both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Clearly, ROS production, an effective killing mechanism of cells of the innate immune system <xref rid="pone.0008240-Roos1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, is inhibited by yersiniabactin. The effect of aerobactin, another siderophore produced by <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, is limited in its capability to reduce ROS production by PMN, monocytes, and mouse macrophages. This difference can be partly explained by the fact that yersiniabactin has a much higher affinity for iron than aerobactin (yersiniabactin, &#8764;4&#215;10<sup>36</sup> M<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and aerobactin,1&#215;10<sup>23</sup> M<sup>&#8722;1</sup>)<xref rid="pone.0008240-Crosa1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008240-Perry1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.</p><p>Furthermore, we demonstrated that yersiniabactin is more effective than known and therapeutically used iron chelators, such as deferoxamine and deferiprone, in reducing ROS production by PMNs, monocytes, and mouse macrophages. Similar to aerobactin, both deferoxamine and deferiprone have a lower affinity for iron than yersiniabactin (deferoxamine, &#8764;1&#215;10<sup>30.6</sup> M<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and deferiprone, &#8764;1&#215;10<sup>19</sup> M<sup>&#8722;1</sup>
<xref rid="pone.0008240-Kontoghiorghes1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008240-Westlin1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>). However, in addition to the iron-binding capacity, other factors (e.g., lipophilicity, pH stability, and solubility) may play a role. For example, enterobactin has a very high iron affinity (1.10<sup>52</sup> M<sup>&#8722;1</sup>); however, its role in iron binding during infections is questionable because its solubility is very limited in aquatic solutions <xref rid="pone.0008240-Crosa1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Furthermore, siderophores can be inhibited by lipocalin 2, which is a component of the innate immune system that limits bacterial growth by sequestering siderophores <xref rid="pone.0008240-Flo1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. However, based on the resemblance of the yersiniabactin structure to the siderophore pyochelin, it is unlikely that yersiniabactin is bound by lipocalin 2 <xref rid="pone.0008240-Chambers1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Clearly, the results presented here demonstrate that yersiniabactin is the most effective of the investigated siderophores in reducing ROS production under physiological conditions.</p><p>This suggests that yersiniabactin, or derivates of it, may be good candidates not only for the treatment of iron overload diseases, such as beta-thalassemia major, but also for reducing oxidative stress in chronic immune-related diseases, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) <xref rid="pone.0008240-Rahman1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. In addition, many degenerative diseases have been correlated with altered ROS production <xref rid="pone.0008240-Wan1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Therefore, yersiniabactin may be also useful in reducing the progression of these degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and spinal muscular atrophy <xref rid="pone.0008240-Wan1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008240-Maczurek1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Furthermore, vascular diseases and type 2 diabetes have also been shown to have a relationship with ROS production, and yersiniabactin may also be able to attenuate the development and progression of these diseases <xref rid="pone.0008240-Lamb1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. However, a possible drawback for therapeutic use of yersiniabactin is that it may induce infections with bacteria that are able to take up iron-saturated yersiniabactin, as has already been shown for deferoxamine <xref rid="pone.0008240-Ewald1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008240-Lesic1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008240-Neupane1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Additionally, as deferoxamine has also been shown to have immunosuppressive effects on T cells <xref rid="pone.0008240-Autenrieth1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, which is mainly mediated through iron sequestering, yersiniabactin may also have immunosuppressive qualities.</p><p>In conclusion, even compared to lactoferrin, the mammalian protein that binds iron most strongly, the equilibrium for iron binding is in favor of yersiniabactin. Therefore, yersiniabactin not only provides bacteria with iron during infection, but also reduces the iron supply to cells of the innate immune system. Therefore, little or no iron is available for cells of the innate immune system, which need iron to produce hydroxyl radicals via the Haber-Weiss reaction. While it is controversial if the Haber-Weiss reaction takes place under physiological conditions, the fact that all tested iron chelators reduce, at least to some extent, ROS production in activated innate immune cells supports the hypothesis that this reaction can take place under physiological conditions. The reduced production of hydroxyl radicals would result in the decreased killing of bacteria by innate immune cells, thereby increasing the likelihood that yersiniabactin-producing <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, like the EHOS, would cause systemic infections. Therefore, we hypothesize that the increased virulence of HPI-positive <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> is caused by yersiniabactin, which in addition to improving bacterial growth, also hampers ROS production in activated innate immune cells. The increased pathogenicity of the high-pathogenicity group of <italic>Yersinia</italic> compared to the low-pathogenicity group and the non-pathogenic group can be explained by the fact that yersiniabactin, which is only produced by the high-pathogenicity group, not only provides iron to the bacterium that is normally bound to iron-binding proteins produced by mammals, like lactoferrin, but more importantly, prevents ROS production by innate immune cells</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Construction of the <italic>irp2</italic> Knockout Strain</title><p>To determine the role of the HPI in iron uptake, an <italic>irp2</italic> knockout strain was generated from the pQC-negative <italic>Enterobacter hormaechei</italic> outbreak strain E4 using the TargeTron knockout system (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).
