<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This increased virulence may be explained by the increased iron scavenging of the bacteria, which would both enhance bacterial growth and limit the availability of iron to cells of the innate immune system, which require iron to catalyze the Haber-Weiss reaction that produces hydroxyl radicals. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Yersinia pestis is regarded not only as a potential bioterrorism threat, but also as a re-emerging pathogen [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>To combat this potential threat, understanding the pathogenesis of Yersinia species is crucial. Yersinia spp. can be divided into a high-pathogenicity group (Y. pestis, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Yersinia enterocolitica biogroup 1B), a low-pathogenicity group (Y. enterocolitica biogroups 2 to 5), and a non-pathogenic group (Y. enterocolitica biogroup 1A) on the basis of the lethal infectious dose in a mouse model [2], [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Of these groups, only the high-pathogenicity group contains the High Pathogenicity Island (HPI) [2], [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>This HPI is generally adjacent to the type III secretion system secreted Yersinia outer proteins (Yops), an essential factor for the full virulence of Y. pestis in mammals [4]–[6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The HPI was first described in Yersinia spp., but it has also been described in other Enterobacteriaceae [7]–[12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Similar to Yersinia spp., Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates that contain the HPI are more virulent than isolates that lack the island [4], [12]–[16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the HPI was highly associated with an Enterobacter hormaechei outbreak strain (EHOS) that caused a nation-wide outbreak in The Netherlands [17]–[19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The HPI encodes for an effective siderophore, yersiniabactin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Yersiniabactin is synthesized by a complex assembly line in which YbtS, YbtE, HMWP1, HMWP2, and YbtU are essential proteins [20], [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>HMWP1 and HMWP2 (High Molecular Weight Protein 1 and 2) are 350 and 230 kDa proteins that are encoded by irp1 and irp2, respectively [22], [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In addition to these factors, other genes are involved in the regulation and transport of yersiniabactin, such as the fyuA gene, which encodes the yersiniabactin receptor. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Yersiniabactin facilitates iron uptake, which is essential for bacterial growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In an environment with very limited free iron, such as the human body, where most iron is bound to proteins, bacterial expression of the HPI genes has been shown to be elevated [24], [25]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Iron plays an important role in the innate immune system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>With the exception of a very limited amount of free iron, in mammals most iron is found incorporated into complex molecules, such as hemin, or bound to transferrin and lactoferrin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>During infection, polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) upregulate lactoferrin production, which reduces the availability of free iron for bacteria and increases the availability of lactoferrin-containing iron for PMNs [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>PMNs release the lactoferrin-containing iron into their phagocytic vacuoles where iron(II) can function as a catalyst to produce hydroxyl radicals (•OH) from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide anions (O– 2) via the Haber-Weiss reaction [27]–[29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Hydroxyl radicals are highly reactive and one of the most potent oxidants of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by phagocytic cells [27]–[29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>However, conclusive evidence that the Haber-Weiss takes place under physiological conditions and that hydroxyl radicals are produced is lacking [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The endogenous production of hydroxyl radicals by PMNs is in doubt because the specificity of the experiments has been questioned, and it has been argued that exogenous iron in the buffers used during in vitro experiments could catalyze the production of hydroxyl radicals rather than endogenous production in PMNs [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Whether monocytes or monocyte-derived macrophages are also dependent upon iron provided by lactoferrin for the production of hydroxyl radicals is unclear, but they are able to produce hydroxyl radicals when activated, where exogenous Fe(III) can serve as a catalyst [32], [33]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to investigate the possible role of yersiniabactin in virulence. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Growth experiments with a wild-type, yersiniabactin-producing strain (E4) and a yersiniabactin-negative irp2 mutant derived from E4 were performed to determine which human-derived iron source was beneficial for the growth of yersiniabactin-producing bacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Eighty percent iron-saturated lactoferrin supported the growth of the wild-type E4, but not the irp2 mutant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Because the increased virulence of yersiniabactin-producing bacteria could not solely be explained by the increased iron uptake and growth, we hypothesized that yersiniabactin may affect the innate immune system [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Previous work has demonstrated a dual role for another siderophore, deferoxamine: deferoxamine provided iron to Y. enterocolitica and modulated the innate immune system [34], [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we hypothesized that PMNs use iron for the production of hydroxyl radicals [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we speculated that yersiniabactin may also play a role in reducing the innate immune response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis was investigated by testing the effect of yersiniabactin and other iron chelators on the ROS production of activated innate immune cells. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>The yersiniabactin iron uptake system encoded by the HPI is a known virulence factor of Y. pestis and other Enterobacteriaceae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>The siderophore produced by Enterobacteriaceae, yersiniabactin, is a highly effective iron chelator that provides iron to the bacteria during infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>In this study we demonstrate that the growth of a yersiniabactin-producing strain of E. hormaechei was enhanced compared to a knockout strain in which the yersiniabactin production was disrupted in medium where iron-saturated lactoferrin is the main iron source. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>In media with hemin or holo-transferrin as the main iron source, yersiniabactin provided no additional benefit, probably because the tested strain, E. hormaechei, contains additional iron uptake systems. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Because it has been suggested that iron is important in the production of ROS, we investigated if yersiniabactin and other iron chelators influenced the production of ROS. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Yersiniabactin and other iron chelators reduced ROS production in PMNs, monocytes, and a mouse macrophage cell-line (J774A.1), which suggests that the decreased amount of iron available for the PMNs was responsible for the reduced ROS production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>This is likely due to competitive binding for iron between yersiniabactin and iron-binding proteins produced by mammals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>However, as yersiniabactin is a more effective iron chelator than lactoferrin or transferrin, the equilibrium is in favor of yersiniabactin, thereby blocking the iron supply to cells of the innate immune system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>The connection between reduced iron uptake and reduced production of ROS by PMNs has been previously shown for deferoxamine and deferiprone [35], [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>However, this also suggests that iron is necessary for the majority of ROS production by PMNs, monocytes, and macrophages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>This also suggests that the Haber-Weiss reaction occurs and that hydroxyl radicals are formed after activation of these innate immune cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Clearly, innate immune cells (PMNs, monocytes, and macrophages) produce endogenous hydroxyl radicals. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Myeloperoxidase catalyzes the conversion of hydrogen peroxide to hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which is thought to be the primary compound responsible for oxidative killing [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, however, myeloperoxidase deficiency does not lead to susceptibility to bacterial infections [30]; the endogenous production of hydroxyl radicals by innate immune cells could potentially explain this observation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Several siderophores were tested: yersiniabactin, aerobactin, deferoxamine, as well as the iron-chelator deferiprone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Among these, yersiniabactin was the most effective in reducing ROS production by human PMNs, human monocytes, and the mouse macrophage-like cell-line J774.1A. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Clearly, yersiniabactin is highly effective in reducing the innate immune responses of the host. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that the presence of HPI increased the virulence of E. coli and Yersinia species in mice [4], [12], [13], [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>In both a mouse bubonic model and a primary pneumonic mouse model, bacterial genes involved in the detoxification of ROS were down-regulated, indicating no ROS response targeted the bacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the expression of yersiniabactin-iron uptake-system genes were strongly up-regulated [41], [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>These results, combined with the results presented in this study, suggest that yersiniabactin reduces ROS production, most likely hydroxyl radical production in particular, in innate immune cells both in vitro and in vivo. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Clearly, ROS production, an effective killing mechanism of cells of the innate immune system [30], is inhibited by yersiniabactin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>The effect of aerobactin, another siderophore produced by Enterobacteriaceae, is limited in its capability to reduce ROS production by PMN, monocytes, and mouse macrophages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>This difference can be partly explained by the fact that yersiniabactin has a much higher affinity for iron than aerobactin (yersiniabactin, ∼4×1036 M−1 and aerobactin,1×1023 M−1)[43], [44]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we demonstrated that yersiniabactin is more effective than known and therapeutically used iron chelators, such as deferoxamine and deferiprone, in reducing ROS production by PMNs, monocytes, and mouse macrophages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Similar to aerobactin, both deferoxamine and deferiprone have a lower affinity for iron than yersiniabactin (deferoxamine, ∼1×1030.6 M−1 and deferiprone, ∼1×1019 M−1 [45], [46]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>However, in addition to the iron-binding capacity, other factors (e.g., lipophilicity, pH stability, and solubility) may play a role. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>For example, enterobactin has a very high iron affinity (1.1052 M−1); however, its role in iron binding during infections is questionable because its solubility is very limited in aquatic solutions [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, siderophores can be inhibited by lipocalin 2, which is a component of the innate immune system that limits bacterial growth by sequestering siderophores [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>However, based on the resemblance of the yersiniabactin structure to the siderophore pyochelin, it is unlikely that yersiniabactin is bound by lipocalin 2 [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Clearly, the results presented here demonstrate that yersiniabactin is the most effective of the investigated siderophores in reducing ROS production under physiological conditions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>This suggests that yersiniabactin, or derivates of it, may be good candidates not only for the treatment of iron overload diseases, such as beta-thalassemia major, but also for reducing oxidative stress in chronic immune-related diseases, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>In addition, many degenerative diseases have been correlated with altered ROS production [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Therefore, yersiniabactin may be also useful in reducing the progression of these degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and spinal muscular atrophy [49], [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, vascular diseases and type 2 diabetes have also been shown to have a relationship with ROS production, and yersiniabactin may also be able to attenuate the development and progression of these diseases [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>However, a possible drawback for therapeutic use of yersiniabactin is that it may induce infections with bacteria that are able to take up iron-saturated yersiniabactin, as has already been shown for deferoxamine [35], [52], [53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Additionally, as deferoxamine has also been shown to have immunosuppressive effects on T cells [54], which is mainly mediated through iron sequestering, yersiniabactin may also have immunosuppressive qualities. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, even compared to lactoferrin, the mammalian protein that binds iron most strongly, the equilibrium for iron binding is in favor of yersiniabactin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Therefore, yersiniabactin not only provides bacteria with iron during infection, but also reduces the iron supply to cells of the innate immune system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Therefore, little or no iron is available for cells of the innate immune system, which need iron to produce hydroxyl radicals via the Haber-Weiss reaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>While it is controversial if the Haber-Weiss reaction takes place under physiological conditions, the fact that all tested iron chelators reduce, at least to some extent, ROS production in activated innate immune cells supports the hypothesis that this reaction can take place under physiological conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>The reduced production of hydroxyl radicals would result in the decreased killing of bacteria by innate immune cells, thereby increasing the likelihood that yersiniabactin-producing Enterobacteriaceae, like the EHOS, would cause systemic infections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we hypothesize that the increased virulence of HPI-positive Enterobacteriaceae is caused by yersiniabactin, which in addition to improving bacterial growth, also hampers ROS production in activated innate immune cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>The increased pathogenicity of the high-pathogenicity group of Yersinia compared to the low-pathogenicity group and the non-pathogenic group can be explained by the fact that yersiniabactin, which is only produced by the high-pathogenicity group, not only provides iron to the bacterium that is normally bound to iron-binding proteins produced by mammals, like lactoferrin, but more importantly, prevents ROS production by innate immune cells </plain></SENT>
