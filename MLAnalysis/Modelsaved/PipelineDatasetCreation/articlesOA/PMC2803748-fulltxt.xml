KCNRG protein may interfere with the normal assembly of the K+ channel proteins causing the suppression of Kv currents. We aimed to examine possible role of KCNRG haploinsufficiency in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and MM cells. We performed detailed genomic analysis of the KCNRG locus; studied effects of the stable overexpression of <italic>KCNRG</italic> isoforms in RPMI-8226, HL-60, and LnCaP cells; and evaluated relative expression of its transcripts in various human lymphomas. Three MM cell lines and 35 CLL PBL samples were screened for KCNRG mutations. <italic>KCNRG</italic> exerts growth suppressive and pro-apoptotic effects in HL-60, LnCaP, and RPMI-8226 cells. Direct sequencing of <italic>KCNRG</italic> exons revealed point mutation delT in RPMI-8226 cell line. Levels of major isoform of <italic>KCNRG</italic> mRNA are lower in DLBL lymphomas compared to normal PBL samples, while levels of its minor mRNA are decreased across the broad range of the lymphoma types.

This disease is usually seen amongst the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. On a cellular level, the disease progresses due to the prolonged survival of B-CLL cells arrested in the G0 stage of the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] This prolonged survival causes the accumulation of quiescent small CD5(+) B lymphocytes which are frozen at an early step of maturation and have decreased susceptibility to apoptotic cell death. Latter features of CLL are commonly attributed to the imbalance in various cytoplasmic pro-survival and pro-death pathways, including the BCR-signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In addition, a small number of &#8220;atypical&#8221; Ki-67 expressing lymphocytes are frequently observed in the bone marrow of CLL patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Proliferation rates of these lymphocytes vary among patients and even among subpopulations of cells within the leukemic clones of individual patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A newly evolving point of view at CLL stresses that blood lymphocyte count in individual patients represents a dynamic interplay between ongoing birth and death within the clones rather than a linear, monotonous accumulation of inert leukemic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The most frequent chromosomal abnormalities in B-CLL are deletions on 13q14 and 17p13, trisomy 12, and rearrangements of 14q32. Being the most common abnormality in CLL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], deletions at 13q14.3 are associated with the longest survival. Rearrangements and/or deletions in the region of 13q14.3 are found in many other types of hematopoietic malignancies, including 38% of mantle cell lymphomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and approximately 54% of multiple myelomas (MM) as detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In the majority of these non-CLL cases, 13q14 deletions are associated with a poor chemotherapy response profile. In addition, deletions of 13q14.3 are common in prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and in some other solid tumors.</p><p>Attempts to delineate the minimal common deleted region (CDR) in CLL and MM cells lead to highlighting a region adjacent to marker D13S319 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This region encompasses an area containing the previously described tumor suppressor gene candidates <italic>DLEU1</italic>, <italic>DLEU2</italic>, <italic>RFP2</italic>, and <italic>KCNRG</italic> as well as microRNAs miR-15a and miR-16-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. <italic>DLEU1</italic> and <italic>DLEU2</italic> candidates are represented by a number of non-coding RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Direct sequencing and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) screening of the <italic>RFP2</italic> gene encoding E3 ubiquitin ligase revealed no mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Recently, a haploinsufficiency mechanism has been proposed as a major mode of inactivation of 13q14 tumor suppressor gene(s). According to this mechanism, deletion of a single active copy of 13q14.3 results in significant downregulation of the candidate gene(s) and loss of function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Candidate tumor suppressor gene <italic>KCNRG</italic> (potassium channel regulating gene) is located within the 3&#8242; end of the largest transcript of <italic>RFP2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and encodes a protein with a high homology to the tetramerization domain of voltage-gated K+ channels (Kv channels). This protein may interfere with the normal assembly of the K+ channel proteins by binding to their tetramerization domain, thereby, causing the suppression of Kv currents. This hypothesis was consequently confirmed using the patch-clamp technique in the human androgen-sensitive prostate cell line LnCaP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. As Kv channels are involved in the proliferation of both LnCaP cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and normal lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], while being upregulated in neoplastic hematopoietic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], we hypothesized that <italic>KCNRG</italic> may exert a tumor suppressor effect relevant to CLL and MM.</p><p>To investigate the possibility of <italic>KCNRG</italic> involvement in the pathogenesis of these diseases, we performed detailed genomic analysis of the KCNRG locus; studied effects of the stable overexpression of <italic>KCNRG</italic> isoforms in the model cell lines RPMI-8226, HL-60, and LnCaP; and evaluated relative expression of its transcripts in various human lymphomas.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Mutation screening</title><p>This study was performed using peripheral blood samples obtained from 35 B-CLL patients and ten donors with informed consent and Institutional Review Board approval. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by a standard procedure using Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation and used for total DNA preparation and purification by phenol/chlorophorm protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Median absolute number of lymphocytes was 57,000/ul (range 24,000&#8211;187,000); therefore, in all cases, fraction of mononuclear cells contained mostly B-CLL cells. Primer sequences for amplifying the coding region of the KCNRG gene were chosen according to Cho et al. All cases were screened for the presence of an aberrant band in the tumor DNA by SSCP analysis of each exon and compared with the normal DNA.

Human KCNRG-L (mRNA isoform B) and KCNRG-S (mRNA isoform A) were cloned into the pcDNA3.1/myc-His vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA). The cloning of KCNRG-L was performed by OriGene (Rockville, MD, USA) using archived full-length cDNA clone corresponding to mRNA isoform NM_173605. For KCNRG-S isoform, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product encompassing its full-length open reading frame was amplified from human brain mRNA, cloned into pGemT-Easy vector (Promega), then transferred to pcDNA3.1/myc-His. The restriction enzymes BamH1 and XhoI were used for the cloning of both KCNRG isoforms. Bidirectional sequencing of the plasmids and PCR clones with vector or gene-specific primers were performed by fluorescence-tagged chain termination (Big Dye Terminator, Applied Biosystems), according to the manufacturer's protocol, followed by fractionation on an ABI 310 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Two primer pairs were designed to confirm authenticity of the inserts: pair V1 capable of amplifying both isoforms of KCNRG with product sizes of 107 basepairs and 129 basepairs, and pair V2, specifically amplifying KCNRG-S specific product of 129 basepairs. Primer sequences were as follows: V1 5&#8242;-TTTTCCCTCCTCAGATGACC-3&#8242; and 5&#8242;-TCCAGTTTGGTTATCAGTAGTGC-3&#8242;, V2 5&#8242;-CCTGGTTTTCCAGTGTG GTT-3&#8242;, and 5&#8242;-GCTGAGGCAGGAGAATCACT-3&#8242;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>LnCaP, HL-60, and RPMI-8226 cells stably expressing KCNRG-L and KCNRG-S</title><p>Cell lines LNCaP, HL-60, and RPMI-8226 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) and maintained in RPMI-1640 containing 2&#160;mM glutamine, 10&#160;mM HEPES, and 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA).

In experiments with transiently transfected cells, an extra set of 16 wells with mock-transfected cells were added. Apoptosis assays were performed in 96 well plates in sets of 8-well replicates for each cell type. Cell proliferation rates were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Chemiluminescent BrDU (Roche). As recommended by the manufacturer, the optimal incubation times were determined experimentally, 48&#160;h for RPMI-8662 and HL-60 and 72&#160;h for LnCaP. Apoptosis rates were determined using the CaspaseGLO 3/7 luminescent Assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) that measures caspase-3 and -7 activities after 2&#160;h of incubation. Chemoluminescence was quantified using microplate fluorometer Fluoroskan Ascent (Thermo Scientific).

Each dilution series was printed in duplicate onto nitrocellulose-coated glass slides (Whatman, Inc., Sanford, ME, USA) with a 2470 Arrayer (Aushon BioSystems, Burlington, MA, USA). Slides were desiccated and stored at &#8722;20&#176;C. Before antibody staining, the lysate arrays were treated with mild Reblot antibody stripping solution (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA) for 15&#160;min at room temperature, washed twice for 5&#160;min in phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated for at least 5&#160;h in blocking solution [1&#160;g I-block (Tropix, Bedford, MA, USA), 0.1% Tween-20 in 500&#160;ml phosphate-buffered saline] at room temperature with constant rocking. Blocked arrays were stained with antibodies on an automated slide stainer (Dako Cytomation, Carpinteria, CA, USA) using the Catalyzed Signal Amplification System kit according to the manufacturer's recommendation (CSA; Dako Cytomation). Briefly, endogenous biotin was blocked for 10&#160;min with the biotin blocking kit (Dako Cytomation), followed by application of protein block for 5&#160;min; primary antibodies were diluted in antibody diluent and incubated on slides for 30&#160;min, and biotinylated secondary antibodies were incubated for 15&#160;min. Signal amplification involved incubation with a streptavidin&#8211;biotin&#8211;peroxidase complex provided in the CSA kit for 15&#160;min and amplification reagent (biotinyl-tyramide/hydrogen peroxide, streptavidin-peroxidase) for 15&#160;min each.

Our analysis (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; Supplementary Figure&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="">2</xref>) revealed two previously unclassified KCNRG-like proteins that belongs to KCTD family, TNFAIP1 (tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced protein 1) and SHKPB1 (SH3KBP1 binding protein 1), while pointing that the protein C6orf69 previously described as KCTD20 represents an outgroup and should be excluded from the T1 family in a sensu stricto. Most of the KCTD proteins are relatively short (on average, 355 aminoacids). Their T1 domains are located close to the N-end of the protein and are not accompanied by any other Pfam domains. KCTD19 protein is the only KCTD member that contains two tandem T1 domains, first of which is truncated. T1 domains in three out of 25 KCTD proteins, namely, KCTD18, KCTD11, and KCTD9L, are truncated. KCNRG is a typical member of the KCTD family, with solitary T1 domain unaccompanied by any other recognizable protein structure.

Despite significant effort undertaken by multiple laboratories, a screening of the mutations in the studied candidate genes in primary tumor cells has not yet been successful. These findings prompted some investigators to propose that a major mode of inactivation of 13q14 tumor suppressor gene(s) is by the deletion of one copy of the gene causing decrease in the production of gene' mRNA and partial loss of its function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This mechanism gene inactivation is known as haploinsufficiency. Importantly, haploinsufficiency implies that the deleted region may contain more than one gene participating in the suppression of the tumor development, a feature that is especially relevant in light of particular importance of the conservative miRNA-16 locus for the development of CLL like disorder in New Zealand mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>Candidate tumor suppressor gene <italic>KCNRG</italic> (potassium channel regulating gene) is located very close to the 10-kb region previously described as CDR in CLL and within larger region deleted in the majority of CLL cases with 13q14.3 aberrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Functional analysis of <italic>KCNRG</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] pointed at the possibility that it might exert a tumor suppressor effect relevant to CLL and MM. Additionally, a missense mutation at codon 92 within the T1 domain of KCNRG was found in one hepatocellular tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Analysis of the Hep3B hepatoma cells revealed that in this cell line, <italic>KCNRG</italic> has growth suppressive activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In this paper, we demonstrated that <italic>KCNRG</italic> possesses similar activity when overexpressed in RPMI-8226 and HL-60 cells. Moreover, overexpression of KCNRG stimulates apoptosis in these cells and leads to dramatic changes in their size and shape. A substantial proportion of both RPMI-8226 and HL-60 cells overexpressing isoform KCNRG-L was arrested in G2 phase, possibly indicative of G2/M checkpoint activation. Additionally, migration of <italic>KCNRG</italic> overexpressing cells has also significantly decreased. Finally, <italic>KCNRG</italic> overexpression increased a propensity of the cells to undergo apoptosis after the stress, in particular, affecting its ability to recover after the storage in frozen state (not shown).</p><p>One way to confirm the relevance of these characteristics of human <italic>KCNRG</italic> to the suppression of CLL and MM in vivo is to find its point mutations in the primary tumor cells. Our and others' attempts to do so were unsuccessful. However, a number of circumstantial evidences points at <italic>KCNRG</italic> as an important player in hematological malignancies. First, real-time PCR profiling of <italic>KCNRG</italic> mRNAs revealed that levels of the major <italic>KCNRG</italic> isoform in DLBL lymphomas are lower compared to normal PBL samples, while levels of its minor mRNA are decreased across the broad range of the lymphoma types. Levels of the <italic>KCNRG</italic> mRNA were also decreased in the lymphomas of the stage IV. Second, MM cell line RPMI-8226 contains delT mutation in the core promoter initiator element that might influence levels of KCNRG expression in this model line. Third, proteomics endpoint analysis by RPA indicated an involvement of <italic>KCNRG</italic> in the suppression of mTOR and VEGFR pathways as well as in caspase activation in a broad sense. In light of these observations, an identification of the particular mode of <italic>KCNRG</italic> inactivation in the tumor samples becomes a priority. Despite a number of studies that delineated 13q14 deletions in CLL and MM and quantified relative expression levels of some candidate genes residing in this area, the critical insights related to the role of 13q14 role in human malignancies are still to be gained. Here, we described a novel, highly informative polymorphic repeat, located at the position 1006 relative to the major start of <italic>KCNRG</italic> mRNAs and within 3&#8242; untranslated area of <italic>RFP2</italic>. As the structure of this repeat allows its relatively simple visualization in agarose gels after conventional PCR, it might become a valuable marker for the hemizygous deletion of <italic>KCNRG</italic> in primary tumor samples.</p><p>Interestingly, <italic>KCNRG</italic> belongs to rather large subfamily of the poorly characterized human genes (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Some of these genes functions in tumorigenesis: <italic>SH3KBP1</italic> suppresses cathepsin B-mediated apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]; hedgehog antagonist REN (<italic>KCTD11</italic>) regulates proliferation and apoptosis of developing granule cell progenitors and suppresses medulloblastoma genesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]; and expression of the <italic>KCTD12</italic> (pfetin) serves as a negative prognostic biomarkers for gastrointestinal stromal tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. As cellular functions for the majority of the KCNRG-like proteins have never been studied, it is important to determine their relevance to the tumorigenesis and lymphomagenesis in humans.</p><p>In conclusion, we conducted a functional study of the tumor suppressor gene candidate <italic>KCNRG</italic> and demonstrated its growth suppressive and pro-apoptotic effects in the cellular models relevant to CLL and MM. We conclude that the effects of the loss of <italic>KCNRG</italic> might be relevant to the progression of these hematological malignancies at least in a subset of the patients with these disorders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><sec id="AppESM1"><title>Electronic Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d28e1365" content-type="local-data"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
