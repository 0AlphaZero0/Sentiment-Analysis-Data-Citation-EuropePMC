</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) represents 22–30% of all leukemia cases, thus being the most commonly diagnosed form of leukemia in the Western world [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This disease is usually seen amongst the elderly [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>On a cellular level, the disease progresses due to the prolonged survival of B-CLL cells arrested in the G0 stage of the cell cycle [3, 4] This prolonged survival causes the accumulation of quiescent small CD5(+) B lymphocytes which are frozen at an early step of maturation and have decreased susceptibility to apoptotic cell death. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Latter features of CLL are commonly attributed to the imbalance in various cytoplasmic pro-survival and pro-death pathways, including the BCR-signaling pathway [3, 5, 6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In addition, a small number of “atypical” Ki-67 expressing lymphocytes are frequently observed in the bone marrow of CLL patients [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Proliferation rates of these lymphocytes vary among patients and even among subpopulations of cells within the leukemic clones of individual patients [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>A newly evolving point of view at CLL stresses that blood lymphocyte count in individual patients represents a dynamic interplay between ongoing birth and death within the clones rather than a linear, monotonous accumulation of inert leukemic cells [8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The most frequent chromosomal abnormalities in B-CLL are deletions on 13q14 and 17p13, trisomy 12, and rearrangements of 14q32. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Being the most common abnormality in CLL [9, 10], deletions at 13q14.3 are associated with the longest survival. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Rearrangements and/or deletions in the region of 13q14.3 are found in many other types of hematopoietic malignancies, including 38% of mantle cell lymphomas [11] and approximately 54% of multiple myelomas (MM) as detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization [12, 13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In the majority of these non-CLL cases, 13q14 deletions are associated with a poor chemotherapy response profile. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In addition, deletions of 13q14.3 are common in prostate cancer [14] and in some other solid tumors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Attempts to delineate the minimal common deleted region (CDR) in CLL and MM cells lead to highlighting a region adjacent to marker D13S319 [9, 13, 15, 16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>This region encompasses an area containing the previously described tumor suppressor gene candidates DLEU1, DLEU2, RFP2, and KCNRG as well as microRNAs miR-15a and miR-16-1 [9, 16–19]. DLEU1 and DLEU2 candidates are represented by a number of non-coding RNAs [15, 20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Direct sequencing and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) screening of the RFP2 gene encoding E3 ubiquitin ligase revealed no mutations [13, 19, 21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Recently, a haploinsufficiency mechanism has been proposed as a major mode of inactivation of 13q14 tumor suppressor gene(s). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>According to this mechanism, deletion of a single active copy of 13q14.3 results in significant downregulation of the candidate gene(s) and loss of function [22]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Candidate tumor suppressor gene KCNRG (potassium channel regulating gene) is located within the 3′ end of the largest transcript of RFP2 [23] and encodes a protein with a high homology to the tetramerization domain of voltage-gated K+ channels (Kv channels). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>This protein may interfere with the normal assembly of the K+ channel proteins by binding to their tetramerization domain, thereby, causing the suppression of Kv currents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis was consequently confirmed using the patch-clamp technique in the human androgen-sensitive prostate cell line LnCaP [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>As Kv channels are involved in the proliferation of both LnCaP cells [24] and normal lymphocytes [25], while being upregulated in neoplastic hematopoietic cells [26], we hypothesized that KCNRG may exert a tumor suppressor effect relevant to CLL and MM. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>To investigate the possibility of KCNRG involvement in the pathogenesis of these diseases, we performed detailed genomic analysis of the KCNRG locus; studied effects of the stable overexpression of KCNRG isoforms in the model cell lines RPMI-8226, HL-60, and LnCaP; and evaluated relative expression of its transcripts in various human lymphomas. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the Hep3B hepatoma cells revealed that in this cell line, KCNRG has growth suppressive activity [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we demonstrated that KCNRG possesses similar activity when overexpressed in RPMI-8226 and HL-60 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Moreover, overexpression of KCNRG stimulates apoptosis in these cells and leads to dramatic changes in their size and shape. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>A substantial proportion of both RPMI-8226 and HL-60 cells overexpressing isoform KCNRG-L was arrested in G2 phase, possibly indicative of G2/M checkpoint activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Additionally, migration of KCNRG overexpressing cells has also significantly decreased. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Finally, KCNRG overexpression increased a propensity of the cells to undergo apoptosis after the stress, in particular, affecting its ability to recover after the storage in frozen state (not shown). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>One way to confirm the relevance of these characteristics of human KCNRG to the suppression of CLL and MM in vivo is to find its point mutations in the primary tumor cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Our and others' attempts to do so were unsuccessful. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>However, a number of circumstantial evidences points at KCNRG as an important player in hematological malignancies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>First, real-time PCR profiling of KCNRG mRNAs revealed that levels of the major KCNRG isoform in DLBL lymphomas are lower compared to normal PBL samples, while levels of its minor mRNA are decreased across the broad range of the lymphoma types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Levels of the KCNRG mRNA were also decreased in the lymphomas of the stage IV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Second, MM cell line RPMI-8226 contains delT mutation in the core promoter initiator element that might influence levels of KCNRG expression in this model line. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Third, proteomics endpoint analysis by RPA indicated an involvement of KCNRG in the suppression of mTOR and VEGFR pathways as well as in caspase activation in a broad sense. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>In light of these observations, an identification of the particular mode of KCNRG inactivation in the tumor samples becomes a priority. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Despite a number of studies that delineated 13q14 deletions in CLL and MM and quantified relative expression levels of some candidate genes residing in this area, the critical insights related to the role of 13q14 role in human malignancies are still to be gained. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Here, we described a novel, highly informative polymorphic repeat, located at the position 1006 relative to the major start of KCNRG mRNAs and within 3′ untranslated area of RFP2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>As the structure of this repeat allows its relatively simple visualization in agarose gels after conventional PCR, it might become a valuable marker for the hemizygous deletion of KCNRG in primary tumor samples. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, KCNRG belongs to rather large subfamily of the poorly characterized human genes (Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Some of these genes functions in tumorigenesis: SH3KBP1 suppresses cathepsin B-mediated apoptosis [35]; hedgehog antagonist REN (KCTD11) regulates proliferation and apoptosis of developing granule cell progenitors and suppresses medulloblastoma genesis [36]; and expression of the KCTD12 (pfetin) serves as a negative prognostic biomarkers for gastrointestinal stromal tumors [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>As cellular functions for the majority of the KCNRG-like proteins have never been studied, it is important to determine their relevance to the tumorigenesis and lymphomagenesis in humans. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we conducted a functional study of the tumor suppressor gene candidate KCNRG and demonstrated its growth suppressive and pro-apoptotic effects in the cellular models relevant to CLL and MM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the effects of the loss of KCNRG might be relevant to the progression of these hematological malignancies at least in a subset of the patients with these disorders. </plain></SENT>
