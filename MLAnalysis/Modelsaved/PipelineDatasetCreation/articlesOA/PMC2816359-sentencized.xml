</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase A; EC 3.1.27.5) has long been studied as a model of enzyme structure and function (reviewed by Raines1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>It is now increasingly recognised as the archetype of an intriguing enzyme superfamily whose actions are closely linked to the evolution of vertebrates and which has undergone tremendous diversification.2–5 Many members of the superfamily have potent biological activities that are dependent on their enzymatic activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Among these are the angiogenic and tumor-promoting activities of angiogenin (Ang),6–8 the antiviral and neurotoxic activities of eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN)9,10 and the cytotoxic activities of bovine seminal ribonuclease11 and Onconase.12 The use of site-directed mutagenesis and broad-spectrum inhibitors such as ribonuclease inhibitor (RI) protein13 have been invaluable in establishing the links between biological and enzymatic activities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, the development of stable, low-molecular weight inhibitors with high specificity remains a priority for the study of individual enzymes in their natural settings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, such compounds may lead to agents for the treatment of pathologies associated with ribonuclease action, most notably anti-tumor agents directed at Ang.8 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>RNase A superfamily members cleave the P-O5′ bonds of RNA specifically after pyrimidine residues.14 Inhibition of this action with small molecules has focused principally on the central catalytic and substrate-binding region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>This is conventionally divided into subsites named P1, B1, and B2, which bind the scissile bond and the heterocyclic bases immediately upstream (a pyrimidine) and downstream (preferentially a purine), respectively.14,15 One well-established line of attack involves phosphoadenosine-based nucleotides. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Such compounds inhibit a variety of ribonucleases including RNase A, EDN, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), RNase 4, Ang and, in all likelihood, many others.16 The tightest-binding examples reported thus far are chemically-synthesized derivatives of adenosine 5′-pyrophosphate (ppA); among these, 5′-diphosphoadenosine 3′-phosphate (ppA-3′-p) and its 5′-phospho 2′-deoxyuridine derivative (pdUppA-3′-p) exhibit Ki values of 10−8–10−6M when binding to RNase A, EDN, or RNase 4.17,18 This has been matched only by oligo (vinylsulfonic acid), a polyanion that inhibits RNase A with a Ki of 0.12 μM under similar buffer conditions containing 0.1M NaCl.19 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>X-ray crystallographic studies of complexes formed between phosphoadenosine-based inhibitors and RNase A,20–22 EDN,23,24 and ECP25 have shown that these compounds bind minimally to the P1 and B2 subsites but can also make additional interactions further afield depending on the nature of substitution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Exploration of the more peripheral interactions may lead to the development of inhibitors that are specific to particular ribonuclease homologs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, these enzyme·inhibitor systems exhibit remarkable conformational complexity and the confidence with which inhibitor improvements can be derived from the existing data is not high. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>For example, with the RNase A·inhibitor system (which has received most attention thus far; Table I), a simple RNA-derived compound such as pA-3′-p binds in the conventional manner observed for oligonucleotide substrate analogues32–35 (here designated as Class Ia) but a radically altered mode is observed upon modification of the compound with phosphate groups at the 5′- and/or 2′- positions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The two key torsional parameters that characterize this are the rotameric state of His119 (a residue that contributes to both the P1 and B2 subsites) and the N-glycosidic torsion angle (χ) of the nucleotide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>These reflect to a large degree the nature of the base-stacking interaction at the B2 subsite and the region of the inhibitor that occupies the P1 subsite.

<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In RNA, χ is usually anti (180–250°) or high-anti (above 250°) but rarely syn (&lt;120°).30,31cLetters in parentheses denote alternate ligand conformations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In view of the conformational uncertainties in the binding of adenylic nucleotides, it remains a priority to extend the panel of inhibitor complexes for which structural data is available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>It is pertinent that several naturally-occuring nucleotides that possess a ppA moiety are also effective ribonuclease inhibitors.36 These include 5′-ATP, P1,P3-bis(5′-adenosyl) triphosphate (Ap3A), NADPH, and NADP+. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>This crystal form presents two protein chains (mol A and mol B) in the asymmetric unit,20 and, with the exception of the Ap3A complex, which lacks residue LysA1, each of the structures comprises two complete main chains (residues 1–124). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Density for residues 16–24 and 87–90 of each chain is consistently poor, as is typical for this crystal form. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In Ramachandran plots, 94.2–96.7% of non-Pro/Gly residues lie in the most-favored regions with only SerB16 falling in a disfavored region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>In no case is the main chain topology perturbed significantly by the presence of the ligand; of the 10 protein chains, nine have Cα traces that deviate by 0.21–0.25 Å (r.m.s.) from the corresponding chain in monoclinic unliganded RNase A (PDB entry 1AFU),20 whereas for chain A of the Ap3A complex, the figure is slightly higher at 0.48 Å and appears to be a consequence of the relatively low resolution of this structure.

<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>This parallels the difficulty experienced in locating the ribosyl backbone atoms in many RNA structures.38 Plausible coordinates were derived through crystallographic refinement with REFMAC539 with referral to the all-atom contact analysis of MolProbity40 and in the knowledge that the lever-actions of the base and phosphates dictate to a large degree the sugar's conformation.41 The position of each of the nucleotide inhibitors is better defined in mol A than in mol B. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Under equivalent conditions, Ki values for 5′-AMP (pA), 5′-ADP (ppA), and 5′-ATP (pppA) are 80, 1.2, and 0.86 μM, respectively.18,36 The 67-fold drop in Ki experienced when moving from 5′-AMP to 5′-ADP coincides with a radical change in nucleotide conformation (Class Ia/Ib to Class II; Table I).22,26 We now present the crystal structure of the RNase A·5′-ATP complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The electron density map indicates the position of the base, the β- and the γ-phosphate but there is significant disorder in between (Figure 2a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The adenine ring is positioned as in the 5′-AMP complex, stacking with His119 (rotamer A) and hydrogen-bonding with Asn71 in a conventional (Class Ia) fashion, but a small decrease in χ coupled with a pronounced curvature of the triphosphate chain brings the γ- rather than the α-phosphate into the P1 subsite (Figure 3; Table III). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>As such, the binding mode conforms to Class Ib. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Previous studies on adenylic nucleotides that contain a 5′-pyrophosphate group (in various states of derivatization) are consistent in their description of a syn base conformation and in their placement of β-phosphate as the major P1 subsite ligand when bound to RNase A (Class II binding). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>The conformation observed here for RNase A-bound 5′-ATP represents a deviation from this pattern and offers an explanation for the stagnation in Ki encountered when moving from 5′-ADP to 5′-ATP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>That is, although the Class II binding mode can support productive interactions of additional 5′-β-phosphate-linked substituents (e.g., in the binding of pdUppA-3′-p),21 with 5′-ATP these are not as favorable as those involving the γ-phosphate after adoption of the anti conformation observed here. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>5′-ATP also inhibits EDN, albeit ∼25-fold less effectively (Ki = 21 μM).36 The manner in which this compound binds to EDN (PDB entry 2C01)24 differs from that observed here with RNase A. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>The catalytic centers of the two proteins are highly similar, and it seems that electronic and/or steric effects of a subtle nature are responsible for the differences in binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Whatever the case, the superior inhibition of RNase A correlates with a better-defined and more extensive interaction between inhibitor and protein. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>The electron density map indicates the position of a portion of the nucleotide corresponding to a 5′-ATP moiety (Figure 2b), and the remainder of the inhibitor is presumed to be in no fixed conformation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>The visible portion has the adenine/His119 rotamer A stacking arrangement and syn base conformation of the Class II binding mode associated with 5′-pyrophosphate-containing adenine nucleotides (Figure 4a; Table III). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>There are modest differences in the binding of the inhibitor to the two protein chains in the asymmetric unit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>These appear to derive from a hydrogen bond in mol A between O2′ of the ribose and Oγ1 of a symmetry-related ThrB70 residue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>This has negligible impact on the adenine position but alters the conformation of the ribose and, to a lesser degree, the polyphosphate chain (Table III). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Although they comprise the same set of atoms, RNase A-bound 5′-ATP and the ordered portion of likewise-bound Ap3A exhibit conformations that are clearly very different from one another. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>In the 5′-ATP complex, the compact conformation of the polyphosphate chain and the tendency of the γ-phosphate toward burial among the P1 subsite residues appears to leave little scope for the addition of a second 5′-linked adenosine (see Figure 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>A switch to the Class II binding mode, however, provides an exit route for the 5′-extension, as is observed for other inhibitors such as pdUppA-3′-p.21 The loss of 1–2 hydrogen bonds that accompanies this change most likely contributes to the decrease in affinity that is observed when moving from 5′-ATP to Ap3A. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Ap3A inhibits EDN with a similar potency (Ki = 70 μM).36 When bound to EDN (PDB entry 2C02),24 the conformation of the second adenosine moiety is likewise disordered, but a syn base conformation is not observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>The reason for this is the need to avoid an overlap between the O3′ edge of the ribose and the side chain of Trp7 (a residue whose counterpart in RNase A is Ala4) (Figure 4b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>The α- and β-phosphates appear to hydrogen-bond with EDN's P1 subsite but it was not possible to arrive at a definitive arrangement due to disorder in the nucleotide.24 It seems likely that hydrogen-bonding is less extensive than in the RNase A complex and that this is compensated for by the adoption of a more favorable base conformation to give a similar binding affinity. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Since their discovery,20 monoclinic RNase A crystals have proven to be well suited to the study and development of ribonuclease inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>In their favor, they grow at low ionic strength and moderate acidity, both of which are conducive to nucleotide binding.16 They also offer good access to the whole B1-P1-B2 region of each of the protein molecules in the asymmetric unit, as indicated by the excellent electron density observed for enzyme-bound pdUppA-3′-p.21 The quality of the present structures supports the utility of these crystals but reaffirms one drawback, namely the potential impact of symmetry-related protein chains on the binding of inhibitors to the B2 subsite. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Mol A is the most affected owing to potential direct hydrogen-bonding interactions between the inhibitor and a symmetry-related ThrB70 residue and, to a lesser degree, to constrainment of GluA111 by its packing against a symmetry-related TyrB115 residue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>In addition, GlnA69 and GlnB69 pack against one another, which could conceivably constrain either residue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>These features do not affect the overall binding mode or conformational order of the present inhibitors but they have been seen to do so, for example in the binding of pA-2′-p and dUppA.22,27 In those cases where there is a degree of conformational disorder and an ensemble of inhibitor conformations exists (e.g., the binding of Ap3A, NADPH or NADP+), the symmetry-related contacts of mol A might be viewed as a helpful means of selecting a representative conformation, but it may be that mol B is a more reliable indicator of solution behavior. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>The conformational diversity of RNase A-bound adenylic inhibitors continues to expand. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>With our report of the RNase A·5′-ATP structure, there are now accounts of the binding of 5′-α-, 5′-β-, 5′-γ-, and 2′-phosphates to the P1 subsite. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>The torsional flexibility of the nucleotides and the adaptability of the B2 subsite are key factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Despite the array of possible conformations, the larger inhibitors investigated here (Ap3A, NADPH, and NADP+) are only partially visible in their respective electron density maps. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>The possibility of nonenzymatic cleavage of these inhibitors must be considered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Ap3A is known to be susceptible to hydrolytic cleavage within the polyphosphate chain but the reaction yields products (5′-ADP and 5′-AMP) that are smaller than the visible moiety (5′-ATP) and occurs at an insignificant rate (t½ = 154 d at 60°C, pH 6.0, and I = 0.1).50 For pyridine nucleotides under mildly acidic conditions, polyphosphate cleavage is not a significant form of degradation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>It does occur with oxidized forms such as NADP+ but elevated temperatures and alkaline conditions are required for the detection of products.51,52 In view of this, the partial electron density observed in the present complexes most likely reflects a lack of interaction between one half of the dinucleotide and the protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>It appears that, as the complexity of the 5′-linked extension increases, the need to avoid unfavorable protein·inhibitor contacts becomes an overiding influence on the binding mode and a reduced number of modes can support the binding of the compound. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>The incomplete interaction of Ap3A, NADPH, and NADP+ with RNase A is reminiscent of the binding of Ap3A and Ap4A to EDN.24 With the latter enzyme, further extension of the polyphosphate linker to form Ap5A brought about a far more extensive interaction, indicating that inclusion of an appropriate linker can have a dramatic effect on binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Hence, it remains possible that the decreases in the Ki for RNase A inhibition encountered when moving from Ap3A (Ki = 29 μM) through Ap4A (Ki = 2.6 μM) to Ap5A (Ki = 0.23 μM) reflect the formation of new interactions permitted by linker extension, as previously suggested.36 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>The details of the NADPH and NADP+ complexes give insight into the suitability of pA-2′-p or ppA-2′-p as a core for the development of larger inhibitors of RNase A. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Although three different binding modes have been observed for 2′-phosphoadenosine-based nucleotides (Table I), none of these permits binding of the nicotinamide portion of the present nucleotides. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>As with the diadenosine polyphosphates, the inclusion of extended, unbranched linkers may be necessary to facilitate additional interactions beyond the 5′-β-phosphate. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>High-throughput screening has identified several non-nucleotide inhibitors that bind slightly more tightly to Ang than to RNase A.53 Existing adenylic inhibitors, on the other hand, tend to select against Ang, for which they exhibit Ki values that are 2–3 orders of magnitude greater than those obtained for RNase A.16 With the nucleotides, the design process has been hampered by an inability to obtain Ang·inhibitor complexes in crystalline form and it has been necessary to extrapolate from data on RNase A and other enzymes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>To help test the validity of these measures, a direct comparison can now be made between the RNase A·PPi and Ang·PPi structures.49 It is clear that the manner in which PPi binds to RNase A is not an accurate indicator of what occurs when the same group is O5′-linked to an adenylic nucleotide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>The same is true for Ang, as can be deduced from heteronuclear NMR data on its interaction with ppA-2′-p and dUppA-2′-p.45 Although there is a close correspondence in the ligand position in the RNase A·PPi and Ang·PPi structures, there is a difference in the manner in which the two enzymes bind ppA-2′-p (Class II and Class III modes, respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, with the larger derivatives that have been examined (NADPH/NADP+ with RNase A and dUppA-2′-p with Ang), the Class III mode prevails (as does the nonengagement of the second nucleotide), suggesting that similar strategies may be necessary to improve the affinity of 2′-phosphoadenosine-based nucleotides for these enzymes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that side chain differences located toward the N-terminus of the protein could contribute to differences in the affinity of adenylic inhibitors for various ribonucleases.17 The contrast between the RNase A·Ap3A and EDN·Ap3A structures supports this view (Figure 4b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>The complete conformational switch that is apparently triggered by the Trp7 side chain of EDN highlights that such steric effects can be strong and could be exploited in the inhibitor design process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>In particular, the close proximity of Trp7 to the ribosyl O3′ atom of the inhibitor suggests that O3′-linked substituents above a certain size may not be tolerated well by this enzyme and may disfavor binding. </plain></SENT>
