</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Plants need light energy to drive photosynthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, too much light can cause photo-oxidative damage (Barber and Andersson 1992; Long et al. 1994); therefore, plants have to avoid or overcome the damage in order to perform photosynthesis efficiently. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>To deal with light stress, plants have evolved several defense mechanisms (Niyogi 1999) that are involved in acclimation to excess light (Li et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>For example, a decrease in light energy absorption can be achieved under high light by chloroplast avoidance movement, which protects plants from photo-oxidative stress (Kasahara et al. 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In addition, excess absorbed light energy can be quenched and harmlessly dissipated as heat (Horton et al. 1994; Niyogi 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>By this thermal dissipation, over 75% of absorbed photons can be eliminated (Demmig-Adams et al. 1996). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The thermal dissipation can be quantified by measuring nonphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence (NPQ) (Baker 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>NPQ is rapidly induced by excess light and is relaxed in the dark. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Energy-dependent quenching (qE), state-transition quenching (qT) and photoinhibitory quenching (qI) are three components that constitute NPQ, and each component is distinguishable based on its relaxation kinetics (reviewed in Maxwell and Johnson 2000; Müller et al. 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>There are also differences in the degree of contribution of each component to NPQ in different organisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>For instance, in some cyanobacteria, qT can be a major component of NPQ (Campbell et al. 1998), whereas others exhibit a substantial rapid component (Bailey et al. 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In higher plants, most of the NPQ is often qE (Maxwell and Johnson 2000). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>It has been previously demonstrated that a high proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane is required for qE (Briantais et al. 1979). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Induction of qE also requires zeaxanthin (Z) synthesis through antheraxanthin (A) from violaxanthin (V) by violaxanthin de-epoxidase (VDE), an enzyme that is activated by low pH in the thylakoid lumen (Yamamoto et al. 1962). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The de-epoxidation state (A + Z)/(V + A + Z), is closely correlated with NPQ (Demmig-Adams and Adams 1996), and Arabidopsis thaliana mutants affecting VDE exhibit much less qE than the wild-type (Niyogi et al. 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Molecular genetic analyses in Arabidopsis have also revealed that the PsbS (NPQ4) protein of photosystem II (PSII) is a critical factor for qE (Li et al. 2000) and that efficient qE needs specific organization of the PSII light-harvesting antenna (Kovacs et al. 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Most, if not all, of the single gene mutants in Arabidopsis that have a major effect on NPQ without impairing photosynthetic electron transport have already been identified in previous studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Thus, the next phase of genetic analysis of NPQ will require the screening and characterization of npq mutants with more subtle phenotypes, along with the identification of quantitative trait loci that affect NPQ (Jung and Niyogi 2009). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used forward and reverse genetic approaches to discover that mutations in YCF20-like genes affect thermal dissipation of excess absorbed light energy in Arabidopsis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In a forward genetic screen, we isolated a new low NPQ mutant, npq6, and then identified the NPQ6 gene as a member of the YCF20 family. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Using a reverse genetic approach, we analyzed a T-DNA insertion allele of another YCF20-like gene, which we called NPQ7 based on its mutant phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The additive phenotype of an npq6 npq7 double mutant suggests that YCF20-like proteins have overlapping functions affecting NPQ. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Genes in the YCF20 family are present not only in chloroplast genomes of algae, but also in the nucleus (or nucleomorph) of some algae (Fig. 6b, c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>In addition, YCF20-like genes are found in cyanobacteria and in the nucleus of some algae and higher plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>The broad phylogenetic distribution and genomic locations of YCF20 genes are consistent with the hypothesis that YCF20 originated in cyanobacteria and became a plastid gene in algae through primary and secondary endosymbiosis (Archibald and Keeling 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>A YCF20 gene still resides in the chloroplast of the primitive green alga Mesostigma viride (Lemieux et al. 2000), however, YCF20 genes were not found in the chloroplast genomes of Euglena gracilis (Hallick et al. 1993) and several green algae, including Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Maul et al. 2002), Chlorella vulgaris (Wakasugi et al. 1997), Nephroselmis olivacea (Turmel et al. 1999), and Ostreococcus tauri (Derelle et al. 2006), and also not in chloroplast genomes of higher plants (Martin et al. 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>This distribution suggests that multiple losses of YCF20 from the chloroplast genome have occurred in the green lineage. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>In the case of O. tauri and plants, it is clear that the YCF20 gene has relocated to the nucleus through the process of endosymbiotic gene transfer, and subsequent gene duplications in plants have resulted in multiple paralogs in the nuclear genome as found in Arabidopsis (Fig. 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the YCF20 gene appears to have been completely lost in the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Chlorella vulgaris, for which nuclear genome sequences are available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>The finding that YCF20 genes are present in both the chloroplast and nucleomorph of Guillardia theta and in both the chloroplast and nucleus of Cyanidioschyzon merolae supports the idea of gene relocation from chloroplast to nucleus, and these likely represent cases of chloroplast to nucleus gene transfers that are “in progress.” </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Despite the finding of YCF20 genes in a wide variety of cyanobacteria, algae, and plants, the function of these genes has not been previously identified experimentally. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Here, through a combination of forward and reverse genetics, we have shown that mutations in two of the three YCF20-like genes in Arabidopsis affect qE, the regulated thermal dissipation of excess absorbed light energy in photosynthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>The functions of these two genes, NPQ6 (At5g43050) and NPQ7 (At1g65420) overlap but are not simply redundant, because the single mutants are partially impaired in qE and the phenotype of the double mutant is additive (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Experiments that test whether overexpression of NPQ6 can suppress the qE defect of npq7, and vice versa, would be of help to understand the functional relationship between NPQ6 and NPQ7. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>A T-DNA knockdown mutant affecting transcript levels of the third YCF20-like gene in Arabidopsis (At3g56830) showed wild-type levels of NPQ (Fig. 8c), suggesting that this gene might have a different function from NPQ6 and NPQ7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this possibility, At3g56830 seems to diverge from other higher plant members in the clade harboring NPQ7 (Fig. 6b), and the C-terminus of the predicted At3g56830 gene product is not as highly conserved as in NPQ6 and NPQ7 (Fig. 6c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Expression of C-terminal fusions of a hemagglutinin tag to NPQ6 and NPQ7 were unable to complement the npq6 and npq7 mutations, respectively (data not shown), indicating that the C-terminal domain of these proteins might be very critical for their function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, it is possible that the At3g56830 knockdown affects the transcript level but not the protein level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Future analysis of a complete loss-of-function mutant induced by T-DNA insertion within the coding region of the At3g56830 gene might help to resolve whether or not its gene product is also involved in NPQ. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Although we have provided strong molecular genetic evidence that mutations affecting two chloroplast-localized YCF20-like proteins impair the qE component of NPQ in Arabidopsis, the exact molecular function of these proteins remains to be determined. YCF20-like genes are also found in cyanobacteria, but cyanobacteria lack pH-dependent qE and have a completely different type of rapid NPQ that involves an orange carotenoid protein and quenching of excess excitation energy in phycobilisomes (Wilson et al. 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>It is possible that the YCF20-like NPQ6 and NPQ7 proteins in Arabidopsis have evolved a new, specific function in qE that is distinct from the role of YCF20-like proteins in cyanobacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, NPQ6 and NPQ7 might have a more general role in PSII function or organization that is shared by many oxygenic photoautotrophs and that somehow affects qE when disrupted in Arabidopsis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Our molecular genetic analysis of mutants affecting NPQ6 and NPQ7 represents an important first step toward understanding the function of YCF20-like proteins, and future biochemical characterization of NPQ6 and NPQ7 in Arabidopsis along with analysis of ycf20 mutants in cyanobacteria will be necessary to elucidate the molecular details of how these proteins function in thermal dissipation and oxygenic photosynthesis. </plain></SENT>
