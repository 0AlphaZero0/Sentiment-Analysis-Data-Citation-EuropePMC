</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Helix 38 of the 23S rRNA, which includes ∼100 nucleotides, is known as the A-site finger (ASF) due to its unusual length, distinct bend, and direct interaction with the A-site tRNA (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The tip of the ASF forms part of the intersubunit bridge B1a (1), which changes dynamically during the elongation cycle of protein synthesis (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These changes go hand in hand with the ‘ratchet motion’ (2), an intersubunit rotation during mRNA–tRNA translocation that changes the ribosome conformation, in particular the constellation of subunit components lying at its periphery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the pre-translocational complex, the tip of the ASF is in contact with ribosomal protein S13 from the small subunit, while after the ratchet motion it interacts with protein S19 (3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The loop E in the 5S rRNA forms a contact with the ‘middle’ part of H38 (Figure 1A) via a symmetric A-patch composed of A-minor interactions (4).

<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The tip is missing in the atomic resolution structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Positioning of H38 from 1pny structure into 2aw4 structure was carried out based on superposition of the 1pny and 2aw4 structures. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The black and dotted boxes specify helical arms 1 and 2 while the dashed box indicates the central hinge segment which is defined as the area with the sharp bend of the backbone and the adjacent non-WC base pairs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The light yellow ellipses mark bases forming base triples in simulations (H.m. and T.t. structures have triples present already in the crystal structures). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Dashed lines represent single H-bonds and empty rectangles mark stacking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Black residue numbers indicate fragments defining the α interhelical angle while grey residue numbers indicate fragments defining the β interhelical angle (the centers of mass of the two angles coincide in the central hinge segment; see Materials and Methods for the exact numbering). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Note that the local interactions in the T.t. elbow segments are not identical in different X-ray structures (25,26) underscoring some uncertainties in the available experimental structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The pairing suggested by the X-ray T.t. structure with PDB code 1vsp is shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1057/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link> and is actually more ordered and more consistent with the base pair classification by Leontis and Westhof. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>See the legend of Table 1 for explanation of the discontinuity of nucleotide numbering in the T.t. structure. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The role of H38 in protein synthesis was investigated in several biochemical studies (5–10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Dontsonova et al. (10) observed a less efficient subunit association but basically normal functional activities of the ribosome after truncation of the ASF aimed to disrupt the intersubunit bridge B1a. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Komoda et al. (8) demonstrated that the Escherichia coli (E.c.) strain with ASF-shortened ribosomes had a normal growth rate but enhanced +1 frameshift activity, suggesting that ASF is a functional attenuator for translocation helping to maintain the reading frame. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Thus, while the ASF is perhaps not essential in the basic steps of translation, it appears to perform complex fine-tuning of the ribosomal activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Mutations affecting the H38 B1a bridge and A-site tRNA interactions caused increased ribosomal affinity for the A-site tRNA (9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Such substitutions had very variable influence on the effect of A-site-specific drugs and on the suppression of nonsense codons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The study pointed out that the mutations induce structural changes that propagate into distant rRNA regions and highlighted the roles of flexible and rigid RNA segments in this process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The authors suggested the presence of an arc of unpaired ‘hinge bases’ facilitating information exchange among functional centers of the ribosome (9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>It was also shown that depletion of pseuduridines of H38 of eukaryotic (yeast) ribosomes results in a wide range of adverse effects including substantially reduced cell growth and translational activity (6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Another mutational study provided evidence that H38 may play an important role in the process of assembling of the large ribosomal subunit (7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>A comparison of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps of the ribosome determined at different stages of translation provides unique information about conformational substates and, by inference, ribosome dynamics (3,11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Among positional changes of functionally significant ribosomal segments uncovered were those of H38. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Structurally, H38 includes an elbow segment at the base of H38 which sharply changes the direction of H38 toward the small subunit (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The largest changes of H38 so far observed are associated with the ratcheting motion (2), characterized by a rotation of the small relative to the large subunit, which has been observed in a number of ribosomal complexes bound with various factors, including elongation factor G (EF-G), release factor, and recycling factor (12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>We use the terms macrostate I and II to denote the two conformational states of the ribosome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>In the macrostate I → II transition, numerous ribosomal elements undergo local conformational changes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Helix 38 of the 23S rRNA is one of these dynamically changing sub-components, showing a quite noticeably different position when going from macrostate I to II (2,13,14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The displacement is most obvious at the tip of H38, which slides along with the head of the 30S subunit as the subunit rotates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The high mobility of the tip segment renders the tip invisible in structure determination of the 70S ribosome by X-ray studies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The elbow segment in the ribosome of Haloarcula marismortui (H.m.) (15), an archaebacterium, is known as a kink-turn (Kt-38), a motif recurrently found in the ribosomal RNAs (16,17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Previously we have investigated kink-turns using explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (18–22). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The simulations revealed that the kink-turns behave as flexible and directional molecular elbows and it was therefore suggested that Kt-38 can bestow the functionally required flexibility to the ASF (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>However, Kt-38 is present only in the ribosome of archaea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The elbow segments of H38 in eubacterial 50S subunits of E.c. (23), Deinoccocus radiodurans (D.r.) (24), and Thermus thermophilus (T.t.) (25,26) are formed with different nucleotides, with diverse base pairing and stacking (Figure 1C–E), resulting nevertheless in a Kt-38-like overall topology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>When considering sequence and secondary structures, the four H38 elbow segments appear entirely unrelated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the C-loop, another motif in H38, is conserved across all three kingdoms (16). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>In the present study we utilize MD simulations to analyze the intrinsic dynamics and flexibility of the elbow segments of the H38 in eubacterial 50S subunits of E.c., T.t. and D.r. along with Kt-38 of H.m. (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The dynamics of the elbow segments are simulated in the context of extended helical arms of H38 predominantly composed of canonical base pairs (Figure 1B–E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The aim was to characterize their intrinsic stochastic fluctuations that may be important for the function of the ribosome (27–31) and can be studied by explicit solvent MD simulations (32). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Despite being limited by force field approximations and the short (∼10–100+ ns) simulation timescale, MD simulations are instrumental in structural studies of RNAs (19,33–43). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The dynamical information conveniently complements the structural picture provided by experiments (32,44,45). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>We also have reanalyzed the earlier cryo-EM maps of the E.c. ribosome (14) by deriving atomic models via flexible fitting of cryo-EM maps using real-space refinement (see below), to better visualize the H38 dynamics (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The results show a movement of 10 Å between the positions of the H38’s tip (Figure 2F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Due to the considerable length of the helix, this movement is consistent with a relatively small motion at the H38 base [see also discussion in (19)], despite that such motion is obviously far below the experimental resolution.

<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>All cryo-EM density maps are shown as transparency. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>The simulations reveal large thermal fluctuations while the simulated structures do not systematically deviate from the X-ray structures (i.e. they keep vast majority of those molecular interactions that are present in the starting structures; see specific analysis for the individual systems below). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>As expected, the range of instantaneous geometries seen in unrestrained simulations of the isolated H38 elbow segments is considerably larger than the range of substates seen in (or suggested by) experimental structures, which occur in a fully assembled ribosome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>In addition, all experimental structures represent averages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>However, the preferred direction of thermal fluctuations in simulations, which reflects the intrinsic flexibility of the studied RNA segment, is consistent with the direction inferred by comparison of experimental maps. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Despite the apparent lack of any sequence and secondary structure conservation, all four studied H38 elbow segments show qualitatively similar hinge-like (open versus closed) dynamics resembling those of the kink-turn. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Therefore, within the assembled ribosome, all these four very diverse sequences form structures that show a substantial degree of topological and dynamical (flexibility) equivalence, which may be of functional importance (46). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Kink-turns are flexible hinge-like RNA building blocks that can passively mediate large-scale RNA motions (18,19,21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>Thus, flexibility conferred by Kt-38 may contribute to the overall dynamics of H38. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>However, while Kt-38 occurs in Archaea it is not conserved in Eubacteria and Eucarya (16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>X-ray structures of eubacterial large ribosomal subunits [E.c. (23), D.r. (24) and T.t. (25,26)] show, at the position equivalent to Kt-38 of H.m., similarly bent RNA structures with very diverse sequences and local interactions (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Despite this, Kt-38 and the equivalent eubacterial regions are V-shaped molecules with very similar fold resulting in similar positioning of the attached arms (Figure 4). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Proper interpretation of the results requires consideration of several points. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>1) We simulate rRNA segments starting from their experimental ribosomal structures affected by surrounding ribosomal elements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>2) As exemplified by the differences between the two T.t. experimental structures, the lower resolution of the ribosomal X-ray structures causes uncertainties in the local arrangements in the starting structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>These affect the development of subsequent simulations and, e.g. 65 ns simulation time scale was not sufficient to resolve the local differences of the two starting T.t. structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>3) The H38 elbow segments would adopt different secondary (2D) and tertiary (3D) structures outside the context of the folded ribosome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Actually, comparative analysis of T.t. 23S rRNA (72) carried out prior to the X-ray structure studies proposed an entirely different 2D model of the H38 elbow segment where all bases were well paired. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Isolated kink-turns unfold in solution (73–77). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>However, the time-scale of the simulations is too short to investigate any such unfolding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>The simulations, on the other hand, give extensive insights into the intrinsic stochastic fluctuations and flexibility associated with the functional geometry occurring in the ribosome, irrespective of whether the system is in the global or just a local minimum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>The E.c. and H.m. systems did not show any sign of unfolding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>The D.r. and one of the T.t. simulations revealed more substantial opening oscillations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>The MD_Tt_2 trajectory is capable of temporarily reaching basically straight geometries, however, the simulated molecule then returns back quite close to the initial structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>Thus, the bent H38 elbow segment geometries correspond to rather robust local minima separated by energy barriers from potential other conformations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>RNA segments that are just trivially compressed or bent like a spring would relax in simulations within ∼1–5 ns (21,39). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>In summary, the simulations qualitatively describe the intrinsic flexibility of the H38 elbow segments relevant to their folded functional geometries. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>The simulations were carried out in presence of a net-neutralizing set of Na+ ions as well as with ∼0.2 M excess KCl salt. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Both ionic conditions lead to very similar simulation behavior on the present time scale. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>Net neutralization by monovalent ions (mostly Na+) is the most common treatment of ionic effects in MD simulations of nucleic acids, which provides fairly sufficient concentration of cations of ∼0.15–0.2 M. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>Basic correctness of this approach at the presently affordable simulation time scale (10 ns – 1 µs) has been verified in many long reference simulations of nucleic acids (18–21,32,36,39,78–84). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>The net-neutralizing monovalent ion atmosphere achieves satisfactory sampling in 20–50+ ns scale simulations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>Main ion binding sites are localized usually within ∼1–2 ns even when not been occupied initially while the ions smoothly exchange between the ion binding sites and the bulk solvent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>Details of ion dynamics are documented in the literature for a broad set of ion binding sites around folded RNAs (see also <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1057/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> in these studies) (20,33,85–88). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>Despite the basic equivalence of the Na+ and KCl simulation results we do not suggest that the Na+ and KCl environments are identical when considering specific local cation–solute interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>As well, we do not suggest that the simulation description is perfect, as there are limitations imposed by the simulation protocol, such as periodicity and finite box size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>However, in our particular study we are looking at the overall salient direction of the movements rather than details of specific conformations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>Such studies are considerably less sensitive to the limitations imposed by the force field and starting structures than analyses of small structural details. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>The flexibilities of RNA segments stem from the intrinsic mechanics of the solute; therefore, their insensitivity to the choice of ion atmosphere is not surprising. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>Note also that, in simulations, the accuracy of ion treatment is for all currently available ion parameter sets primarily affected by the common pair-additive force field approximation, which neglects polarization effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>This leads to some discrepancies in the ion–solvent–solute balance, such as an underestimation of the cation–solute direct interaction energy and excessive short-range repulsion between the cations and solute atoms (32,89). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>The Aqvist’s cation parameters (51) that we used in net-neutralization Na+ simulations were recently criticized as producing salt-crystalization artifacts in excess-salt simulations (specifically for KCl) (90). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>However, this problem is rather caused by imbalance of adapted Aqvist’s cation parameters combined with inconsistent anion parameters and does not indicate any substantial bias in net-neutralizing simulations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Thus the Na+ Aqvist’s parameters remain a valid option for net-neutralizing simulations and may actually have a subtly better balance for cation–solute inner-shell interactions than some other parametrizations (91). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>For excess salt KCl simulations we used one of the recent parameter sets that does not lead to salt clustering (52). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>The presented results do not depend on the choice of the ion atmosphere, at least within the range of available force fields. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>All simulated rRNA segments are characterized by surprisingly similar stochastic fluctuations and thus internal flexibility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>The kink-turn shows substantial hinge-like fluctuation dynamics (19,20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>Very similar overall hinge-like dynamics was detected in simulations of the equivalent regions of the three eubacterial species, which thus can be considered as dynamical equivalents of Kt-38. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>In other words, while Kt-38 is not conserved, it is in all three cases replaced by RNA building blocks possessing qualitatively the same directional flexibility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>This flexibility signature is thus conserved during the evolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>If Kt-38 is involved in large-scale dynamical movements of H38, as suggested earlier (19), then all three Kt-38 replacements would be equally fit to support similar motion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>Obviously, the oscillations seen in different simulations are not identical. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>As explained above, the present study faces several limitations which do not allow us to achieve a quantitative accuracy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>However, taking into account the entire diversity of the sequences forming the H38 elbow regions, it is justified to conclude that all simulated systems show surprisingly similar thermal fluctuations, especially regarding the preferred direction of motions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>The movement was roughly visualized by α and β angles describing fluctuations of the central hinge segment and of the whole system including the extended helical arms, respectively. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>Thus, the arms add additional flexibility (due to bending and groove breathing) which enhances the hinge-like dynamics stemming from the flexibility of the central hinge segment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>The dynamics was also captured using essential dynamics analysis and clustering methods. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed the internal structural dynamics of all four simulated segments at the level of individual molecular interactions (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1057/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>However, each simulated segment achieves its flexibility in a different manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>For the Kt-38, we see the common dynamics of kink-turns having A-minor I interaction (18–21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>In the E.c., D.r. and T.t. H38 elbow segments, the hinge-like dynamics is coupled with flexibility of H-bonds formed in the central hinge segment and with fluctuations of major groove widths. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>The motions are rather complex and we did not find a unifying picture of local movements in these four equivalently positioned, identically shaped, but otherwise very diverse flexible RNA segments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>Despite this diversity, they have similar effects on the mutual fluctuations of the attached helical arms of H38. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>Perhaps, a substantial contribution to the flexibility could stem from their overall V-like topology; i.e., it could be a rather common feature of V-shaped RNAs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>We have compared the geometries of the E.c. H38 elbow segment sampled in the simulation with H38 structures seen in E.c. X-ray 70S vacant ribosome structure (23) and in cryo-EM studies (Figures 2, 3 and 6, Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>Specifically, we carried out a new real-space refinement fitting of the H38 positions in post-translocational state (non-ratcheted; EMDB Access Code: 1056) and the EF-G-GDPNP-bound state (ratcheting; EMDB Access Code: 1363) E.c. ribosomes, where the segmentation now divides the whole H38 into 8 rigid pieces (Figure 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>Although structural changes localized at the elbow region are entirely below the ∼10-Å resolution of the experimental method, the refinement gives the impression that the movement propagates along the ASF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the overall shape of the ASF and direction of preferred flexibility of the H38 elbow regions derived from the simulation mean that a change of the β angle in the H38 elbow region by 6° would be entirely sufficient to give the experimentally observed large relocation of the tip of the ASF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>Obviously, the cryo-EM technique visualizes ensemble averages of structures in a finite range of conformations, so the actual range of dynamic motions may be considerably larger than what we infer from a comparison of two maps. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>The direction of fluctuations seen in the simulations is consistent with the experimental geometries (Figures 2 and 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>As noted above, the limitations of the theoretical and experimental data as well as the overall complexity of the ribosome do not allow us to make more quantitative comparison between theory and experiment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, considering all the results together leads us to suggest that the intrinsic flexibility of the H38 elbow region, as characterized by MD simulations, may indeed facilitate a substantial part of the functional movements of the ASF. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>The suggestion emerging from mutational studies, cryo-EM and our MD simulations is that the H.m. kink-turn 38 and its equivalents in eubacteria species are passive elbow-like elements that, due to their strategic position at the back of the subunit, allow smooth large-scale fluctuations and swift barrier-free repositioning of the whole ASF, particularly affecting the tip area and the 5S rRNA contact area. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>These movements could allow a range of back and forth dynamics, up and down dynamics, and their combination (Figure 8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>For example, changing the elbow angle by 6° would result in more than 10 Å positional shifts of the ASF tip, provided the motion fully propagates along the 100-Å path of a stiff H38 (Figures 2, 6 and 8) (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>This idea is consistent with the role of the ASF in the attenuation of translocation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="343" pm="."><plain>Attenuation probably includes slowing down the tRNA movement and—considering the alternate B1a bridging contacts of its tip with S13 and S19 (3)—participation in a molecular ruler that establishes two preferred ratchet orientations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>The idea is also consistent with the proposed involvement of H38 in complex dynamical allosteric signaling between ribosomal functional centers involving the dynamics of 5S rRNA (9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>The large flexibility (floppiness) of the H38 elbows suggests that they are unlikely to be spring-like elements. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="352" pm="."><plain>This A-minor-I interaction appears to not be involved in any tertiary contacts with other parts of the ribosome. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="364" pm="."><plain>However, the flexibility would be modestly modified, as predicted by simulations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="365" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, all the elbows are intrinsically very flexible (see the simulation behavior) and thus can extensively structurally adapt to the surrounding elements with no energy costs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="366" pm="."><plain>The flexibility can facilitate the H38 swaps compared to what one would guess based on superposition of the static averaged X-ray structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="367" pm="."><plain>Note that changes in the elbow region may affect not only the ASF tip, but also its dynamical interaction with 5S rRNA and the overall dynamical allosteric signaling between ribosomal functional centers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="368" pm="."><plain>Therefore, modifications of the elbow region may provide interesting clues regarding the ribosome dynamics. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="369" pm="."><plain>Finally, one could also attempt to rigidify the H38 elbow segment, simply by substituting sequences that would be prone to form standard Watson–Crick (WC) (especially GC) base pairs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="370" pm="."><plain>However, this could not only interfere with the H38 elbow flexibility, but could perhaps ultimately disrupt folding of the large subunit, specifically the interaction between 23S rRNA and 5S rRNA of the central protuberance. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="371" pm="."><plain>Obviously, it is also important to take into account the tertiary contacts of H38, which may impose static constraints on the ribosome components. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="372" pm="."><plain>A brief analysis of H38 elbow contacts is given in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1057/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link>. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="373" pm="."><plain>The H38 elbows are basically free of such contacts and the elbow is rather exposed on the surface of the subunit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="374" pm="."><plain>The proximal attached helical arms are involved in some tertiary interactions, for example helical arm 1 of E.c. H38 elbow makes contact with H36 while helical arm 2 makes contacts with ribosomal proteins L30 and L27. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="375" pm="."><plain>Similar contacts can be seen for other species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="376" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, it still is one of the least crowded areas of the ribosome and therefore functional fluctuations can be expected to occur in this region. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="377" pm="."><plain>Motions of H38 should be coupled with 5S rRNA dynamics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="378" pm="."><plain>Mutational studies indicate that 5S rRNA mediates allosteric transmission of information from the decoding center via the B1a/B1b bridges to the elongation factor binding site (92). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="379" pm="."><plain>This again agrees with the previous real-space fitting results (67) which show that 5S rRNA moves approximately in a range from 2 to 5 Å (Figure 5 on page 796 in that paper). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="380" pm="."><plain>Thus, when considering the allosteric role of 5S rRNA movements, the flexibility of the H38 elbow region must be of high functional importance. </plain></SENT>
