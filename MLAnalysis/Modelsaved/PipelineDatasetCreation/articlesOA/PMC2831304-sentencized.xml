</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Various strategies have been used to integrate foreign DNA into the genomes of model and other organisms, including homologous recombination, site-specific recombination and double-strand break repair following site-specific DNA cleavage by engineered nucleases (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These strategies integrate the foreign DNA into specific locations in the host genome, but can suffer from low efficiency or a lack of suitable integration sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In contrast, transposon and retroviral integration systems act with high efficiency (2,3), but suffer from a lack of control over the site of integration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Integration at inappropriate genomic locations can lead to activation or inactivation of important host genes with severe deleterious consequences (4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, insertion into regions of heterochromatin can lead to poor expression of the foreign DNA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Members of the Tc1/mariner family of transposable elements are widespread in nature, being found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Naturally occurring active elements from the Tc1/mariner family include Mos1 mariner from Drosophila mauritiana (6), Tc1 and Tc3 from Caenorhabditis elegans (7,8), and ISY100 (ISTcSa) from Synechocystis sp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>PCC6803 (9,10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Other active elements, such as Sleeping Beauty and Himar1 have been reconstructed from the sequences of multiple inactive copies present in the genomes of fish and insects, respectively (11,12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Transposons from the Tc1/mariner family are highly active in cultured cells and model organisms, and there is much interest in their use as vectors for gene delivery (13). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>One transposon from the Tc1/mariner family, the Synechochystis transposon ISY100, transposes efficiently both in vitro, and in vivo in Escherichia coli (9,10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>ISY100 has a simple structure, consisting of a single transposase gene flanked by 24 bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats (IRs) that mark the transposon ends. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Like other members of this family, ISY100 transposase has an N-terminal DNA-binding domain that specifically recognizes the transposon IRs, and a C-terminal DDE domain that catalyses the cutting and rejoining reactions involved in transposition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Transposition occurs by a cut and paste mechanism in which the transposon is cut from one site in the genome by double-strand breaks at both transposon ends, and then inserted into a new target site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Transposition is exclusively into TA dinucleotides, and insertions are flanked by duplications of this target TA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Previous work has had some success in modifying the target specificity of retroviral integrases and eukaryotic transposases, by directly or indirectly tethering the transposase to specific sites in the DNA using sequence-specific DNA-binding domains (14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In most of these studies, multiple binding sites for the DNA-binding domain were required, and integration was observed in a relatively large stretch of DNA around the specific binding site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigate the properties of a ‘Z-transposase’ made by fusing the zinc-finger DNA-binding domain from the mouse transcription factor Zif268 to the C-terminus of ISY100 transposase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>We find that this fusion protein combines the TA target-specificity of the Tc1/mariner family of transposases with the DNA-binding specificity of Zif268 and promotes transposition in specific TAs located adjacent to a single Zif268 binding site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The target specificity of our Z-transposase can be changed by substituting the Zif268 DNA-binding with variants that specifically recognize sequences from the HIV-1 promoter. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>The sequences of 21 ISY100 insertion sites from the Synechocystis PCC6803 genome (19), three from the large Synechocystis plasmids pSYSG and pSYSA (20), 19 insertion sites from the work of Urasaki et al.

<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>A structure-based sequence alignment of Mos1, SB and ISY100 transposases shows that while SB and Mos1 have similar C-termini, ISY100 lacks a C-terminal α-helical region of 32 amino acids present in Mos1 (10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Fusion of a protein domain to the C-terminus of ISY100 transposase therefore seems much less likely to interfere with DNA binding and dimerization of ISY100 transposase (Figure 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>We did not attempt to fuse a DNA-binding domain to the N-terminus of ISY100 transposase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>However, because the N-terminus is further from the catalytic target-binding domain of transposase than the C-terminus, it seems likely that an N-terminal fusion would not target transposition as specifically as the C-terminal fusion studied here. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Targeted transposition required linker L3, consisting of residues 141–185 of Tn3 resolvase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>These residues form an autonomously folding three-helix DNA-binding domain that binds specifically to the sequence TGTCCG (44,45). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>However, this sequence is not present in the ISY100 IRs or in any of the target sequences used in our experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Molecular modelling of target capture complexes formed by Z-transposase suggest that the linker between the C-terminus of transposase and the N-terminus of the Zif268 DNA-binding domain will have to stretch 30–60 Å to allow transposase to reach target TAs 7–17 bp from the Zif268 binding site (Figure 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Linker L3 could stretch ∼50 Å if the Tn3 resolvase DNA-binding domain remains folded and we propose that this linker is required simply to stretch the long distances required. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Consistent with our results, molecular modelling also suggests that steric clashes between Zif268 and transposase will prevent integration at TAs closer than about 6 bp from the Zif268 binding site, and that linker L3 will have to stretch right round the DNA helix in the poorly favoured pZ+11pap target plasmid. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>L3 Z-transposase carried out a background level of transposition at sites outside the [TANN]9 array, in plasmids both with or without the Zif268 binding site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>This was most likely catalysed by Z-transposase molecules interacting with target sites using solely the target binding activity of the transposase catalytic domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the transposase target-binding region, that render transposase unable to bind target DNA without assistance from the zinc-finger DNA-binding domain, might abolish this undesirable off-target transposition. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>We describe here a papillation assay that reports the level of targeted transposition by Z-transposase into a specific TA in a single bacterial colony. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>This assay could be used to select Z-transposase mutants with increased levels of targeted transposition, and could be combined with an assay to select for loss of ‘off-target’ transposition to obtain Z-transposase mutants with increased targeting specificity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>The overall activity of Z-transposase might also be increased by the incorporation of ‘hyperactivity’ mutations, identified in wild-type transposase using an assay for untargeted transposition. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>To be useful for gene delivery in eukaryotic systems, a targeted transposition system must be capable of delivering its cargo to a single site in a genome of over 109 bp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>A 9 bp zinc-finger binding site is insufficient to specify a unique site in a genome of this size, but two 9 bp binding sites should suffice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>We have observed efficient transposition into a TA located between two Zif268 binding sites in IR (Figure 4C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>From the dimeric structure of transposase, it should be possible to select Z-transposase variants that are dependent on zinc-finger-mediated binding to a pair of appropriately spaced sequence motifs for the assembly of an active dimer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>By changing the recognition helices of the zinc-finger domains, these Z-transposases could be designed to target many different chosen single sites in a large eukaryotic genome. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Z-transposase with the wild-type Zif268 domain gave a higher level of targeted transposition than those with Zif268 domains selected to bind to sequences from the HIV-1 promoter (Figure 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>One possible explanation for this is that wild-type Zif268 domain binds to its site with a higher affinity than either ZifA or ZifB variants (18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Therefore, another approach to increasing the specificity and efficiency of targeted transposition might be to use longer, tighter binding zinc-finger proteins, such as the synthetic polydactyl zinc-finger protein E2C. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>This DNA-binding domain contains six zinc-finger domains and binds with high affinity and specificity to an 18 bp sequence that occurs just once in the human genome (46). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>We have yet to show that ISY100 transposase will function in eukaryotic cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, there is a reasonable possibility that ISY100 transposase (or activated mutants thereof) will function in eukaryotes because: (i) ISY100 transposition requires no host specific proteins, (ii) other members of the same family (such as Minos, SB and derivatives of Himar1) work efficiently in vertebrate cells (47) and (iii) other bacterial recombinases, such as Cre and ϕC31 integrase, work efficiently in eukaryotic cells and have found many useful applications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>Even if ISY100 derived Z-transposases do not function in eukaryotic cells, the lessons learned from them using our tractable genetic and biochemical techniques should be applicable to other related systems. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>With 50% of insertions in a 20 bp region adjacent to the Zif268 binding site, and up to 70% of these in a single TA dinucleotide, our ISY100 Z-transposase is one of the most specifically targeted transposition systems developed to date. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>The specificity of targeting can be altered using zinc-finger DNA-binding domains that have been selected to bind to different DNA sequences, and we believe that this system holds great promise for the development of a precisely targeted integration system that will be useful for a number of applications. </plain></SENT>
