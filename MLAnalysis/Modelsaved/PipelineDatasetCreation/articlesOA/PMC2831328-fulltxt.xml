These enzymes are RNA-stimulated ATPases that translocate on RNA and unwind or remodel structured RNA in an ATP-dependent fashion. How ATP and the ATPase cycle fuel the work performed by helicases is not completely clear. The hepatitis C virus RNA helicase, NS3, is an important model system for this class of enzymes. NS3 binding to a single-/double-strand RNA or DNA junction leads to ATP-independent melting of the duplex and formation of a complex capable of ATP-dependent unwinding by using a spring-loaded mechanism. We have established an RNA substrate for NS3 that can be unwound in a single sub-step. Our studies are consistent with a model in which a single ATP binding and/or hydrolysis event sets the unwinding spring and phosphate dissociation contributes to release of the spring, thereby driving the power stroke used for unwinding.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>RNA helicases function in myriad aspects of RNA metabolism in the cell, and new functions continue to emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Viruses also encode RNA helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The RNA helicase encoded by hepatitis C virus (HCV), non-structural protein 3 (NS3), is a DExH-box protein that belongs to helicase superfamily 2 (SF2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Unlike most DExH-box proteins, NS3 is also a DNA helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Although HCV NS3 RNA helicase activity is essential for virus viability, the precise role of the RNA helicase activity in the multiplication cycle is not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p><p>HCV NS3 has emerged as an important model system for studies of the kinetics and mechanism of SF2 RNA helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 B8 B9">3&#8211;9</xref>). NS3 binds to its nucleic acid substrate in multiple forms: monomer, dimer, oligomer, depending on the length of the single-stranded overhang used for NS3 loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). After formation of the NS3-nucleic acid complex, a slow isomerization of this complex occurs that activates the complex for unwinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). It has recently been suggested that this isomerization may reflect an ATP-independent, local melting of the duplex region targeted for ATP-dependent unwinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). NS3 has been proposed to use both passive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) mechanisms for unwinding. It is possible that a passive mechanism is used prior to formation of the activated complex and an active mechanism used thereafter.</p><p>Addition of ATP to a reaction containing activated complexes leads to multiple cycles of unwinding and pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The number of cycles of unwinding and pausing per binding event is dependent on the NS3 oligomeric state, with monomers being the least processive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The kinetic and physical step size for NS3 is 11&#8211;18 bp, again depending on the oligomeric state. This &#8216;super&#8217; step of unwinding occurs in sub-steps of 3 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), and each sub-step is thought to occur in three, 1-bp sub-sub-steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Whether or not the ATPase cycle couples to a sub-step or a sub-sub-step needs to be clarified.</p><p>How the ATPase cycle couples to unwinding is not completely clear for any helicase but clearly represents an important frontier for helicase enzymology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The realization that NS3 employs an active mechanism for unwinding suggested that this system might also be used to address this question. We reasoned that if an unwinding substrate could be produced that required no greater than one, 3-bp sub-step for unwinding to occur, then correlations between the ATPase cycle and unwinding might be possible.</p><p>We show that an RNA substrate containing a 20-nt single-stranded loading strand and a 9-bp duplex can be unwound in a single sub-step. Importantly, the rate constant for unwinding was equivalent to the rate constant for phosphate release during the ATPase cycle. This study provides the first, direct link between a step in the ATPase cycle and unwinding by an RNA helicase, and sets the stage for elucidation of the mechanochemical coupling mechanism employed by RNA helicases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>All RNA oligonucleotides were from Dharmacon Research, Inc.; All DNA oligonucleotides were from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.; [&#947;-<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP (7000 Ci/mmol) was from MP Biomedical; [&#945;-<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was from Perkin Elmer; T4 polynucleotide kinase was from USB; ATP was from GE Healthcare; N-[2-(1-Maleimidyl)ethyl]-7-(diethylamino)coumarin-3-carboxamide (MDCC) was from Invitrogen; AMPPNP, 7-methylguanosine and purine nucleoside phosphorylase were from Sigma; all other reagents were of the highest grade available from Sigma, Fisher or VWR.</p></sec><sec><title>Purification and 5&#8242;-<sup>32</sup>P-labeling of RNA oligonucleotides</title><p>RNA oligonucleotides were purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and end-labeled by using [&#947;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and are described in the &#8216;Materials and Methods&#8217; section provided in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1118/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link>.

A 20-nt loading strand may be sufficient to accommodate binding of an NS3 dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). However, the oligomeric status of NS3 does not alter the transactions occurring at the single-(ss)/double-strand (ds) junction, the site of unwinding, only NS3 processivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Both the kinetic and physical step size for unwinding of ds nucleic acid by NS3 ranges from 11 bp for a monomer to 18 bp for a dimer, with the 11&#8211;18 bp step being comprised of multiple 3-bp sub-steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). After binding, NS3 may melt as many as 5 bp of the duplex region located at the ss/ds junction of a substrate for unwinding in an ATP-independent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Continued unwinding would require ATP consumption.</p><p>Taking all of this information into account, we designed a substrate for NS3 unwinding that could potentially be unwound in a single 3-bp sub-step. This advance would permit ensemble experiments to be used to relate events occurring during the unwinding sub-step to events of the ATPase cycle occurring concurrently. The substrate is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>a. We refer to this substrate as ds9-C20. The substrate contains a 9-bp duplex (ds9) and 20-nt 3&#8242;-overhang comprised of 20 cytidylate residues (C20). The 20-nt overhang should permit a monomer or dimer to be accommodated, depending upon the stoichiometry of NS3 to ds9-C20 substrate. Melting of 3 bp of the 9-bp duplex followed by a 3-bp substep would leave 3 bp annealed that should spontaneously melt at 37&#176;C, leading to release of the 9-nt &#8216;displaced&#8217; strand.

This experiment was performed by using fluorescence polarization. A ds9-C20 substrate was prepared that contained a fluorescein (FL) molecule on the 3&#8242; end of the loading strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>a). We refer to the FL-labeled substrate as ds9-C20-FL. Placing the FL molecule at any position of the duplex region of the substrate altered binding affinity. We titrated NS3 (at least 0.2&#8211;5 Kd) into binding buffer containing ds9-C20-FL (0.1 nM). The change in fluorescence polarization (<italic>mP</italic>) was plotted as a function of NS3 concentration, and the data were fit to the appropriate model, generally a hyperbola as described in &#8216;Materials and Methods&#8217; section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>b). The time of incubation was varied (1 or 10 min) prior to recording the <italic>mP</italic> values because of reports of a slow assembly of a functional NS3-RNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The value for the equilibrium dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) of the NS3&#183;ds9-C20 complex was in the 40&#8211;50 nM range and was not impacted substantially by the incubation time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>c).</p><p>It has been shown that ATP weakens the interaction between NS3 and nucleic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>c, in the presence of 5 mM ATP, the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value for the NS3&#183;ds9-C20 complex increased by as much as 7-fold relative to the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value determined in the absence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>c). During this experiment, the duplex was not unwound (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1118/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1a</ext-link>); ATP was not completely consumed (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1118/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1c</ext-link>), and ADP had a modest effect on the Kd value for the NS3&#183;ds9-C20 complex relative to ATP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1118/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1b and S1d</ext-link>). The inability to observe ds9-C20 unwinding under these conditions may reflect a small proportion of NS3 being located at the ss/ds junction.</p><p>It was possible that the observed increase in the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value for the NS3&#183;ds9-C20 complex was due to ATP hydrolysis. We performed three experiments to test this possibility. First, we used the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue, AMPPNP. We observed a 5-fold increase in the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value for the NS3&#183;ds9-C20 complex, suggesting that ATP binding is sufficient to reduce the affinity of NS3 for ds9-C20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>c). Second, we used an NS3 derivative that lacks ATPase activity due to a substitution of alanine for aspartic acid at position 290 (D290A NS3). Asp-290 is located in conserved sequence motif II (DExH) and interacts with the divalent cation cofactor and perhaps the water nucleophile in the triphosphate-binding pocket/catalytic center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Again, ATP and AMPPNP increased the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value for the NS3-D290A&#183;ds9-C20 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>c). However, the extent of destabilization was 2-fold for NS3-D290A instead of 7-fold as observed for wild-type NS3. Finally, we performed these experiments in the presence of EDTA and observed destabilization of ds9-C20 binding to NS3 by ATP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1118/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1b</ext-link>). We conclude that ATP binding to the ATPase catalytic site causes changes in NS3 that lead to the observed destabilization of the NS3&#183;ds9-C20 complex.</p></sec><sec><title>NS3 equilibrates at the ss/ds junction of ds9-C20 in the presence of ATP</title><p>In order to get a sense for where NS3 interacts with the ds9-C20 substrate, we determined the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value for NS3 in complex with ds9 or C20. The C20-binding experiment was performed with a FL-labeled oligonucleotide as described earlier. However, the ds9-binding experiment had to be performed by using a competition format (&#8216;Materials and Methods&#8217; section and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>d) because of position-dependent changes in the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value measured for different versions of ds9-FL.</p><p>In the absence of ATP, the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values for complexes of NS3 with ds9 and C20 were within 2-fold of the value measured for ds9-C20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>d). Therefore, the position of NS3 relative to the junction will be heterogeneous under conditions in which ds9-C20 is in excess of NS3. NS3 will completely coat ds9-C20 under conditions in which NS3 is in excess of ds9-C20.</p><p>In contrast, in the presence of ATP, the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value for the NS3&#183;ds9 and NS3&#183; C20 complexes increased by 133- and 50-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>d). Under the same conditions, the NS3&#183;ds9-C20 complex was only destabilized by 7-fold. Therefore, in the presence of ATP, NS3 may bind preferentially to the ss/ds junction. Identical results were observed in the presence of EDTA.</p></sec><sec><title>Binding of ds9-C20 to NS3 weakens ATP binding</title><p>In order to complete the analysis of the thermodynamics of substrate binding to NS3, we evaluated binding of ATP to NS3 by monitoring the quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of NS3 (&#8216;Materials and Methods&#8217; section).

Products were resolved from substrate by using native gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>a). We chose an NS3 concentration of 2 &#956;M because this concentration should lead to incorporation of at least 90% of the ds9-C20 RNA into a complex with NS3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>c) that is located at the ss/ds junction in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>c and d). A 10-min incubation was sufficient to assemble active complexes on the ds9-C20 substrate, suggesting that the kinetics of formation of an unwinding-competent, NS3-RNA complex is dependent on the RNA substrate employed.

These &#8216;tailed&#8217; substrates should mimic a pre-melted duplex and might lead to faster activation and/or a greater yield of activated complexes, both of which might now exhibit temperature independence. The affinity of NS3 for all of these substrates was on par with the ds9-C20 substrate, and the affinity was modulated by ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>b). However, neither the rate constant for activation nor the amount of activated complex was impacted by addition of the adenylate tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>c).

These data suggest that release of ADP and/or Pi is rate limiting in the steady state. Given a burst amplitude of &#8764;0.3 &#956;M, only 15% of the NS3&#183;ds9-C20 complexes were competent for fast hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>a), which could reflect the fraction of complexes to which ATP was bound at 10 &#956;M ATP. This possibility was ruled out by the observation that a 50% reduction in the concentration of ATP employed failed to reduce the amplitude by 50%, only the observed rate constant for hydrolysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1118/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4</ext-link>). We conclude that the amplitude reflects the concentration of complexes competent for ATP hydrolysis under these conditions. We used this amplitude to calculate a steady-state rate constant; a value of 4 s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> was obtained. This value is equivalent to that measured for the fast phase of unwinding by NS3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>b). Interestingly, the burst of ATP hydrolysis was not observed in the absence of RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>a). The steady-state rate was the same in the presence and absence of RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>a); however, this fact provides no mechanistic insight and could be merely coincidental.</p><p>These data provide a compelling correlation between the rate-limiting step of unwinding and a product-release step of the ATPase cycle.

Pi binding to a PBP modified with a coumarin-based fluorescent probe leads to a fluorescence change, the kinetics of which can be monitored in a stopped-flow apparatus (&#8216;Materials and Methods&#8217; section). The labeled PBP is referred to as MDCC-PBP.</p><p>We combined NS3 (2 &#956;M) with dc9-C20 (20 &#956;M) in a syringe that was maintained at 37&#176;C. In a second syringe, we combined ATP (10 mM) and MDCC-PBP (2 &#956;M). MDCC-PBP preparations generally contained 50% unlabeled protein (&#8216;Materials and Methods&#8217; section). We included 7-methylguanosine and purine nucleoside phosphorylase as a &#8216;sponge&#8217; for Pi in both syringes to minimize background and maximize the observed fluorescence change. The use of MDCC-PBP at a concentration sub-stoichiometric to NS3 was to ensure that we monitored only one round of Pi release, permitting the rate constant to be determined by a single exponential fit of the data. Upon mixing, an exponential increase in fluorescence was observed that fit nicely to a single exponential rise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>b). The observed rate constant was 5.3 &#177; 0.6 s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, a value within error of both the steady-state rate constant for the ATPase cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>a) and the fast rate constant for ds9-C20 unwinding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>b). Reduction of the MDCC-PBP concentration to 1 &#956;M did not cause a significant change in the observed rate constant for Pi release. When MDCC-PBP was present in excess, a linear change in fluorescence was observed from which calculation of a rate constant proved too unreliable. We conclude that Pi release is the rate-limiting step for the ATPase cycle of the NS3&#183;ds9-C20 complex. From these experiments, it is clear that ADP release cannot occur slower than Pi release. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that product release is random with both ADP and Pi release occurring at the same rate. Also, we cannot formally exclude the possibility that steps after ADP/Pi dissociation, such as binding of a second ATP molecule, do not contribute to the observed unwinding.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>RNA helicases use chemical energy stored in the phosphoanhydride bond of ATP to perform mechanical work of RNA unwinding. How this happens is not clear. It is now known that despite an apparent large kinetic and physical step size for the NS3 helicase, unwinding requires sub-steps and perhaps sub-sub-steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The smallest step is linked to hydrolysis of a single ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Whether this translates to 1-bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) or 3-bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) unwound still needs to be clarified.</p><p>This study was initiated at a time when the prevailing thought was that the enzyme translocated in 3-bp sub-steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). We therefore assumed that at 37&#176;C, an unwinding substrate of 9-bp might require only a single sub-step for unwinding, especially given the reports of local melting of the duplex occurring after NS3 binding to the unwinding substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Unwinding of the ds9-C20 substrate employed here seems to function as expected, employing the mechanism shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>.
<fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Integrating the ATPase cycle into models for RNA unwinding by HCV NS3. This model was adapted from that presented recently by Myong <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Domains 1 and 2 together constitute the ATP-binding and ATPase sites and are colored blue and green, respectively. The &#8216;receptacle&#8217; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) for displaced RNA is colored yellow. NS3 binds to both the ss and ds regions of the unwinding substrate; however, there is a preference for the ss/ds junction. A time- and temperature-dependent activation of the NS3-RNA complex occurs after RNA binding to NS3. This activation may reflect an ATP-independent fraying of the duplex. Binding of ATP, and ATP hydrolysis lead to closing of domains 1 and 2 and translocation by 3 bp on loading strand, creating a high energy NS3-RNA complex. Phosphate dissociation releases the strain by permitting movement of the receptacle and unwinding of the next 3 bp. The system would now be reset for another cycle of unwinding. With the ds9-C20 substrate, one cycle of unwinding is followed by spontaneous melting of the duplex, thus preventing the need for additional rounds of ATP-dependent unwinding. We conclude that Pi release drives the power stroke for unwinding by NS3.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkp1118f7"/></fig></p><p>NS3 binds to the unwinding substrate and slowly transforms into a complex competent for unwinding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). This isomerization may lead to local melting of the duplex as the rate constant for activation is temperature dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>a). Whether or not the melting is at the ss/ds junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) or within the duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) is not known. However, an unwinding substrate with a pre-frayed end does not exhibit enhanced kinetics of unwinding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>c).</p><p>Next, ATP binds to the NS3&#183;ds9-C20 complex. Our study suggests that nucleic acid causes an &#8764;8-fold decrease in the affinity of NS3 for ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Reduced affinity for ATP in the presence of nucleic acid has been documented in the past for both full-length and truncated (NS3h) form of NS3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). However, an increase in affinity has also been reported for full-length NS3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). All of these studies inferred affinity from kinetic studies of the ATPase activity. This study employed a direct approach. While NS3-ATP and NS3&#183;ds9-C20-ATP complexes show a change in intrinsic fluorescence relative to NS3 and NS3&#183;ds9-C20, respectively, the same was not true for NS3h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Therefore, it is not absolutely clear that the site monitored by our studies represents the ATPase catalytic center. There has been some suggestion that NS3 has two ATP-binding sites, one of which could be remote from the catalytic site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). The <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value for ATP reported here is in the 1&#8211;7 mM range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Values obtained by others in the presence of RNA were: 25 &#181;M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), 0.5 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) and 3.4&#8211;4.6 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>Binding of ATP to NS3 dramatically decreases the affinity of NS3 for RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Binding to ss/ds junction is affected less than binding to ds or ss RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). This observation raises the important question: how does NS3 bind to RNA in the cell where concentrations of ATP likely exceed that of viral (and cellular) RNA? Binding of NS3 to RNA, especially viral RNA, may be facilitated by interactions with other viral proteins, such as NS5A or NS5B, that bind to viral RNA specifically and independently of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Clearly, binding of NS3 to cellular RNA is not advantageous to the cell as the unwinding activity could lead to RNA remodeling and the ATPase activity could lead to ATP depletion. Our observations of the antagonistic effect of ATP binding on RNA binding and vice versa may explain the observation that expression of NS3 is not toxic to cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28 B29 B30">28&#8211;30</xref>).</p><p>Very limited information is available on the kinetics of ATP binding and dissociation. One study of NS3h suggested that the second-order rate constant for ATP binding to NS3h-RNA is 0.4 &#181;M<sup>&#8722;1</sup> s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, three orders of magnitude slower than the second-order rate constant for RNA binding to NS3h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). A study of NS3 suggested that the second-order rate constant for ATP binding to a paused NS3-RNA complex is 9.9 mM<sup>&#8722;1</sup> s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Given the uncertainty and extremes of the values for the rate constants for association and dissociation of ATP, as well as equilibrium dissociation constant for ATP, the ATP concentration employed in any experiment could significantly influence experimental outcome. For example, if the second-order rate constant is 9.9 mM<sup>&#8722;1</sup> s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, then at 1 mM, any process occurring faster than 2 s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> will be attenuated by binding and may not be observed.</p><p>Addition of ATP to the NS3&#183;ds9-C20 complex led to unwinding that was dependent on ATP concentration. At 1 mM ATP, incomplete unwinding was predicted; the observed rate constant was 0.1 s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1118/DC1">Figure S3</ext-link>). However, at 10 mM ATP, essentially all of the RNA was unwound. The kinetics of unwinding were biphasic. The rate constant for the first phase (70%) was 4 s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>; the rate constant for the second phase (30%) was 0.1 s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>b). The rate constant of 4 s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> correlates to an unwinding rate that is consistent with our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). However, displacement rate constants this fast have never been observed in ensemble experiments, only single-molecule experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>The reasons for the two rate constants observed for unwinding of the ds9-C20 substrate are not clear. It is possible that the organization of the NS3&#183;ds9-C20 complex relative to the junction is different or the extent of activation is different (e.g. extent of duplex melting). Pyle has suggested that the use of a complementary trap for the displaced strand could artificially increase the burst amplitude (and perhaps rate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). This effect of trap was not observed in our system (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1118/DC1">Supplementary Figure S5a</ext-link>), consistent with the observed dependence of the amplitude of unwinding on ATP concentration (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1118/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3</ext-link>).</p><p>The existence of NS3-RNA complex capable of fast unwinding provides new opportunities for ensemble experiments to contribute to our understanding of helicase mechanism. The kinetics of the fast phase does not exhibit a lag, suggesting that a single step is sufficient for unwinding and that if sub- or sub-sub-steps are involved, then the rate constant(s) must be greater than 40 s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> for this substrate; rate constants that are substantially faster than predicted by single-molecule experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>The possibility that one step was sufficient for unwinding encouraged evaluation of the ATPase cycle. Under the conditions employed, the steady-state rate constant for the ATPase cycle of the NS3&#183;ds9-C20 complex was also 4 s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>b and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1118/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4</ext-link>). The pre-steady-state rate constant for ATP hydrolysis by the NS3&#183;ds9-C20 complex was 49 s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> using 10 &#181;M ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>a). These data suggest that ATP hydrolysis is faster than release of ADP or Pi. The ability to observe a burst at 10 &#181;M ATP would argue that the second order rate constant is &gt;4 &#181;M<sup>&#8722;1</sup> s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. It is important to note that very little unwinding is observed under conditions employed for pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of the ATPase cycle. This observation is not explained by the presence of inactive enzyme in our preparations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1118/DC1">Supplementary Figure S5b</ext-link>). Caution is clearly warranted in the interpretation of the ATPase cycle relative to the unwinding cycle. However, these data suggested that ATP hydrolysis is unlikely to be the rate-limiting step of the ATPase cycle in the presence of nucleic acid.</p><p>Release of phosphate was measured by using PBP and the rate constant was &#8764;5 s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>b). Taken at face value, these data suggest that any reiterative process coupled to the ATPase cycle would be limited by phosphate release. Phosphate release was recently found to limit the ssDNA-stimulated TTPase cycle for the ring-shaped T7 helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). We have reached the same conclusion for the ssRNA-stimulated ATPase cycle of NS3 (Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, in preparation). The data also suggest that our unwinding substrate is unwound in one cycle of ATP hydrolysis. It is unlikely that unwinding 1 bp would be sufficient, so these data are most consistent with a 3-bp sub-step per ATP hydrolyzed, although binding, hydrolysis and phosphate release may act independently to translocate the enzyme through 1-bp sub-sub-steps. Under the conditions used, melting of 3 bp would be sufficient to prevent hybridization at 37&#176;C (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1118/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2b</ext-link>). DEAD-box proteins can melt multiple basepairs by using a single ATP without the requirement for hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31 B32 B33">31&#8211;33</xref>). Hydrolysis in this case permits enzyme turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).</p><p>The stoichiometry of ATP bound per bp unwound is, at best, inferred by all experiments performed on NS3 unwinding, including this study. However, phosphate release as a rate-limiting step would predict a pause between every round of ATP hydrolysis as has been observed in single molecule force experiments and ensemble experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Indeed, in these studies, release of the paused NS3-RNA complex depended on a first order rate constant of &#8764;2&#8211;5 s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), which is clearly on the same order of magnitude as the rate constant for phosphate release determined here. Single molecule FRET experiments also suggest that 3-bp steps are limited by a rate constant of &#8764;1 s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>We propose that phosphate release contributes to the release of the &#8216;spring&#8217; that moves NS3 by one sub-step. Phosphate release is the signal for conformational changes required for function in a variety of systems, from cytoskeletal motor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) to translation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). The substrate described here is well suited to explore this possibility more deeply for the NS3 helicase by using ensemble experiments. In addition, the approach described here for NS3 should illuminate mechanisms for other DExH-box RNA helicases and may also permit direct comparison of this class of helicases to the DEAD-box class of enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31 B32 B33">31&#8211;33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1118/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><funding-source>National Institutes of Health</funding-source> (<award-id>AI060563</award-id> to K.D.R. and C.E.C.).
