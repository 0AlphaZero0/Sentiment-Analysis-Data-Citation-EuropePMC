</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RNA helicases function in myriad aspects of RNA metabolism in the cell, and new functions continue to emerge (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Viruses also encode RNA helicases (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The RNA helicase encoded by hepatitis C virus (HCV), non-structural protein 3 (NS3), is a DExH-box protein that belongs to helicase superfamily 2 (SF2) (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Unlike most DExH-box proteins, NS3 is also a DNA helicase (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although HCV NS3 RNA helicase activity is essential for virus viability, the precise role of the RNA helicase activity in the multiplication cycle is not known (2). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>HCV NS3 has emerged as an important model system for studies of the kinetics and mechanism of SF2 RNA helicases (3–9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>NS3 binds to its nucleic acid substrate in multiple forms: monomer, dimer, oligomer, depending on the length of the single-stranded overhang used for NS3 loading (10,11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>After formation of the NS3-nucleic acid complex, a slow isomerization of this complex occurs that activates the complex for unwinding (12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It has recently been suggested that this isomerization may reflect an ATP-independent, local melting of the duplex region targeted for ATP-dependent unwinding (3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>NS3 has been proposed to use both passive (5) and active (3) mechanisms for unwinding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>It is possible that a passive mechanism is used prior to formation of the activated complex and an active mechanism used thereafter. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Addition of ATP to a reaction containing activated complexes leads to multiple cycles of unwinding and pausing (4,9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The number of cycles of unwinding and pausing per binding event is dependent on the NS3 oligomeric state, with monomers being the least processive (4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The kinetic and physical step size for NS3 is 11–18 bp, again depending on the oligomeric state. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>This ‘super’ step of unwinding occurs in sub-steps of 3 bp (3,4), and each sub-step is thought to occur in three, 1-bp sub-sub-steps (6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Whether or not the ATPase cycle couples to a sub-step or a sub-sub-step needs to be clarified. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>How the ATPase cycle couples to unwinding is not completely clear for any helicase but clearly represents an important frontier for helicase enzymology (13,14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The realization that NS3 employs an active mechanism for unwinding suggested that this system might also be used to address this question. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>We reasoned that if an unwinding substrate could be produced that required no greater than one, 3-bp sub-step for unwinding to occur, then correlations between the ATPase cycle and unwinding might be possible. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>We show that an RNA substrate containing a 20-nt single-stranded loading strand and a 9-bp duplex can be unwound in a single sub-step. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the rate constant for unwinding was equivalent to the rate constant for phosphate release during the ATPase cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>This study provides the first, direct link between a step in the ATPase cycle and unwinding by an RNA helicase, and sets the stage for elucidation of the mechanochemical coupling mechanism employed by RNA helicases. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="357" pm="."><plain>RNA helicases use chemical energy stored in the phosphoanhydride bond of ATP to perform mechanical work of RNA unwinding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="358" pm="."><plain>How this happens is not clear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="359" pm="."><plain>It is now known that despite an apparent large kinetic and physical step size for the NS3 helicase, unwinding requires sub-steps and perhaps sub-sub-steps (4,6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="360" pm="."><plain>The smallest step is linked to hydrolysis of a single ATP (4,6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="361" pm="."><plain>Whether this translates to 1-bp (4) or 3-bp (6) unwound still needs to be clarified. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="362" pm="."><plain>This study was initiated at a time when the prevailing thought was that the enzyme translocated in 3-bp sub-steps (6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="363" pm="."><plain>We therefore assumed that at 37°C, an unwinding substrate of 9-bp might require only a single sub-step for unwinding, especially given the reports of local melting of the duplex occurring after NS3 binding to the unwinding substrate (5). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="368" pm="."><plain>NS3 binds to both the ss and ds regions of the unwinding substrate; however, there is a preference for the ss/ds junction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="369" pm="."><plain>A time- and temperature-dependent activation of the NS3-RNA complex occurs after RNA binding to NS3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="370" pm="."><plain>This activation may reflect an ATP-independent fraying of the duplex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="371" pm="."><plain>Binding of ATP, and ATP hydrolysis lead to closing of domains 1 and 2 and translocation by 3 bp on loading strand, creating a high energy NS3-RNA complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="372" pm="."><plain>Phosphate dissociation releases the strain by permitting movement of the receptacle and unwinding of the next 3 bp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="373" pm="."><plain>The system would now be reset for another cycle of unwinding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="374" pm="."><plain>With the ds9-C20 substrate, one cycle of unwinding is followed by spontaneous melting of the duplex, thus preventing the need for additional rounds of ATP-dependent unwinding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="375" pm="."><plain>We conclude that Pi release drives the power stroke for unwinding by NS3. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="376" pm="."><plain>NS3 binds to the unwinding substrate and slowly transforms into a complex competent for unwinding (Figure 7) (12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="377" pm="."><plain>This isomerization may lead to local melting of the duplex as the rate constant for activation is temperature dependent (Figure 3a). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="412" pm="."><plain>This effect of trap was not observed in our system (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1118/DC1">Supplementary Figure S5a</ext-link>), consistent with the observed dependence of the amplitude of unwinding on ATP concentration (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1118/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="413" pm="."><plain>The existence of NS3-RNA complex capable of fast unwinding provides new opportunities for ensemble experiments to contribute to our understanding of helicase mechanism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="414" pm="."><plain>The kinetics of the fast phase does not exhibit a lag, suggesting that a single step is sufficient for unwinding and that if sub- or sub-sub-steps are involved, then the rate constant(s) must be greater than 40 s−1 for this substrate; rate constants that are substantially faster than predicted by single-molecule experiments (4,6). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="415" pm="."><plain>The possibility that one step was sufficient for unwinding encouraged evaluation of the ATPase cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="416" pm="."><plain>Under the conditions employed, the steady-state rate constant for the ATPase cycle of the NS3·ds9-C20 complex was also 4 s−1 (Figures 3b and 6, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1118/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="417" pm="."><plain>The pre-steady-state rate constant for ATP hydrolysis by the NS3·ds9-C20 complex was 49 s−1 using 10 µM ATP (Figure 5a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="418" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that ATP hydrolysis is faster than release of ADP or Pi. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="419" pm="."><plain>The ability to observe a burst at 10 µM ATP would argue that the second order rate constant is &gt;4 µM−1 s−1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="420" pm="."><plain>It is important to note that very little unwinding is observed under conditions employed for pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of the ATPase cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="421" pm="."><plain>This observation is not explained by the presence of inactive enzyme in our preparations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1118/DC1">Supplementary Figure S5b</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="422" pm="."><plain>Caution is clearly warranted in the interpretation of the ATPase cycle relative to the unwinding cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="423" pm="."><plain>However, these data suggested that ATP hydrolysis is unlikely to be the rate-limiting step of the ATPase cycle in the presence of nucleic acid. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="424" pm="."><plain>Release of phosphate was measured by using PBP and the rate constant was ∼5 s−1 (Figure 5b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="425" pm="."><plain>Taken at face value, these data suggest that any reiterative process coupled to the ATPase cycle would be limited by phosphate release. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="426" pm="."><plain>Phosphate release was recently found to limit the ssDNA-stimulated TTPase cycle for the ring-shaped T7 helicase (13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="427" pm="."><plain>We have reached the same conclusion for the ssRNA-stimulated ATPase cycle of NS3 (Wang et al., in preparation). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="428" pm="."><plain>The data also suggest that our unwinding substrate is unwound in one cycle of ATP hydrolysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="429" pm="."><plain>It is unlikely that unwinding 1 bp would be sufficient, so these data are most consistent with a 3-bp sub-step per ATP hydrolyzed, although binding, hydrolysis and phosphate release may act independently to translocate the enzyme through 1-bp sub-sub-steps. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="430" pm="."><plain>Under the conditions used, melting of 3 bp would be sufficient to prevent hybridization at 37°C (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1118/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2b</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="431" pm="."><plain>DEAD-box proteins can melt multiple basepairs by using a single ATP without the requirement for hydrolysis (31–33). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="432" pm="."><plain>Hydrolysis in this case permits enzyme turnover (32). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="433" pm="."><plain>The stoichiometry of ATP bound per bp unwound is, at best, inferred by all experiments performed on NS3 unwinding, including this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="434" pm="."><plain>However, phosphate release as a rate-limiting step would predict a pause between every round of ATP hydrolysis as has been observed in single molecule force experiments and ensemble experiments (4,9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="435" pm="."><plain>Indeed, in these studies, release of the paused NS3-RNA complex depended on a first order rate constant of ∼2–5 s−1 (4,9), which is clearly on the same order of magnitude as the rate constant for phosphate release determined here. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="436" pm="."><plain>Single molecule FRET experiments also suggest that 3-bp steps are limited by a rate constant of ∼1 s−1 (6). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="437" pm="."><plain>We propose that phosphate release contributes to the release of the ‘spring’ that moves NS3 by one sub-step. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="438" pm="."><plain>Phosphate release is the signal for conformational changes required for function in a variety of systems, from cytoskeletal motor proteins (34) to translation factors (35). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="439" pm="."><plain>The substrate described here is well suited to explore this possibility more deeply for the NS3 helicase by using ensemble experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="440" pm="."><plain>In addition, the approach described here for NS3 should illuminate mechanisms for other DExH-box RNA helicases and may also permit direct comparison of this class of helicases to the DEAD-box class of enzymes (31–33,36). </plain></SENT>
