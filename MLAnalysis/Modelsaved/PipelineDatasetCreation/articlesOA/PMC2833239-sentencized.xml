</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Falciparum malaria is one of the most important diseases in Africa, both in terms of mortality and burden on health services. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Many people in Africa who have malaria are not being treated with effective drugs.1 Simultaneously, a substantial proportion, sometimes the majority, of those treated for malaria in both East and West Africa are not actually infected with malaria parasites.2 3 4 Given that malaria is the most common diagnosis made in African children and one of the most common in adults, both underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis of malaria have substantial public health implications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Missing true cases threatens the lives of otherwise well children, whereas people wrongly treated for malaria often have alternative diagnoses—especially bacterial diseases, some of which are potentially fatal—that are not being treated.5 6 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Overdiagnosis also leads to overuse of antimalarial drugs, potentially increasing the risk of spread of drug resistant malaria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Given that the current highly effective drugs are substantially more expensive than previous antimalarials, the economic implications of overdiagnosis are considerable and undermine the cost effectiveness of the newer artemisinin based combination therapies (ACTs).7 Malaria incidence is falling in some areas, and the problem of overtreatment becomes more important where malaria incidence is decreasing because the proportion of serious causes of febrile illness that are not malaria increases.8 Overdiagnosis of malaria is therefore likely to be an increasing problem. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Until recently, proper diagnosis of malaria relied on light microscopy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>This approach is possible or cost effective only in settings with high throughput and where trained microscopists are available.9 New rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for falciparum malaria are sensitive and specific (although there is marked variation between different makes of tests),10 11 and can be used in peripheral settings (rural and community settings) where most patients in Africa get their care. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>They do not require microscopes, electricity, or trained laboratory staff. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>They are also potentially cost effective, but only if prescribers use the results to guide their prescribing.12 Studies in central clinics in East Africa where microscopy is used for diagnosis suggest that clinicians often do not change their prescribing behaviour when given rapid diagnostic tests to use,13 14 and one study indicated that rapid diagnostic tests even have the potential to be harmful by encouraging undertreatment of true malaria compared with presumptive treatment.15 A good response to the results of rapid diagnostic tests has, however, been achieved under certain circumstances.16 17 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Several major questions need to be answered about how best to use rapid diagnostic tests for the management of febrile illness in Africa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The most important of these questions relates to the role of rapid diagnostic tests in settings where microscopy is not available, because most children and adults in Africa seek care in such settings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Inaccurate prescription of antimalarials is greater in such situations because causes of febrile illness are difficult to differentiate clinically in the absence of tests. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Testing the impact of rapid diagnostic tests in this setting is therefore essential. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>There is much hope, but limited evidence, that they will also have an impact where microscopy is not available because prescribers who have not become used to ignoring microscopy results because microscopy is not available may be much more likely to use rapid diagnostic tests to guide diagnosis and treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Additionally, most published studies on the impact of rapid diagnostic tests on management of febrile illness were performed in East Africa, but the largest burden of febrile diseases is in the populous countries of West Africa, where malaria epidemiology, clinical training, and the structure of the health service are very different from in East Africa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Finally, there are few follow-up data on patients once they have left clinics, and one of the concerns is that rapid diagnostic tests may lead to greater mortality and morbidity because they lead to cases of true malaria being missed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>We set out to study the impact of rapid diagnostic tests on prescribing of antimalarials and antibiotics in West Africa in two settings serving the same population: one where microscopy is routinely available (to allow comparison with previous studies) and the other where microscopy is not available (peripheral clinics, which are representative of the majority of clinics in sub-Saharan Africa). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Most deaths from malaria are in children, but the majority of antimalarials in Africa are consumed by adults, so we examined the impact in both children and adults. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The study was a randomised, controlled, open label clinical trial carried out in the Dangme West district of southern Ghana, a rural district with an estimated population of about 130 000 living in scattered communities of less than 2000 people. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The district has four health centres and six community based clinics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>There is one publicly owned laboratory based in Dodowa Health Centre, Dodowa, and two privately owned laboratories in two other sub districts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>All health facilities where there are no laboratories rely on clinical diagnosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The district has no hospital. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>In 2008, a total of 31 971 cases of malaria were reported in all health facilities in the district, both public and private, which accounted for approximately 41% of all reported attendances. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Of these 31 971 cases, 7808 (24%) were in children less than 5 years of age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>A high proportion of these diagnoses were presumptive (that is, made without tests). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec><title><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Setting </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The trial was undertaken in four health facilities in the district, one of which (Dodowa Health Centre) had facilities for microscopy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The others, where the diagnosis was normally presumptive, included one clinic that is privately owned. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The Dodowa Health Centre is subsequently referred to as the “microscopy setting,” whereas the other health facilities as a group are referred to as the “clinical setting.” </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>The healthcare professionals were mostly nurses with two years of basic training followed by several years of experience in hospitals, or nurses with three years of basic training resulting in a diploma and usually a number of years of experience in hospitals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The healthcare professionals also included auxiliary nurses with two years of basic training and additional “on the job” training in basic curative care. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>The final category of healthcare professionals was nurse practitioners with three years of basic training resulting in a diploma followed by an additional two years of training in curative care, often separated by a number of years of work in hospitals and sometimes training in midwifery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The latter group was the most highly trained and experienced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>There was only one doctor. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Before the study begun, all healthcare professionals in participating centres were given identical training about the sensitivity and specificity of rapid diagnostic tests, alternative causes of febrile illness, and the Ghana national guidelines, which indicate presumptive treatment for children under 5 years of age (that is, the treatment is assigned without carrying out a diagnostic test). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The first day focused on differential diagnoses of fever in children and adults, whereas the second day focused on the study itself and rapid diagnostic tests. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>In the training, emphasis was placed on the difference between a diagnosis by microscopy, which depends on identification of the malaria parasite, and a diagnosis according to the rapid diagnostic test, which relies on an antigen-antibody reaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>This distinction was emphasised to improve the perceptions of negative clinical slide results among healthcare professionals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>The healthcare professionals were also trained to carry out and interpret the rapid diagnostic test themselves. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>They were, however, left free to make their own clinical decisions after the initial training. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>The training took two days and was designed to replicate the best training that could reasonably be delivered in a routine roll-out of rapid diagnostic tests. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Participants and randomisation </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>All patients visiting the health facilities were screened for enrolment into the study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The inclusion criteria were that the healthcare professional considered treating the patient for malaria and wanted to test for malaria or treat the patient with an antimalarial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, illness severe enough to warrant referral to a hospital, insistence by the healthcare professional on a particular test or a particular method of treatment, patient insistence on a particular test, refusal of consent by the patient or guardian (for minors), not living in the district or nearby, or not intending to remain in the district for the next two months for follow-up. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>OptiMAL-IT rapid diagnostic test kits (Diamed AG, Cressier sur Morat, Switzerland)18 were used for this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>This test uses a dipstick coated with monoclonal antibodies against plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase, which is released from erythrocytes infected with the parasite. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Local microscopy used Giemsa staining, with the parasite count recorded as +, ++, or +++. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>In both settings a blood sample for a research slide was taken for all patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Research slides were Giemsa stained and read by two independent microscopists who were blind to the study allocations and results of the rapid diagnostic tests. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>In cases where the two readers had discordant results, the slide was read by a third reader. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>These analyses by the expert microscopists were undertaken later and not used by the healthcare professionals in their treatment decisions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>The research slides were examined under 100× oil immersion magnification and a film was recorded as positive or negative and parasite count recorded for malaria on the basis of the number of asexual parasites per 200 white blood cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Randomisation was carried out using Stata 8 software (Statacorp, College Station, TX) by staff not involved in clinical care. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Randomisation was carried out in blocks of 10 for each setting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>The allocations were placed in sealed, sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes and delivered to the study team. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>At all health facilities, envelopes were arranged and allocated sequentially. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>At the single health facility with microscopy facilities, patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and who the health professional wished to have tested for malaria were sent to a member of the study team, who carried out an evaluation for eligibility and obtained informed consent and demographic and clinical data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>A sealed, sequentially numbered envelope containing the patient’s test allocation—either “rapid diagnostic test” or “microscopy”—was opened in the presence of the patient; this constituted entry to the trial and intention to treat analysis was conducted on the basis of this allocation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>The allocated test, either rapid diagnostic test or local microscopy, was then carried out in the clinic’s laboratory, with a separate research slide taken for all cases to be read later. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>The laboratory results were written out as usual in the case of clinical microscopy, and rapid diagnostic test results were recorded and the dipstick sent in its case to the healthcare professional to read as well. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>At the three health facilities where microscopy was not available, healthcare professionals sent patients in whom they suspected malaria to the study team. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Informed consent was sought and eligible patients were randomised in the same way as those at the clinic with microscopy facilities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>In the case of allocation to the rapid diagnostic test group, the test was carried out by a member of the study team and the results recorded. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>The results were sent together with the rapid diagnostic test kit to the healthcare professional for clinician read diagnosis and subsequent treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>In cases where the patient was assigned to clinical diagnosis, the laboratory results form with “clinical diagnosis” ticked on it was returned to the healthcare professional. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>A blood sample for a research slide was also taken—this was not read until later. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was the proportion of patients, either children or adults, who did not have malaria on the basis of a negative double read research slide but were prescribed antimalarial treatment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients whose research slide was positive for malaria and who were not prescribed an antimalarial, the proportion of patients whose research slide was either positive or negative who were prescribed antibiotics, the proportion of patients whose rapid diagnostic test result was positive and who were not prescribed an antimalarial, and the composite measure of “correct prescription of antimalarials,” meaning antimalarials being given to all patients who were test positive and not to anyone who was test negative, in all patients and in children under 5 years only. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of rapid diagnostic tests were also calculated against the double read research slides. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>The response of healthcare professionals was measured objectively by appropriate prescription of an effective antimalarial or a broad spectrum antibiotic capable of treating common Gram positive or Gram negative pathogens (for example, pneumococcus or non-typhoid salmonella). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up at their homes 28 days after enrolment to determine subsequent treatment seeking and any mortality or admissions to hospital, and to confirm socioeconomic variables. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>A random sample of 500 patients in both the clinical and microscopy settings had blood films taken during follow-up. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Data were entered into Epi Info 6 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA) and analysed using Stata 10 (Statacorp). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Simple proportions were calculated for the study groups overall, and then results were stratified by age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>In all cases results from the microscopy setting and those from the clinical setting were analysed separately. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>For the primary and major secondary outcomes, odds ratios were calculated in an uncorrected logistic regression model and subsequently adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic status, and clustering by healthcare professional. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Socioeconomic status was determined by constructing an asset index, which has been validated locally, and calculating quintiles.19 Clustering by healthcare professional was adjusted for by using the “svy” command in Stata, with healthcare professionals as the primary sampling unit. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>The sample size was calculated to allow us to detect a 25% reduction in overprescription of antimalarials in patients of any age in the microscopy and clinical settings independently (α=0.05, β=0.8); a reduction less than this was thought unlikely to lead to a public health change as large and potentially expensive as deploying rapid diagnostic tests. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Published studies suggest that an antimalarial will be prescribed in at least 45% of patients who have a negative blood slide result, where microscopy is present. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was overprescription irrespective of age in each setting independently (that is, both in the clinical setting and the microscopy setting), but we wished to have power for a major secondary analysis restricted to children, so the trial was powered for this analysis (and, therefore, overpowered for the primary analysis). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>We assumed on the basis of previous clinic data that the ratio of patients in whom malaria was suspected would be 2:1 for children to adults. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>In adults we conservatively estimated that overprescription would be 50%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>In children we estimated it would be 30%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Detecting a 25% reduction in overprescription required a sample size of 2500 children and 1000 adults, or 3500 patients overall for the microscopy setting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>In the clinical setting, we estimated that the overprescription of antimalarials was likely to be 10% higher in both children and adults; thus around 3000 patients were required. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>The total required sample size for the whole study was therefore 6500. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>In common with a similar study in East Africa, in this West African setting rapid diagnostic tests for malaria had no impact on the prescription of antimalarials in clinics where microscopy was available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Healthcare professionals treated the results from rapid diagnostic tests the same way as those from microscopy, often ignoring negative results and prescribing antimalarials regardless; the non-significant trend towards lower prescription of antimalarials to patients whose double read research slide was negative was because the operational sensitivity of rapid diagnostic tests was higher than that for routine microscopy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in clinics where microscopy was not available and normal practice was presumptive treatment, which is typical of the majority of clinics in sub-Saharan Africa, providing rapid diagnostic tests had a clinically important impact on reducing overprescription of antimalarials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>The use of rapid diagnostic tests also improved the targeting of antibiotics to patients who did not have malaria according to their double read research slide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between the rapid diagnostic test arm and the clinical diagnosis arm in the proportions of cases of confirmed malaria that were not treated, nor evidence that introducing antimalarial treatment targeted by rapid diagnostic tests where treatment is presumptive increased mortality in children or care seeking 28 days later. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Despite these encouraging results in the clinical setting, a substantial proportion of the artemisinin based combination therapy prescribed when healthcare professionals had requested a test was still to patients with a negative test result. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Simply deploying rapid diagnostic tests with a limited training package is unlikely to lead to them having their full potential impact even in settings where microscopy is not available. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Major efforts are being made by the Global Fund and other organisations to increase the availability and lower the cost of antimalarials.20 The public health impact of these endeavours could be substantially undermined in West Africa, where a large proportion of the world’s deaths from falciparum malaria occur, unless better targeting can be achieved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>This is made more urgent by the fact that malaria makes up a decreasing proportion of febrile illness in some areas.8 The emerging resistance to artemisinin based regimens in Asia, from where previous antimalarial drug resistance has spread, probably makes it more likely that indiscriminate use of antimalarials will speed up the spread of drug resistance.21 Giving antimalarials to people who do not have malaria has no positive effect, and many alternative causes of febrile illness are potentially being missed as a result of overdiagnosis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec><title><text><SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Comparison with other studies </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Attempts to change practice in West Africa by implementing rapid diagnostic tests have been disappointing, with more than 80% of patients whose rapid diagnostic test was negative prescribed antimalarials in one study.22 Changing the behaviour of prescribers can be difficult in any setting where healthcare professionals are used to a particular prescribing pattern for a common syndrome,23 as the prolonged efforts to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing in the UK have demonstrated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>The reasons malaria is overdiagnosed are complex.24 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>The disappointing results in the microscopy setting are consistent with studies from East Africa.12 13 Microscopy is more cost effective than rapid diagnostic tests in settings where there is high throughput. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Therefore, improving existing microscopy techniques should ideally be the aim in these settings because there is no evidence that substituting rapid diagnostic tests has any advantages on prescribing behaviour. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>The operational sensitivity of microscopy was low in our study, however, and sustaining improvements in laboratory standards can be challenging25; rapid diagnostic tests may therefore have a role in quality control. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>As shown by this study and other trials of rapid diagnostic tests where microscopy is the comparator,26 27 improving diagnostic techniques with targeted training cannot be assumed to translate into better diagnosis for patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Strenuous efforts will be needed to understand, and change, existing clinical behaviour where healthcare professionals have got used to ignoring negative malaria tests. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>There are several reasons healthcare professionals and public health officials in Africa have been cautious about introducing rapid diagnostic tests in peripheral settings, where this study suggests they do lead to changes in prescribing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Two are addressed by this study directly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>The first is that because rapid diagnostic tests do not have an impact on prescribing where microscopy is available, people feel that there is no point using them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>However, in this setting at least, introducing rapid diagnostic tests had a much greater impact on promoting rational prescribing of antimalarials and antibiotics where there was no existing microscopy than where microscopy was available. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>The second is the concern that true malaria cases will be missed when rapid diagnostic tests are used, and that this will lead to harm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>There was, however, no evidence in this study that the reduction of overdiagnosis was balanced by an increase in underdiagnosis, or that rapid diagnostic tests led to an increase in repeat attendance or mortality at 28 days. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>The study was not powered to detect a difference in mortality though, so this finding should be interpreted with caution. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>One real concern could not be dealt with: that deploying a blood test where it has not been used before is not risk-free in settings where the prevalence of blood borne viruses is relatively high. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Additionally, although it is logical to assume that improving targeting of antibiotics to children who do not have malaria according to their research laboratory slide should have an impact on reducing subsequent severe bacterial illness,28 direct evidence for this is currently lacking. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Limitations of the study </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>The major weakness of all studies of patient and prescriber behaviour are that behaviour cannot automatically be generalised from one setting to another. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>This study is no exception, although it is reassuring scientifically, if not in public health terms, that our results are consistent with data from East Africa that show a limited impact of rapid diagnostic tests where microscopy exists. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>This agreement strengthens the likelihood that the positive impact we recorded in a community setting is in fact a real and generalisable effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>Additionally, there is always the risk that being in a trial will itself change the behaviour of healthcare professionals (the Hawthorne effect). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Much of the difference between previous studies has been assumed to be due to different training packages and diagnostic settings; in this study, prescribers in both the clinical setting and the microscopy setting were given identical training together, used the same test, and were in the same catchment area. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Although residual differences in both caseload and prescriber behaviour will exist, the impact of rapid diagnostic tests was very different in the two settings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>In general, the operational effectiveness of any intervention when used in normal practice is lower than that found in research studies, even in pragmatic trials. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>The role of rapid diagnostic tests for the treatment of malaria is the subject of considerable debate.29 30 This study provides evidence to support exploring the deployment of rapid diagnostic tests for malaria in West Africa in settings where microscopy is not available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>The results also show that where microscopy is available, rapid diagnostic tests are unlikely to have more than a marginal impact on existing prescriber behaviour if deployed with a pragmatic training package. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Using rapid diagnostic tests is, however, likely to achieve its greatest impact only if accompanied by training and supervision tailored to the users and informed by social science studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Although the impact of rapid diagnostic tests on prescriber behaviour in settings where diagnosis is currently syndromic (based on symptoms) is encouraging, for malaria a substantial proportion of negative tests by any technique are still ignored. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>This problem will need to be tackled if treatment according to rapid diagnostic tests is to be more effective and cost effective than presumptive treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>While we acknowledge the limited generalisability, our study provides support for the deployment of rapid diagnostic tests in peripheral settings where microscopy is not available. </plain></SENT>
