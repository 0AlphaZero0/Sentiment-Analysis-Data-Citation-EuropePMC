Consequently, biological studies have yet to identify, on a genome scale, key regulatory networks perturbed by altered microRNA functions in the context of cancer. In this report, we demonstrate for the first time how phenotypic knowledge of inheritable cancer traits and of risk factor loci can be utilized jointly with gene expression analysis to efficiently prioritize deregulated microRNAs for biological characterization. Using this approach we characterize miR-204 as a tumor suppressor microRNA and uncover previously unknown connections between microRNA regulation, network topology, and expression dynamics. Specifically, we validate 18 gene targets of miR-204 that show elevated mRNA expression and are enriched in biological processes associated with tumor progression in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC). We further demonstrate the enrichment of bottleneckness, a key molecular network topology, among miR-204 gene targets. Restoration of miR-204 function in HNSCC cell lines inhibits the expression of its functionally related gene targets, leads to the reduced adhesion, migration and invasion in vitro and attenuates experimental lung metastasis in vivo. As importantly, our investigation also provides experimental evidence linking the function of microRNAs that are located in the cancer-associated genomic regions (CAGRs) to the observed predisposition to human cancers. Specifically, we show miR-204 may serve as a tumor suppressor gene at the 9q21.1&#8211;22.3 CAGR locus, a well established risk factor locus in head and neck cancers for which tumor suppressor genes have not been identified. This new strategy that integrates expression profiling, genetics and novel computational biology approaches provides for improved efficiency in characterization and modeling of microRNA functions in cancer as compared to the state of art and is applicable to the investigation of microRNA functions in other biological processes and diseases.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>MicroRNAs regulate the expression of genes in cells and are important in cancer development and progression. Designing new microRNA-based treatments requires the understanding of their mechanisms of action. Previous biological studies lack in depth since only a few genes are confirmed as microRNA targets. Additionally, key biological systems perturbed by altered microRNA functions in the context of cancer remain to be identified. Here, we demonstrate for the first time how genetic knowledge about the inheritance of cancer can be utilized jointly with data about the expression of genes in cancer samples to model deregulated microRNAs and their functions at multiple scales of biology. Our approach further uncovers previously unknown connections between microRNAs, their regulated genes, and their dynamics. Using head and neck cancer as a model, we predict the presence, functions, and gene targets of a new tumor suppressor microRNA in a cancer-associated chromosomal region where a candidate gene has not been identified. We then confirm their validity with extensive and thorough biological characterization and show attenuation of lung metastasis in mice. The discovery of molecular networks regulated by microRNAs could be exploited for the design of new treatments as an alternative to the single-gene target paradigm.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since the discovery of microRNAs as important regulators of broad biological processes <xref rid="pcbi.1000730-Brennecke1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pcbi.1000730-Poy1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, characterization of their functions in cancer has been hindered by lack of microRNA profiling information in tumors such as squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC). Previous reports show that only one or a few gene targets, identified among predicted or differentially expressed genes, were directly targeted by the microRNA under investigation <xref rid="pcbi.1000730-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pcbi.1000730-Tavazoie1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. While sequence-based computational algorithms have been applied for predicting all potential microRNA gene targets; false positive rates remains relatively high <xref rid="pcbi.1000730-Sethupathy1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000730-Lewis1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Further, sequence-based predictions are unable, by design, to account for biological contexts (e.g. cell and tissue types, normal or disease conditions) and thus are not optimized for predicting the biological function of genes targeted by cancer microRNAs. Moreover, genome-scale and biological studies have yet to identify key regulatory networks perturbed by altered microRNA functions in cancer.</p><p>To investigate microRNA function in HNSCC, we sought to develop an effective computational approach that is complementary to microRNA profiling and, in addition, is capable of simultaneously predicting tumor suppressor microRNAs as well as their functional targets from gene expression. In this report we illustrate how phenotypic knowledge of genetic disorders (OMIM database) can be utilized jointly with gene expression analyses to achieve this goal. Using this approach, we selected miR-204 among ten prioritized microRNAs for biological characterization, as miR-204 is located at the cancer-associated genomic region (CAGR) 9q21.1&#8211;q22.3 locus exhibiting high frequency of Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in human HNSCC <xref rid="pcbi.1000730-AhSee1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pcbi.1000730-Scully1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and a CAGR for which candidate tumor suppressor gene targets have not been identified. Additionally, we report the first computationally predicted and biologically validated microRNA-regulated network that is dependent on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) whose overexpression occurs in over 80% of head and neck cancer. We further demonstrate that gene targets of miR-204 exhibit enriched bottleneck and hub network topology properties in a predicted protein-protein interaction network (PPIN). Moreover, we confirm the validity of our computational predictions of a microRNA function, as well as its gene targets and system's properties through conducting extensive and thorough biological characterization using a clinically relevant <italic>in vivo</italic> metastatic model of head and neck cancer.</p><p>In summary, we show how such a high throughput system's strategy can accelerate the investigation of microRNA function in cancer by illustrating altered complex biological processes and regulatory pathways associated with microRNA dysfunction in cancer, by identifying among all putative microRNA gene targets only those that are dysregulated, and by elucidating molecular interactions underpinning microRNA regulation of malignant transformation and progression. The ability to characterize tumor suppressor microRNAs through a network analysis of mRNA expression datasets would be a major advance with potentially wide application. Further, we provide experimental evidence linking microRNA function to the genetic risk of HNSCC. We show at the LOH 9q21.1&#8211;22.3 locus, miR-204 could serve as a tumor suppressor of HNSCC oncogenesis and progression.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>A figure summarizing the main results and experimental approaches of this paper is included as Supporting Figure 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000730.s001">Text S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Combining genome-scale predictive strategies to prioritize candidate microRNAs for biological characterization in HNSCC</title><p>At the time of initiating this study, comprehensive analysis of microRNA expression profile in head and neck cancer (HNSCC) was not available and would have required time-consuming accruement of tumor tissues for conducting such analysis, a situation that is not limited to HNSCC research.

We noted that vast majority of the known microRNAs had at least one putative target in the top 500 deregulated genes of the HNSCC expression arrays (GSE6631), with a median of 19 targets. Therefore, it is unfeasible to manually select microRNA candidates from their deregulated targets for biological validation. Applying IMRE method to each dataset, we predicted a set of down-regulated microRNAs in HNSCC (113 and 43, respectively; FDR &#8804;0.05, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), of which 34 were consistently found in both prediction sets (<italic>P-value</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;2.0&#215;10<sup>&#8722;16</sup>, Fisher's exact test, Figure 1A and Table 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000730.s002">Text S2</xref>, FDR &lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).

<underline>(downloaded Dec. 1, 2006)]</underline>. OMIM contains 610 biologically validated cancer genes among which 586 (96%) are predicted targets of 527 microRNAs in miRNOME. We observed that each of the 527 microRNAs could, on average, target 30 OMIM cancer genes (not shown). Thus, it is also unfeasible to manually select microRNA candidates from OMIM cancer genes for biological validation. Our analyses identified 46 microRNAs significantly enriched in the inheritable cancer gene subset of OMIM in the miRNOME (Figure 1A; Table 3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000730.s002">Text S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000730.s003">Protocol S1/Section A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000730.s004">Dataset S1</xref>).

In comparison, tumors in Cluster B were enriched with the Group 3 &#8220;normal epithelium-like subtype&#8221; tumors (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.011) <xref rid="pcbi.1000730-Chung1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. This is consistent with our observation that miR-204 targets were hub-bottleneck regulators of an EGFR-dependent regulatory network in HNSCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Further, consistent with the prognostic capability of a 582-gene signature set reported by Chung et al. <xref rid="pcbi.1000730-Chung1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, Cluster A showed overall earlier relapse than Cluster B (Figure S7). The fact that very comparable prognostic predictions can be derived using only 19 miR-204 gene targets suggest a potentially important role of miR-204 in HNSCC prognosis and merits further investigation and validation using a larger cohort of HNSCC tumor samples with well-characterized clinical outcomes.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000730-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000730.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Expression pattern of miR-204 targets identified a subtype of HNSCC tumors exhibiting an EGFR-pathway signature and miR-204 was deregulated in other squamous and epithelial tumors.</title><p>miR-204 functional targets classified 60 HNSCC tumors in (GSE686) <xref rid="pcbi.1000730-Chung1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> microarray based on their intrinsic properties (Methods). <italic>P</italic>-<italic>values</italic> were obtained using a Fisher's exact test; *: censored data.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000730.g005"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we developed an efficient combined computational and biological approach to predict and to prioritize cancer microRNAs for biological investigation. We demonstrated this strategy as an effective economical alternative to comprehensive microRNA analysis in cancers such as HNSCC for which prior genomic array datasets (mRNA or microRNA) are less abundant. This approach also allowed the identification of functional gene targets of the deregulated microRNAs that would otherwise require paired profiling of mRNA and microRNA expression for which the feasibility is often limited by the additional costs, or by the lack of access to the tissue. Employing this method that integrates the analysis of microRNA target predictions, differential HNSCC gene expression and the cancer genes in the OMIM genetic dataset, we identified and characterized miR-204, located within its host gene TRPM3 at the 9q21.1&#8211;q22.3 region frequently incurring allelic loss <xref rid="pcbi.1000730-AhSee1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pcbi.1000730-Scully1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, as a potential tumor suppressor microRNA of HNSCC and possibly of other epithelial cancers. The high propensity of LOH at 9q21.1&#8211;q22.3 that occurs in 37% HNSCC pre-malignant conditions, further increases to 67% in cancer state <xref rid="pcbi.1000730-AbouElhamd1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> suggesting the presence of tumor suppressor gene candidates. While tumor suppressor genes at other frequent allelic loss loci in HNSCC have been identified, gene candidates responsible for the tumor suppressor activity associated with the 9q21 locus remain elusive. Here, we provided a plausible mechanism that loss of tumor suppressor function of miR-204 as a result of allelic imbalance at 9q21.1&#8211;q22.3 may significantly increases the genetic susceptibility to HNSCC oncogenesis and progression. LOH at this locus is also seen in the squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the esophagus <xref rid="pcbi.1000730-Lichun1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> and SCC of the lung <xref rid="pcbi.1000730-Sato1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> suggesting a common somatic genetic lesion underlies the development of SCC of diverse tissue origin. The highly coordinated and nearly complete suppression of miR-204 and its host gene TRPM3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g001">Figure 1B&#8211;E</xref>) raises the possibility that TRPM3 mRNA expression may serve as a marker to indicate miR-204 expression status in HNSCC or other tumors, and also potentially LOH at 9q21.1&#8211;q22.3. Since a small variation in the expression of a specific microRNA is expected to affect the expression of tens or hundreds of target mRNAs, genetic variations in a microRNA expression at the chromosomal break point, as we observed with miR-204 at the 9q21.1&#8211;q22.3 locus, could represent an effective mechanism of cancer predisposition, a hypothesis that is supported by emerging experimental evidences <xref rid="pcbi.1000730-Calin1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000730-Sevignani1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.

Additionally, since its identification <xref rid="pcbi.1000730-LagosQuintana1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> biological characterization of miR-204 functions in normal development remain limited. Thus far, miR-204 was implicated in affecting global mRNA expression levels in the retina <xref rid="pcbi.1000730-Arora1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>; and was shown to regulate mesenchymal progenitor cell differentiation <xref rid="pcbi.1000730-Huang3" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>.</p><p>Through enrichment analysis and network modeling using mRNA gene expression profile, we identified a set of functionally related miR-204 targets that showed increased mRNA expression in HNSCC upon miR-204 suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g002">Figures 2A&#8211;C</xref>). The presence of miR-204 binding sites (Table 8 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000730.s002">Text S2</xref>), the coordinated up-regulation and the ability of increased miR-204 function to specifically inhibit the expression of 18 out of 21 gene targets (86%) (Figure 2D, Supporting Figures 4&#8211;5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000730.s001">Text S1</xref>) suggest that these predicted genes are very likely selective and direct miR-204 targets in HNSCC. This finding is consistent with the genome-wide association between microRNA binding sites and the ability of corresponding targeting microRNAs to alter their gene expression <xref rid="pcbi.1000730-Lim1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. This is the first report of a large set of functionally related cancer microRNA targets that was identified via high throughput computational approaches and confirmed biologically. In addition, the joint analyses of sequence-base information and mRNA expression arrays yielded an accuracy rate of 86% of miR-204 target predictions which surpasses the published accuracy (about 40%) of each sequence-based method when used alone <xref rid="pcbi.1000730-Lewis1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000730-John1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000730-GriffithsJones1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>.</p><p>More broadly, we demonstrated a computational framework for predicting altered regulatory networks and biological functions associated with differentially expressed microRNA targets. Indeed, our combined systems biology approach uncovered previously unknown connections between microRNA regulation, network topology, and expression dynamics for which we obtained thorough biological validations. While genome-scale analyses of interactions among microRNA gene targets in the context of a cellular or protein-protein interaction networks have been conducted computationally <xref rid="pcbi.1000730-Cui1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pcbi.1000730-Liang1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, such methods and observations await biological confirmation. Here we significantly extended the observations of two recent reports on network modeling <xref rid="pcbi.1000730-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000730-Pujana1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and demonstrated the feasibility and validity of deploying statistical and bioinformatics approaches to derive regulatory networks corresponding to altered expression of proteins targeted by microRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Further, combining functional enrichment analysis with network modeling leads to the unbiased prioritization of an EGFR-dependent protein regulatory network connected via up-regulated gene targets of microRNAs in human HNSCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Topological analyses of hub and bottleneck properties further identified key regulatory proteins within the EGFR network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g003">Figures 3A&#8211;B</xref>). miR-204 appeared critical to regulate the function of this &#8220;prioritized HNSCC PPIN&#8221; as its gene targets exhibited significant enrichment of hub and bottleneck properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g003">Figures 3A&#8211;B</xref>). Since the EGFR network was derived from overexpressed genes in HNSCC, the functional enrichment of its 56 proteins suggests their positive regulation of cell cycle, cell/matrix adhesion and extracellular matrix modeling. Using this approach, the biological effect of altering the function of a specific microRNA, such as miR-204, can be accurately predicted via its gene targets that are key regulators of a protein network. Accordingly, enhancement of miR-204 function inhibited the expression of its functionally related gene targets (Figure 2D, Supporting Figures 4&#8211;5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000730.s001">Text S1</xref>) in the &#8220;prioritized HNSCC PPIN&#8221; and lead to the reduced adhesion, migration and invasion <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g004">Figures 4A&#8211;C</xref>) and experimental lung metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g004">Figures 4D&#8211;F</xref>). Further, the strong association of overexpression of functional miR-204 gene targets with an earlier relapse in a sub-type of HNSCC tumors expressing an EGFR-pathway signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g005">Figure 5</xref>) suggests that miR-204 expression and its deregulated gene targets could be potentially used for mechanism-based prognostic stratification of HNSCC patients to complement the conventional clinical-pathological tumor diagnosis. In fact, the feasibility of employing microRNA as sensitive and informative biomarkers for molecular diagnosis has recently been demonstrated <xref rid="pcbi.1000730-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>.</p><p>Collectively, these findings show that single protein network modeling and statistical functional enrichment of a PPIN can illuminate altered complex biological processes and regulatory pathways associated with microRNA dysfunction in cancer with high precision.

Furthermore, our implementation of a link-randomization conserves the number of &#8220;connections&#8221; of each protein (node-degree <xref rid="pcbi.1000730-Barabasi1" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pcbi.1000730-Barabasi2" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>).

Each HNSCC protein was mapped to each of the rest HNSCC proteins according to existing pairs of protein interactions in the original PPIN yielding an Observed number of distinct <underline>P</underline>rotein <underline>I</underline>nteractions (Observed count of PI). Thereafter, the same procedure was applied to the 10,000 permuted PPINs yielding control counts of distinct protein <underline>i</underline>nteractions for each of the UG (Control count of PI). Since each HNSCC protein had a constant node degree in each permutation (see the previous paragraph), this procedure controlled properly for HNSCC proteins having more protein interactions than others thus providing no statistical advantage to those better connected proteins (such as hub or bottleneck proteins).
