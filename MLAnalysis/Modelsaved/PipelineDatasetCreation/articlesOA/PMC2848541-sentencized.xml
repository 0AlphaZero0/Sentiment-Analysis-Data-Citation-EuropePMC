</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Since the discovery of microRNAs as important regulators of broad biological processes [1]–[5], characterization of their functions in cancer has been hindered by lack of microRNA profiling information in tumors such as squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Previous reports show that only one or a few gene targets, identified among predicted or differentially expressed genes, were directly targeted by the microRNA under investigation [6]–[8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>While sequence-based computational algorithms have been applied for predicting all potential microRNA gene targets; false positive rates remains relatively high [9],[10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Further, sequence-based predictions are unable, by design, to account for biological contexts (e.g. cell and tissue types, normal or disease conditions) and thus are not optimized for predicting the biological function of genes targeted by cancer microRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Moreover, genome-scale and biological studies have yet to identify key regulatory networks perturbed by altered microRNA functions in cancer. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>To investigate microRNA function in HNSCC, we sought to develop an effective computational approach that is complementary to microRNA profiling and, in addition, is capable of simultaneously predicting tumor suppressor microRNAs as well as their functional targets from gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>In this report we illustrate how phenotypic knowledge of genetic disorders (OMIM database) can be utilized jointly with gene expression analyses to achieve this goal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Using this approach, we selected miR-204 among ten prioritized microRNAs for biological characterization, as miR-204 is located at the cancer-associated genomic region (CAGR) 9q21.1–q22.3 locus exhibiting high frequency of Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in human HNSCC [11]–[15], and a CAGR for which candidate tumor suppressor gene targets have not been identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we report the first computationally predicted and biologically validated microRNA-regulated network that is dependent on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) whose overexpression occurs in over 80% of head and neck cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>We further demonstrate that gene targets of miR-204 exhibit enriched bottleneck and hub network topology properties in a predicted protein-protein interaction network (PPIN). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we confirm the validity of our computational predictions of a microRNA function, as well as its gene targets and system's properties through conducting extensive and thorough biological characterization using a clinically relevant in vivo metastatic model of head and neck cancer. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>In summary, we show how such a high throughput system's strategy can accelerate the investigation of microRNA function in cancer by illustrating altered complex biological processes and regulatory pathways associated with microRNA dysfunction in cancer, by identifying among all putative microRNA gene targets only those that are dysregulated, and by elucidating molecular interactions underpinning microRNA regulation of malignant transformation and progression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The ability to characterize tumor suppressor microRNAs through a network analysis of mRNA expression datasets would be a major advance with potentially wide application. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Further, we provide experimental evidence linking microRNA function to the genetic risk of HNSCC. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>At the time of initiating this study, comprehensive analysis of microRNA expression profile in head and neck cancer (HNSCC) was not available and would have required time-consuming accruement of tumor tissues for conducting such analysis, a situation that is not limited to HNSCC research. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the development of a computational capability to simultaneously predict tumor suppressor microRNAs as well as their functional targets from more widely available genome-wide gene expression datasets could be an efficient reverse engineering approach for identifying deregulated microRNAs and their functional gene targets. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>We first developed IMRE, a statistical method to predict altered expression of microRNAs from genome-wide mRNA expression and putative microRNA targets databases (Supporting Figure 2 in Text S1, Materials and Methods). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>This strategy is based, in part, on the observations that at genome scale the expression of microRNAs and their direct mRNA targets are, in general, inversely correlated [16],[17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>To conduct this analysis, we integrated five complementary microRNA target databases to generate “miRNOME” that contains 534 human microRNAs and 17,343 microRNA gene targets (Materials and Methods, and Table 1 in Text S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>We validated this method using two independent cancer expression profiling experiments in GEO comprised of paired mRNA and microRNA expressions for tumors and normal tissue (GSE2564 [18]: multiple epithelial cancer; GSE8126 [19]: prostate cancer). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>IMRE-predicted downregulated microRNAs that are exclusively inferred from mRNA expression and microRNA targets datasets (Materials and Methods) were enriched in the expression analysis of the corresponding microRNA array dataset (GSE2564: P = 0.014; GSE8126: P = 0.0002 respectively, cumulative hypergeometric test, data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>A recent study also demonstrated the increased prediction specificity of microRNA and its gene target relationship via intersecting the results of multiple prediction algorithms [20]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, we applied the IMRE method to analyze two independent HNSCC mRNA microarray datasets for predicting deregulated microRNAs from genome-wide mRNA expression (Supporting Figure 2 in Text S1, Materials and Methods): first, the GSE6631 set that provides differential mRNA gene expression between 22 HNSCC non-microdissected patient tumor samples and their paired normal squamous tissues [21], and second, the GSE2379 [22] set that contains 34 micro-dissected node-positive HNSCC tumors of the hypopharynx. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>We noted that vast majority of the known microRNAs had at least one putative target in the top 500 deregulated genes of the HNSCC expression arrays (GSE6631), with a median of 19 targets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is unfeasible to manually select microRNA candidates from their deregulated targets for biological validation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Applying IMRE method to each dataset, we predicted a set of down-regulated microRNAs in HNSCC (113 and 43, respectively; FDR ≤0.05, Materials and Methods), of which 34 were consistently found in both prediction sets (P-value = 2.0×10−16, Fisher's exact test, Figure 1A and Table 2 in Text S2, FDR &lt;0.05, Materials and Methods). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Predictions of up-regulated microRNAs did not reach reproducible statistical significance (not shown). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>To further reduce the number of microRNAs to the most promising candidates for HNSCC, we conducted a statistical enrichment analysis of putative microRNA targets among inheritable cancer genes in the OMIM human disease gene database [Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/</ext-link> (downloaded Dec. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>1, 2006)]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>OMIM contains 610 biologically validated cancer genes among which 586 (96%) are predicted targets of 527 microRNAs in miRNOME. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>We observed that each of the 527 microRNAs could, on average, target 30 OMIM cancer genes (not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is also unfeasible to manually select microRNA candidates from OMIM cancer genes for biological validation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Our analyses identified 46 microRNAs significantly enriched in the inheritable cancer gene subset of OMIM in the miRNOME (Figure 1A; Table 3 in Text S2, Materials and Methods, Protocol S1/Section A, and Dataset S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Since microRNAs can be deregulated across cancers of different tissue origin [23], we performed a review of literature and confirmed the validity of these 46 predictions (OMIM; Supporting Figure 3 in Text S1, P = 0.039; cumulative hypergeometric test, Table 4 in Text S2, Materials and Methods). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, we reduced the list of candidates in HNSCC to ten microRNAs (Figure 1A) that were predicted in the HNSCC gene expression (34 microRNAs; Table 2 in Text S2) as well as in inheritable cancer genes (46 microRNAs; Table 3 in Text S2). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>We chose miR-204 among the ten prioritized microRNAs for thorough biological characterization based on the following considerations. First, miR-204 is located within the sixth intron of the host gene transient receptor potential melastatin 3 cation channel (TRPM3, NM_020952) and is transcribed in the same direction as TRPM3 [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>TRPM3 is located on human chromosome 9q21.11 that is within the 9q21.1–q22.3 locus exhibiting high frequency of Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in human HNSCC [11]–[15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>LOH at 9q21.1–q22.3 occurs in 37% of premalignant head and neck lesions, and increases to 67% in HNSCC [14]. Second, in addition to the genomic imbalance at 9q21.1–q22.3 locus, chromosomal aberrations occur most frequently at 3p, 5q, 9p, 11q and 17p in HNSCC [11],[12],[25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>With the exception of let-7g that is located at the 3p21 locus (note that let7g is also included in the class of microRNAs with related mature sequence “Let7/98”), the other 7 prioritized microRNAs are not in the cancer associated genomic regions (CAGRs).

<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>The presence of miR-204 binding sites (Table 8 in Text S2), the coordinated up-regulation and the ability of increased miR-204 function to specifically inhibit the expression of 18 out of 21 gene targets (86%) (Figure 2D, Supporting Figures 4–5 in Text S1) suggest that these predicted genes are very likely selective and direct miR-204 targets in HNSCC. </plain></SENT>
