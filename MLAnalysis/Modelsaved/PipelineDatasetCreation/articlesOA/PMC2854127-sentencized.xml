</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sulfur is incorporated into the backbone of almost all proteins in the form of the amino acids cysteine and methionine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In some proteins, sulfur is also present as iron–sulfur clusters, sulfur-containing vitamins, and cofactors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>What's more, sulfur is important in the structure of tRNAs, which are crucial for translation of the genetic code from messenger RNA for protein synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The biosynthetic pathways for assembly of these sulfur-containing molecules are generally well known, but the molecular details of how sulfur is delivered from protein to protein are less well understood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In bacteria, one of three pathways for sulfur delivery is the isc (iron-sulfur clusters) system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>First, an enzyme called IscS extracts sulfur atoms from cysteine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This versatile enzyme can then interact with several proteins to deliver sulfur to various pathways that make iron–sulfur clusters or transfer sulfur to cofactors and tRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This study describes in atomic detail precisely how IscS binds in a specific and yet distinct way to two different proteins: IscU (a scaffold protein for iron–sulfur cluster formation) and TusA (which delivers sulfur for tRNA modification). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, by introducing mutations into IscS, we have identified the region on the surface of this protein that is involved in binding its target proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>These findings provide a molecular view of the protein–protein interactions involved in sulfur transfer and advance our understanding of how sulfur is delivered from one protein to another during biosynthesis of iron–sulfur clusters. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Delivery of sulfur for these various biosynthetic pathways is a complex process, involving successive transfers of sulfur as persulfide between multiple proteins, many of which are highly conserved across species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Three distinct systems have been identified for the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters: isc, nif, and suf (reviewed in [1],[3]–[5]). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>It initiates intracellular sulfur trafficking, delivering the sulfur to several sulfur-accepting proteins such as IscU, ThiI, TusA, and MoaD/MoeB that commit the sulfur to different metabolic pathways, including iron-sulfur cluster assembly, thiamine and biotin synthesis, tRNA modifications, or molybdopterin biosynthesis [2],[3],[11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>IscU is the primary scaffold for assembly of Fe-S clusters [12] that are required by iron-sulfur proteins. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our data show that the sulfur acceptors IscU and TusA and ThiI can bind to IscS only one at a time and that the effectors/modulators CyaY/frataxin and IscX can form a ternary complex with IscS in the presence of IscU but not with TusA or ThiI. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>We have determined the structure of PLP-bound IscS at 2.05 Å resolution in a different crystal environment from that observed previously and have also found the Cys328IscS-containing loop extending away from the protein with its tip disordered. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>Next, the Cys328-carrying loop pivots around hinges located near Ser324 and Ser336, adopting the “open” conformation such that Cys328 can closely approach the cysteine of the acceptor protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>The conformation of the Cys328IscS loop in the IscS-TusA complex, with the donor and acceptor cysteines in close proximity, suggests that the observed conformation is close to that expected in a transfer-competent state (Figure 3A). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>In the complex with IscU the observed distance between Cys328IscS and the Cys residues of IscU is too long for a direct transfer (Figure S4), and consequently a conformational rearrangement is necessary to bring together the sulfur donor and acceptor cysteines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>Since most regions of IscS show no differences in the various crystal structures, either alone or complexed with acceptor proteins, and in view of the high flexibility/disorder of the Cys328 loop, we postulate that it is this loop that bends closer toward IscU in order to effect sulfur transfer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the observation of a disulfide linkage between Cys328IscS and Cys37IscU from Azotobacter vivendi [50] or with E. coli Cys63IscU [51] supports the notion that the Cys328 loop travels over a significant distance in order to interact with different partners. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>This implies that the flexibility of the Cys328 loop is crucial for the IscS ability to act as a shuttle in sulfur transfer and is consistent with the in vivo effects of mutations in the loop region of IscS on Fe-S cluster synthesis [21],[43],[44]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>Different binding partners utilize different parts of this docking surface and approach Cys328 from different directions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>The key to the ability of IscS to transfer persulfide sulfur to multiple acceptor proteins is the length and flexibility of the loop carrying Cys328. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>Indeed, superposition of the complexes shows that Cys19TusA and Cys37IscU are over 16 Å apart (Figure S4), yet both can accept sulfur from Cys328IscS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>The shorter loops carrying the active site cysteine in SufS and NifS are likely adapted for interaction with only a single acceptor protein, SufU and NifU, respectively, and may require the binding of this partner to trigger flipping of this loop from an inside conformation to an outside one. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>It is clear that IscS binds the monomeric form of apo-IscU, consistent with the model proposed by Shimomura et al. [31], and would be structurally inconsistent with binding of an IscU trimer containing an Fe-S cluster. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>It is also noteworthy that the binding site on IscU for the HscA chaperone, required for Fe-S cluster assembly or delivery from IscU to target proteins, may have some overlap with that for IscS since Lys103IscU was shown to be involved in HscA binding [52] and the K103IscUE mutation also disrupts the IscS-IscU complex (Figure S5A and Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>This argues against simultaneous binding of IscU to IscS and HscA and is consistent with a role for this chaperone in mediating delivery of the Fe-S cluster to recipient proteins. </plain></SENT>
