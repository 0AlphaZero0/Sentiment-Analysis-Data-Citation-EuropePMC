</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>IRP1 and IRP2 are homologous cytoplasmic proteins that post-transcriptionally regulate cellular iron metabolism [1], [2], [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In iron-starved cells, both IRPs are activated for binding to iron responsive elements (IREs) within the untranslated regions of several mRNAs and thereby modulate their stability or translation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Among other targets, IRPs control the expression of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and ferritin, which are key proteins of cellular iron uptake and storage, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The binding of IRPs stabilizes TfR1 mRNA and inhibits translation of H- and L-ferritin mRNAs, promoting homeostatic adaptation to iron deficiency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Likewise, IRPs control the stability or translation of IRE-containing mRNA isoforms of the iron transporters DMT1 [4] and ferroportin [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>IRPs are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues and share at least some degree of functional redundancy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>This is evident from the early embryonic lethality at the blastocyst stage, associated with the ablation of both IRP1 and IRP2 in mice [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Moreover, conditional disruption of both IRP1 and IRP2 in the mouse intestine elicits severe fatal pathology in this organ [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, single IRP1-/- or IRP2-/- knockout mice are viable [8], [9], [10], [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, it appears that IRP2 has a more dominant role in vivo, considering that IRP1-/- mice are healthy [8], while IRP2-/- counterparts develop microcytic anemia [9], [11] and neurodegeneration [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In agreement with these findings, silencing experiments in HeLa cells identified IRP2 as the major regulator of TfR1 and ferritin mRNA expression, without, however, excluding a contribution of IRP1 [12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In iron-replete cells, IRP1 assembles a cubane [4Fe-4S] cluster and acquires enzymatic function as cytosolic aconitase, at the expense of its RNA-binding activity [1], [2], while IRP2 undergoes ubiquitination by the E3 ligase FBXL5 and degradation by the proteasome [13], [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Conversely, iron starvation triggers a switch of IRP1 from cytosolic aconitase to an IRE-binding protein by loss of its [4Fe-4S] cluster, and promotes stabilization of IRP2 following degradation of FBXL5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The iron-dependent [4Fe-4S] cluster switch of IRP1 readily occurs under standard cell culture conditions with 21% oxygen, but appears less efficient al lower (3%–6%) oxygen levels that likely reflect physiological tissue oxygenation [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In line with this notion, IRP1 is predominantly expressed as aconitase in animal tissues, and only a small fraction is activated for IRE-binding in response to iron deficiency [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>These findings support the idea that in vivo, the expression of major IRE-containing mRNAs, such as those encoding TfR1 and ferritin, is primarily regulated by IRP2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>IRP1 may serve as a potential reservoir for further IRE-binding activity, but possibly also exert more specialized functions for the control of other IRE-containing transcripts [17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Considering that iron is essential for cell proliferation [18], we previously hypothesized that manipulations in the IRE/IRP system to misregulate iron homeostasis may affect tumor growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>To address this, we utilized human H1299 lung cancer cells engineered for tetracycline-inducible expression of an IRP1 transgene, and assessed their capacity to form tumor xenografts in nude mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>We reported that the overexpression of IRP1 (either wild type, or a mutant carrying a C437S substitution that has constitutive IRE-binding activity) drastically inhibits the growth of tumor xenografts, without grossly affecting their iron content [19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Here, we examine the effects of IRP2 in this model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>We show that overexpression of IRP2 elicits an opposite phenotype and profoundly stimulates tumor growth, even though both IRPs appear to regulate IRE-containing mRNAs within the tumors in a similar manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>In addition, we provide evidence that the tumor-promoting activity of IRP2 requires its specific insert of 73 amino acids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Finally, we identify distinct gene expression patterns between control tumors and those overexpressing IRP2 or IRP1, that may account for their differential growth phenotypes. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>To better understand the requirements for the apparent pro-oncogenic activity of IRP2, we evaluated the performance of HIRP2Δ73 cells, overexpressing the IRP2Δ73 deletion mutant, in the tumorigenicity assay. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Thus, in contrast to wild type protein, IRP2Δ73 failed to drastically stimulate tumor growth and increase tumor mass and size (Fig. 1), suggesting that the 73 amino acids insert of IRP2 is necessary for its apparent pro-oncogenic function. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, this insert also accounts for differential anchorage-independent growth characteristics between HIRP2wt and HIRP2Δ73 cells in soft agar. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>To address whether the 73 amino acids insert of IRP2 suffices to elicit pro-oncogenic responses in vivo, we employed HIRP2ΔD4 and HIRP2ΔD4/−73d cells for the tumorigenicity assay in nude mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>These cells express an inactive truncated version of IRP2, lacking the entire C-terminal domain 4, in the presence (IRP2ΔD4) or absence (IRP2ΔD4/−73d) of the 73 amino acids insert (Fig. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Prompted by the inhibitory effects of IRP1 in tumor xenograft growth in nude mice [19], we examined the role of IRP2 in this setting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>The data in Fig. 1 show that IRP2 triggers opposite responses and profoundly promotes tumor growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Importantly, a causal relationship is established by the reversion of this phenotype with tetracycline, that efficiently turns off the expression of the IRP2 transgene in vivo (Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Even though the administration of tetracycline clearly inhibited the pro-oncogenic function of IRP2, the respective tumors were not growing as slow as controls (compare Figs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>1 and 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>These small differences may be related to experimental variability and/or minimal leakiness of the tetracycline promoter (undetectable by immunoblotting). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the wild type protein, the deletion mutant IRP2Δ73 that lacks an IRP2-specific insert of 73 amino acids, failed to stimulate tumor growth in the xenograft model (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the ratios of tumor volumes to the expression of HA-tagged IRP2wt and IRP2Δ73 (Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>S3A) excludes the possibility that this is due to the relatively reduced expression of the mutant in tumors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>The IRP2-specific insert appears to be unstructured [25] and, contrary to earlier assumptions, is dispensable for iron-dependent degradation of the protein [13], [14], [20], [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Our data provide strong evidence that the 73 amino acids insert confers an apparent pro-oncogenic activity to IRP2, and assign for the first time a functional role for this unique sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>The differential anchorage-independent growth phenotypes of H1299 cells expressing either IRP2Δ73 or IRP2wt (Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>S1) also imply a functional significance of this sequence in cell proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the 73 amino acids insert failed to accelerate tumor xenograft growth when expressed outside the context of full-length and functional IRP2 (Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Thus, the 73 amino acids insert is necessary but not sufficient to elicit pro-oncogenic responses in vivo. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Tumors derived from IRP2-overexpressing cells, as well as these cells in culture, maintained high levels of IRP2 at the experimental endpoint and exhibited an upregulation of TfR1 mRNA and protein (Figs. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, while IRP2Δ73 was likewise highly expressed, it failed to upregulate TfR1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Considering that this deletion mutant exhibits IRE-binding activity in vitro with a ferritin IRE-probe (Figs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>4 and 5), we speculate that it may bind with reduced affinity to TfR1 IREs in vivo. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the presence of the IRP2wt (or IRP2Δ73) transgene did not affect the expression of ferritin neither in xenografts, nor in cultured cells (Figs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>4 and 5), even though IRPs are well-established inhibitors of ferritin mRNA translation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Since the tumor xenografts consist primarily of H1299 cells (Fig. 3), it is unlikely that a putative repressor activity of IRP2 is masked by high ferritin levels in stroma cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>In addition, no IRP2-dependent alteration in ferritin mRNA levels was observed, that could antagonize and mitigate the expected translational repression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Similar unexpected findings were previously documented in tumor xenografts overexpressing IRP1 [19], while the overexpression of IRP1 only conditionally suppressed ferritin mRNA translation in cultured H1299 cells grown at low densities [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that at higher cell densities, ferritin mRNA bypassed the inhibitory activity of tetracycline-inducible IRP1 and was efficiently translated [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Analogous results were obtained with tetracycline-inducible IRP2, when HIRP2wt cells were freshly generated (Guohua Chen and Kostas Pantopoulos, unpublished observations). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>However, after several years of maintenance of the cell lines in the lab, we are unable to observe any repression of ferritin synthesis by IRP2 (or IRP1) at low cell densities (Fig. 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>We suspect that the cells have adapted to the presence of exogenous IRP2 (or IRP1), even under suppressive conditions with tetracycline, presumably due to low leakiness of the tetracycline promoter. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>The data in Fig. 6 indicate that within the tumor xenograft, IRP2 (or IRP2Δ73) may also fail to control the expression of other IRE-containing mRNAs, such as those encoding DMT1, ferroportin and CDC14A. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that all these proteins are encoded by non-IRE-containing mRNA isoforms, generated by alternative splicing [4], [5], [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>The absence of any IRP2-dependent alterations in VEGF levels may suggest that the H1299 cells primarily express HIF-1α, that is unresponsive to IRPs. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>We noted that the expression of the IRP2 transgene in tumor xenografts was associated with increased levels of the c-MYC oncogene, as well as with increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Figs. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>This was not the case with IRP2Δ73, even though a trend towards higher c-MYC content was evident in IRP2Δ73-related tumors, without reaching statistical significance. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Our cDNA microarray analysis did not show any increase in c-MYC mRNA levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Thus, we speculate that the IRP2-dependent increase in c-MYC protein content may be related, at least partially, with stabilization of this protein following phosphorylation by ERK1/2 [28]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>The IRP2-dependent increase in c-MYC levels deserves particular attention, considering that IRP2 is a direct transcriptional target of c-MYC [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Our data are consistent with a regulatory feedback loop between c-MYC and IRP2 that controls tumor growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>It was proposed that the c-MYC-mediated transcriptional activation of IRP2, and concomitant transcriptional and translational suppression of H-ferritin by c-MYC and IRP2, respectively, contribute to cell transformation by increasing the intracellular iron pool [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>In the tumor xenograft model presented here, the pro-oncogenic properties of IRP2 are independent of its capacity to regulate ferritin expression and tumor iron levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>In line with this notion, the tumor suppressor phenotype associated with IRP1 overexpression in tumor xenografts was also independent of ferritin and iron levels [19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our data provide strong evidence that the apparent pro-oncogenic activity of IRP2 is unrelated to the established function of this protein as regulator of several known IRE-containing mRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>The cDNA microarray analysis (Fig. 7) demonstrates that the overexpression of either IRP2 or IRP1 transgenes is associated with distinct gene expression patterns in tumors, that may account for their strikingly opposite growth phenotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our data suggest that the unique 73 amino acids insert confers to IRP2 pro-oncogenic potential and is essential for accelerated tumor growth. </plain></SENT>
