Here we report that XGIPC/kermit2 binds to the cytoplasmic domain of the &#945;5 subunit and regulates the activity of &#945;5&#946;1 integrin. The interaction of kermit2 with &#945;5&#946;1 is essential for fibronectin (FN) matrix assembly during the early stages of gastrulation. We further demonstrate that kermit2 regulates &#945;5&#946;1 integrin endocytosis downstream of activin signaling. Inhibition of kermit2 function impairs cell migration but not adhesion to FN substrates indicating that integrin recycling is essential for mesoderm cell migration. Furthermore, we find that the &#945;5&#946;1 integrin is colocalized with kermit2 and Rab 21 in embryonic and XTC cells. These data support a model where region specific mesoderm induction acts through kermit2 to regulate the temporally and spatially restricted changes in adhesive properties of the &#945;5&#946;1 integrin through receptor endocytosis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell adhesion is central to many biological processes including development, cancer metastasis, and wound healing. Integrin heterodimers are key regulators of cell adhesion and the interaction of cell surface integrin receptors with the extracellular matrix (ECM) has been well characterized <xref rid="pone.0010665-Hynes1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Most integrins exist on the cell surface in a low affinity state and through various stimuli can be activated to a high affinity state that promotes cell adhesion <xref rid="pone.0010665-Banno1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Once activated, integrins are capable of promoting both ECM assembly as well as cell migration on ECM substrates. However, the presence of activated integrins at the cell surface is not sufficient to drive cell migration and there is growing evidence that endocytic recycling of activated integrins is a key step in regulating cell adhesion <xref rid="pone.0010665-Pellinen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>In the <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> embryo the &#945;5&#946;1 integrin plays a number of critical roles during gastrulation. Cells of the blastocoel roof use &#945;5&#946;1 to assemble a fibronectin (FN) matrix just prior to gastrulation <xref rid="pone.0010665-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0010665-Ramos2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.

As the expression of &#945;5&#946;1 integrin is ubiquitous in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryo, the differential use of &#945;5&#946;1 by ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm suggests that this integrin exists in multiple activation states. Animal cap ectodermal cells adhere to the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence of Central Cell Binding Domain (CCBD) of FN. Treatment of ectodermal cells with activin induces a mesodermal cell fate and results in cell spreading and migration on FN <xref rid="pone.0010665-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> using the RGD sequence in conjunction with the neighboring synergy site <xref rid="pone.0010665-Ramos1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010665-Aota1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010665-Bowditch1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The spreading and migration of activin-treated ectodermal cells on FN occurs with same temporal regulation as observed in involuted mesoderm cells, indicating that in the embryo activation of the &#945;5&#946;1 integrin is under strict temporal and spatial regulation <xref rid="pone.0010665-Ramos2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Several lines of evidence point to the cytoplasmic domains of both the &#945; and &#946; integrin subunits as being required for integrin activation in <italic>Xenopus</italic>. Expression of a &#946;1 cytoplasmic domain dominant negative construct interferes with both FN assembly and activin induced cell migration <xref rid="pone.0010665-Marsden1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Chimeric integrin molecules consisting of the &#945;4 extra-cellular domain and a variety of &#945; subunit cytoplasmic domains reveal that while a number of &#945; subunit cytoplasmic domains can substitute in cell adhesion, the &#945;6 and &#945;5 cytoplasmic domains are uniquely necessary for FN assembly <xref rid="pone.0010665-Na1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>As &#945;5 and &#945;6 cytoplasmic domains confer the ability to assemble FN and both contain a C terminal Class I PDZ binding motif we decided to ask what role this domain plays in <italic>Xenopus</italic> development. GIPC, a PDZ domain-containing protein, has previously been identified as interacting with the PDZ binding motif of the mammalian &#945;5 and &#945;6 integrin subunits <xref rid="pone.0010665-ElMourabit1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010665-Tani1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.

GIPC also acts as a scaffolding protein, interacting with itself and other proteins through regions outside its PDZ domain. Recently, Valdembri et al. (2009) demonstrated that GIPC provides a link between the VEGF co-receptor neuropilin and &#945;5&#946;1 integrin in endothelial cells. The interaction of nrp-1, &#945;5&#946;1, and GIPC results in the rapid turnover of activated &#945;5&#946;1 in migrating cells <xref rid="pone.0010665-Valdembri1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Their results suggest that GIPC may function to cluster cell surface receptors within specific domains effectively compartmentalizing the components of signal transduction pathways.</p><p>In <italic>Xenopus</italic> the only studies examining the role of GIPC addressed the interaction between XGIPC/kermit2 and the IGF receptor <xref rid="pone.0010665-Booth1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010665-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Here we look at the interactions between kermit2 and the &#945;5 and &#945;6 integrin subunits. We demonstrate that kermit2 binds the cytoplasmic domain of the &#945;5 and &#945;6 integrin subunits, and that the interaction with &#945;5&#946;1 results in receptor endocytosis during activin induced cell migration.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>The adhesive activity of the &#945;5&#946;1 integrin is regulated in both time and space during <italic>Xenopus</italic> development.

Embryos over-expressing kermit2 close their blastopores normally and assemble a dense FN ECM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010665-g002">Figure 2B, F</xref>).

Taken together these results indicate that normal kermit2 function mediated through the PDZ binding domain is required for FN matrix assembly and gastrulation. In situ hybridizations with an Xbra probe reveal that defects in gastrulation are not due to deficits in mesodermal patterning but likely stem from defects in convergent extension due to a disrupted FN matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010665-g002">Figure 2G&#8211;I</xref>).

Here we show a similar interaction exists in <italic>Xenopus</italic>. Kermit2 interacts strongly with both the &#945;5 and &#945;6 subunits that have a Type1 recognition sequence, but not with the &#945;V subunit that lacks such a sequence. The &#945;6 subunit contains a canonical Type I recognitions sequence, TSDA, and has the highest affinity for kermit2. The &#945;5 subunit has a C-terminal ASEA sequence substituting the aspartic acid at position -2 with a conserved glutamic acid and also has a non-polar alanine in the place of polar threonine at position -3. Tani et al. (2001) have reported that substitution of a non-polar amino acid at position -3 in the human &#945;6A cytoplasmic domain reduces the interactions with GIPC by 60%. This is similar to the difference in the affinity of the &#945;5 and &#945;6 domains that we observe in our two-hybrid assays.</p><p>While we found that there are substantial amounts of kermit2 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos our GST pull downs and coimmunoprecipitations suggest that only a small fraction of kermit2 in the embryo is competent to bind to endogenous &#945;5&#946;1 integrin. Similarly, Liu et al. (2001) found that while GIPC is essential for steady surface expression of gp75, very little GIPC is found associated with gp75 in immunoprecipitates. A possible explanation for the low yield of GIPC in immunprecipitates was suggested by Versano et al. (2006) <xref rid="pone.0010665-Varsano1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. They demonstrate that the interaction between the nerve growth factor receptor, TrkA and GIPC is transient and restricted to the cell periphery. We also find that kermit2 associated with integrin &#945;5&#946;1 is predominantly found in vesicular structures that are proximal to sites of ECM adhesion in cultured cells, or localized to the periphery of embryonic cells. This restricted temporal and spatial sub-cellular window of interaction may well account for the low yields of GIPC in our IP's and pull down experiments. It is remarkable that while we see restricted interactions between kermit2 and &#945;5&#946;1, the dominant negative kermit2 construct is effective at abolishing cell migration. This may reflect the system we are using as <italic>Xenopus</italic> cells are large and display relatively small lamellipodial protrusions and hence have only a small adhesive footprint. Small differences in adhesion may well have dramatic overall effects on cell morphology. Interestingly, interfering with kermit2 function does not decrease cell adhesion but does eliminate lamellipodia and cell migration suggesting it may only be acting on activated &#945;5&#946;1 integrin. We do not have the reagents to directly assess &#945;5&#946;1activation, however activin-signaling drives increased endocytosis of &#945;5&#946;1in a kermit2 dependant manner, and the AEEL mutation in kermit2 interferes with embryonic cell behaviors that can be directly attributed to integrin activation.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Kermit2 and Mesoderm Cell Migration</title><p>Our results demonstrate that in activin induced mesodermal cells kermit2 mediates changes in integrin &#945;5&#946;1 regulated cell motility.

Embryonic <italic>Xenopus</italic> cells do not form clearly defined structures such as focal adhesions making description of adhesive sites difficult. However, at sites where we observe integrin accumulation we also see Rab 21/&#945;5&#946;1 and kermit2/&#945;5&#946;1positive vesicles. Moreover, in cultured cells we see accumulation of Rab 21/&#945;5&#946;1 and kermit2/&#945;5&#946;1 positive vesicles at focal adhesions. This suggests that there is a feed back loop between integrin activation, adhesion, and recycling functionally tying inside-out and outside-in integrin signaling. Valembri et al. (2009)implicate nrp1 in a complex with &#945;5&#946;1as a requirement for integrin endocytosis downstream of FN adhesion. We have not identified a specific partner protein in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, however, &#945;5&#946;1 immunoprecipitates from activin-induced adherent cells contain a 35 KDa protein that is biotin labeled at the cell surface and endocytosed with the &#945;5&#946;1integrin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0010665.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Interestingly, we observe the opposite situation for &#945;V containing integrins in which a 55 KDa protein coimmunoprecipitates in non-adherent cells and is lost in immunoprecipitates from adherent cells (supplemental material S3). We are presently pursuing the identity of these proteins and it is interesting to speculate that their presence is directly related to receptor activation and or recycling. Another possibility for the change in behavior we see following adhesion to FN is that integrin cross talk stimulates receptor endocytosis <xref rid="pone.0010665-PijuanThompson1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The &#945;V&#946;3 integrin is expressed in the early embryo and perhaps it acts to regulate the recycling of the &#945;5&#946;1 receptor down stream of FN assembly in a manner similar to that described by White et al.

Testing of these ideas awaits the development of a specific inhibitor for the &#945;V containing integrins in <italic>Xenopus</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>FN Assembly vs. Cell Migration</title><p>Disrupting kermit2 interactions with &#945;5&#946;1affects both FN matrix assembly and mesendoderm cell migration without affecting the ability of cells to adhere to FN. While it is not difficult to reconcile integrin recycling with cell migration it is unclear what role kermit2 plays in FN matrix assembly. FN matrix assembly in <italic>Xenopus</italic> has been proposed to stem from increased tension across the blastocoel roof independent of integrin expression <xref rid="pone.0010665-Dzamba1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> suggesting stable surface expression of integrin &#945;5&#946;1 is required. Furthermore, the assembly of FN is inhibited by antibodies that block &#945;5&#946;1 interactions with the synergy site of FN indicating that activated integrin is essential for FN assembly <xref rid="pone.0010665-Ramos2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. FN can be assembled by chimeric integrins that do not recognize the synergy site, however, only the &#945;6 and &#945;5 cytoplasmic domains, that contain the Type I PDZ recognition motif recognized by kermit2, confer the ability to assemble FN matrix <xref rid="pone.0010665-Na1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Since this critical cytoplasmic PDZ domain is essential it may be that kermit2 is required to export activated integrin &#945;5&#946;1 or retain integrin on the surface of pre-gastrula stage cells facilitating FN assembly. Such a temporally restricted role has been described in melanoma cells where GIPC is required to move gp75 from the golgi to the cell membrane <xref rid="pone.0010665-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Alternatively, the scaffolding role of kermit2 may be essential to the regulation of &#945;5&#946;1 mediated FN assembly. Experiments that decrease expression of GIPC in endothelial cells prevent FN matrix assembly, a process dependant on GIPC mediated interactions between &#945;5&#946;1 and nrp1 <xref rid="pone.0010665-Valdembri1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Multiple Roles For kermit2</title><p>Previous publications using morpholino knockdowns did not describe an early role for kermit2 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> development. However, it is clear in these studies that MO knockdowns produce a variety of phenotypes in morphant embryos, including deficits in axial extension <xref rid="pone.0010665-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Our experiments with morpholinos also demonstrate there is considerable variation in the axial extension of morphant embryos, although the defects in anterior neural and eye development are always robust. We show that kermit2 is present as maternal protein and morpholino knockdowns only reduce kermit2 protein levels by about 50% through gastrulation. When we combine the MO with the dominant negative construct embryos resemble those obtained with the dominant negative construct alone suggesting the MO only partially inhibits kermit2 function during gastrulation. This indicates that kermit2 protein levels are partially regulated through translation of zygotic transcripts but that maternal protein is likely still functional during gastrulation. Our interpretation of these observations is that kermit2 regulates cell surface turnover over of a variety of receptors, including &#945;5&#946;1 integrin. The morpholino begins to impinge on kermit2 expression at gastrulation when &#945;5&#946;1 regulates both FN assembly as well as cell movements <xref rid="pone.0010665-Marsden1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. As there is considerable variation in the timing of FN assembly and mesoderm movements in individual <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos, the morpholinos may only affect a subset of embryos in which these processes occur relatively late and maternal kermit2 expression cannot compensate for the morpholino inhibition of zygotic kermit2 expression. This would produce embryos in which FN assembly and cell movements are inhibited resulting in a truncated AP axis. In embryos in which FN assembly and cell movements take place earlier, the morpholino would have less effect and maternal kermit2 is present in high enough levels to traffic integrin. These embryos would show a more dominant anterior neural defect and less axial defects. While speculative such a scenario is supported by the observation that the dominant negative construct affects not only FN assembly and cell movements, but also anterior neural development later in embryogenesis. Due to the promiscuous binding of kermit2 to many known target molecules we cannot completely eliminate the possibility that the defects we observe are due to multiple interactions. Despite this it is clear that kermit2 can regulate integrin activity, and that the dominant negative construct produce embryo phenotypes that closely resemble those obtained when FN assembly <xref rid="pone.0010665-Marsden1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010665-Marsden2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> and integrin function are inhibited <xref rid="pone.0010665-Davidson1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.</p><p>There is a closely related Kermit molecule expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos that regulates neural crest induction <xref rid="pone.0010665-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. The similarity between kermit and kermit2 brings up the possibility that the kermit2mut construct inhibits the function of kermit. The design of our dominant negative construct blocks interactions between the PDZ binding domain in kermit2 and the PDZ domain of its partners and therefore should have no inhibitory effect on kermit function. Furthermore, kermit/GIPC family members act through the linking of protein complexes outside of the PDZ binding domain and the diversity in sequence between Kermit and kermit2 indicates there should not be any functional redundancy. Indeed, there is no evidence for redundant roles for closely related kermit proteins <xref rid="pone.0010665-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>In <italic>Xenopus</italic> kermit2 was originally isolated as a binding partner for the IGF receptor <xref rid="pone.0010665-Booth1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and has been implicated in regulating IGF signaling through interactions with the IGF receptor <xref rid="pone.0010665-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. As IGF is known as a potent regulator of integrin function the possibility existed that our observations stemmed from disruptions in IGF signaling <xref rid="pone.0010665-Legate1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010665-Saegusa1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. A dominant negative IGFR previously shown to block IGF signaling had no effect on FN assembly. We see minor delays in blastopore closure and axial extension, however, by the end of gastrulation embryos appear normal. This suggests that our results with kermit2 do not stem from an inhibition of IGF signaling. Previously kermit2 has been described as acting primarily in the anterior neural plate. It is interesting that the strongest interaction we described in yeast two-hybrid assays is between kermit2 and the &#945;6 integrin subunit that is also expressed in the developing central nervous system. We are now looking at the potential interactions between the &#945;6&#946;1 integrin, IGFR-1, and kermit2 in the neural plate.</p><p>In mammals GIPC is known to regulate TGF-&#946; signaling through interactions with the type III receptor <xref rid="pone.0010665-Blobe1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. A type III receptor homologue has not been characterized in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and we see no effect on mesoderm patterning or gene expression levels indicating that it is unlikely that our results stem from disruptions in TGF-&#946; family member signaling.</p><p>In summary we propose that kermit2 is involved in the region specific activation of integrin &#945;5&#946;1. Here we demonstrate that kermit2 interacts with the &#945;5&#946;1 integrin and that this interaction is required for receptor endocytosis and cell migration. Kermit2 function is mediated partially through activin signaling, although previous evidence suggests this in unlikely to be directly linked to mesoderm patterning. As receptor endocytosis is also influenced by interactions with FN our results suggest that kermit2 is at the nexus of several signaling pathways regulating integrin recycling. The turnover of &#945;5&#946;1 may be required for keeping a population of activated integrins on the surface of cells during gastrulation, a time when several integrin-mediated events are of importance. These include both inside-out signaling during FN assembly, as well as outside-in signaling during cellular rearrangements.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All animals were handled in strict accordance with good animal practice as defined by the University of Waterloo Office of Research Ethics.
