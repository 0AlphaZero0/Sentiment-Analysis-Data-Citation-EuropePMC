<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Integrin heterodimers are key regulators of cell adhesion and the interaction of cell surface integrin receptors with the extracellular matrix (ECM) has been well characterized [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Most integrins exist on the cell surface in a low affinity state and through various stimuli can be activated to a high affinity state that promotes cell adhesion [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Once activated, integrins are capable of promoting both ECM assembly as well as cell migration on ECM substrates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>However, the presence of activated integrins at the cell surface is not sufficient to drive cell migration and there is growing evidence that endocytic recycling of activated integrins is a key step in regulating cell adhesion [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In the Xenopus laevis embryo the α5β1 integrin plays a number of critical roles during gastrulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Cells of the blastocoel roof use α5β1 to assemble a fibronectin (FN) matrix just prior to gastrulation [4]–[6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Upon the initiation of gastrulation involuted mesoderm cells use α5β1 integrin to adhere and migrate directionally on this FN matrix [7]–[9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>As the expression of α5β1 integrin is ubiquitous in the Xenopus embryo, the differential use of α5β1 by ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm suggests that this integrin exists in multiple activation states. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Animal cap ectodermal cells adhere to the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence of Central Cell Binding Domain (CCBD) of FN. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Treatment of ectodermal cells with activin induces a mesodermal cell fate and results in cell spreading and migration on FN [10] using the RGD sequence in conjunction with the neighboring synergy site [5], [11], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The spreading and migration of activin-treated ectodermal cells on FN occurs with same temporal regulation as observed in involuted mesoderm cells, indicating that in the embryo activation of the α5β1 integrin is under strict temporal and spatial regulation [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Several lines of evidence point to the cytoplasmic domains of both the α and β integrin subunits as being required for integrin activation in Xenopus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Expression of a β1 cytoplasmic domain dominant negative construct interferes with both FN assembly and activin induced cell migration [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Chimeric integrin molecules consisting of the α4 extra-cellular domain and a variety of α subunit cytoplasmic domains reveal that while a number of α subunit cytoplasmic domains can substitute in cell adhesion, the α6 and α5 cytoplasmic domains are uniquely necessary for FN assembly [14]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>As α5 and α6 cytoplasmic domains confer the ability to assemble FN and both contain a C terminal Class I PDZ binding motif we decided to ask what role this domain plays in Xenopus development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>GIPC, a PDZ domain-containing protein, has previously been identified as interacting with the PDZ binding motif of the mammalian α5 and α6 integrin subunits [15], [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>GIPC has been demonstrated to interact with multiple trans-membrane proteins with Class I PDZ binding motifs including Tax [17], TrkA [18], Glut-1 [19], SemaF [20], neuropilin [21], syndecan [22], gp75 [23], and the NMDA receptor [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>GIPC also acts as a scaffolding protein, interacting with itself and other proteins through regions outside its PDZ domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Recently, Valdembri et al. (2009) demonstrated that GIPC provides a link between the VEGF co-receptor neuropilin and α5β1 integrin in endothelial cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The interaction of nrp-1, α5β1, and GIPC results in the rapid turnover of activated α5β1 in migrating cells [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Their results suggest that GIPC may function to cluster cell surface receptors within specific domains effectively compartmentalizing the components of signal transduction pathways. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>The gastrula stage Xenopus embryo provides a convenient assay for α5β1 integrin function as both the assembly of FN and the cell movements that depend upon FN matrix are well characterized [27]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Kermit2mut acts as a dominant negative as embryos fail to close their blastopores, and have a dramatic decrease in FN matrix lining the blastocoel roof (Figure 2C, F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Taken together these results indicate that normal kermit2 function mediated through the PDZ binding domain is required for FN matrix assembly and gastrulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridizations with an Xbra probe reveal that defects in gastrulation are not due to deficits in mesodermal patterning but likely stem from defects in convergent extension due to a disrupted FN matrix (Figure 2G–I). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Kermit2 and kermit2mut expressing embryos have similar amounts of FN indicating that the lack of FN matrix assembly is not due to a decrease in FN protein abundance (Figure 2K). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>FN matrix assembly in Xenopus has been proposed to stem from increased tension across the blastocoel roof independent of integrin expression [42] suggesting stable surface expression of integrin α5β1 is required. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the assembly of FN is inhibited by antibodies that block α5β1 interactions with the synergy site of FN indicating that activated integrin is essential for FN assembly [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>FN can be assembled by chimeric integrins that do not recognize the synergy site, however, only the α6 and α5 cytoplasmic domains, that contain the Type I PDZ recognition motif recognized by kermit2, confer the ability to assemble FN matrix [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>Since this critical cytoplasmic PDZ domain is essential it may be that kermit2 is required to export activated integrin α5β1 or retain integrin on the surface of pre-gastrula stage cells facilitating FN assembly. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>However, it is clear in these studies that MO knockdowns produce a variety of phenotypes in morphant embryos, including deficits in axial extension [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>Our experiments with morpholinos also demonstrate there is considerable variation in the axial extension of morphant embryos, although the defects in anterior neural and eye development are always robust. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>We show that kermit2 is present as maternal protein and morpholino knockdowns only reduce kermit2 protein levels by about 50% through gastrulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>When we combine the MO with the dominant negative construct embryos resemble those obtained with the dominant negative construct alone suggesting the MO only partially inhibits kermit2 function during gastrulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>This indicates that kermit2 protein levels are partially regulated through translation of zygotic transcripts but that maternal protein is likely still functional during gastrulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>Our interpretation of these observations is that kermit2 regulates cell surface turnover over of a variety of receptors, including α5β1 integrin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>The morpholino begins to impinge on kermit2 expression at gastrulation when α5β1 regulates both FN assembly as well as cell movements [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>As there is considerable variation in the timing of FN assembly and mesoderm movements in individual Xenopus embryos, the morpholinos may only affect a subset of embryos in which these processes occur relatively late and maternal kermit2 expression cannot compensate for the morpholino inhibition of zygotic kermit2 expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>This would produce embryos in which FN assembly and cell movements are inhibited resulting in a truncated AP axis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>In embryos in which FN assembly and cell movements take place earlier, the morpholino would have less effect and maternal kermit2 is present in high enough levels to traffic integrin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>These embryos would show a more dominant anterior neural defect and less axial defects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>While speculative such a scenario is supported by the observation that the dominant negative construct affects not only FN assembly and cell movements, but also anterior neural development later in embryogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>Due to the promiscuous binding of kermit2 to many known target molecules we cannot completely eliminate the possibility that the defects we observe are due to multiple interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>Despite this it is clear that kermit2 can regulate integrin activity, and that the dominant negative construct produce embryo phenotypes that closely resemble those obtained when FN assembly [13], [43] and integrin function are inhibited [44]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>The design of our dominant negative construct blocks interactions between the PDZ binding domain in kermit2 and the PDZ domain of its partners and therefore should have no inhibitory effect on kermit function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, kermit/GIPC family members act through the linking of protein complexes outside of the PDZ binding domain and the diversity in sequence between Kermit and kermit2 indicates there should not be any functional redundancy. </plain></SENT>
