</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>‘How good is this sample?’ and ‘How well does the model fit the data?’ are pertinent questions throughout the process of structure solution, driving critical experimental decisions even at the initial step of eliciting the crystal lattice from the raw diffraction image. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Algorithms for determining and refining the lattice description are well understood, and are implemented by many data-processing packages such as MOSFLM (Leslie, 1999 ▶), HKL (Otwinowski &amp; Minor, 1997 ▶), XDS (Kabsch, 2010a  ▶,b  ▶) and d*TREK (Pflugrath, 1999 ▶). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Generally, candidate Bragg spots are selected from the diffraction image and their observed laboratory coordinates are converted into reciprocal space by an appropriate geometric construction (Arndt &amp; Wonacott, 1977 ▶; reviewed by Dauter, 1999 ▶). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Lattice periodicity is detected by one of several autoindexing procedures (e.g. Steller et al., 1997 ▶), leading to a lattice model with nine degrees of freedom: three unit-cell lengths, three unit-cell angles and three librations of the lattice with respect to the laboratory axes (Fig. 1 ▶ a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The predictive power of the lattice model makes accurate data integration possible; in particular, it is used to deduce image coordinates for all of the reflections (Rossmann &amp; van Beek, 1999 ▶), even those with a low intensity level that would not otherwise be distinguishable from the background level. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The unit-cell model, or rather seven of its nine degrees of freedom (cell lengths, cell angles and libration about the z axis or direction of incident X-rays) are readily optimized, since they produce direct changes in the expected Bragg spot positions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>By comparing the predicted and observed Bragg positions, a best-fit model can be obtained by least-squares refinement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>High-accuracy refinements of librations about the x and y axes are outside the scope of this paper, as small rotations about these axes do not produce first-order changes in the expected spot positions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The accepted approach in this regard is to integrate the Bragg intensities over a full or partial data set, giving spot-intensity profiles over a sequence of y rotations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>These profiles determine high-accuracy x- and y-rotational orientations through a post-refinement algorithm (Rossmann et al., 1979 ▶; Winkler et al., 1979 ▶), and the resulting lattice model is then used as the basis for a second, more accurate, round of integration. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This paper focuses only on what is achievable with the observed center-of-mass spot positions from the best-measured spots (Fig. 2 ▶ a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>There is good reason to emphasize this initial characterization of raw images (prior to data reduction), since high-throughput crystal screening is relied upon increasingly to identify the best crystalline samples prior to the collection of full data sets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Crystal screening, which is now a standard option at many synchroton beamlines (Soltis et al., 2008 ▶), examines numerous samples sequentially under robotic control. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>A typical protocol involves the collection of two diffraction patterns spaced 90° apart on the y-rotational axis, which is enough data to gain a general understanding of the quality of the sample. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Software server frameworks such as Web-Ice (González et al., 2008 ▶) or EDNA (Incardona et al., 2009 ▶) execute autoindexing trials for each crystal, generating a summary report that lists characteristics such as the signal strength and limiting resolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>One important quality measure is the r.m.s. deviation (in laboratory space) between the observed and predicted positions of the best-measured spots. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Even in the absence of post-refinement, the lattice model ought to predict spot positions with sub-pixel accuracy, so in the best cases the r.m.s. spot displacement is expected to be less than the CCD pixel size, typically about 100 µm. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In less favorable cases, it is challenging to refine the lattice model in a well behaved manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>If the operative method is to minimize the variance  between observed spot centroids r obs and predicted spot positions r calc for the N best-measured spots, then one must check the implicit assumption that the observations have been paired with the correct Miller index h i. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>This assumption breaks down for many experimental samples where Miller indices are difficult or impossible to assign. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>One example is seen in Fig. 2 ▶, where the lattice may be modulated (Wagner &amp; Schönleber, 2009 ▶), generating satellite spots and streaks that are spaced along the c* axis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Another problematic phenomenon (§3) is the superposition of multiple lattices, which requires a decision as to which spots to associate with a given lattice model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Clearly, in these cases, the assignment of observations to the wrong Miller index will artificially inflate the r.m.s. deviation value [which is σr in equation (1)]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the refined lattice model will be biased by the outliers, thus degrading any crystal quality measures that depend on an accurate knowledge of the lattice (including the signal strength and limiting resolution). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Here we develop a simple statistical test to decide, automatically, which observations should be included in equation (1) and which should be rejected as outliers, thus improving the general computational outcome. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Raw diffraction images for a number of published protein structures were downloaded from the Joint Center for Structural Genomics (JCSG; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcsg.org">http://www.jcsg.org</ext-link>) to be used as test cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Images from hen egg-white lysozyme containing superimposed lattices from two crystals were obtained by Peter Zwart at Beamline 5.0.1 of the Advanced Light Source at Berkeley. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Software development was greatly facilitated by the framework provided by the open-source Computational Crystallography Toolbox (cctbx; Grosse-Kunstleve et al., 2002 ▶). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Raw data are analyzed with a spot-finding program (DISTL; Zhang et al., 2006 ▶), with a view to eliminating various types of signal artifacts prior to any further analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The rules applied (determined by trial and error) have been described elsewhere (Sauter et al., 2004 ▶; Sauter &amp; Zwart, 2009 ▶) and are only briefly repeated here. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Spots are retained for analysis only if they have smooth profiles that are well separated from their neighbors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Falloff of the spot count as a function of resolution is used to determine conservative outer- and inner-resolution cutoffs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Additional filters reject spots that are unusually intense, large or small in pixel area, or skewed in shape. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Spots are ignored if they are too close to the rotation spindle for accurate positional evaluation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Further analysis is performed on the spots once the tentative lattice model is established by autoindexing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>A formula given previously [equation (8) of Sauter et al. (2004 ▶)] converts an observed spot position r to a real-valued Miller index f, the components of which are rounded off to produce the likely integer-valued Miller index h. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Index h is not always well defined for a rotation photograph; the rotation of the sample about the y axis (typically anywhere from 0.1 to 1.0°) may produce differing h values for a particular r position at the beginning and end of the rotation, in which case the observed spot is removed from consideration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The difference f − h is expected to have small fractional components. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Conversely, large component values may indicate an outlier. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Indeed, we are able to filter out ice-ring artifacts by detecting peaks in a plot of |f − h| versus resolution, usefully supplementing the detection of ice rings by additional plots of background-corrected pixel intensities and number of candidate spots versus resolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Yet despite all this attention to heuristics for classifying outliers, there are still numerous examples of undetected split spots, fragmented ice rings and superimposed lattices that work their way into the target function [equation (1)] for optimizing the lattice model. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>We therefore resort to statistical assumptions to help sort the spots. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Two populations are posited, a collection of outliers that do not fit the lattice model, and a normally distributed collection of lattice spots that fit the model, albeit with some uncertainty. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The normally distributed lattice spots are taken to deviate from their predicted positions in the plane of the detector with a Gaussian probability distribution in each coordinate, x and y. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>We make the further simplifying assumptions that the individual coordinate deviations Δx and Δy (Fig. 3 ▶ a) are uncorrelated and that their variances are equal (). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>This permits the total deviation between the observed and predicted positions, to be modeled with a Rayleigh probability distribution (which may be thought of as an extension of the Gaussian distribution into two dimensions), where σ2 =  =  = . </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>With this framework in place, the goal now is to separate observations that do and do not appear to fit a Rayleigh distribution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The total group of N observations is sorted in order of increasing Δr (Fig. 3 ▶ c), indexed by the symbol k (k = 0, 1, …, N − 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>A useful tool for interpreting this series is the cumulative distribution function, or probability that an observation will have a Δr lower than a given value, It is assumed that the spots with the smallest Δr values will form a safe group (with no outliers) from which to model the variance in this equation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>We therefore take a reasonable subset (40% of the well measured spots with the lowest Δr; see below) and optimize the value of σ by least-squares minimization of a function f that characterizes the vertical difference between the observed and calculated cumulative distribution curves in Fig. 3 ▶(c), In this equation, the observed distribution function Φobs is just a straight-line function, (2k + 1)/2N, that spreads the observations along the vertical axis of Fig. 3 ▶(c), while the calculated distribution function Φcalc is equation (4) evaluated at the Δr position of the kth observation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Modeling the variance with equation (5) is expected to be superior to using equation (1), since we are fairly confident that equation (5) samples only the variation of spots that truly belong to the lattice, and not the outliers that may be present in the total ensemble of N spots. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>With the cumulative distribution function [equation (4)] now established, it is possible to define an outlier as an observation for which Δr is too far away from the idealized curve of equation (4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>A good cutoff is a distance of σ [represented by the green bar in Fig. 3 ▶(c)], i.e. spots are classified as outliers when It is important to understand that this cutoff criterion does not penalize observations that depart from the mean by many standard deviations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>For example, if the sample size is extremely large it would be perfectly acceptable for a non-outlying spot to have Δr = 6σ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Rather than impose an arbitrary σ cutoff, outliers are identified when the incidence of high Δr values exceeds that expected from a Rayleigh distribution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>This approach accounts for the sample size in a natural way, as others have done in different contexts (Read, 1999 ▶; Zwart et al., 2005 ▶). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The statistical model for outlier rejection is applied immediately after autoindexing at the computational stage (Fig. 1 ▶ b) where the lattice model is still expressed as a triclinic cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Subsequent to outlier rejection, the model is re-refined [again based on the target function in equation (1)] and the cell is analyzed to discover the possible Bravais types (Sauter et al., 2006 ▶) prior to data integration. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>To assess the lattice quality from a variety of crystal samples, 22 protein structures were selected from the JCSG data archive, spanning a wide subset of Bravais types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>As indicated in Table 1 ▶, diffraction properties such as limiting resolution varied over a considerable range, as did the experimental conditions such as the width of the rotation angle (not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Lattice deviation statistics computed from one rotation image in each data set (generally the first image) reveal a broad spectrum of sample qualities, with one sample (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=3bgu">3bgu</ext-link>) exhibiting a second lattice and two others presenting Bragg spots that are split in half (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=1vr8">1vr8</ext-link>) or streaked in long rows (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=1vk8">1vk8</ext-link>; Fig. 2 ▶). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Separately, a test image from a lysozyme sample containing two lattices was analyzed (Fig. 4 ▶). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Each diffraction pattern was autoindexed with LABELIT (Sauter et al., 2004 ▶) and the resulting lattice refined based on its agreement with the center-of-mass positions of the N best-candidate Bragg spots [equation (1)]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Our procedure for rejecting outliers is illustrated in Fig. 3 ▶ for the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=1vk8">1vk8</ext-link> diffraction pattern. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Fig. 3 ▶(a) plots the Δx and Δy deviations of the observed spots from their predicted positions, although the outliers that are several millimeters away from the nearest expected lattice point (Fig. 2 ▶ b) are beyond the extent of this graph. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>The ordered sequence of Δr values is shown in Fig. 3 ▶(c), along with the best-fit cumulative distribution function [Φ(Δr), blue curve] which is modeled on the 40% of observations with the lowest Δr values (red spots). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>In all cases examined, choosing the best-conforming subset of Bragg spots in this manner shows that the errors in the spot positions are described reasonably well by a Rayleigh distribution [equations (3) and (4)]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>The modeled parameter describing the distribution (σ) is not very sensitive to the exact fraction of spots included; comparable results are obtained upon inclusion of anywhere from 25 to 55% of the spots. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>A command-line option was added to labelit.index to set this parameter (see §4). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>In the case of sample <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=1vk8">1vk8</ext-link>, a full 80% of the chosen spots coincide with the Rayleigh distribution (blue line, Fig. 3 ▶ c), while the remaining observations (those above the green cutoff line) depart markedly from this ideal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>These are interpreted as outliers, and are thus removed from the list of observations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Another round of lattice refinement ensues, this time producing Δx and Δy deviations with a much tighter distribution about the model (Fig. 3 ▶ b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Also, an ordered plot of Δr values shows that the entire set of remaining observations adheres extremely well to a Rayleigh distribution (Fig. 3 ▶ d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>The improvement in the model is not confined to the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=1vk8">1vk8</ext-link> case; indeed, the r.m.s. deviation between model and experiment (σr) decreases after a second round of model refinement, sometimes dramatically, in every instance where outliers are rejected (Table 1 ▶). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>For the crystals containing two lattices (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=3bgu">3bgu</ext-link> and lysozyme), the initial lattice refinement target (for refining the predominant lattice) is contaminated with spot observations from the second lattice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>The r.m.s. spot deviations (887 and 586 µm, respectively) are therefore exceptionally large. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>However, the statistical rejection of outliers successfully removes these observations, such that the second round of lattice refinement produces much lower spot deviations (66 and 100 µm) that are typical of single-crystal samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the identification of the outlying spots provides an opportunity to index the second lattice: a separate round of autoindexing based on just the outliers (Fig. 1 ▶ b) produces good lattice models, although the spot deviations of 586 and 321 µm are fairly high. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>The significance of this result is that it is not necessary to determine manually which spots to identify with the second lattice prior to autoindexing based on painstaking visual inspection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>The two superimposed lysozyme lattices discerned in this manner are depicted in Fig. 4 ▶. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>As explained in §1 above, the automated crystal-screening experiments that are the intended focus of this paper often rely on acquiring two images spaced 90° apart on the y-rotational axis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>We simulated such data sets by selecting widely spaced images from the JCSG archive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Statistical rejection of outliers from these two-image data sets (data not shown) did not differ remarkably from the one-image trials listed in Table 1 ▶, either in the ability to improve the model fit or the ability to conform the remaining spots to a Rayleigh model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Certain minor details did change when considering the two images together, e.g. the additional lattice was not as pronounced in the second <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=3bgu">3bgu</ext-link> image and the spot splitting was not as severe in the second <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=1vr8">1vr8</ext-link> image. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>In other data sets such as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=1vm6">1vm6</ext-link>, the percentage of spots rejected as outliers increased slightly, apparently because the lattice model proved to be a better fit for one of the two images (data not shown). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Within the crystal-screening paradigm, tens or hundreds of similar crystal samples may be evaluated for optimal diffraction before one or two are selected for data collection (Page et al., 2005 ▶). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Automated software tools can facilitate this process by providing measures of sample quality (such as the signal-to-noise ratio, limiting resolution, r.m.s. deviation, mosaicity and number of ice-ring artifacts) in real time as the data are acquired. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Except for the quantification of ice rings, these standard quality measures focus on the diffracted lattice itself. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>What have been lacking are reliable measures for the interference caused by non-lattice artifacts, which might degrade the integration of the Bragg signal or the subtraction of background, thus reducing the quality of the structure factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Two of the statistics presented in Table 1 ▶ appear to capture this information. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Although the program normally operates with image data as the only input, a few command-line options have been added (described in the online manual) for generating plots such as those shown in Figs. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Presently, the indexing of a second lattice is not part of the default procedure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Rather, it is intended that a high percentage of outliers will alert the user to the possibility of a second lattice, whereupon labelit.index may be run a second time with a command-line flag set to follow the ‘additional lattice’ indexing path shown in Fig. 1 ▶(b). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>The discovery of additional lattices performed here and elsewhere (Buts et al., 2004 ▶) raises the question of how to handle data reduction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Standard programs such as MOSFLM, HKL, XDS and d*TREK treat only one lattice at a time, so separate data-reduction runs will have to be performed to integrate the Bragg signals from each lattice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Care must be taken with pairs of reflections from different lattices that either overlap or come close enough such that the background subtraction performed for one lattice is biased by the Bragg signal from another lattice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>One approach, implemented in the program UNTANGLE (Buts et al., 2004 ▶), is to enumerate and reject problematic pairs of reflections before the data sets are merged together. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Other programs such as PROW (Bourgeois et al., 1998 ▶) and EVAL15 (Schreurs et al., 2010 ▶) preserve the information that is present in near or overlapping signals by jointly integrating and deconvoluting the neighboring spots. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>The need for software tools to analyze multiple lattices is likely to increase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>In contrast with the present practice of transferring individual crystals to the goniometer stage, some new sample-preparation technologies have focused on the in situ collection of data without removing crystals from their growth chamber. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>These protocols, involving samples grown in capillaries (Yadav et al., 2005 ▶) or on microfluidic plates (Ng et al., 2008 ▶; Gerdts et al., 2008 ▶; Emamzadah et al., 2009 ▶), omit the step where crystals are separated from each other, so it is quite possible for the incident X-ray beam to impinge on two crystals simultaneously. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>The early outlier-based detection of additional lattices (§3) could either be used automatically to trigger special data-reduction protocols, or be deployed as part of a system of safeguards to avoid collecting such data sets altogether. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>At the same time, one must keep in mind the assumptions underlying the present methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Autoindexing must succeed prior to outlier analysis, so even if there are multiple lattices, one of them must be sufficiently predominant so that its unit-cell axes can be discerned by the autoindexing methodology (Steller et al., 1997 ▶, in the case of labelit.index). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Outlier detection relies on the assumption that there is a safely known subset of observations (we assume 40% here) that truly coincides with the main lattice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Finally, if the outliers are used as a basis for determining a second lattice, we again assume that there is a predominant signal to be found, so it may be difficult to apply the present method to a superposition of three or more lattices. </plain></SENT>
