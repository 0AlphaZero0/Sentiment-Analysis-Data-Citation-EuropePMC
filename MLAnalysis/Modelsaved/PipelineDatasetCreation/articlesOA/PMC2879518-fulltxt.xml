Tat can be released to the extracellular space and taken up by adjacent cells, exerting profound cytoskeleton rearrangements that lead to apoptosis. In contrast, intracellular Tat has been described as protector from apoptosis. <italic>Tat</italic> gene is composed by two coding exons that yield a protein of 101 amino acids (aa). First exon (1&#8211;72aa) is sufficient for viral transcript elongation and second exon (73&#8211;101 aa) appears to contribute to non-transcriptional functions. We observed that Jurkat cells stably expressing intracellular Tat101 showed gene expression deregulation 4-fold higher than cells expressing Tat72. Functional experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of this deregulation. First, NF-&#954;B-, NF-AT- and Sp1-dependent transcriptional activities were greatly enhanced in Jurkat-Tat101, whereas Tat72 induced milder but efficient activation. Second, cytoskeleton-related functions as cell morphology, proliferation, chemotaxis, polarization and actin polymerization were deeply altered in Jurkat-Tat101, but not in Jurkat-Tat72. Finally, expression of several cell surface receptors was dramatically impaired by intracellular Tat101 but not by Tat72. Consequently, these modifications were greatly dependent on Tat second exon and they could be related to the anergy observed in HIV-1-infected T cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transcriptional activator (Tat) is essential for viral gene expression and replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Tat fulfils an efficient viral transcript elongation through the interaction with the Tat response element (TAR), a stem-loop RNA located at the 5&#8242;-end of nascent viral transcripts that enables the recruitment of cellular factors as P-TEFb to increase the functional capacity of the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). P-TEFb is composed of cyclin T1, which directly interacts with Tat and permits the binding to TAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), and CDK9, which hyperphosphorylates RNAPII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Other functions have also been attributed to Tat as enhancing viral reverse transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), mimicking chemokine functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), suppressing antigen specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), and regulating host cell gene expression through binding to canonical enhancer sequences of cellular transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) or creating a complex interactome formed by several host cell proteins involved in gene expression regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Tat can also be released from infected cells and taken up by adjacent non-infected cells through receptor-mediated or adsorptive endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), acting then as a secretable growth factor, T-cell activator, and modulator of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). However, Tat also shows non-transcriptional activities as the modulation of cellular protein synthesis, thereby affecting the metabolism of host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p><italic>Tat</italic> coding gene consists of two spliced exons separated in the HIV-1 genome by more than 2300 nts. After complete splicing of the viral pre-mRNA, a highly conserved protein of 101 residues is synthesized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Tat101 is the most common protein in clinical HIV-1 isolates but several laboratory virus strains (LAI, HXB2, BRU, NL4.3) encode a Tat86 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), a non-natural truncated form that appears to be fully functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Tat is composed by several domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A): the cysteine-rich domain [amino acid (aa) 22&#8211;37] is required for Tat transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>); the central domain (aa 38&#8211;48) contains the conserved <sup>36</sup>VCFT<sup>39</sup> motif involved in tubulin binding and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18 B19">17&#8211;19</xref>), and the <sup>41</sup>KGLGI<sup>45</sup> motif that constitutes the minimal activation domain together with the cysteine-rich domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>); the basic domain (aa 49&#8211;57) contains the nuclear localization signal <sup>49</sup>RKKRRQRRR<sup>57</sup> necessary for binding to TAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), Tat cellular uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), and nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), and this region is the minimal neurotoxic region causing cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>); the glutamine-rich region (aa 60&#8211;72) has been involved in Tat-mediated apoptosis of T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>); and finally, the second exon (aa 73&#8211;101) is the least conserved region between different isolates, with homology below 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). This region contains two main motifs: an <sup>78</sup>RGD<sup>80</sup> sequence absent in HIV-2 and SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus) Tat that is involved in cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>); and the <sup>86</sup>ESKKKVE<sup>92</sup> motif that has been described as critical for NF-&#954;B transactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). The second exon has been involved in several activities as the cellular uptake of the exogenous Tat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), apoptosis through increasing activity of caspase-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), improvement of HIV-1 replication in tissue culture and primary PBLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), and IL-2 superinduction in HIV-1-infected T cells after CD3/CD28 co-stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). The contribution of the second exon to HIV-1 <italic>in vivo</italic> replication has also been demonstrated after the accidental infection of three laboratory workers with the HXB2 HIV-1 isolate that shows a premature stop codon at the aa 89. In two of these patients, this mutation reverted spontaneously yielding a more pathogenic virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). These results were also confirmed in four macaques infected with SIVtat1ex virus that reverted to wild-type SIV in two of them, correlating with increased viral load and decreased CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>).
<fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>HIV-1 Tat protein structure. (<bold>A</bold>) Full-length Tat protein consists of 101aa. Tat first exon expands from 1 to 72 residues, while second exon expands from 73 to 101 residues. Tat complete sequence can be divided into five conserved domains. A highly conserved motif <sup>41</sup>KGLGI<sup>45</sup> located at the central domain constitutes the minimal activation domain together with both N-terminal acidic and cysteine-rich domains. The highly conserved motif <sup>49</sup>RKKRRQRRR<sup>57</sup> (NLS) located at the basic domain confers Tat the ability to bind TAR and translocate to the nucleus. The second exon region contains the rather conserved motif <sup>78</sup>RGD<sup>80</sup> involved in cell adhesion signal and a partially conserved <sup>86</sup>ESKKKVE<sup>92</sup> motif involved in NF-&#954;B transactivation. (<bold>B</bold>) Alignment of Tat protein sequences from several clinical isolates shows that the first exon is highly conserved amongst different HIV-1 isolates, whereas the second exon shows homology lower than 50%. Sequence names provided correspond to the GenBank accession number for each sequence. Sequences of Tat101 and Tat72 proteins used in this study are also included.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkq037f1"/></fig></p><p>Both extra and intracellular Tat display the same structure, but this protein acts differently when is synthesized inside the cell during HIV-1 infection than when is released from infected cells. Intracellular Tat is able to protect cells from apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), whereas extracellular Tat is considered a dose-dependent pro-apoptotic factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38 B39 B40 B41">38&#8211;41</xref>) that contributes to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated immunosuppresion and pathologies as Kaposi&#8217;s sarcoma, dementia and degenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42 B43 B44">42&#8211;44</xref>). One pro-apoptotic mechanism described for extracellular Tat involves its attachment to microtubules and to the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>), altering the cytoskeleton dynamics. Cytoskeleton is involved in cell motility, proliferation and intracellular trafficking, as well as in cell shape maintenance and polarity. Actin filaments, actin-binding proteins and microtubules are not only essential for regulating cell death, but also play a major role in HIV-1 infection. Viral trafficking is mediated through microtubules by retrograde transport, the viral core uses dynein to move toward the nuclear pore complex (NPC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), and the cytoskeleton reorganization is necessary to initiate HIV-1-induced membrane fusion, viral assembly and budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). In this context, although intracellular Tat101 induces down-regulation of several cytoskeletal proteins, it does not cause cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), suggesting that intracellular Tat has a role in the modification of the cytoskeleton structure for adapting the host cell to HIV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>).</p><p>In the present work, the contribution of intracellular Tat to changes in the T-cell cytoskeleton structure and function and the specific role of the second exon in these modifications were analysed by microarrays and functional assays. Deregulation of gene expression was 4-fold higher in T cells expressing intracellular Tat101 than Tat truncated at the second exon (Tat72). We prove that the C-terminus is important for modifying cytoskeleton functions as cell morphology, growth, proliferation, and chemotaxis, as well as T-cell signalling and activation. Furthermore, <italic>in silico</italic> modelling of Tat72 suggests that the second exon can induce higher affinity or strength in the binding of Tat to its target sequences or protein partners.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cells</title><p>Jurkat cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Biowhitaker, Walkersville, MD, USA) with 10% fetal calf serum (PAN Biotech GmbH, Aidenbach, Germany), 2 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 100 &#181;g/ml streptomycin and 100 U/ml penicillin, at 37&#176;C.

Quantile normalization was performed and expression values (log2 transformed) were obtained for each probe. Probes were also flagged as Present, Marginal or Absent using GeneSpring default settings. Probes that were flagged as Present or Marginal in all three replicates for the two experimental conditions to be compared on each contrast were selected for further analysis. These filtered data were loaded into SAM (Significance Analysis of Microarrays) software for genomic expression data mining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>).

B-H Multiple Testing Correction <italic>p</italic>-value test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>) was used to calculate the <italic>p</italic>-value for determining the probability that each biological function and/or disease assigned to the dataset was due to chance alone. Canonical pathway analysis identified from the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis library those pathways that were more significant to the dataset. All genes associated with a canonical pathway in the Ingenuity knowledge base were considered for the analysis. The significance of the association between the dataset and the canonical pathway was measured in two ways: first, the ratio of the number of genes from the dataset that map to the pathway divided by the total number of molecules that exist in the canonical pathway; and second, the B-H Multiple Testing Correction <italic>p</italic>-value test was used to calculate a <italic>p</italic>-value to determine the probability that the association between the genes in the dataset and the canonical pathway was due to chance alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Tat <italic>in silico</italic> modelling</title><p>Tat72 protein model was constructed by homology modelling based on the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra structure of unbound HIV-1 Tat with 86 residues from HIV-1 BRU isolate (PDB code: 1jfw) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>) plus residues 49&#8211;68 from EIAV Tat protein bound to TAR/P-TEFb complex (PDB code: 2w2h) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>) using Modeller 9v4 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>).

Both Tat72 and Tat101 were able to promote the transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR, although full-length Tat was slightly more efficient in LTR transactivation than Tat72 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). Role of Tat in LTR transactivation was assessed by treatment with doxycycline. Basal transcriptional activity due to NF-&#954;B exclusively was also evaluated by transient transfection of vector 3&#954;B-LUC. &#954;B-dependent activity was also higher in Jurkat-Tat101 than in Jurkat-Tat72 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). NF-&#954;B-dependent synthesis of LUC was confirmed by simultaneous co-transfection of vector CMV-I&#954;B&#945; to produce the over-expression of I&#954;B&#945;, the main inhibitor of NF-&#954;B. Analysis by immunoblotting of nuclear localization of the main active NF-&#954;B protein, p65/RelA, showed that while this protein remained unchanged in Jurkat-Tat72, total p65/RelA was 2.7-fold increased in Jurkat-Tat101 and Ser<sup>536</sup>-phosphorylated p65/RelA was 1.6-fold increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C).

Besides, I&#954;B&#945; phosphorylated at Ser<sup>32</sup> is susceptible to be degraded in the proteasome, letting active NF-&#954;B free to be translocated to the nucleus. NF-&#954;B activity in Jurkat-Tat72 and Jurkat-Tat101 was measured by DAI assay using a specific probe containing both -&#954;B consensus sites located at the HIV-1 LTR promoter.

However, there are few studies about HIV-1 Tat crystallization that could permit <italic>in silico</italic> modelling to evaluate the effect on Tat function after truncating the second exon. PDB structure 1jfw corresponding to the NMR spectra of a chemically synthesized Tat86 protein from BRU isolate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>) has been used to develop a reliable homology modelling of Tat72, with which shows an identity of 91%. The absence of published structural data for residues 86&#8211;101 makes impossible to perform a reliable modelling of Tat101. Results from modelling Tat72 showed that this protein is highly flexible and displays extended regions and connecting loops, although it did not show highly defined &#945;-helixes or &#946;-sheets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A). Tat72 model showed very polarized electrostatic charges, with a high-positive charged TAR-interacting region in the N-terminus, whereas the C-terminus was severely reduced and showed quite diminished positive charging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B). This end would likely interact with several host cell proteins and structural targets, providing Tat101 with 29aa residues that would strength these interactions. In order to infer the contribution of the second exon to this interaction, modelling of Tat72/cyclin T1/TAR complex was attempted. Because HIV-1 Tat structure has not been crystallized in complex with TAR and cyclin T1, a crystallization of Tat from equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV) in complex with TAR and cyclin T1 (PDB structure 2w2h) was used as model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>). Probably due to the high flexibility of the protein, only one &#945;-helix interacting with TAR was resolved in the structure 2w2h. EIAV and HIV-1 are distantly related, with less that 30% sequence identity, but the TAR interacting region is relatively conserved and both human and horse cyclin T1 are almost identical. EIAV TAR is formed by two distinct structural regions and although the activation domains of both HIV-1 and EIAV Tat contain a conserved core element, the cysteine-rich domain is absent from EIAV Tat. As a result, HIV-1 Tat requires the presence of additional structural regions to completely fulfil its functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Based on this assumption, Tat72 was modelled using as template ijfw structure except for the TAR-interacting region, for which the resolved &#945;-helix from 2w2h was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C). Although 2w2h diffracting crystal was generated by using a 57 residues-EIAV Tat (13-69aa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>), quite good volumetric fitting in the space comprised between TAR and cyclin T1 was obtained for Tat72 after slight manually adjustment to avoid molecular collisions, despite 1jfw had been resolved in an unbound conformation. Accordingly, folding of cyclin T1 around Tat should be a highly conserved three-dimensional structure. In this model, the C-terminal domain of Tat72 is deeply enfolded in the cyclin T1 structure, leaving no physical space in the inner part of cyclin T1 for accommodating the C-terminus of 29aa that constitute the second exon. This would imply that the second exon of Tat101 in an extended conformation should be interacting not only with the internal core of cyclin T1 but with its external surface or with other protein/s bound to the complex.

As a secretable factor, Tat induces dramatic cytoskeleton rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>) that lead to apoptotic events related to HIV-1-induced pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>). As an intracellular protein, Tat is a regulator involved in LTR transcriptional activation and HIV-1 replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Despite the different behaviour, the protein structure is the same. Tat first exon (1&#8211;72aa) contains the minimal functional domain to generate a protein competent in HIV-1 replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), whereas the second exon (73&#8211;101aa) has often been described as dispensable for Tat activity. However, most primate lentiviruses conserve the second exon despite the high error rate of the RT, suggesting it must have an essential biological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76 B77 B78">76&#8211;78</xref>). Moreover, an HIV or SIV virus carrying one stop codon at the end of the first exon can spontaneously revert to full-length Tat <italic>in vivo</italic>, yielding a more pathogenic virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). This higher pathogenicity could be related to a higher efficiency for initiating the LTR transactivation or to non-transcriptional activities. In order to study the role of the second exon of Tat in the modification of T-cell functionality, two lines of Jurkat cells stably expressing Tat101 or Tat72 have been obtained. Because the <sup>86</sup>ESKKKVE<sup>92</sup> motif is critical for NF-&#954;B transactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), it was assumed that Tat72 would be less efficient to transactivate the HIV-1 LTR promoter in our cellular system. This was confirmed when Tat72 proved to be 25% less efficient than Tat101 to initiate the LTR-dependent transactivation. This lower activity was related to lower NF-&#954;B-, NF-AT- and Sp1-dependent activities, in accordance with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79 B80 B81 B82 B83 B84">79&#8211;84</xref>). Due to Tat concentration in Jurkat-Tat101 and Jurkat-Tat72 was very similar and highly stable after long-term culture, differences in the transactivation activity could not be caused by different quantities of Tat-expressing cells in each population. Therefore, Tat72 was less efficient to transactivate the LTR but nevertheless, active.</p><p>The main activities attributed to Tat are the LTR transactivation and the efficient elongation of viral transcripts, but other functions have also been related to Tat as the modification of the cytoskeleton dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>). The cytoskeleton integrity is indispensable for maintaining the cellular shape and survival and for an appropriate immune response. Actually, T cells become motile cells upon activation, switching from a spherical to a polarized shape and orienting their components towards one pole of the cell. This mechanism relies on the cytoskeletal elements, being the microfilament system remodelling essential for T-cell polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>). It has been described that extracellular Tat can induce dramatic cytoskeleton rearrangements that lead to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>). Conversely, although the cytoskeleton can also be greatly modified by Tat intracellular expression, these changes do not decrease cell viability but even prevent apoptosis induced by different stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Accordingly, the role of intracellular Tat in the T-cell cytoskeleton disorganization was investigated. To avoid interferences caused by extracellular Tat, the possibility that Tat could be solubilized in the culture medium of Jurkat-Tat101 or Jurkat-Tat72 was previously ruled out.</p><p>A global functional analysis of changes in the T-cell gene expression profile induced by intracellular Tat and the role of the second exon in these changes was performed by using microarrays of whole human genome. This wide approach has previously allowed the identification of cellular functions modified by the intracellular expression of Tat, as those related to cell survival, proliferation, transcription, immune response, metabolism and chemokine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>). De la Fuente <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>) also determined that Tat86 deregulates many cellular genes involved in cell signalling, translation and control of proliferative and differentiation signals. However, Tat86 is a non-natural truncated form that lacks the <sup>86</sup>ESKKKVE<sup>92</sup> motif critical for NF-&#954;B transactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) and therefore, it should not be fully functional. In fact, our results proved that Tat72 was not fully functional either because the intracellular expression of Tat101 induced up- or down-regulation of nearly 300 genes, whereas less than 70 genes were deregulated in Jurkat-Tat72. Within these impaired functions, we focused on those related to the cytoskeleton functionality as cell morphology, growth and proliferation, movement or apoptosis, as well as cell signalling and T-cell activation. All these functions are related to HIV-1 infectivity and virulence. These data prove that although the second coding exon of Tat may be dispensable for the transcriptional activity of this protein, it is essential for non-transcriptional functions.</p><p>Several functional analyses were performed to evaluate the consequences of the gene expression deregulation caused by intracellular Tat in the cytoskeleton activity and the role of the second exon in these modifications. First, we observed that intracellular Tat101 caused modifications in the morphology and shape of Jurkat cells and a strong inhibition of PHA-induced proliferation, whereas Tat72 did not produce significant changes. These results were valuable because the role of Tat in cell proliferation is controversial. Our data agree with previous reports that demonstrate the inhibition of T-cell proliferation by extracellular Tat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89 B90 B91">89&#8211;91</xref>), but in other studies Tat did not show effect on PHA-induced T-cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">92</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">93</xref>). Moreover, Gibellini <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) suggested that Tat could be involved in the positive regulation of T-cell proliferation, although no functional studies were performed in this report. In our study, intracellular Tat101 not only caused the inhibition of PHA-induced proliferation but also of SDF-1/CXCL12-induced chemotaxis. This inhibition was not observed in Jurkat-Tat72 either. The chemotaxis impairment in Jurkat-Tat101 was not due to changes in CXCR4 surface expression or to the binding of extracellular Tat to CXCR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>) because soluble Tat was not detected in the culture medium. Instead, Tat-mediated mechanism underlying the impairment of chemotaxis and proliferation could be related to the deregulation of essential genes related to T-cell growth, infiltration and development as CADM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">94</xref>), Bcl11a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">95</xref>), or SMAD7&#8212;antagonist of TGF-&#946; signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">96</xref>). Other genes related to migration were up-regulated in Jurkat-Tat101 as DOCK3, which is involved in cytoskeleton reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">97</xref>), modification of cell morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98">98</xref>), impairment of cell migration, and regulation of the Wnt signalling pathway&#8212;related to cell growth, proliferation and polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99 B100 B101">99&#8211;101</xref>). There are other proteins required for cell motility that are down-regulated as ELMO1 that acts together with DOCK1 and DOCK2 to activate Rac/Rho small GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B102">102</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103">103</xref>). This mechanism could be similar to the Nef-dependent inhibition of T-cell chemotaxis induced by the activation of Rac through the binding of Nef to the complex DOCK2&#8211;ELMO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103">103</xref>). Besides, intracellular Tat induced the up-regulation of Spry2 -which can inhibit cell growth, migration and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B104">104</xref>), as well as the down-regulation of CD40LG, which modulates proliferation and movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B105">105</xref>), and CD44, which mediates T-cell migration, recirculation and homing through Rac-mediated cytoskeletal rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B106">106</xref>). Other receptors involved in cell migration as CCR1, CCR7 and MCAM/CD146 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B107 B108 B109">107&#8211;109</xref>) were also down-regulated. Within all these genes modified in Jurkat-Tat101, only Wnt5a, Spry2 and CD40LG were also deregulated in Jurkat-Tat72.</p><p>Impairment of chemotaxis and proliferation are related to changes in the cytoskeleton structure mediated by Tat. It has been demonstrated that extracellular Tat increases the rate of tubulin polymerization <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Now we determined that intracellular Tat increased the rate of basal F-actin polymerization <italic>in vivo</italic> and that this effect was dependent on the second exon. The higher basal F-actin polymerization and polarization showed by Jurkat-Tat101 could be responsible for the impairment of migration because it would impede further response to chemotactic stimuli. However, it has been described that full-length Tat is not necessary to enhance the tubulin polymerization that leads to apoptosis but only peptides containing the glutamine-rich region are required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). These results were obtained by adding high concentrations of exogenous Tat to an <italic>in vitro</italic> system of purified lamb brain tubulin. Our results indicated that the second exon was essential to induce extensive modifications in the T-cell actin cytoskeleton <italic>in vivo</italic> mediated by intracellular Tat. These modifications can not be due exclusively to the direct interaction of Tat with cytoskeleton elements as tubulin or actin but to other indirect mechanisms as the up-regulation of DOCK3 and Spry2 or the down-regulation of ELMO1, CD40LG and CD44. These results increase the differences between the behaviour of extra and intracellular Tat. Other possible explanation is that Tat localizes predominantly in the nucleus when is synthesized inside the cell, but it remains mainly at the cytosol after being endocytosed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), where it could be retained through the binding to cytoskeletal proteins as actin, tubulin, Lis1 and Hic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B110">110</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B111">111</xref>), causing higher toxicity.</p><p>Alterations in the cytoskeleton structure could impair the HIV-1 infection because HIV-1 uses dynein and the microtubule network to move towards the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Besides, the nucleocapsid core interacts with actin filaments to allow the intracellular transport of Gag, virus assembly and budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B112">112</xref>), and actin and other cytoskeletal proteins as ERM could act as structural component of HIV-1 particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B113">113</xref>). These mechanisms could mean that re-infection of cells already infected and expressing intracellular Tat could be hindered. In fact, Tat down-regulates surface receptors as CD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B114">114</xref>) and TCR/CD3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B115">115</xref>). Accordingly, Jurkat-Tat101 lacked of several essential receptors on the cell surface. Absence of CD4 and CCR9&#8212;an alternative receptor to CD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B116">116</xref>) &#8212;would also mean that these cells could not be re-infected. Down-regulation of other surface receptors as CD1 (CD1a, b, c, d, e) and CD2 was also dramatic in Jurkat-Tat101. It has been described that endogenous HIV-1 Nef down-regulates CD1a selectively among CD1 molecules in dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B117">117</xref>), but we observed that intracellular Tat101 down-regulated all CD1 molecules in Jurkat. Because CD1 receptors act as antigen presenting molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B118">118</xref>), their down-regulation would contribute to the impairment of the immune response. In fact, Tat has been described as an inhibitor of antigen-specific responsiveness of T cells, inducing anergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">93</xref>). Down-regulation of these receptors was dependent on the second exon because it was not observed in Jurkat-Tat72.</p><p>In summary, Tat second exon was responsible for altering the cytoskeleton structure and functions as proliferation, chemotaxis and migration, and for the down-expression of surface receptors, when Tat is synthesized inside the cell. These changes suggest that intracellular Tat could be essential for adapting the host cell to HIV-1 infection, for hindering re-infections, and for the impairment of T-cell functionality during the immune response. Structurally, the second exon is a high-positive charged region of 29aa that would likely enhance the binding strength or affinity to host cell proteins and structural targets, as was described for the HIV-2 Tat second exon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B119 B120 B121">119&#8211;121</xref>). To test this statement, <italic>in silico</italic> modelling of Tat72 was performed and adjusted within the Tat/TAR/P-TEFb complex, leaving Tat72 C-terminus deeply buried in the cyclin T1 structure. It would be improbable to fit Tat101 in the same space, implying that the C-terminal domain must interact not only with the internal core of cyclin T1 but with its external surface. Accordingly, the presence of the second exon would explain why Tat101 was more competent than Tat72 to cause gene expression deregulation and cytoskeleton modifications. More analyses will be necessary to evaluate how these changes in the cytoskeleton structure and functionality would affect HIV-1 infection. Data obtained by microarrays provide important clues about the pathways impaired by Tat and will be used as the basis for more extensive studies.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq037/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Plan Nacional del SIDA (MVI 1434/05&#8211;5), FIPSE 36584/06 and 36633/07, VIRHORST Network from Comunidad de Madrid (Spain), FIS PI040614 and PI0808752, ISCIII-RETIC RD06/0006, EUROPRISE Network of Excellence of the EU (Grant no.
