</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transcriptional activator (Tat) is essential for viral gene expression and replication (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Tat fulfils an efficient viral transcript elongation through the interaction with the Tat response element (TAR), a stem-loop RNA located at the 5′-end of nascent viral transcripts that enables the recruitment of cellular factors as P-TEFb to increase the functional capacity of the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>P-TEFb is composed of cyclin T1, which directly interacts with Tat and permits the binding to TAR (3), and CDK9, which hyperphosphorylates RNAPII (4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Other functions have also been attributed to Tat as enhancing viral reverse transcription (5), mimicking chemokine functions (6), suppressing antigen specific CD8+ T-cell immune response (7), and regulating host cell gene expression through binding to canonical enhancer sequences of cellular transcription factors (8) or creating a complex interactome formed by several host cell proteins involved in gene expression regulation (9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Tat can also be released from infected cells and taken up by adjacent non-infected cells through receptor-mediated or adsorptive endocytosis (10,11), acting then as a secretable growth factor, T-cell activator, and modulator of apoptosis (12,13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, Tat also shows non-transcriptional activities as the modulation of cellular protein synthesis, thereby affecting the metabolism of host cells (12,14). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Tat coding gene consists of two spliced exons separated in the HIV-1 genome by more than 2300 nts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>After complete splicing of the viral pre-mRNA, a highly conserved protein of 101 residues is synthesized (15). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Tat101 is the most common protein in clinical HIV-1 isolates but several laboratory virus strains (LAI, HXB2, BRU, NL4.3) encode a Tat86 protein (3), a non-natural truncated form that appears to be fully functional (15). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Tat is composed by several domains (Figure 1A): the cysteine-rich domain [amino acid (aa) 22–37] is required for Tat transcriptional activity (16); the central domain (aa 38–48) contains the conserved 36VCFT39 motif involved in tubulin binding and apoptosis (17–19), and the 41KGLGI45 motif that constitutes the minimal activation domain together with the cysteine-rich domain (20); the basic domain (aa 49–57) contains the nuclear localization signal 49RKKRRQRRR57 necessary for binding to TAR (21,22), Tat cellular uptake (23), and nuclear translocation (24), and this region is the minimal neurotoxic region causing cell death (25); the glutamine-rich region (aa 60–72) has been involved in Tat-mediated apoptosis of T-cells (26); and finally, the second exon (aa 73–101) is the least conserved region between different isolates, with homology below 50% (Figure 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>This region contains two main motifs: an 78RGD80 sequence absent in HIV-2 and SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus) Tat that is involved in cell adhesion (27); and the 86ESKKKVE92 motif that has been described as critical for NF-κB transactivation (28). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The second exon has been involved in several activities as the cellular uptake of the exogenous Tat (29), apoptosis through increasing activity of caspase-8 (30,31), improvement of HIV-1 replication in tissue culture and primary PBLs (2,28,32), and IL-2 superinduction in HIV-1-infected T cells after CD3/CD28 co-stimulation (33). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The contribution of the second exon to HIV-1 in vivo replication has also been demonstrated after the accidental infection of three laboratory workers with the HXB2 HIV-1 isolate that shows a premature stop codon at the aa 89. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In two of these patients, this mutation reverted spontaneously yielding a more pathogenic virus (34,35). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>These results were also confirmed in four macaques infected with SIVtat1ex virus that reverted to wild-type SIV in two of them, correlating with increased viral load and decreased CD4+ T-cell count (35). Figure 1.HIV-1 Tat protein structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>(A) Full-length Tat protein consists of 101aa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Tat first exon expands from 1 to 72 residues, while second exon expands from 73 to 101 residues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Tat complete sequence can be divided into five conserved domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>A highly conserved motif 41KGLGI45 located at the central domain constitutes the minimal activation domain together with both N-terminal acidic and cysteine-rich domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The highly conserved motif 49RKKRRQRRR57 (NLS) located at the basic domain confers Tat the ability to bind TAR and translocate to the nucleus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The second exon region contains the rather conserved motif 78RGD80 involved in cell adhesion signal and a partially conserved 86ESKKKVE92 motif involved in NF-κB transactivation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>(B) Alignment of Tat protein sequences from several clinical isolates shows that the first exon is highly conserved amongst different HIV-1 isolates, whereas the second exon shows homology lower than 50%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Sequence names provided correspond to the GenBank accession number for each sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Sequences of Tat101 and Tat72 proteins used in this study are also included. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Both extra and intracellular Tat display the same structure, but this protein acts differently when is synthesized inside the cell during HIV-1 infection than when is released from infected cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Intracellular Tat is able to protect cells from apoptosis (14,36,37), whereas extracellular Tat is considered a dose-dependent pro-apoptotic factor (38–41) that contributes to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated immunosuppresion and pathologies as Kaposi’s sarcoma, dementia and degenerative diseases (17,42–44). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>One pro-apoptotic mechanism described for extracellular Tat involves its attachment to microtubules and to the actin cytoskeleton (18,19,26,44–46), altering the cytoskeleton dynamics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Cytoskeleton is involved in cell motility, proliferation and intracellular trafficking, as well as in cell shape maintenance and polarity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Actin filaments, actin-binding proteins and microtubules are not only essential for regulating cell death, but also play a major role in HIV-1 infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Viral trafficking is mediated through microtubules by retrograde transport, the viral core uses dynein to move toward the nuclear pore complex (NPC) (47), and the cytoskeleton reorganization is necessary to initiate HIV-1-induced membrane fusion, viral assembly and budding (48). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In this context, although intracellular Tat101 induces down-regulation of several cytoskeletal proteins, it does not cause cell death (14), suggesting that intracellular Tat has a role in the modification of the cytoskeleton structure for adapting the host cell to HIV-1 infection (49). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>In the present work, the contribution of intracellular Tat to changes in the T-cell cytoskeleton structure and function and the specific role of the second exon in these modifications were analysed by microarrays and functional assays. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Deregulation of gene expression was 4-fold higher in T cells expressing intracellular Tat101 than Tat truncated at the second exon (Tat72). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>We prove that the C-terminus is important for modifying cytoskeleton functions as cell morphology, growth, proliferation, and chemotaxis, as well as T-cell signalling and activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in silico modelling of Tat72 suggests that the second exon can induce higher affinity or strength in the binding of Tat to its target sequences or protein partners. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="360" pm="."><plain>HIV-1 Tat acts in a different way when it is synthesized inside the cell during HIV-1 infection than when it is released to the extracellular medium and taken up by adjacent cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="361" pm="."><plain>As a secretable factor, Tat induces dramatic cytoskeleton rearrangements (74) that lead to apoptotic events related to HIV-1-induced pathogenesis (6,43,44,75). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="362" pm="."><plain>As an intracellular protein, Tat is a regulator involved in LTR transcriptional activation and HIV-1 replication (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="363" pm="."><plain>Despite the different behaviour, the protein structure is the same. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="364" pm="."><plain>Tat first exon (1–72aa) contains the minimal functional domain to generate a protein competent in HIV-1 replication (20), whereas the second exon (73–101aa) has often been described as dispensable for Tat activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="365" pm="."><plain>However, most primate lentiviruses conserve the second exon despite the high error rate of the RT, suggesting it must have an essential biological function (12,29,30,76–78). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="366" pm="."><plain>Moreover, an HIV or SIV virus carrying one stop codon at the end of the first exon can spontaneously revert to full-length Tat in vivo, yielding a more pathogenic virus (34,35). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="367" pm="."><plain>This higher pathogenicity could be related to a higher efficiency for initiating the LTR transactivation or to non-transcriptional activities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="368" pm="."><plain>In order to study the role of the second exon of Tat in the modification of T-cell functionality, two lines of Jurkat cells stably expressing Tat101 or Tat72 have been obtained. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="369" pm="."><plain>Because the 86ESKKKVE92 motif is critical for NF-κB transactivation (28), it was assumed that Tat72 would be less efficient to transactivate the HIV-1 LTR promoter in our cellular system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="370" pm="."><plain>This was confirmed when Tat72 proved to be 25% less efficient than Tat101 to initiate the LTR-dependent transactivation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="371" pm="."><plain>This lower activity was related to lower NF-κB-, NF-AT- and Sp1-dependent activities, in accordance with previous reports (79–84). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="372" pm="."><plain>Due to Tat concentration in Jurkat-Tat101 and Jurkat-Tat72 was very similar and highly stable after long-term culture, differences in the transactivation activity could not be caused by different quantities of Tat-expressing cells in each population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="373" pm="."><plain>Therefore, Tat72 was less efficient to transactivate the LTR but nevertheless, active. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="374" pm="."><plain>The main activities attributed to Tat are the LTR transactivation and the efficient elongation of viral transcripts, but other functions have also been related to Tat as the modification of the cytoskeleton dynamics (6,12,14,43,44,75). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="375" pm="."><plain>The cytoskeleton integrity is indispensable for maintaining the cellular shape and survival and for an appropriate immune response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="376" pm="."><plain>Actually, T cells become motile cells upon activation, switching from a spherical to a polarized shape and orienting their components towards one pole of the cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="377" pm="."><plain>This mechanism relies on the cytoskeletal elements, being the microfilament system remodelling essential for T-cell polarization (85,86). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="378" pm="."><plain>It has been described that extracellular Tat can induce dramatic cytoskeleton rearrangements that lead to apoptosis (6,43,44,75). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="379" pm="."><plain>Conversely, although the cytoskeleton can also be greatly modified by Tat intracellular expression, these changes do not decrease cell viability but even prevent apoptosis induced by different stimuli (14,17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="380" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the role of intracellular Tat in the T-cell cytoskeleton disorganization was investigated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="381" pm="."><plain>To avoid interferences caused by extracellular Tat, the possibility that Tat could be solubilized in the culture medium of Jurkat-Tat101 or Jurkat-Tat72 was previously ruled out. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="382" pm="."><plain>A global functional analysis of changes in the T-cell gene expression profile induced by intracellular Tat and the role of the second exon in these changes was performed by using microarrays of whole human genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="383" pm="."><plain>This wide approach has previously allowed the identification of cellular functions modified by the intracellular expression of Tat, as those related to cell survival, proliferation, transcription, immune response, metabolism and chemokine release (36,87). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="384" pm="."><plain>De la Fuente et al. (88) also determined that Tat86 deregulates many cellular genes involved in cell signalling, translation and control of proliferative and differentiation signals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="385" pm="."><plain>However, Tat86 is a non-natural truncated form that lacks the 86ESKKKVE92 motif critical for NF-κB transactivation (28) and therefore, it should not be fully functional. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="386" pm="."><plain>In fact, our results proved that Tat72 was not fully functional either because the intracellular expression of Tat101 induced up- or down-regulation of nearly 300 genes, whereas less than 70 genes were deregulated in Jurkat-Tat72. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="387" pm="."><plain>Within these impaired functions, we focused on those related to the cytoskeleton functionality as cell morphology, growth and proliferation, movement or apoptosis, as well as cell signalling and T-cell activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="388" pm="."><plain>All these functions are related to HIV-1 infectivity and virulence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="389" pm="."><plain>These data prove that although the second coding exon of Tat may be dispensable for the transcriptional activity of this protein, it is essential for non-transcriptional functions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="390" pm="."><plain>Several functional analyses were performed to evaluate the consequences of the gene expression deregulation caused by intracellular Tat in the cytoskeleton activity and the role of the second exon in these modifications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="391" pm="."><plain>First, we observed that intracellular Tat101 caused modifications in the morphology and shape of Jurkat cells and a strong inhibition of PHA-induced proliferation, whereas Tat72 did not produce significant changes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="392" pm="."><plain>These results were valuable because the role of Tat in cell proliferation is controversial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="393" pm="."><plain>Our data agree with previous reports that demonstrate the inhibition of T-cell proliferation by extracellular Tat (89–91), but in other studies Tat did not show effect on PHA-induced T-cell proliferation (92,93). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="394" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Gibellini et al. (36) suggested that Tat could be involved in the positive regulation of T-cell proliferation, although no functional studies were performed in this report. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="395" pm="."><plain>In our study, intracellular Tat101 not only caused the inhibition of PHA-induced proliferation but also of SDF-1/CXCL12-induced chemotaxis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="396" pm="."><plain>This inhibition was not observed in Jurkat-Tat72 either. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="397" pm="."><plain>The chemotaxis impairment in Jurkat-Tat101 was not due to changes in CXCR4 surface expression or to the binding of extracellular Tat to CXCR4 (72) because soluble Tat was not detected in the culture medium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="398" pm="."><plain>Instead, Tat-mediated mechanism underlying the impairment of chemotaxis and proliferation could be related to the deregulation of essential genes related to T-cell growth, infiltration and development as CADM1 (94), Bcl11a (95), or SMAD7—antagonist of TGF-β signalling (96). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="399" pm="."><plain>Other genes related to migration were up-regulated in Jurkat-Tat101 as DOCK3, which is involved in cytoskeleton reorganization (97), modification of cell morphology (98), impairment of cell migration, and regulation of the Wnt signalling pathway—related to cell growth, proliferation and polarity (99–101). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="400" pm="."><plain>There are other proteins required for cell motility that are down-regulated as ELMO1 that acts together with DOCK1 and DOCK2 to activate Rac/Rho small GTPases (102,103). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="401" pm="."><plain>This mechanism could be similar to the Nef-dependent inhibition of T-cell chemotaxis induced by the activation of Rac through the binding of Nef to the complex DOCK2–ELMO1 (103). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="402" pm="."><plain>Besides, intracellular Tat induced the up-regulation of Spry2 -which can inhibit cell growth, migration and invasion (104), as well as the down-regulation of CD40LG, which modulates proliferation and movement (105), and CD44, which mediates T-cell migration, recirculation and homing through Rac-mediated cytoskeletal rearrangements (106). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="403" pm="."><plain>Other receptors involved in cell migration as CCR1, CCR7 and MCAM/CD146 (107–109) were also down-regulated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="404" pm="."><plain>Within all these genes modified in Jurkat-Tat101, only Wnt5a, Spry2 and CD40LG were also deregulated in Jurkat-Tat72. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="405" pm="."><plain>Impairment of chemotaxis and proliferation are related to changes in the cytoskeleton structure mediated by Tat. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="406" pm="."><plain>It has been demonstrated that extracellular Tat increases the rate of tubulin polymerization in vitro (18,26). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="407" pm="."><plain>Now we determined that intracellular Tat increased the rate of basal F-actin polymerization in vivo and that this effect was dependent on the second exon. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="408" pm="."><plain>The higher basal F-actin polymerization and polarization showed by Jurkat-Tat101 could be responsible for the impairment of migration because it would impede further response to chemotactic stimuli. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="409" pm="."><plain>However, it has been described that full-length Tat is not necessary to enhance the tubulin polymerization that leads to apoptosis but only peptides containing the glutamine-rich region are required (18,26). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="410" pm="."><plain>These results were obtained by adding high concentrations of exogenous Tat to an in vitro system of purified lamb brain tubulin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="411" pm="."><plain>Our results indicated that the second exon was essential to induce extensive modifications in the T-cell actin cytoskeleton in vivo mediated by intracellular Tat. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="412" pm="."><plain>These modifications can not be due exclusively to the direct interaction of Tat with cytoskeleton elements as tubulin or actin but to other indirect mechanisms as the up-regulation of DOCK3 and Spry2 or the down-regulation of ELMO1, CD40LG and CD44. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="413" pm="."><plain>These results increase the differences between the behaviour of extra and intracellular Tat. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="414" pm="."><plain>Other possible explanation is that Tat localizes predominantly in the nucleus when is synthesized inside the cell, but it remains mainly at the cytosol after being endocytosed (17), where it could be retained through the binding to cytoskeletal proteins as actin, tubulin, Lis1 and Hic (19,110,111), causing higher toxicity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="415" pm="."><plain>Alterations in the cytoskeleton structure could impair the HIV-1 infection because HIV-1 uses dynein and the microtubule network to move towards the NPC (47). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="416" pm="."><plain>Besides, the nucleocapsid core interacts with actin filaments to allow the intracellular transport of Gag, virus assembly and budding (112), and actin and other cytoskeletal proteins as ERM could act as structural component of HIV-1 particles (113). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="417" pm="."><plain>These mechanisms could mean that re-infection of cells already infected and expressing intracellular Tat could be hindered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="418" pm="."><plain>In fact, Tat down-regulates surface receptors as CD4 (114) and TCR/CD3 (115). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="419" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, Jurkat-Tat101 lacked of several essential receptors on the cell surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="420" pm="."><plain>Absence of CD4 and CCR9—an alternative receptor to CD4 (116) —would also mean that these cells could not be re-infected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="421" pm="."><plain>Down-regulation of other surface receptors as CD1 (CD1a, b, c, d, e) and CD2 was also dramatic in Jurkat-Tat101. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="422" pm="."><plain>It has been described that endogenous HIV-1 Nef down-regulates CD1a selectively among CD1 molecules in dendritic cells (117), but we observed that intracellular Tat101 down-regulated all CD1 molecules in Jurkat. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="423" pm="."><plain>Because CD1 receptors act as antigen presenting molecules (118), their down-regulation would contribute to the impairment of the immune response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="424" pm="."><plain>In fact, Tat has been described as an inhibitor of antigen-specific responsiveness of T cells, inducing anergy (93). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="425" pm="."><plain>Down-regulation of these receptors was dependent on the second exon because it was not observed in Jurkat-Tat72. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="426" pm="."><plain>In summary, Tat second exon was responsible for altering the cytoskeleton structure and functions as proliferation, chemotaxis and migration, and for the down-expression of surface receptors, when Tat is synthesized inside the cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="427" pm="."><plain>These changes suggest that intracellular Tat could be essential for adapting the host cell to HIV-1 infection, for hindering re-infections, and for the impairment of T-cell functionality during the immune response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="428" pm="."><plain>Structurally, the second exon is a high-positive charged region of 29aa that would likely enhance the binding strength or affinity to host cell proteins and structural targets, as was described for the HIV-2 Tat second exon (119–121). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="429" pm="."><plain>To test this statement, in silico modelling of Tat72 was performed and adjusted within the Tat/TAR/P-TEFb complex, leaving Tat72 C-terminus deeply buried in the cyclin T1 structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="430" pm="."><plain>It would be improbable to fit Tat101 in the same space, implying that the C-terminal domain must interact not only with the internal core of cyclin T1 but with its external surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="431" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the presence of the second exon would explain why Tat101 was more competent than Tat72 to cause gene expression deregulation and cytoskeleton modifications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="432" pm="."><plain>More analyses will be necessary to evaluate how these changes in the cytoskeleton structure and functionality would affect HIV-1 infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="433" pm="."><plain>Data obtained by microarrays provide important clues about the pathways impaired by Tat and will be used as the basis for more extensive studies. </plain></SENT>
