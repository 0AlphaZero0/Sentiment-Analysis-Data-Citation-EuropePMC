Many aspects of glioma CSCs (GSCs), however, have been characterized in non-physiological settings.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We found gene expression similarity superiorly defined glioma &#8220;stemness&#8221;, and revealed that GSC similarity increased with lower tumor grade. Using this method, we examined stemness in human grade IV gliomas (GBM) before and after dendritic cell (DC) vaccine therapy. This was followed by gene expression, phenotypic and functional analysis of murine GL26 tumors recovered from nude, wild-type, or DC-vaccinated host brains.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>GSC similarity was specifically increased in post-vaccine GBMs, and correlated best to vaccine-altered gene expression and endogenous anti-tumor T cell activity. GL26 analysis confirmed immune alterations, specific acquisition of stem cell markers, specifically enhanced sensitivity to anti-stem drug (cyclopamine), and enhanced tumorigenicity in wild-type hosts, in tumors in proportion to anti-tumor T cell activity. Nevertheless, vaccine-exposed GL26 cells were no more tumorigenic than parental GL26 in T cell-deficient hosts, though they otherwise appeared similar to GSCs enriched by chemotherapy. Finally, vaccine-exposed GBM and GL26 exhibited relatively homogeneous expression of genes expressed in progenitor cells and/or differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>T cell activity represents an inducible physiological process capable of proportionally enriching GSCs in human and mouse gliomas. Stem-like gliomas enriched by strong T cell activity, however, may differ from other GSCs in that their stem-like properties may be disassociated from increased tumor malignancy and heterogeneity under specific host immune conditions.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis posits that neoplastic clones are exclusively maintained by a small fraction of cells with stem cell properties in many tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most malignant primary brain tumor (glioma) <xref rid="pone.0010974-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.

Classical glioma CSCs (GSCs) regenerate both themselves and more differentiated tumor progeny <xref rid="pone.0010974-Sanai1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, but GSC differentiation results in decreased tumorigenicity <xref rid="pone.0010974-Piccirillo1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010974-Ridgway1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010974-Ruiz1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010974-Sanchez1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010974-Clement1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010974-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Thus, destruction or differentiation of CSCs is thought necessary and perhaps sufficient to effectively treat tumors such as GBM <xref rid="pone.0010974-Oliver1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Key aspects of GBM malignancy, however, are not easily integrated into the CSC hypothesis. For example, despite their higher tumorigenicity, CSCs are more prominent in pediatric brain tumors such as medulloblastoma and ependymoma than in GBM <xref rid="pone.0010974-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0010974-Singh2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In this context, medulloblastomas in particular can be highly malignant, as evidenced by their assignment of WHO grade IV, but their overall, progression-free, and 5-year survival rates are comparable to those of ependymoma, and far exceed those of GBM <xref rid="pone.0010974-CBTRUS1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0010974-Riffaud1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0010974-Souweidane1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Thus, CSCs are more prominent in brain tumors with substantially lower malignancy than GBM. In addition, cytolytic treatments such as irradiation and chemotherapy that enrich GSCs <xref rid="pone.0010974-Bao1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010974-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, clinically benefit brain tumor patients <xref rid="pone.0010974-Stupp1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010974-Stupp2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. This could be due to a primary influence of GSCs on tumor recurrence, rather than on overall tumor progression, although GSC-enriching therapies appear to delay recurrences to some extent as well <xref rid="pone.0010974-Stupp1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010974-Stupp2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Moreover, the effectiveness of anti-CSC therapy in treating CSC-rare tumors has not been demonstrated, although it may effectively treat tumors with sizable CSC subpopulations <xref rid="pone.0010974-Schatton1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Finally, classical CSCs appear to exacerbate malignancy within discrete glioma subcategories <xref rid="pone.0010974-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, implicating modification of stem-associated malignancy by independent tumor properties.</p><p>Since many aspects of CSCs have been characterized in non-physiological <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> systems, further resolution of the relationship of CSCs to tumor malignancy may hinge on identifying inducible physiological processes that enhance stem-like properties. As CSCs are enriched by cytolytic therapy, we examined whether cytolytic T cell activity <xref rid="pone.0010974-Calzascia1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010974-Masson1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> might represent one such process. We found that T cell activity enhances most genetic and functional stem-like properties within gliomas, but fails to unconditionally enhance either tumorigenicity or heterogeneous gene expression, thereby providing further clarification on the role of stem-like tumors in glioma malignancy and diversity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>All CSMC patients participating in this study provided written informed consent for gene profiling, vaccination (where appropriate), and all associated analyses prior to surgery.

Informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to enrollment into vaccination trials (enrollment 1999&#8211;2005). For all trials, the primary safety endpoint was the number of Grade 3 or 4 toxicities, and was evaluated in all enrolled patients. Primary efficacy endpoints were time to survival (TTS) and time to tumor progression (TTP). TTS was evaluated from the date of surgery immediately preceding vaccination to the date of death or last contact (if still living). TTP was evaluated from the same initial surgery date used for TTS, to date of progression on MRI (approximately 25% increase in tumor volume), provided progression was verified either histologically or in serial MRI scans (including routine FLAIR, gadolinium-enhanced, and perfusion-weighted MRIs). All diagnostic pathology and scans were subjected to central tumor board review and consensus.</p><p>Post-vaccine immune responsiveness was the primary immunological endpoint. Vaccinated patients were corticosteroid-free during all blood collections and vaccinations. Each of up to 4 vaccines consisted of 900 &#181;g autologous tumor lysate/10-40&#215;10<sup>6</sup> autologous DC. Vaccination started approximately 15 weeks post-surgery. Serial MRI scans were performed every 2&#8211;3 months, continuously monitored until late-2006. Tumor lysates were derived from a single surgical tumor resection immediately preceding vaccination. No effect of sex or any of the major ethnic groups on safety, immunological, or efficacy endpoints was detected. All vaccine patients from whom surgically resected tumor tissue was available before and after vaccination, and that yielded RNA of sufficiently quality and quantity for microarray analysis, were analyzed.

In addition, GL26 glioma cells were implanted into brains of T cell-deficient (nude), wild-type syngeneic (C57Bl/6; WT), or DC-vaccinated syngeneic mice, and recovered by briefly culturing tumors excised from terminally symptomatic hosts.

We therefore asked whether GSC gene expression was distinctly related to vaccine-associated or standard therapy-associated alterations in GBM gene expression. This was accomplished by plotting similarity to the GSC microarray profile (Pearson's coefficients across all transcripts) versus similarity to either post-vaccine or post-standard therapy microarray profiles (Pearson's coefficients across all transcripts) within 200 independent GBM samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010974-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>), and generating exponential correlation coefficients as a measure of their inter-relatedness. This analysis aimed to discern whether GSC similarity was more related to vaccine-induced or standard therapy-induced expression profiles globally, but is not able to discern further details of what specific genes are involved in any relationships so identified. GSC similarity correlated significantly with both post-vaccine and post-standard therapy similarity. This suggested that stem-like gene expression is related to both vaccine and standard therapies, although perhaps more significantly to vaccine therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010974-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). To examine the basis of the potentially stronger relationship between stem-like and post-vaccine gene expression, we divided samples further into weakly and more strongly stem-like subgroups. This subdivision revealed that weak similarity to the CSC profile correlated equally with standard therapy- or vaccine-influenced gene expression, but higher CSC similarity correlated exclusively with the post-vaccine profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010974-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). This is consistent with the possibility that a relatively low level of stem-like gene expression may be conferred onto GBM by either standard or vaccine therapy, but that vaccination confers a higher level of stem-like gene expression to these tumors.</p><p>To identify oncogenic pathways potentially involved in T cell-influenced gene expression, we performed Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) on vaccine-treated GBM and GL26. IPA is a software tool that extracts and categorizes multiplexed information such as gene expression microarray data into groups based on known functional involvement of individual components (i.e., individual genes) as documented in scientific literature. Such analysis quantifies pathway involvement by calculating the proportion of genes within a number of defined pathways that are altered by a given treatment or manipulation. IPA of transcripts significantly altered after vaccination in GBM patients and/or in GL26 recovered from DC vaccine-treated mice revealed that 7 of the top 11 developmental/oncogenic pathways were up-regulated in common between human GBM and mouse GL26 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0010974.s003">Fig. S3</xref>).

These findings raised the possibility that vaccine-enriched glioma cells might be somewhat distinct from classical GSCs enriched by chemotherapy or neurosphere culture.

We reasoned that the 2 therapies should synergize only if they eliminated or otherwise acted on distinct tumor subpopulations. GL26 was therefore implanted simultaneously into WT and nude mice, followed by TMZ treatment and/or DC-vaccination (WT only). TMZ significantly enhanced survival in both nude and WT hosts, with maximal enhancement in unvaccinated WT, but did not synergize with vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010974-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). This pattern of synergy is consistent with a scenario in which vaccine-induced T cell activity acts on the same tumor subpopulation targeted by TMZ chemotherapy, but in which endogenous T cell activity acts on tumor cells that survive or are unchanged by chemotherapy.</p><p>The above survival study also indicated that host survival is prolonged by DC vaccination, despite its promotion of tumor cells with enhanced tumorigenicity in immunocompetent hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010974-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). This may occur because vaccination eliminates a larger or more malignant non-stem tumor subpopulation than the stem-like tumor cells it spares. If true, this would implicate selection rather than induction as a mechanism for T cell-mediated enrichment of GSCs, as outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010974-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>.

If true, increasingly stem-like tumors should exhibit increased heterogeneity, particularly within genes involved in progenitor cell function and/or differentiation. To test this, we stratified 200 GBM samples into 10 subgroups based on increasing GSC similarity. We then assessed pair-wise relatedness of samples within each subgroup across all transcripts (Pearson's correlation coefficients for every possible sample pair within each stratified group, considering all probesets) as well as within genes expressed in cell progenitors or during differentiation (progenitor/differentiation genes; Pearson's correlation coefficients for every possible sample pair within each stratified group, considering only thos probesets known to be expressed in cell progenitors or during differentiation). The aim of this analysis was to determine the degree of gene expression heterogeneity potentially related to differentiation, between GBMs from different patients as a function of their stemness.(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010974-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>).

These data demonstrate that stem-like GBM lines exhibit evidence of homogenized gene expression, whereas stem-like GBM tumor tissue exhibits heterogeneity within progenitor/differentiation genes. Such heterogeneity could be ascribed to contaminating non-stem subpopulations and/or transitional cell states accompanying stem-like GBM <italic>in situ</italic> that are subsequently lost in culture. Alternatively, it could be due to enrichment of distinct categories of stem-like tumor cells by different environmental constraints.</p><p>Because stem-like gene expression in GBM was related to endogenous rather than vaccine-induced anti-tumor immunity, it was unclear how vaccine exposure would affect GBM heterogeneity within progenitor/differentiation genes. We thus examined heterogeneity among pre- and post-treatment (vaccine or standard therapy) GBM pairs from the same patients. Surprisingly, the relatively high heterogeneity within progenitor/differentiation genes observed in non- or pre-vaccinated GBM was eliminated in tumors acquired from the same patients after DC vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010974-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). Thus, regardless of the specific etiology of this heterogeneity or its role in GBM phenotypic variation, GBMs acquired more homogeneous gene expression after exposure to strong anti-tumor T cell activity.</p><p>Whereas these results suggest that strong anti-tumor immune activity has the ability to homogenize expression of genes potentially involved in progenitor cell function and/or differentiation, it was still unclear whether the absence of T cell activity promote heterogeneity within these genes. In this context, the pre-vaccine heterogeneity observed in GBM patients could have originated from distinct genetic origins of tumors in different patients, rather than from the absence of T cell activity per se. To further clarify the potential impact of anti-tumor T cell activity on glioma genetic heterogeneity, and to formally address whether the lack of anti-tumor T cell activity can enhance heterogeneous gene expression in glioma, we assessed microarray profile similarity among biological replicates of GL26nu, GL26B6, and GL26B6V (all dervived from the same parental tumor). Remarkably, relatively high heterogeneity within progenitor/differentiation genes was observed only in GL26nu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010974-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). In contrast, GL26B6 and GL26B6V exhibited more homogeneous gene expression within progenitor/differentiation genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010974-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that strong anti-tumor T cell activity is sufficient to render gliomas more stem-like and to homogenize progenitor/differentiation gene expression. Similarly, the absence of anti-tumor T cell activity can enhance heterogeneous expression within the same set of genes in gliomas.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Microarray analyses (PCA and IPA) on all transcripts, vaccine-altered, and immune-related genes, suggested that <italic>in vivo</italic> vaccine treatment rendered GBM gene expression more similar to that of classical GSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010974-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0010974.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). We considered the possibility that these results may be dependent on the use of a tumor lysate-pulsed DC vaccine strategy to elicit anti-tumor CTL activity. In this context, however, endogenous anti-tumor T cell activity measured prior to vaccination <xref rid="pone.0010974-Wheeler1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, correlated directly with GBM stemness (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0010974.s002">Fig. S2B</xref>), suggesting that increased T cell activity in general (endogenous or DC vaccine-induced), correlated with a stem-like gene expression profile in these patients. Nevertheless, it is recognized that specific targeting of GSC antigens during T cell induction may yield distinct findings. For example, others have previously shown that DCs loaded with stem-like, as opposed to parental, glioma cells are better able to elicit an effective immune response against either parental or stem-like gliomas in mice <xref rid="pone.0010974-Pellegatta1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0010974-Souweidane1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Such treatment would not necessarily be expected to increase stem-like properties in surviving tumors, particularly if T cell activity enriches glioma stemness solely through selective killing of targeted tumor cells. This raises the possibility that our own vaccination strategy enriched GSCs because it failed to include T cell epitopes of GSCs. However, we and others have observed that anti-tumor T cells in DC-vaccinated human and mouse glioma hosts predominantly recognize Trp-2, or dopachrome tautamerase (DCT; <xref rid="pone.0010974-Liu2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>

The molecular mechansism whereby T cell activity enhances GSC properties in GBM is therefore unclear, and requires further study to clarify whether it proceeds via selective destruction of tumor cells and/or by independent means.</p><p>Stem-like properties were assessed in the transplantable murine glioma, GL26 to determine if T cell activity directly caused an increase in glioma stemness. GL26 exhibited more stem-like gene and protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010974-g001">Figs. 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010974-g002">2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010974-g003">3A, B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0010974.s002">Fig. S2A</xref>), as well as GSC functions including cyclopamine sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010974-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>), chemoresistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010974-g004">Fig. 4A, B</xref>), and enhanced tumorigenesis in wild-type hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010974-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>), after exposure to anti-tumor CTL activity derived from either endogenous or vaccine-induced T cell responses. Specifically, GSC-like gene expression, protein expression, chemoresistance, and tumorigenesis and functional properties were incrementally but consistently increased in GL26 gliomas exposed to low but measurable endogenous anti-tumor CTL activity (GL26B6), and such properties were more dramatically increased in GL26 exposed to higher DC vaccine-induced anti-tumor CTL (GL26B6V; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010974-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>; 3A; 4C; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0010974.s004">Fig. S4A, B</xref>). Together, these data indicate a strong correlation between anti-tumor T cell activity and stem-like properties in clinical glioma specimens. In addition, the observation that T cell presence caused stem-like properties to increase in GL26 in direct proportion to the level of anti-tumor CTL activity against this glioma, suggests that stem-like properties may be directly enhanced by anti-tumor T cell activity. As such, these data represent the first evidence that tumor stemness may be regulated by inducible physiological processes generally, and anti-tumor CTL activity in particular. Nevertheless, further investigation is required to elucidate the precise nature and involvement of anti-tumor T cell activity in enhanced stem-like properties in gliomas.</p><p>Shh and EGFR signaling pathways, each of which can mediate brain tumor generation and/or malignancy, were identified as the most prominently up- and down- regulated oncogenic pathways, respectively, common to GBM and GL26 exposed to T cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0010974.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). Furthermore, sensitivity to cyclopamine a Shh signaling antagonist, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010974-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>), <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> chemoresistance, and resistance to CTL killing were also enhanced in vaccine-exposed GL26 (GL26B6V; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010974-g004">Fig. 4A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010974-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). These data suggest that vaccine-exposed gliomas may be generally resistant to chemical and immune cytotoxicity, but maintain sensitivity to anti-stem agents including cyclopamine. It is therefore tempting to speculate that anti-stem agents might be particularly useful in combination with vaccination to treat malignant gliomas. It is equally intriguing to speculate that a switch in dependency from EGFR-mediated to Shh-mediated growth might critically impact the acquisition of stem-like functional properties, and/or tumor immune resistance, and the role of each of these pathways in such phenomena are subjects of further studies.</p><p>In this study, we observed that greater stemness, as defined by microarray similarity, was inversely associated with brain tumor malignancy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0010974.s001">Fig. S1C</xref>).

These distinct tumors all grow in different ways, within distinct parts of the brain, which may impact malignancy. Moreover, the cell of origin for these tumors is hypothesized to be distinct, which may be a major factor impacting the frequency of CSCs in each tumor type. Thus, the relationship of CD133 expression and other metrics to stem cell properties of brain tumors may be complex, and therefore requires further clarification.</p><p>We observed a superior correlation between vaccine-induced, as opposed to standard therapy-induced, and GSC gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010974-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). In this context, vaccination, like chemotherapy, appeared to enhance stem-like properties in gliomas, yet significantly benefited murine, and perhaps human, host survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010974-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>)<xref rid="pone.0010974-Stupp1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010974-Stupp2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010974-Wheeler1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Together, these observations suggest that enrichment of stem-like gliomas might be disassociated at least under certain physiological conditions from greater tumor malignancy, a notion that is also consistent with GSCs exacerbating malignancy within discrete GBM subcategories <xref rid="pone.0010974-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Such disassociation was evident in vaccine-exposed GL26 (GL26B6V) growing in nude hosts, which was no more lethal than their counterparts (GL26, GL26nu; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010974-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). In this respect, vaccine-exposed gliomas appeared somewhat distinct from classical GSCs defined by CD133 expression and/or neurosphere selection. Since classical GSCs are also enriched by treatments such as chemotherapy, we would expect vaccination and chemotherapy to synergize in the event they eliminated distinct GSC subpopulations. Nevertheless, the lack of synergy between vaccination and chemotherapy in mice is consistent with chemotherapy sparing the same stem-like tumor subset as vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010974-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). Together with the apparent synergy between endogenous T cell activity and chemotherapy, this supports a model in which endogenous anti-tumor T cell activity and standard chemotherapy, may each eliminate distinct individual non-stem tumor subpopulations, whereas vaccine-induced T cell activity eliminates both. In this manner, both vaccination and chemotherapy could enrich stem-like tumor cells, but vaccination would do so more efficiently. Thus, chemotherapy-exposed and vaccine-exposed gliomas may harbor similar stem-like components, but each may also be accompanied by distinct non-stem tumor subpopulations, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010974-g007">Fig. 7</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0010974-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0010974.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Model for vaccine-induced stem-like properties in gliomas.</title><p>Model accounting for qualitatively and quantitatively distinct enrichment of glioma CSCs by endogenous T cells, chemotherapy and vaccination.

An additional possibility is that decreased immunogenicity of stem-like GL26 cells contribute to their enrichment after DC vaccination. In this context, we have observed no quantitative or qualitative difference in dominant antigen-directed T cell responses mediated by re-implantation GL26B6V relative to parental GL26 into wild-type mouse brains (59&#177;5% vs 53&#177;5% Trp-2-reactive intracranial CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, respectively; n&#8202;=&#8202;7 mice each for GL26 and GL26B6V; <italic>P</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;0.23, single-side T-test; not shown). Thus, we believe CTL resistance may play a more prominent role in enrichment of stem-like GL26 than reduced immunogenicity.</p><p>Despite globally homogeneous gene expression in classical GSCs, significantly higher heterogeneity within progenitor/differentiation genes was evident in more stem-like GBM from external sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010974-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). This is consistent with the notion that GSCs may contribute to GBM heterogeneity by promoting heterogeneous expression within genes involved in progenitor cell function and/or differentiation. Similarly compartmentalized heterogeneity was also evident in our patients' GBM tissue prior to DC vaccination, but was significantly decreased in GBM tissue acquired after DC vaccination from the same patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010974-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). The basis for why stem-like GBM tissue should be associated with heterogeneous expression in progenitor/differentiation genes, whereas DC vaccination that apparently increases stemness in these tumors is associated with decreased heterogeneity is unclear, but could reflect the persistence of distinct contaminating tumor subpopulations co-enriched with GSCs <italic>in situ</italic>. Alternatively, the discrepancy could reflect that classical GSCs, being enhanced by relatively weak endogenous anti-tumor T cell activity, may differ qualitatively from GSCs enhanced by strong vaccine-mediated T cell activity. Further studies are needed to critically test these possibilities. More practically, however, compartmentalized heterogeneity within progenitor/differentiation genes could conceivably allow tumors to evade targeted or conventional treatments via outgrowth of resistant tumor variants, whereas homogenized gene expression could potentially enhance susceptibility to such therapies. In this context, the findings of progenitor/differentiation gene homogenization after vaccination, coupled with more heterogeneous expression of these genes under conditions of T cell deficiency in GL26, are particularly intriguing in that they point to a previously undocumented ability of immune activity to constrain tumor genetic variation. Although the relationship of heterogeneous expression within the progenitor/differentiation gene set examined to phenotypic heterogeneity in gliomas has yet to be established, reduced genetic variation in general could conceivably impact adaptive tumor responses and thereby stabilize therapeutic efficacy in GBM.</p><p>Together these findings provide the first evidence that tumor stemness can be regulated by a targetable physiological process, namely anti-tumor T cell activity. Moreover, they highlight that immune resistance, like chemoresistance, may be accompanied by greater reliance on stem cell signaling pathways. Moreover, they provide evidence that tumor malignancy may not be directly associated with stem-like tumor components in all cases. Further study is required to establish the precise relationship between vaccine-elicited gliomas and classical GSCs, and between non-stem and stem-like tumor components, but manipulation of physiological processes inducing glioma stemness promises continued clarification of GSC origins, treatment susceptibility, and their role in tumor malignancy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0010974.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Validation of GSC similarity to distinguish CSCs from non-fractionated GBM. (A) GSC similarity (Pearson's coefficient for similarity to GSCs across all transcripts), and CD133 expression, were determined for GBM from HFH (n&#8202;=&#8202;200) and high-grade gliomas from UCLA (n&#8202;=&#8202;45; GEO accession #GSE4412), plotted against each other for each individual sample, trendlines generated, and r and P values determined as depicted. CSC similarity correlated significantly with CD133 expression within two separate databases. (B) Ability of CD133 expression, or GSC similarity, to distinguish non-fractionated GBM from CD133<sup>&#8722;</sup> or CD133<sup>+</sup> GSCs (29) (GEO accession #GDS2728) or from stem cell media-cultured GBM lines from 2 patients (37) (GEO accession #GSE4536); was determined (P&lt;0.01 denoted by red asterisk). Unlike CD133 expression, only GSC similarity distinguished CD133<sup>+</sup> or CD133 GSCs (from multiple sources) from surgical GBM samples (C) GSC similarity (Pearson's coefficient for similarity to GSCs - GEO accession #GDS2728 - across all transcripts), and CD133 expression, were determined for de novo GBM, secondary GBM, and grade 3 gliomas from UCLA (GEO accession #GSE4412) and each parameter assessed for inter-group differences by one-tailed T-test (P&lt;0.01 denoted by red asterisk). CD133 expression has been shown to be highest in de novo GBM (29), and this was arguably the case in the samples we analyzed, but global GSC similarity was highest in grade 3 gliomas and secondary GBM (Fig. S1C). Global GSC similarity thus paralleled increased numbers of CSCs reported for lower-grade brain tumors (1, 2). These data validated that gene expression similarity distinguishes stem-like gliomas more faithfully than does CD133 expression.</p><p>(1.87 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0010974.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0010974.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>Stem-like gene expression accompanies endogenous and vaccine-induced anti-tumor T cell activity in gliomas.
