</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We found gene expression similarity superiorly defined glioma “stemness”, and revealed that GSC similarity increased with lower tumor grade. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Using this method, we examined stemness in human grade IV gliomas (GBM) before and after dendritic cell (DC) vaccine therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This was followed by gene expression, phenotypic and functional analysis of murine GL26 tumors recovered from nude, wild-type, or DC-vaccinated host brains. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>GSC similarity was specifically increased in post-vaccine GBMs, and correlated best to vaccine-altered gene expression and endogenous anti-tumor T cell activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>GL26 analysis confirmed immune alterations, specific acquisition of stem cell markers, specifically enhanced sensitivity to anti-stem drug (cyclopamine), and enhanced tumorigenicity in wild-type hosts, in tumors in proportion to anti-tumor T cell activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, vaccine-exposed GL26 cells were no more tumorigenic than parental GL26 in T cell-deficient hosts, though they otherwise appeared similar to GSCs enriched by chemotherapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Finally, vaccine-exposed GBM and GL26 exhibited relatively homogeneous expression of genes expressed in progenitor cells and/or differentiation. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>T cell activity represents an inducible physiological process capable of proportionally enriching GSCs in human and mouse gliomas. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis posits that neoplastic clones are exclusively maintained by a small fraction of cells with stem cell properties in many tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most malignant primary brain tumor (glioma) [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>CSCs are rare within GBM, but are classically enriched by selection of stem markers such as CD133, or by neurosphere formation [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Classical glioma CSCs (GSCs) regenerate both themselves and more differentiated tumor progeny [3], but GSC differentiation results in decreased tumorigenicity [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Thus, destruction or differentiation of CSCs is thought necessary and perhaps sufficient to effectively treat tumors such as GBM [10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Key aspects of GBM malignancy, however, are not easily integrated into the CSC hypothesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>For example, despite their higher tumorigenicity, CSCs are more prominent in pediatric brain tumors such as medulloblastoma and ependymoma than in GBM [1],[2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In this context, medulloblastomas in particular can be highly malignant, as evidenced by their assignment of WHO grade IV, but their overall, progression-free, and 5-year survival rates are comparable to those of ependymoma, and far exceed those of GBM [11] [12] [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Thus, CSCs are more prominent in brain tumors with substantially lower malignancy than GBM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In addition, cytolytic treatments such as irradiation and chemotherapy that enrich GSCs [14], [15], clinically benefit brain tumor patients [16], [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>This could be due to a primary influence of GSCs on tumor recurrence, rather than on overall tumor progression, although GSC-enriching therapies appear to delay recurrences to some extent as well [16], [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the effectiveness of anti-CSC therapy in treating CSC-rare tumors has not been demonstrated, although it may effectively treat tumors with sizable CSC subpopulations [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Finally, classical CSCs appear to exacerbate malignancy within discrete glioma subcategories [19], implicating modification of stem-associated malignancy by independent tumor properties. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Since many aspects of CSCs have been characterized in non-physiological in vitro or in vivo systems, further resolution of the relationship of CSCs to tumor malignancy may hinge on identifying inducible physiological processes that enhance stem-like properties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>As CSCs are enriched by cytolytic therapy, we examined whether cytolytic T cell activity [20], [21] might represent one such process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>We found that T cell activity enhances most genetic and functional stem-like properties within gliomas, but fails to unconditionally enhance either tumorigenicity or heterogeneous gene expression, thereby providing further clarification on the role of stem-like tumors in glioma malignancy and diversity. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="366" pm="."><plain>Together, these observations suggest that enrichment of stem-like gliomas might be disassociated at least under certain physiological conditions from greater tumor malignancy, a notion that is also consistent with GSCs exacerbating malignancy within discrete GBM subcategories [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="367" pm="."><plain>Such disassociation was evident in vaccine-exposed GL26 (GL26B6V) growing in nude hosts, which was no more lethal than their counterparts (GL26, GL26nu; Fig. 4C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="368" pm="."><plain>In this respect, vaccine-exposed gliomas appeared somewhat distinct from classical GSCs defined by CD133 expression and/or neurosphere selection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="369" pm="."><plain>Since classical GSCs are also enriched by treatments such as chemotherapy, we would expect vaccination and chemotherapy to synergize in the event they eliminated distinct GSC subpopulations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="370" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the lack of synergy between vaccination and chemotherapy in mice is consistent with chemotherapy sparing the same stem-like tumor subset as vaccination (Fig. 4D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="371" pm="."><plain>Together with the apparent synergy between endogenous T cell activity and chemotherapy, this supports a model in which endogenous anti-tumor T cell activity and standard chemotherapy, may each eliminate distinct individual non-stem tumor subpopulations, whereas vaccine-induced T cell activity eliminates both. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="372" pm="."><plain>In this manner, both vaccination and chemotherapy could enrich stem-like tumor cells, but vaccination would do so more efficiently. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="373" pm="."><plain>Thus, chemotherapy-exposed and vaccine-exposed gliomas may harbor similar stem-like components, but each may also be accompanied by distinct non-stem tumor subpopulations, as illustrated in Fig. 7. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="379" pm="."><plain>Both properties were observed using the GL26 system (Fig. 4D, 5B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="380" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, further studies are required to fully test whether GSCs are enriched by DC vaccination solely via selection, as it is unclear whether differential killing of GL26B6V at the relatively high E:T ratios presented here is sufficient to entirely account for vaccine-mediated promotion of stem-like properties in GL26. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="381" pm="."><plain>Differential susceptibility to cytolytic therapeutics including radiation and chemotherapy also enrich classical GSCs [14], [15], but the relationship between these and vaccine-elicited gliomas requires further clarification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="382" pm="."><plain>An additional possibility is that decreased immunogenicity of stem-like GL26 cells contribute to their enrichment after DC vaccination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="383" pm="."><plain>In this context, we have observed no quantitative or qualitative difference in dominant antigen-directed T cell responses mediated by re-implantation GL26B6V relative to parental GL26 into wild-type mouse brains (59±5% vs 53±5% Trp-2-reactive intracranial CD8+ T cells, respectively; n = 7 mice each for GL26 and GL26B6V; P = 0.23, single-side T-test; not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="384" pm="."><plain>Thus, we believe CTL resistance may play a more prominent role in enrichment of stem-like GL26 than reduced immunogenicity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="385" pm="."><plain>Despite globally homogeneous gene expression in classical GSCs, significantly higher heterogeneity within progenitor/differentiation genes was evident in more stem-like GBM from external sources (Fig. 6A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="386" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the notion that GSCs may contribute to GBM heterogeneity by promoting heterogeneous expression within genes involved in progenitor cell function and/or differentiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="387" pm="."><plain>Similarly compartmentalized heterogeneity was also evident in our patients' GBM tissue prior to DC vaccination, but was significantly decreased in GBM tissue acquired after DC vaccination from the same patients (Fig. 6B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="388" pm="."><plain>The basis for why stem-like GBM tissue should be associated with heterogeneous expression in progenitor/differentiation genes, whereas DC vaccination that apparently increases stemness in these tumors is associated with decreased heterogeneity is unclear, but could reflect the persistence of distinct contaminating tumor subpopulations co-enriched with GSCs in situ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="389" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, the discrepancy could reflect that classical GSCs, being enhanced by relatively weak endogenous anti-tumor T cell activity, may differ qualitatively from GSCs enhanced by strong vaccine-mediated T cell activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="390" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to critically test these possibilities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="391" pm="."><plain>More practically, however, compartmentalized heterogeneity within progenitor/differentiation genes could conceivably allow tumors to evade targeted or conventional treatments via outgrowth of resistant tumor variants, whereas homogenized gene expression could potentially enhance susceptibility to such therapies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="392" pm="."><plain>In this context, the findings of progenitor/differentiation gene homogenization after vaccination, coupled with more heterogeneous expression of these genes under conditions of T cell deficiency in GL26, are particularly intriguing in that they point to a previously undocumented ability of immune activity to constrain tumor genetic variation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="393" pm="."><plain>Although the relationship of heterogeneous expression within the progenitor/differentiation gene set examined to phenotypic heterogeneity in gliomas has yet to be established, reduced genetic variation in general could conceivably impact adaptive tumor responses and thereby stabilize therapeutic efficacy in GBM. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="394" pm="."><plain>Together these findings provide the first evidence that tumor stemness can be regulated by a targetable physiological process, namely anti-tumor T cell activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="395" pm="."><plain>Moreover, they highlight that immune resistance, like chemoresistance, may be accompanied by greater reliance on stem cell signaling pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="396" pm="."><plain>Moreover, they provide evidence that tumor malignancy may not be directly associated with stem-like tumor components in all cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="397" pm="."><plain>Further study is required to establish the precise relationship between vaccine-elicited gliomas and classical GSCs, and between non-stem and stem-like tumor components, but manipulation of physiological processes inducing glioma stemness promises continued clarification of GSC origins, treatment susceptibility, and their role in tumor malignancy. </plain></SENT>
