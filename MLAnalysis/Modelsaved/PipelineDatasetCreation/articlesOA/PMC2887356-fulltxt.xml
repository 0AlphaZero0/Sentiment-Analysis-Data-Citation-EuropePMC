As the majority of these ORFs have no homologs with characterized sequence or protein structure, traditional sequence-based approaches cannot be applied to deduce their biological function. Here, we characterize <italic>YER067W</italic>, a conserved gene of unknown function that is strongly induced in response to many stress conditions and repressed in drug resistant yeast strains. Gene expression patterns of <italic>YER067W</italic> and its paralog <italic>YIL057C</italic> suggest an involvement in energy metabolism. We show that yeast lacking <italic>YER067W</italic> display altered levels of reserve carbohydrates and a growth deficiency in media that requires aerobic metabolism. Impaired mitochondrial function and overall reduction of ergosterol content in the <italic>YER067W</italic> deleted strain explained the observed 2- and 4-fold increase in resistance to the drugs fluconazole and amphotericin B, respectively. Cell fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that Yer067w is associated with cellular membranes despite the absence of a transmembrane domain in the protein. Finally, the 1.7 &#197; resolution crystal structure of Yer067w shows an alpha-beta fold with low similarity to known structures and a putative functional site.</p><p>
<italic>YER067W'</italic>s involvement with aerobic energetic metabolism suggests the assignment of the gene name <italic>RGI1</italic>, standing for respiratory growth induced 1. Altogether, the results shed light on a previously uncharacterized protein family and provide basis for further studies of its apparent role in energy metabolism control and drug resistance.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In this work, we bring new insights into the structural and functional characterization of a previously poorly annotated gene in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the open reading frame (ORF) <italic>YER067W</italic>. This sequence belongs to a group of approximately 1000 genes from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (20% of the genome) that have been missed by the genome-wide methods currently used to address protein/gene function such as interactomes, phenotype screenings and homology-based functional annotation. Like the majority of uncharacterized genes from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>YER067W</italic> codes for a short protein (&#8804;20 kDa) that is present in duplicate in the yeast genome (shares 70% identity with the ORF <italic>YIL057C</italic>), and its homologs are restricted to fungi and contain no characterized functional domains <xref rid="pone.0011163-PenaCastillo1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>The functional annotation of this subset of genes is particularly challenging because almost nothing can be learned from sequence comparisons. Moreover, most of the uncharacterized proteins have no tridimensional structure available, hindering a structure-based analysis. Functional hints are generally extracted from high-throughput studies performed on <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. These data are well-organized and accessible through the <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Genome Database (SGD) <xref rid="pone.0011163-Hong1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, a public database that curates the yeast genes and also compiles Gene Ontology (GO) annotations, publications, interactions, and a multitude of additional information. Almost every gene has some published data compiled; however, the information is incomplete for many ORFs to define at least one aspect of the Gene Ontology (GO), which is subdivided into three major branches: Molecular function, Biological process and Cellular component. For these genes, the GO annotation awaits an experimental validation of functional hypothesis raised from high-throughput data analysis.</p><p>
<italic>YER067W</italic> attracted our attention because of its high levels of expression in a wide range of conditions, such as intracellular iron depletion <xref rid="pone.0011163-Seo1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, carbon source restriction <xref rid="pone.0011163-Lai1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, high temperature, high osmotic stress, cold stress <xref rid="pone.0011163-Gasch1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, unfolded protein response <xref rid="pone.0011163-Travers1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, and high hydrostatic pressure <xref rid="pone.0011163-Fernandes1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. These data point to the importance of <italic>YER067W</italic> as a stress-related gene in non-standard laboratory growth conditions.</p><p>Another notable feature of <italic>YER067W</italic> gene regulation concerns its apparent correlation with the development of a drug-resistant phenotype in yeast. A study of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> showed that cells chronically treated with different antifungal drugs from the azole class display a consistent down-regulation of <italic>YER067W</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0011163-Bammert1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Furthermore, two other independent works that employed microarray analysis to address differences in gene expression between fluconazole-resistant and -susceptible strains showed that both <italic>YER067W</italic> and its <italic>Candida albicans</italic> ortholog <italic>IPF20056</italic> (ORF 191354) are repressed in the fluconazole-resistant strain. This trait was observed in an experimentally induced resistant strain of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> that was selected for fluconazole tolerance after growth for 400 generations in the presence of the drug <xref rid="pone.0011163-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and was also observed in three different clinical isolates of <italic>Candida albicans</italic> that developed fluconazole resistance <xref rid="pone.0011163-Rogers1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Fungal infections are particularly complex to treat because there are few classes of antifungal drugs available and the repetition and lengthy duration of treatment favors the development of drug-resistant strains <xref rid="pone.0011163-Gulshan1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The most widely used drugs belong to the azole class, which inhibit the enzyme lanosterol demethylase (Erg11), involved in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway. Ergosterol is also the target for polyene drugs such as amphothericin B and nystatin. As both classes of drugs act on components of the same pathway, the mechanisms of resistance developed against one kind of drug are frequently effective against the other. Moreover, due to the similarity of the cellular machinery of fungi and metazoans, it is difficult to develop fungal-specific drugs <xref rid="pone.0011163-Cowen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Therefore, the characterization of new fungal-specific proteins involved in the development of drug resistance is of outstanding interest.</p><p>Despite the notable induction of <italic>YER067W</italic> in several environmental conditions, very little data concerning protein-protein or genetic interaction is available for Yer067w. Two-hybrid experiments and mass spectrometry-based identification of Yer067w interaction partners offer some potential hits, but they are never confirmed within the experiment (no more than a single identification event) or between experiments (coincident hits in different experiments) <xref rid="pone.0011163-Ito1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011163-Tong1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Moreover, the putative interaction partners are of very diverse functions and have promiscuous interaction profiles; for example, Rpp0, a ribosomal protein that was identified as a putative Yer067w interaction partner, appears to be physically associated to more than 100 proteins of varied functions <xref rid="pone.0011163-Tong1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>The only GO annotation available for Yer067w comes from a genome-wide localization study using GFP-tagged proteins and points to a nuclear and cytoplasmic localization for Yer067w during normal growth conditions <xref rid="pone.0011163-Ghaemmaghami1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>In this work, we use existing gene regulation data and apply different experimental methodologies to improve the functional annotation of <italic>YER067W</italic>. We determine whether <italic>YER067W</italic> is adaptively important to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and uncover the biological processes in which this stress-induced protein plays a role, including confirmation of the drug-resistance connection suggested by gene regulation data. We more accurately determine the cellular distribution of this protein by observing the localization of an untagged Yer067w protein. Finally, we present the three-dimensional structure of Yer067w and determine whether it resembles any previously characterized folds.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Phylogenetic analysis reveals that Yer067w is under strong selective constraint</title><p>To identify Yer067w homologs, we performed BLAST and PSI-BLAST similarity searches using the Yer067w protein sequence to query the non-redundant protein database (NCBI). Despite the enhanced sensitivity of PSI-BLAST in searches for distantly-related proteins <xref rid="pone.0011163-Altschul1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, both programs retrieved the same proteins, including the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> paralog Yil057c and orthologs from different fungal genera (<italic>Candida</italic>, <italic>Pichia</italic>, <italic>Ashbya</italic>, <italic>Kluyveromyces</italic>, <italic>Lodderomyces</italic>, <italic>Debaryomyces,</italic> and <italic>Vanderwaltozyma</italic>). The search was completed by exploring the Fungal Orthogroups Repository <xref rid="pone.0011163-Wapinski1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, which retrieved homologs from other <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> and <italic>Candida</italic> species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011163-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This analysis clearly showed that the 23 proteins homologous to Yer067w are restricted to ascomycetes belonging to the Saccharomycotina subphyla. A sequence alignment of the Yer067w family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011163-g001">Figure 1</xref>) reveals a high degree of conservation throughout the Saccharomycotina. A significant fraction of positions are identical in 50% or more of Yer067w family members (asterisks) and more than 20 positions are identical amongst all family members (green boxes). The limited phylogenic distribution of Yer067w homologs is characteristic of orthologous &#8220;ORFans&#8221;, genes that are typically present in only a few, generally closely related organisms and have no annotated function <xref rid="pone.0011163-Siew1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0011163-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0011163.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Sequence alignment of 23 proteins homologous to Yer067w protein.</title><p>Sequences were identified by a PSI-BLAST search against the NR protein database and against the Fungal Orthogroups Repository <xref rid="pone.0011163-Wapinski1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.

This trend suggests that those genes are under low selective pressure and perform accessory or redundant functions <xref rid="pone.0011163-Nishida1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. To evaluate if this would be the case for <italic>YER067W</italic>, we analyzed the evolution rate of this gene and examined the phylogenetic history of Yer067w protein family.</p><p>Evolution rate can be inferred from the ratio of the number of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site (dN) to the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS), a measure that distinguishes the amino acid selection pressure from the background nucleotide mutation rate <xref rid="pone.0011163-Hurst1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In a previous work analyzing dN/dS ratio in four closely related yeast species (<italic>S. cerevisiae, S. mikatae, S. bayanus,</italic> and <italic>S. paradoxus</italic>), the dN/dS ratio for <italic>YER067W</italic> was 0.03, indicating a relatively slow mutation rate given that the whole genome mean for dN/dS ratios in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> was 0.10 <xref rid="pone.0011163-Wall1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. This analysis indicates that the <italic>YER067W</italic> locus is under strong selective constraint and that it is not a quickly evolving gene.</p><p>Moreover, the phylogenetic tree constructed using <italic>YER067W</italic> homologs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011163.s001">Figure S1</xref>) closely resembles the evolutionary history of the Saccharomycotina subphyla <xref rid="pone.0011163-Scannell1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, reinforcing the conservation of this gene family. Another interesting feature of the <italic>YER067W</italic> family is the presence of a duplicated pair of homologs in almost every species that diverged after a whole genome duplication (WGD) event <xref rid="pone.0011163-Scannell1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The conservation of both genes in WGD yeast species is a remarkable feature because nearly 90% of the duplicated genes in yeast genomes have lost one member of the pair in the present-day set <xref rid="pone.0011163-Byrne1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Because truly redundant genes are unlikely to exist, the presence of two copies may be explained by a neofunctionalization, in which one duplicate evolves a useful new function while the other one performs the ancestral function, or a subfunctionalization, in which the duplicates partition ancestral functions between themselves so that both duplicates are required for full fitness (for example, if the duplicate copies become differently expressed or localized within the cell). In the following sections, this question will be addressed by analyzing gene expression regulation and phenotypes associated with deletion of <italic>YER067W</italic> and its paralog <italic>YIL057C</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>
<italic>YER067W</italic> and <italic>YIL057C</italic> display different induction patterns linked to genes involved in energy metabolism</title><p>Analysis of global gene expression in several environmental conditions revealed an interesting feature of genome regulation: genes involved in common pathways or metabolic processes tend to be coordinately expressed/repressed. Therefore, the functions of characterized genes in a given regulatory cluster can suggest hypothetical functions for uncharacterized genes in the same cluster <xref rid="pone.0011163-Gasch1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. As <italic>YER067W</italic> expression is affected by a wide range of conditions, this approach can identify in which aspects of yeast physiology <italic>YER067W</italic> is involved.</p><p>By comparing several data sets from microarray experiments using the program SPELL <xref rid="pone.0011163-Hibbs1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, we verified that the expression of the <italic>YER067W</italic> gene is tightly linked to genes involved in carbohydrate metabolic processes (p value &#8202;=&#8202;5.22 10<sup>&#8722;5</sup>), including glycogen synthases (<italic>GSY1</italic> and <italic>GSY2</italic>) and trehalose synthase subunits (<italic>TPS2</italic> and <italic>TSL1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011163.s003">Table S1</xref>).

This possibility could explain the resistance observed in the presence of both fluconazole and amphotericin B.

The reverse is also true: cells with mitochondrial defects show modulation in ergosterol gene expression and their sterol profile <xref rid="pone.0011163-Brun1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.

The longest helix, &#945;4, transversally crosses the &#946;-sheet and is mainly stabilized by hydrophobic interactions involving the nonpolar amino acids F80, L84, I88, L92, I96, and V100 that are facing the inner face of the &#946;-sheet. Interestingly, this helix contains an unusual bulge in the fourth turn.

However, the conserved cavity is long and has a largely hydrophobic character, hinting at the large size of the ligand and suggesting that this cavity is likely to be a protein-binding site.

Nevertheless, both programs indicated that Yer067w shares only weak structural homology with a number of &#945;/&#946; structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011163-g008">Figure 8 B</xref>).

Despite the low scores obtained for these putative structural homologs, each of the matches was analyzed to identify key residues or structural motifs resembling the conserved core of the Yer067w family.

The best scores (SSAP ranging from 70&#8211;74 and identity &lt;10%) suggested several possible classifications, including Roll architecture, as in Nuclear transport factor (NTF)-like proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011163-g008">Figure 8 C, D</xref>) and a two-layer sandwich architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011163-g008">Figure 8F</xref>). The Yer067w structure differs from the NTF fold in two main aspects. While the NTF fold is characterized by a highly curved &#946;-sheet flanked by &#945;-helices forming a conical structure <xref rid="pone.0011163-Fribourg1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, the Yer067w &#946;-sheet is only slightly twisted, forming a supporting surface for the &#945;-helices rather than a roll-like structure. Furthermore, the C-terminal helix &#945;4 of Yer067w is structurally aligned to the N-terminal helix &#945;1 of NTF-like proteins, underlining the distinct topology among these proteins. The other possible classification is a two-layer sandwich architecture represented by the TATA-binding protein (PDB code 1qna), which agrees well with the overall fold of Yer067w: a &#946;-sheet backed by &#945;-helices on one side. However, we could not find any structures in the CATH database with the same order and configuration of secondary structure elements as those of Yer067w, precluding a straightforward classification in any of the topologies already classified as the two-layer sandwich architecture. Thus, the Yer067w structure likely defines a new subfamily of the &#945;/&#946; proteins, contributing to our understanding of the protein-fold space and the relationship between sequence and three-dimensional structure.</p><p>To complete the structural characterization of the Yer067w family, we modeled the three-dimensional structures of selected representatives from distinct phylogenetic branches using the program SwissModel with the Yer067w structure as a template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011163-g008">Figure 8G, H</xref>). The model of DEHA0D04532 from <italic>Debaromyces hansenii</italic>, the most distant Yer067w homolog, is highly similar to the Yer067w, demonstrating a Q-score of 0.87 and an RMSD of 0.3 &#197;, as calculated by SSM pairwise comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011163-g008">Figure 8G</xref>). The most obvious difference in the DEHA0D04532 model is an insertion between strands &#946;5 and &#946;6 that is predicted to form two short &#946;-strands in the model. The structural models of the proteins from the post-WGD species are highly similar to the Yer067w structure, which reflects the high sequence identity between these proteins. For example, the structural model of Yil057c is nearly identical to that of Yer067w, with a Q-score of 1 and an RMSD of 0.06 &#197; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011163-g008">Figure 8H</xref>).
