</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In this work, we bring new insights into the structural and functional characterization of a previously poorly annotated gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the open reading frame (ORF) YER067W. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>This sequence belongs to a group of approximately 1000 genes from S. cerevisiae (20% of the genome) that have been missed by the genome-wide methods currently used to address protein/gene function such as interactomes, phenotype screenings and homology-based functional annotation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Like the majority of uncharacterized genes from S. cerevisiae, YER067W codes for a short protein (≤20 kDa) that is present in duplicate in the yeast genome (shares 70% identity with the ORF YIL057C), and its homologs are restricted to fungi and contain no characterized functional domains [1]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The functional annotation of this subset of genes is particularly challenging because almost nothing can be learned from sequence comparisons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Moreover, most of the uncharacterized proteins have no tridimensional structure available, hindering a structure-based analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Functional hints are generally extracted from high-throughput studies performed on S. cerevisiae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>These data are well-organized and accessible through the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) [2], a public database that curates the yeast genes and also compiles Gene Ontology (GO) annotations, publications, interactions, and a multitude of additional information. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Almost every gene has some published data compiled; however, the information is incomplete for many ORFs to define at least one aspect of the Gene Ontology (GO), which is subdivided into three major branches: Molecular function, Biological process and Cellular component. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>For these genes, the GO annotation awaits an experimental validation of functional hypothesis raised from high-throughput data analysis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>YER067W attracted our attention because of its high levels of expression in a wide range of conditions, such as intracellular iron depletion [3], carbon source restriction [4], high temperature, high osmotic stress, cold stress [5], unfolded protein response [6], and high hydrostatic pressure [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>These data point to the importance of YER067W as a stress-related gene in non-standard laboratory growth conditions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Another notable feature of YER067W gene regulation concerns its apparent correlation with the development of a drug-resistant phenotype in yeast. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>A study of S. cerevisiae showed that cells chronically treated with different antifungal drugs from the azole class display a consistent down-regulation of YER067W [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, two other independent works that employed microarray analysis to address differences in gene expression between fluconazole-resistant and -susceptible strains showed that both YER067W and its Candida albicans ortholog IPF20056 (ORF 191354) are repressed in the fluconazole-resistant strain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>This trait was observed in an experimentally induced resistant strain of S. cerevisiae that was selected for fluconazole tolerance after growth for 400 generations in the presence of the drug [9] and was also observed in three different clinical isolates of Candida albicans that developed fluconazole resistance [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Fungal infections are particularly complex to treat because there are few classes of antifungal drugs available and the repetition and lengthy duration of treatment favors the development of drug-resistant strains [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The most widely used drugs belong to the azole class, which inhibit the enzyme lanosterol demethylase (Erg11), involved in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Ergosterol is also the target for polyene drugs such as amphothericin B and nystatin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>As both classes of drugs act on components of the same pathway, the mechanisms of resistance developed against one kind of drug are frequently effective against the other. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Moreover, due to the similarity of the cellular machinery of fungi and metazoans, it is difficult to develop fungal-specific drugs [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the characterization of new fungal-specific proteins involved in the development of drug resistance is of outstanding interest. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Despite the notable induction of YER067W in several environmental conditions, very little data concerning protein-protein or genetic interaction is available for Yer067w. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Two-hybrid experiments and mass spectrometry-based identification of Yer067w interaction partners offer some potential hits, but they are never confirmed within the experiment (no more than a single identification event) or between experiments (coincident hits in different experiments) [13], [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the putative interaction partners are of very diverse functions and have promiscuous interaction profiles; for example, Rpp0, a ribosomal protein that was identified as a putative Yer067w interaction partner, appears to be physically associated to more than 100 proteins of varied functions [14]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The only GO annotation available for Yer067w comes from a genome-wide localization study using GFP-tagged proteins and points to a nuclear and cytoplasmic localization for Yer067w during normal growth conditions [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>In this work, we use existing gene regulation data and apply different experimental methodologies to improve the functional annotation of YER067W. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>We determine whether YER067W is adaptively important to S. cerevisiae and uncover the biological processes in which this stress-induced protein plays a role, including confirmation of the drug-resistance connection suggested by gene regulation data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>We more accurately determine the cellular distribution of this protein by observing the localization of an untagged Yer067w protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Finally, we present the three-dimensional structure of Yer067w and determine whether it resembles any previously characterized folds. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>To identify Yer067w homologs, we performed BLAST and PSI-BLAST similarity searches using the Yer067w protein sequence to query the non-redundant protein database (NCBI). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Despite the enhanced sensitivity of PSI-BLAST in searches for distantly-related proteins [16], both programs retrieved the same proteins, including the S. cerevisiae paralog Yil057c and orthologs from different fungal genera (Candida, Pichia, Ashbya, Kluyveromyces, Lodderomyces, Debaryomyces, and Vanderwaltozyma). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The search was completed by exploring the Fungal Orthogroups Repository [17], which retrieved homologs from other Saccharomyces and Candida species (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>This analysis clearly showed that the 23 proteins homologous to Yer067w are restricted to ascomycetes belonging to the Saccharomycotina subphyla. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The limited phylogenic distribution of Yer067w homologs is characteristic of orthologous “ORFans”, genes that are typically present in only a few, generally closely related organisms and have no annotated function [18]. </plain></SENT>

</text></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0011163.g001"/></fig></SecTag><p><text><SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Many orphan genes demonstrate a higher evolving rate than non-orphan genes, changing so quickly that sequence similarity cannot be traced beyond a certain evolutionary distance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>This trend suggests that those genes are under low selective pressure and perform accessory or redundant functions [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>To evaluate if this would be the case for YER067W, we analyzed the evolution rate of this gene and examined the phylogenetic history of Yer067w protein family. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Evolution rate can be inferred from the ratio of the number of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site (dN) to the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS), a measure that distinguishes the amino acid selection pressure from the background nucleotide mutation rate [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>In a previous work analyzing dN/dS ratio in four closely related yeast species (S. cerevisiae, S. mikatae, S. bayanus, and S. paradoxus), the dN/dS ratio for YER067W was 0.03, indicating a relatively slow mutation rate given that the whole genome mean for dN/dS ratios in S. cerevisiae was 0.10 [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>This analysis indicates that the YER067W locus is under strong selective constraint and that it is not a quickly evolving gene. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the phylogenetic tree constructed using YER067W homologs (Figure S1) closely resembles the evolutionary history of the Saccharomycotina subphyla [22], reinforcing the conservation of this gene family. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Another interesting feature of the YER067W family is the presence of a duplicated pair of homologs in almost every species that diverged after a whole genome duplication (WGD) event [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>The conservation of both genes in WGD yeast species is a remarkable feature because nearly 90% of the duplicated genes in yeast genomes have lost one member of the pair in the present-day set [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Because truly redundant genes are unlikely to exist, the presence of two copies may be explained by a neofunctionalization, in which one duplicate evolves a useful new function while the other one performs the ancestral function, or a subfunctionalization, in which the duplicates partition ancestral functions between themselves so that both duplicates are required for full fitness (for example, if the duplicate copies become differently expressed or localized within the cell). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>In the following sections, this question will be addressed by analyzing gene expression regulation and phenotypes associated with deletion of YER067W and its paralog YIL057C. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title><text><SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>YER067W and YIL057C display different induction patterns linked to genes involved in energy metabolism </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Analysis of global gene expression in several environmental conditions revealed an interesting feature of genome regulation: genes involved in common pathways or metabolic processes tend to be coordinately expressed/repressed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the functions of characterized genes in a given regulatory cluster can suggest hypothetical functions for uncharacterized genes in the same cluster [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>As YER067W expression is affected by a wide range of conditions, this approach can identify in which aspects of yeast physiology YER067W is involved. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>By comparing several data sets from microarray experiments using the program SPELL [24], we verified that the expression of the YER067W gene is tightly linked to genes involved in carbohydrate metabolic processes (p value  = 5.22 10−5), including glycogen synthases (GSY1 and GSY2) and trehalose synthase subunits (TPS2 and TSL1) (Table S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>However, the paralog YIL057C is mainly co-regulated with genes that are involved in lipid oxidation in the peroxisome such as PXA1, CTA1, POT1 and ECI1 (p-value of 5.9510−3) (Table S1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>These results are corroborated by the differences in the promoter structures of YER067W and YIL057C as determined by the program Yeastract (Table S2) [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>The YER067W promoter contains several binding sites for the stress response transcription factors Msn2/4 and Hsf1, and these sites have been functionally validated [5], [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Transcriptional control of YER067W by the main stress-responsive gene activators of Saccharomyces cerevisiae explains the wide range of conditions in which expression of this gene is induced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>However, the co-regulation of YER067W with metabolism-related genes and not heat-shock proteins, which are involved with protein homeostasis, suggests that YER067W is mainly implicated in energetic metabolism adjustments in response to adverse conditions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Conversely, YIL057C does not possess stress response elements such as Msn2/4 or Hsf1 in the promoter region (Table S2); instead, its induction seems to be governed by Adr1, a transcription factor that activates genes involved in the utilization of non-fermentable carbon sources, including many peroxisomal genes [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>This observation is in agreement with YIL057C up-regulation in situations that require aerobic energetic metabolism pathways [28]–[30] and is in accordance with the SPELL results (Table S1). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>The best scores (SSAP ranging from 70–74 and identity &lt;10%) suggested several possible classifications, including Roll architecture, as in Nuclear transport factor (NTF)-like proteins (Figure 8 C, D) and a two-layer sandwich architecture (Figure 8F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>The Yer067w structure differs from the NTF fold in two main aspects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>While the NTF fold is characterized by a highly curved β-sheet flanked by α-helices forming a conical structure [44], the Yer067w β-sheet is only slightly twisted, forming a supporting surface for the α-helices rather than a roll-like structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the C-terminal helix α4 of Yer067w is structurally aligned to the N-terminal helix α1 of NTF-like proteins, underlining the distinct topology among these proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>The other possible classification is a two-layer sandwich architecture represented by the TATA-binding protein (PDB code 1qna), which agrees well with the overall fold of Yer067w: a β-sheet backed by α-helices on one side. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>However, we could not find any structures in the CATH database with the same order and configuration of secondary structure elements as those of Yer067w, precluding a straightforward classification in any of the topologies already classified as the two-layer sandwich architecture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Thus, the Yer067w structure likely defines a new subfamily of the α/β proteins, contributing to our understanding of the protein-fold space and the relationship between sequence and three-dimensional structure. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>The most obvious difference in the DEHA0D04532 model is an insertion between strands β5 and β6 that is predicted to form two short β-strands in the model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>The structural models of the proteins from the post-WGD species are highly similar to the Yer067w structure, which reflects the high sequence identity between these proteins. </plain></SENT>
