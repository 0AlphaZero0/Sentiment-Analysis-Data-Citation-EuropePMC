Previous genetic and ultrastructural data revealed that the potyvirus cyclindrical inclusion (CI) protein is directly involved in cell-to-cell movement, likely through the formation of conical structures anchored to and extended through PD. In this study, we demonstrate that plasmodesmatal localization of CI in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaf cells is modulated by the recently discovered potyviral protein, P3N-PIPO, in a CI:P3N-PIPO ratio-dependent manner. We show that P3N-PIPO is a PD-located protein that physically interacts with CI <italic>in planta</italic>. The early secretory pathway, rather than the actomyosin motility system, is required for the delivery of P3N-PIPO and CI to PD. Moreover, CI mutations that disrupt virus cell-to-cell movement compromise PD-localization capacity. These data suggest that the CI and P3N-PIPO complex coordinates the formation of PD-associated structures that facilitate the intercellular movement of potyviruses in infected plants.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Plant viral pathogens cause an estimated US$60 billion loss in crop yields worldwide each year. Potyviruses, accounting for &#8764;30% of known plant viruses, include many agriculturally important viruses. Despite their importance, the cell-to-cell spread of potyviruses remains poorly understood. Previous studies have shown that at early time points of infection, the virus-encoded CI protein, one of 11 known potyviral proteins, is associated with cone-shaped structures at plasmodesmata (PD) and is involved in viral cell-to-cell movement. In this paper, we show that a newly identified potyviral protein, P3N-PIPO, is a PD-located protein and directs the CI protein to PD, facilitating the deposition of the cone-shaped structures of CI at PD by interacting with CI protein. We demonstrate that the mutant of CI, which impairs potyviral cell-to-cell movement, loses its ability to accumulate at PD. We further reveal that P3N-PIPO utilizes the secretory pathway rather than the actomyosin motility system for trafficking to PD. Taken together, the data presented in this study suggest that CI and P3N-PIPO coordinates the formation of conical structure at PD for potyviral cell-to-cell spread.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability of plant viruses to cross the cell wall barrier between an infected and adjacent healthy cell is a prerequisite to establish systemic infection <xref rid="ppat.1000962-MauleA1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ppat.1000962-Boevink1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.

Based on the characteristics of their intercellular transport, plant viruses can be classified into several groups. One group, which includes tobamoviruses, encodes a single dedicated MP that associates with, and increases the size exclusion limits of, PD to allow transport of virions or viral genomes (nucleic acids) through the modified channel <xref rid="ppat.1000962-Kawakami1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1000962-Wright1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The second group includes many plant viruses with icosahedral particles, and requires both the MP and coat protein (CP) for cell-to-cell movement.

This speculation is also supported by the finding that potyviral P3 protein does not interact with CI <xref rid="ppat.1000962-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.

Unlike PDLP1, both P3N-PIPO and CI lack a typical transmembrane domain. Disrupting the ER-Golgi secretory pathway obstructed the targeting of P3N-PIPO and CI to PD, whereas impairing the actomyosin motility system had little effect on their PD localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000962-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, targeting of P3N-PIPO and CI to PD requires a functional secretory pathway but not the actomyosin motility system. Interestingly, targeting of PDLP1 to PD is mediated by a transmembrane domain and requires both the ER-Golgi secretory pathway and the actomyosin motility system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000962-g004">Figure 4</xref>) <xref rid="ppat.1000962-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.

As P3N-PIPO is translated via ribosomal frameshifting <xref rid="ppat.1000962-Chung1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, the ratio of CI to P3N-PIPO biosynthesis depends on the frameshift efficiency. In PSbMV&#8211;infected pea cotyledons, cell wall-associated CI conical structures were found only in the infection front where active genome translation and replication was occurring <xref rid="ppat.1000962-Roberts1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In cells behind this zone, CI was no longer associated with the cell wall, which is consistent with the temporal series of events documented in the current study. The transient association of CI structures with PD could be conditional upon the level of viral genome translation, frameshifting and the subsequent CI:P3N-PIPO ratio.</p><p>Targeting of CI to PD by P3N-PIPO may also be affected by CI self-interactions. Two movement-defective CI mutants (DD3, 4AA and KK101,102AA), previously shown to have reduced self-interacting strength <xref rid="ppat.1000962-GmezdeCedrn1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, lost ability to form cytoplasmic structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000962-g006">Figure 6C</xref>, panel III; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000962-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). When these mutants were either expressed alone or in the presence of P3N-PIPO, they were distributed to the cell periphery and the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000962-g007">Figure 7B,C</xref>). Though these mutants could still interact with P3N-PIPO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000962-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), they were unable to accumulate at PD to form the thread-like structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000962-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Therefore, the proper self-assembly of CI is necessary for its interaction with P3N-PIPO to form the cone-shape structure at PD for viral cell-to-cell movement.</p><p>During the reviewing process of this paper, Wen and Hajimorad reported that mutation of the putative SMV PIPO impedes cell-to-cell movement <xref rid="ppat.1000962-Wen1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, providing genetic evidence that P3N-PIPO is a potyviral MP. Thus, our data reveals the mechanism by which P3N-PIPO functions as an MP. Taking into account these new findings, we propose a model for the formation of movement complexes that facilitate intercellular transport of potyviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000962-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Initial events likely involve the recruitment of nascent virus particles by CI or self-interacting CI structures at membrane-bound sites of replication adjacent to chloroplasts. Next, CI-virion complexes may associate with either pre-targeted P3N-PIPO followed by trafficking to PD, or with PD-associated P3N-PIPO. CI structures are then proposed to grow from P3N-PIPO-anchored sites at PD, forming thread-like structures that might recruit additional virus particles for transport. Actual movement of virus particles through PD may be facilitated by PD-traversing CI complexes, although the details of this proposed event are not known. It is difficult to imagine a mechanistic role for the late-forming cytoplasmic aggregates in virus movement, as these form during a post-movement phase of infection. This model bears some similarity to that proposed by Jackson and colleagues for cell-to-cell movement of hordeiviruses <xref rid="ppat.1000962-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1000962-VerchotLubicz1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, which encode three MPs (TGB1, TGB2 and TGB3). The hordeivirus model states that TGB1 binds the viral RNAs to form movement complexes. Interaction with TGB3 targets the TGB1-RNA movement complex to PD. TGB2 then interacts with TGB3 to stabilize the movement complex at PD and facilitate PD gating. The key deficits of the proposed models center around the mechanisms underlying gating, the mechanisms to generate force, and the impact of these virus-associated events on the normal functions of PD in intercellular trafficking and defense. These represent critical areas of future study.</p><fig id="ppat-1000962-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000962.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Model for potyvirus intercellular transport through PD.</title><p>The virion-CI movement complex is intracellularly transported to the modified PD where CI forms conical structures anchored by the PD-located P3N-PIPO.

Destination vectors pEarleygate100, pEarleygate102, pMDC83, pMDC43, pGWB454 and pGWB455 were used to express untagged protein, C-terminal CFP-HA fusion protein, C-terminal GFP-6xHis fusion protein, N-terminal GFP fusion protein, C-terminal mRFP fusion protein, and N-terminal mRFP fusion protein, respectively <xref rid="ppat.1000962-Curtis1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ppat.1000962-Nakagawa1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. The vectors used in the BiFC assay were modified from pEarlyGate vectors 201 and 202, where the YFP N-terminus comprises amino acids 1&#8211;174 and the C-terminus comprises amino acids 174&#8211;239 <xref rid="ppat.1000962-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The recombinant TuMV infectious clones containing 6K-GFP (TuMV:6K-GFP) and GFP (TuMV:GFP) were as described previously <xref rid="ppat.1000962-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1000962-Wei2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Plasmid pTEV7DA-GFP was described <xref rid="ppat.1000962-Schaad1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. The P1, HC-Pro, P3, P3N-PIPO, 6K1, CI, 6K2, NIa, NIb and CP coding regions of TuMV were amplified by PCR, recombined into pDONR221, and then into the binary destination vector pEarleygate100 for expressing nontagged proteins. The entry vector pDONR221 containing TuMV P3N-PIPO or CI were transferred by recombination into the binary destination vectors pEarleygate102, pMDC83 and pGWB454 to produce plasmids TuMV P3N-PIPO-CFP, TuMV P3N-PIPO-GFP, TuMV P3N-PIPO-mRFP, TuMV CI-GFP, and TuMV P3N-PIPO-mRFP. The entry vector pDONR221 containing TuMV CP was transferred by recombination into the binary destination vectors pMDC43 and pGWB455 to produce plasmids TuMV GFP-CP and TuMV mRFP-CP, respectively. The TEV P3N-PIPO, wild-type CI, and two CI mutants (DD3, 4AA and KR100,101AA) were amplified by PCR, recombined into pDONR221, and then into the binary destination vectors pEarleygate100, pMDC43 or pGWB455 to generate plasmids TEV P3N-PIPO (nontagged), TEV P3N-PIPO-GFP, TEV-CI-mRFP, TEV CI(AA3, 4)-mRFP and TEV CI(AA100,101)-mRFP. For BiFC experiments, the pDONR221vectors containing TuMV P3N-PIPO and CI were recombined into BiFC vectors YN and YC to generate P3N-PIPO-YN (YC) and CI-YN (YC), respectively. The pDONR221 vectors containing TEV P3N-PIPO, CI, CI(AA3, 4) and CI(AA100,101) were recombined into BiFC vectors YN and YC to generate TEV P3N-PIPO-YN (YC), CI-YN (YC), CI(AA3, 4)-YN (YC) and CI(AA100,101)-YN (YC), respectively. The plasmid containing the PDLP1:GFP was a kind gift from Andrew J. Maule (John Innes Centre, UK). The DNA fragment for PDLP1 was amplified and recombined into pDONR221 and then into the binary destination vector pGWB454 to give PDLP1-mRFP.
