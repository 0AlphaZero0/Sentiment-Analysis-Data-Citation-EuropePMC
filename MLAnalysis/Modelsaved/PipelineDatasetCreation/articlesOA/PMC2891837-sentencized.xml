</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The ability of plant viruses to cross the cell wall barrier between an infected and adjacent healthy cell is a prerequisite to establish systemic infection [1]–[6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Cell-to-cell movement of viruses occurs through plasmodesmata (PD), a specialized intercellular organelle, unique to the plant kingdom [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>PD are structurally complex microchannels that cross the cell wall and establish cytoplasmic and endomembrane continuity between neighboring cells [1], [2], [7], [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>PD allow small molecules to diffuse between cells and regulate the intercellular trafficking of macromolecules or macromolecular complexes such as virions and ribonucleoprotein complexes [1], [2], [7], [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Viral cell-to-cell movement through PD is mediated by virus-encoded factors termed movement protein (MP) [9], [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Based on the characteristics of their intercellular transport, plant viruses can be classified into several groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>One group, which includes tobamoviruses, encodes a single dedicated MP that associates with, and increases the size exclusion limits of, PD to allow transport of virions or viral genomes (nucleic acids) through the modified channel [11], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The second group includes many plant viruses with icosahedral particles, and requires both the MP and coat protein (CP) for cell-to-cell movement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>This group, which includes nepo- and comoviruses, encodes an MP that forms PD-associated tubules that traverse the cell wall and through which virions move [13], [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The third group includes several viruses with filamentous particles, such as potexviruses, that contain a set of three movement genes called the triple gene block. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>These genes encode proteins that are assumed to function coordinately, but without forming the tubular structure, to transport viral particles or genomes through PD [3], [4], [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The family Potyviridae consists of approximately 30% of known plant viruses, including many agriculturally important viruses, e.g., Plum pox virus (PPV), Soybean mosaic virus (SMV), Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), Tobacco etch virus (TEV) and Tobacco vein mottling virus (TVMV) [16], [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Potyviruses contain a flexuous filamentous virion morphology composed of approximately 2000 copies of CP, and possess dimensions of 680–900 nm by 11–15 nm [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The potyviral genome is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of approximately 10 kilobases (kb), containing a long open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polyprotein that is cleaved into ∼10 mature proteins [18], [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>They are, from the N terminus of the polyprotein, P1, helper component proteinase (HC-Pro), P3, 6K1, cyclindrical inclusion (CI), 6K2, viral genome-linked protein of nuclear inclusion protein a (NIa-VPg), proteinase domain of NIa (NIa-Pro), nuclear inclusion protein b (NIb), and CP (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In addition, a small ORF encoding a recently identified ∼25 kDa protein, P3N-PIPO, is embedded in the P3 coding region as a plus 2 frameshift sequence (Figure 1) [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Of these 11 potyviral proteins, CI, CP, HC-Pro and VPg have been suggested to be involved in viral cell-to-cell movement [9], [21], [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidence indicates that HC-Pro and VPg are essential in other aspects of the infection process such as viral genome replication or suppression on host defense (RNA silencing) [23], [24], where as CP and CI are more likely to be MPs [9], [25]–[29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the conserved core region of CP abolish virion assembly and cell-to-cell movement, suggesting potyviruses likely move as virions [25], [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>High-resolution ultrastructural analyses indicate that CI forms the cone-shaped structures at the cell periphery adjacent to PD [27]–[29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>CP and viral RNA are present in these PD-associated structures in infected cells [27], [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Moreover, substitutions affecting the N terminus of CI can result in loss of cell-to-cell movement without compromising virus replication at the single cell level [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>These findings support the idea that potyvirus intercellular transport involves interactions between virus particles, CI structures and PD. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>These punctate bodies of CI-mRFP spanned walls of the two adjoining cells, appearing in patterns as PD [30]. </plain></SENT>
