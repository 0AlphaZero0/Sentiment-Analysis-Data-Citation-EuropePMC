</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The human population contains approximately 10 million single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) account for a large portion of the known genetic variations associated with human diseases (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Many experimental mutagenesis studies have been dedicated to the identification of disease-causing amino acid (AA) substitutions among SNP sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, experimental mutagenesis is time-, labor- and cost-demanding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, numerous computational tools have been developed to predict effects of AA substitutions on protein function. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The reported methods have significantly different input requirements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>(i) One set of tools focuses only on sequence-based features (3–7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>For example, Ng and Henikoff (5) developed a homology-based algorithm (SIFT; sorting intolerant from tolerant) to estimate the viability of substitutions according to the profiles of AA residues in alignment columns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>(ii) A number of approaches extend beyond the use of alignments to sequence-based prediction of structural features (3,5,7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>For instance, Bromberg and Rost (3) trained neural networks using, among other features, predicted secondary structure and residue solvent accessibility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>(iii) To reflect the differences between the wild type AA and the mutant, several methods utilize physicochemical features (3,6,7), illustrating the differences in the hydropathy, secondary structure propensities, etc. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>(iv) With the growing number of solved structures, several tools choose to utilize observed structural data such as solvent accessibility (8–11), distance to the ligand (9–11), statistical knowledge-based potentials (9) and micro-environment description (8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>(v) A number of studies show that prediction can be improved by combining information from various sources (3,7,11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>For example, PolyPhen (11) employs a rule-based system that incorporates information from the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot annotations (12) together with data extracted from solved 3D-structure and sequence alignment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>AA substitution prediction algorithms are usually contingent on a data set of substitution variants that have been experimentally annotated as neutral or non-neutral. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The available data sets can be broadly divided into four categories. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>(i) Relatively clean substitution data collected from extensive mutagenesis studies (13–15). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>These studies probe nearly all substitutions over whole proteins to reflect the whole spectrum of effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>(ii) Comprehensive collections of naturally occurring substitutions annotated through association studies and targeted laboratory mutagenesis experiments (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (12), HGMD (2), etc). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, this data might be biased by investigator interest and some of the annotated neutrals are likely non-neutral mutations whose disease associations were overlooked. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the number of false non-neutral annotations obtained from association studies is also relatively high (16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>(iii) The Protein Mutant Database (PMD) (17), representative of the third type of data, avoids the problem of false non-neutrals by reporting substitutions that have been experimentally validated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>(iv) The fourth category includes evolutionary model (EM)-based substitution data sets that are a relatively reliable set of neutral mutations created by analyzing single residue substitutions between orthologous proteins (3,7). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Herein, we present a web-based tool, named MuD, aimed at distinguishing functionally neutral and non-neutral AA substitutions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>MuD utilizes a machine learning algorithm and a set of structural- and sequence-based features. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>A benchmark experiment using a cross-validation on a subset of the Bromberg and Rost (3) data set (Sub-BR data set) showed similar performance as SNAP (screening for non-acceptable polymorphisms). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>However, the performance on a test set of three proteins (3-PRO), which have previously been used for benchmarking, confirmed the importance of using reliable experimentally verified structural data (e.g. naturally occurring ligands pertinent to the function of the protein and the biological oligomerization state of the protein). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Given this improvement in performance, we enabled the MuD server to allow users to guide the prediction scheme using select structural features. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The web server is free and open to all users and there is no login requirement. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>We employed a Random Forests machine-learning algorithm to differentiate between non-neutral and neutral substitutions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The model was trained and tested on the Sub-BR data set (described below) using cross-validation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In addition, we evaluated the performance on the 3-PRO data set after training on the complete Sub-BR data set. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec><title><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Data sets </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>MuD’s model was trained on substitutions extracted from the Bromberg and Rost (3) data set. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Since MuD requires both sequence and structural data, we excluded proteins for which the structure was not available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>We also excluded proteins with fewer than five homologs, and substitutions in positions with low information content, as measured by the ConSurf (18) confidence interval. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>This filtration procedure resulted in a set of 19 615 substitutions (70% non-neutral). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>A balanced data set contributes to the prediction accuracy (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Thus, we randomly removed approximately a third of the non-neutral substitutions, yielding a balanced set (Sub-BR) comprising 12 133 substitutions from 1178 proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Of this subset, 10 253 substitutions originated from PMD and 2065 were EM substitutions. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>After applying the filtration procedure (as explained previously), we retained subsets with 1773/2230, 148/157 and 315/1475 non-neutral to neutral mutants ratios, respectively; constituting 99%, 90% and 89% of the original data sets, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>The original mutagenesis experiments classified each substitution into four categories: no phenotypic effect and three levels of severity of phenotypic change. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>We followed the reduced binary classification of Ref. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>(9), where the substitutions with no effect were deemed neutral and the rest were non-neutral. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>The solvent accessibility was calculated according to the structure (among all the protein’s structures) in which the query position had the least area of side chain solvent accessibility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>This structure was used to calculate two solvent accessibility features: Cβ density (10) and side chain accessible surface area (using NACCESS (28)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>To measure the involvement of the query position in the oligomerization interfaces, we performed a search over all available structures for the maximal difference between the heavy atom density of the query position in its single chain and complex forms. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>To identify residues involved in ligand binding or catalytic activity, we measured the shortest distance between the heavy atoms of the query position and of the ligands in all available structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>A ligand was defined as a hetero atom compound, dinucleotide chain or a protein chain shorter than 15 AAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Since crystal structures often include ingredients of the crystallization solution, which are not naturally present, we strove to rank the ligands according to their biological relevance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>We assumed that the evolutionary conservation of the binding site indicates whether the ligand bound to the site is indeed naturally present. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we ranked the ligands according to the ConSurf conservation score assigned to the most conserved AA with a distance of 4 Å from the ligand. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>This value was selected empirically (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq528/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>(8), but taking into account the residue environment of homologs (inferred from the MSA). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Given a query position, we retrieved from the protein structure all the AA positions Ψ whose Cα atoms were within a distance of 9 Å from the Cα of the query position. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Next, according to the alignment of the AA sequence of the query protein in the MSA we defined MSA columns T that correspond to Ψ. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we added a feature that specifies the sequence identity of the query protein to the closest homolog bearing the mutant AA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>For example, the mutation I104S in the human protein transthyretin (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID: TTHY_HUMAN) is known to cause amyloidosis Type 1 (29). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>The performance of MuD on the Sub-BR data set was examined using a leave-one-out cross-validation test. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>To empirically estimate how well the method can be generalized to unseen substitutions it is important that the training and testing sets are as dissimilar as possible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Therefore, during each iteration of the leave-one-out cross-validation, all substitutions from a single protein were designated for testing, whereas the substitutions belonging to proteins with HSSP distances ≤0 (27) to the test protein were designated for training. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>For alignments of &gt;250 residues this HSSP-distance threshold infers that no pair of proteins had over 21% pairwise sequence identity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>To calculate the average and SD for the performance measures, we used a bootstrap procedure with 1000 iterations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>At each iteration we randomly selected 60% of the data set while maintaining a balanced ratio of non-neutral to neutral substitutions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>The performance measures on each subset were calculated according to predictions obtained during the cross-validation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>To compare PolyPhen’s performance, we defined the ‘benign’ and ‘possibly damaging’ predictions as neutral and the prediction ‘probably damaging’ as non-neutral. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>This binary classification gave the highest Matthew’s correlation coefficient (MCC) value for the PolyPhen predictions on the Sub-BR data set (MCC of 0.39 ± 0.01). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>The alternative definition, setting ‘benign’ predictions as neutral and ‘possibly damaging’ predictions and ‘probably damaging’ as non-neutral gave a lower MCC of 0.35 ± 0.01. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>To further measure MuD’s performance, we trained on the Sub-BR data set and tested on the 3-PRO data set in fully- and semi-automatic schemes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>As in the cross validation procedure, only proteins with an HSSP-value ≤0 to any of the 3-PRO proteins were retained in the training set. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>In the semi-automatic scheme, all ligands not present naturally were disregarded and the oligomerization state of the protein was determined according to the literature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Specifically, (i) the T4 lysozyme was predicted as a dimer by the PQS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>However, according to the literature its biological unit is a monomer (30). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>As the T4 lysozyme has been used as a scaffold for the creation of an artificial binding site, most of its solved structures include biologically non-relevant ligands (30). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Hence, we disregarded all ligands found in the T4 lysozyme structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>(ii) Most of the HIV protease structures have an inhibitor located at the active site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>All other ligands and additional chains were removed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>(iii) At the semi-automatic prediction of the lac I repressor substitutions, we considered only the DNA segments and ligands that were located at the known repressor binding site. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>To assess the overall performance, we utilized both the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under curve (AUC) and the MCC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>The ROC curve analysis does not require the determination of a decision threshold and as such can better describe the performance of the prediction. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Although all methods exhibited a decline in the performance on the Sub-PMD data set relative to the performance on the Sub-BR data set, MuD surpassed all methods on the Sub-PMD data set. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Values in the table have been multiplied by 100. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>The Sub-BR data set consists of two subsets: substitutions extracted from the PMD database and neutral EM substitutions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the performance of MuD on each of these subsets separately. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>MuD did better than SIFT, PolyPhen and SNAP on the Sub-PMD data set. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>However, the performance of all four methods on this set was lower than on the entire data set. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>MuD had a high FP rate of 41.1 ± 0.6% on the substitutions extracted from the PMD compared to only 2.0 ± 0.2% on the EM subset. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>The implications of this are discussed in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq528/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link>. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Prediction performance may also depend on the protein’s structural class. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>To examine this possibility, we analyzed the cross-validation results of SNAP and MuD and the predictions made by SIFT and PolyPhen on the Sub-BR data set according to the SCOP class assignment of the query proteins (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq528/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Ninty seven percent of the Sub-BR data set mutations occur at proteins assigned by SCOP to one of the seven ‘true’ SCOP classes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Across all SCOP classes MuD performed as good as any of the other methods or better. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>The performance of MuD, SNAP and SIFT on the ‘membrane and cell surface proteins and peptides’ and ‘small proteins’ classes showed a decline in the performance relative to the four main SCOP classes (all α, all β, α / β, α + β). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>These classes comprise a small number of substitutions (437 and 391, respectively), but the decline may be indicative of a true difficulty. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated performance on additional data sets that have previously been used for benchmarking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Our results of the fully automated and of the semi-automatic schemes were compared with SIFT, PolyPhen and SNAP (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>A comparison between all the fully automated methods indicated that neither was favorable over the others. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>SNAP performed best on the T4 lysozyme, SIFT performed best on the HIV protease and MuD performed best on the lac I repressor data set. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>However, semi-automatic MuD surpassed all other methods in all performance measures.

<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>The performance of the automatic predictors appears to depend on the evaluation criterion and data set. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless as indicated by all measures, the application of the semi-automatic prediction scheme improved the performance, thus surpassing all the fully-automatic methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>In the semi-automatic prediction, we removed from the solved crystal structures of the query proteins, the structures of the non-naturally present ligands and selected the appropriate dimerization state for each of the proteins. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>We tested MuD using cross-validation analysis on the Sub-BR data set and found automatic MuD to be as good as SNAP, and better than PolyPhen and SIFT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>However, the assessment also indicates that MuD might be less suitable for the prediction of substitutions in non-globular and small proteins. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>The incorporation of structural features such as solvent accessibility, ligand proximity and oligomerization interfaces into the automatic MuD might not always be advantageous. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>This is due to (i) the presence of non-naturally present ligands, such as ingredients of the crystallization solution and (ii) incorrect oligomerization state assignments that may hinder the prediction accuracy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>To alleviate these problems, the MuD web server implementation offers a semi-automatic scheme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>It enables the user to incorporate additional data about the target protein in order to improve the prediction accuracy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>This procedure aims reducing the erroneous features that might be extracted from the crystal structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Specifically, the graphical interface of the server allows the user to filter out irrelevant ligands and to select the structure of the biological unit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the user can change the indication of functionally important residues. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Detailed analysis of three well-characterized proteins showed that the incorporation of target-specific data on each protein via the semi-automatic scheme improved the prediction performance, surpassing current methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>The largest difference in the performance between the semi-automatic and automatic MuD is manifested in the T4 lysozyme data set. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>This is not surprising since many of the PDB T4 lysozyme structures contain non-relevant ligands and do not present the protein in its correct biological shape. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>An important aspect of MuD is the ascription of a reliability score to every prediction (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq528/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>The reliability score offers the researcher a qualitative assessment of the prediction, indicating its expected accuracy, sensitivity and precision. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>The reliability score can be used to prioritize substitutions in a given set according to their likelihood of affecting the protein function. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>We are hopeful that this tool will assist researchers in the annotation of disease causing substitutions in proteins with a solved crystal structure. </plain></SENT>
