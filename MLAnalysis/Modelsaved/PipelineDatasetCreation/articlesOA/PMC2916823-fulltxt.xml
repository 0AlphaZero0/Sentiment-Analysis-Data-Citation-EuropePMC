One of the earliest responses is the attenuation of protein translation. Little is known about the role that Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization plays in the early UPR. Work from our group has shown that cytosolic phosphorylation of calnexin (CLNX) controls Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake into the ER via the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (SERCA) 2b.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Here, we demonstrate that calcineurin (CN), a Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent phosphatase, associates with the (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), and promotes PERK auto-phosphorylation. This association, in turn, increases the phosphorylation level of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 &#945; (eIF2-&#945;) and attenuates protein translation. Data supporting these conclusions were obtained from co-immunoprecipitations, pull-down assays, <italic>in-vitro</italic> kinase assays, siRNA treatments and [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine incorporation measurements. The interaction of CN with PERK was facilitated at elevated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and involved the cytosolic domain of PERK. CN levels were rapidly increased by ER stressors, which could be blocked by siRNA treatments for CN-A&#945; in cultured astrocytes. Downregulation of CN blocked subsequent ER-stress-induced increases in phosphorylated elF2-&#945;. CN knockdown in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes predisposed them to induction of apoptosis. </p><p>We also found that CLNX was dephosphorylated by CN when Ca<sup>2+</sup> increased. These data were obtained from [&#947;<sup>32</sup>P]-CLNX immunoprecipitations and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging measurements. CLNX was dephosphorylated when <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes were treated with ER stressors. Dephosphorylation was pharmacologically blocked by treatment with CN inhibitors. </p><p>Finally, evidence is presented that PERK phosphorylates CN-A at low resting levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We further show that phosphorylated CN-A exhibits decreased phosphatase activity, consistent with this regulatory mechanism being shut down as ER homeostasis is re-established.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Our data suggest two new complementary roles for CN in the regulation of the early UPR. First, CN binding to PERK enhances inhibition of protein translation to allow the cell time to recover. The induction of the early UPR, as indicated by increased P-elF2&#945;, is critically dependent on a translational increase in CN-A&#945;. Second, CN dephosphorylates CLNX and likely removes inhibition of SERCA2b activity, which would aid the rapid restoration of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ER is a dynamic organelle that plays a critical role in a variety of processes, including Ca<sup>2+</sup> storage and release, synthesis and folding of proteins, as well as post-translational protein modification.

This activates a signal transduction pathway called the <underline>U</underline>nfolded <underline>P</underline>rotein <underline>R</underline>esponse (UPR) that attempts to restore homeostasis in the ER <xref rid="pone.0011925-Schroder1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. An immediate response is the attenuation of protein translation via PERK, which phosphorylates the &#945; subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2&#945;) <xref rid="pone.0011925-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011925-Harding1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. PERK is a type I ER membrane protein with a stress-sensing luminal domain connected by a transmembrane segment to a cytoplasmic-kinase domain. PERK is normally inactive due to the association of its luminal domain with the ER chaperone BiP. During ER stress, BiP is competitively titrated from the luminal domain of PERK by the excess of unfolded proteins <xref rid="pone.0011925-Bertolotti1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. This dissociation causes PERK to undergo homo-oligomerization and trans-autophosphorylation within its cytosolic kinase domain, thereby increasing its activity. Additional changes that promote long-term adaptation are transcriptional up-regulation of ER chaperones and molecules involved in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD). If ER damage is persistent or excessive, an apoptotic response is initiated by either ER specific caspases <xref rid="pone.0011925-Nakagawa1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011925-Hitomi1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> or by mechanisms related with the mitogen-activated protein kinase JNK or transcriptional activation of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) <xref rid="pone.0011925-Urano1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011925-Marciniak1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>Maintenance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the ER is primarily attained by the activity of SERCAs <xref rid="pone.0011925-Lytton1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011925-Camacho1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011925-MacLennan1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, which pump Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the ER. These Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPases counteract the loss of Ca<sup>2+</sup> via leaks and the opening of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channels <xref rid="pone.0011925-Berridge1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011925-Hofer1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011925-Ehrlich1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The free Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the ER is a balance between Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, uptake and buffering by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins in the lumen. Calreticulin (CRT) and CLNX are Ca<sup>2+</sup> -binding chaperones that reside in the ER <xref rid="pone.0011925-Bergeron1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011925-Michalak1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and play key roles in modulating SERCA 2b activity <xref rid="pone.0011925-John1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011925-Roderick1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011925-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. CRT is entirely luminal and CLNX is a type I trans-membrane protein. The carboxy-terminus of each protein is luminal and is responsible for interaction of the lectins with the monoglucosylated form of N-linked glycoprotein during protein folding <xref rid="pone.0011925-Bergeron1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011925-Wada1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In the cytosolic domain of CLNX, three phosphorylated residues have been identified <xref rid="pone.0011925-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> that are implicated in the modulation of the interaction of CLNX with the ribosome <xref rid="pone.0011925-Chevet1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Dephosphorylation of CLNX causes dissociation of the chaperone from the ribosome <xref rid="pone.0011925-Chevet1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Our group identified the carboxy-terminal serine residue 562 in the rat isoform of CLNX as a phosphorylation site capable of controlling SERCA 2b activity. Further, we demonstrated that CLNX phosphorylation acted as a cytosolic switch that regulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> store refilling <xref rid="pone.0011925-Roderick1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Calcineurin is a Ca<sup>2+</sup> and calmodulin dependent serine/threonine phosphatase. This heterodimer phosphatase is composed of a catalytic subunit, calcineurin A (CN-A) and a regulatory subunit, calcineurin B (CN-B) <xref rid="pone.0011925-Klee1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. CN-A contains specific domains with regulatory functions, including an amino-terminus domain with catalytic properties, a CN-B binding domain, a calmodulin (CaM) binding domain and finally, an autoinhibitory domain (AI) at the carboxy-terminus <xref rid="pone.0011925-Sagoo1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. At resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, the phosphatase is relatively inactive. An increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> activates CN-A through Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding, which dissociates AI from the catalytic domain <xref rid="pone.0011925-Perrino1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. To date, the involvement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in a multitude of cellular pathways has been well documented <xref rid="pone.0011925-Berridge1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. However, little is known about the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in restoring ER homeostasis, once ER stress has been triggered. Here we reveal that CN plays key roles in restoring ER homeostasis during stress. CN activity boosts the refilling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores so that optimal conditions for protein processing/folding are rapidly reached. CN also directly interacts with PERK to increase its auto-phosphorylation, which helps to attenuate protein translation while homeostasis is being restored. Finally, we show that a knockdown of CN levels in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes results in a decrease of protein synthesis inhibition and a rapid acceleration of apoptosis. Taken together, these data underscore the importance of CN activity in the rescue of cells from ER stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>CLNX is Dephosphorylated during ER Stress by CN</title><p>Thapsigargin (Tg) is an irreversible inhibitor of the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPases <xref rid="pone.0011925-Thastrup1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. It induces ER stress by depleting Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores with a concomitant increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, causing accumulation of malfolded proteins within the ER <xref rid="pone.0011925-Prostko1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. By site directed mutagenesis, we previously demonstrated that phosphorylation of serine residue 562 in CLNX controlled an interaction with SERCA 2b. Phosphorylation of S562 inhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup> store refilling while dephosphorylation increased SERCA 2b activity <xref rid="pone.0011925-Roderick1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Given its ability to regulate SERCA 2b activity, we asked if ER stress altered the phosphorylation state of CLNX. To this end, CLNX mRNA (0.7 &#181;g/&#181;l) was overexpressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes as previously described (Roderick et al. 2000). After 3 days of protein expression, oocytes were labelled with [&#947;<sup>32</sup>P]ATP for 20 minutes, the microsomal fraction was extracted and an anti-CLNX antibody was used to immunoprecipitate the protein. We observed a significant level of phosphorylation of CLNX under normal resting conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011925-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, 0 minutes). In a subpopulation, we treated CLNX overexpressing oocytes with Tg (1 &#181;M) for 15, 30 and 60 minutes. When the precipitates were examined with autoradiography, we observed significant (p&lt;0.05) dephosphorylation at all time points tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011925-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). To determine if overexpression of CLNX itself caused ER stress, we measured the levels of ER stress in native and overexpressing CLNX oocytes. This was accomplished by a Western blot probed with an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated form of eIF2&#945; (anti-phospho eIF2&#945;) and an antibody against BiP, both are widely considered strong indicators of ER stress <xref rid="pone.0011925-Harding1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011925-Prostko1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Overexpression of CLNX did not affect the level of phosphorylated eIF2&#945; or BiP and hence, did not induce ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011925-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). These results show that ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion and/or increased cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> decreases CLNX phosphorylation. To test whether CN may be mediating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive dephosphorylation of CLNX, we repeated the above series of experiments using the CN inhibitors cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506. Preincubation of oocytes with these inhibitors completely reversed the dephosphorylation of CLNX in response to Tg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011925-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and treatment consistent with a primary role of CN in this ER stress response.</p><fig id="pone-0011925-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0011925.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>CLNX is dephosphorylated during ER stress by CN.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) IPs of [&#947;<sup>32</sup>P]ATP-labeled CLNX from oocytes in the absence (0 minutes) or presence (15, 30 and 60 minutes) of Tg (1 &#181;M) were performed.

</title><p>The dependence of CLNX phosphorylation on CN activity suggested that Ca<sup>2+</sup> was being released into the cytosol during Tm-induced ER stress.

Since PERK is presently considered the most proximal luminal sensor of the UPR <xref rid="pone.0011925-Harding1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, we wondered if there was a functional relationship between CN and PERK. To initially address this question, <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes were treated with Tg (1 &#181;M) for either 15, 30 or 60 minutes. A second group of oocytes were initially treated with DTT (1 mM) for 60 minutes and then washed for either 0, 20 or 60 minutes. Like Tg and Tm, DTT is an ER stress inducer, but its effects are reported to be reversible <xref rid="pone.0011925-Bertolotti1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011925-Harding2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Protein extracts were prepared from each of the six groups of oocytes along with an untreated, control group. The cytosolic fractions were run on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot with anti-CN-A antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011925-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). We observed that the expression level of CN-A increased significantly after 30 and 60 minutes following Tg treatment and also after 1 hour of treatment with DTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011925-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Partial reversal of the 1 hour exposure of oocytes to DTT was obtained by washing the treated oocytes for another hour before preparing the protein extract. Furthermore, we examined whether endogenous CN could associate with the endogenous PERK by co-immunoprecipitations (Co-IPs) of CN-A with PERK in the same oocytes stressed with either Tg or DTT as presented above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011925-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The respective microsomal fractions were immunoprecipitated with anti-CN-A antibody, run on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot with anti-PERK antibody, which labeled both phosphorylated and the higher mobile unphosphorylated PERK. First, we found that the largest amount of CN-A that co-immunopurified with P-PERK/PERK occurred at the highest level of ER stress (60 minutes) for both Tg or DTT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011925-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>, lanes 4 and 5). Second, the presence of CN-A appeared to increase PERK phosphorylation levels.

CN performs this important function with the aid of two ER transmembrane proteins: CLNX and PERK. Consequently, CN can now be viewed as an active participant in the UPR by virtue of its ability to couple the cytoplasmic side to the ER lumen in a Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent manner. We previously established that when the ER is optimally loaded with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the most favorable condition necessary for protein processing and folding, CLNX is phosphorylated and physically interacts with SERCA 2b to inhibit its activity <xref rid="pone.0011925-Roderick1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. We also demonstrated that IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release caused a Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent dephosphorylation of serine residue (S562) in the cytosolic domain of CLNX. This removed the functional interaction of CLNX with the pump, removing inhibition and maximizing SERCA 2b-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> store refilling. CLNX phosphorylation had already been shown to regulate its association with the ribosome, which facilitated the presentation and binding of newly synthesized glycoproteins to the chaperone <xref rid="pone.0011925-Chevet1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Dephosphorylation of the dog CLNX isoform on the homologous serine residue <xref rid="pone.0011925-Chevet1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> had been shown to dissociate the protein from the ribosome uncoupling the protein synthesis machinery. Here, we demonstrate that CLNX is subject to dephosphorylation by CN under ER stress. This result is in agreement with Michalak's group <xref rid="pone.0011925-Coe1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, who recently found that CLNX deficient cells have constitutively active UPR. This has been suggested to represent an acute stress response <xref rid="pone.0011925-Rutkowski1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. We also show that another ER stressor, Tm, induced a small Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase in the cytosol. These data are consistent with Tm-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization in fibroblast and CHO cells <xref rid="pone.0011925-Carlberg1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011925-Hayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> and suggest that both Tg and Tm are able to activate CN through a common and well characterized Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM dependent mechanism. We suggest that CN phosphatase activity provides the cell with additional time to restore ER homeostasis while the organelle is being refilled with Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>Surprisingly, we discovered that CN-A levels were significantly increased in the cytosol of <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes within 30&#8211;60 minutes of being stressed by Tg or DTT. We also found that CN-A interacted with PERK during stress, and that the kinetics of this association were correlated with the increase in CN-A levels. This suggested to us that the rise in CN levels could cause the subsequent interaction and activation of PERK. We confirmed this hypothesis in an independent model system, cultured mouse astrocytes. We found that ER-stress induced by OGD or thapsigargin treatment in cultured astrocytes rapidly increases CN-A&#945; levels. Because we were able to block this increase by siRNA treatments in astrocytes, it appears that stress-induced increases in CN-A&#945; are translationally dependent. Remarkably, the induction of the early UPR in astrocytes, as indicated by increased P-elF2&#945;, was critically dependent on this rapid increase in CN-A&#945;. Specifically, when astrocytes were treated with siRNA specific for CN-A&#945;, we observed no significant increase in P-elF2&#945; in response to Tg treatment. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments with recombinant proteins also support this model.

The significance of this finding is that this association should occur immediately after ER stress has been triggered when the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration initially increases. It is worth noting that in contrast to the CaM dependence of CN phosphatase activity, the association of CN with PERK appears to be inhibited by CaM. This interaction does not appear to be mediated by another protein, since no other protein was added to the <italic>in vitro</italic> assay. Moreover, we did not detect an interaction between CN-A and the catalytically inactive mutant GST-cPERK K/A. One explanation for this result is that lysine-618 is a critical residue in the CN binding site of PERK. Alternatively, CN may only be able to interact with PERK after a conformational change occurs in response to autophosphorylation. In this light, lysine 618 is critical to either PERK autophosphorylation and to the subsequent conformational change <xref rid="pone.0011925-Harding1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011925-Marciniak2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. In support of this, we and others <xref rid="pone.0011925-Marciniak2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> observe different mobilities for GST-cPERK and GST-cPERKK/A on SDS-PAGE (100 kD, and 85 kD, respectively), consistent with different protein conformations. We suggest that CN associates with PERK only after the kinase has been activated and once bound, stimulates further autophosphorylation of PERK.</p><p>Our model is consistent with the current of view of stress activated PERK. BiP is normally bound to the luminal domain of PERK and acts as negative regulator of activation <xref rid="pone.0011925-Ma2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. In response to ER stress, BiP dissociates from its luminal domain of PERK to assist in luminal protein folding. This allows PERK oligomerization and its subsequent activation <xref rid="pone.0011925-Bertolotti1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Our data take this stress activation sequence one step further by showing that CN-A binds to PERK and induces additional autophosphorylation at high cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Interestingly, a ligand for PERK with the properties that we have described has been previously sought after <xref rid="pone.0011925-Bertolotti1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. We suggest that CN is a strong candidate for this ligand. Modulation of PERK activity by CN would represent a fine-tuning mechanism for optimal ER stress signaling. Moreover, CN/PERK interaction may constitute an example of at least partial dissociation from stress sensor activation, since ATF6, IRE1&#945; and PERK would not all be activated by the same mechanism of titration from BiP. In this scenario, members of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family, BAX and BAK <xref rid="pone.0011925-Hetz1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, have been shown to interact with the cytosolic domain of IRE1&#945; during ER stress <xref rid="pone.0011925-Calfon1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. It would appear that both IRE1&#945; and PERK are actively regulated by cytoplasmic signals.</p><p>Another interesting finding was that PERK phosphorylated CN-A at resting concentrations of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Phosphorylation decreased the V<sub>max</sub> of CN to 70%, without changing its affinity (K<sub>m</sub>) for substrate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011925.s010">Table S1</xref>). It is possible that phosphorylation of CN-A by PERK generates a more pronounced effect when CaM dissociates from CN upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> decrease. This event could have more physiological relevance when ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis is being restored after stress by Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal from the cytosol. Phosphorylation of CN has previously been observed <italic>in vitro</italic> by both CaM Kinase II and PKC <xref rid="pone.0011925-Hashimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011925-Hashimoto2" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. In all cases, phosphorylated CN exhibits less phosphatase activity. Interestingly, PERK phosphorylation was reduced at low Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, when CN-A was phosphorylated. This appears unlikely to be the result of dephosphorylation by CN, since its phosphatase activity is significantly reduced in both low Ca<sup>2+</sup> and when it is phosphorylated. The decrease of PERK phosphorylation is more likely a consequence of CN dissociating from PERK at low Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations as suggested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011925-g003">Figure 3C</xref>.</p><p>Physiologically, we presented evidence suggesting that knock down of early CN levels with morpholinos increased the susceptibility of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes to undergo apoptosis. This suggested an important regulatory role of CN in preventing or delaying apoptosis during ER stress. This interpretation is in agreement with other reports suggesting that the susceptibility of cells to undergo apoptosis during stress depends on the amount of releasable Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER <xref rid="pone.0011925-FoyouziYoussefi1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011925-Pinton1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. CN dependent dephosphorylation of CLNX, which increases SERCA 2b activity, is likely to minimize problems with protein folding during acute ER stress by rapidly restoring ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores. At the same time, the interaction of CN with PERK would be expected to rescue cells from apoptosis by strongly attenuated new protein translation.</p><p>In summary, this study reveals a novel role for CN at the initiation of the ER stress cascade. We have incorporated these mechanistic insights into a comprehensive model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011925-g008">Figure 8</xref>) that also accommodates findings related to PERK activation and CLNX-ribosome association as described by others <xref rid="pone.0011925-Harding1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011925-Bertolotti1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011925-Chevet1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Our discovery that CN activity plays an important role in the acute phase of ER Stress reveals an additional level of complexity to the UPR. It is important to distinguish this new role of CN during the early UPR from its distinct cell death function during later time points of the UPR. In particular, it has been reported that prolonged exposure of cells to CN inhibitors leads to upregulation of CHOP and subsequent apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0011925-Kitamura1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. The new function of CN that we uncovered in this manuscript occurs at an earlier step in the UPR, prior to induction of CHOP. UPR has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes such as control of nutritional and differentiation programs <xref rid="pone.0011925-Schroder2" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. It is also associated with numerous diseases like neurodegenerative disorders <xref rid="pone.0011925-Forman1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, cancer <xref rid="pone.0011925-Koritzinsky1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, viral infection <xref rid="pone.0011925-He1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref> or ischemic injury <xref rid="pone.0011925-Kumar1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Understanding the impact of CN activity in ER stress will yield new insights into the underlying causes of these physiological and pathological processes.</p><fig id="pone-0011925-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0011925.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Role of CN in the early phases of ER stress.</title><p>(<bold>1</bold>) Resting conditions of the ER: CLNX is phosphorylated, interacting with SERCA 2b and inhibiting its activity.

(<bold>2</bold>) ER stress: unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER lumen, BiP dissociates from PERK, permitting its dimerization and autophosphorylation, which leads to attenuation of protein synthesis.

(<bold>3</bold>) CN levels are increased, leading to the association of CN with pre-activated PERK, which induces further PERK auto-phosphorylation, increasing the phosphorylation level of eIF2&#945;. This emphasizes the protein translation inhibition. If cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels are restored (<bold>1</bold>), CN becomes phosphorylated by PERK, decreasing its activity.

Note the top band in the dashed rectangle is darker than the lower band at 150 kD and likely corresponds to P-PERK and PERK, respectively. P-PERK is known to migrate higher than PERK. (F) Western Blot from primary mouse astrocytes using pre immune serum (left panel) or anti-PERKUT antibody (middle panels) or commercial antibody anti-PERKCM (from Cell signaling cat#3179S). Extracts were obtained from cultured astrocytes at rest (lanes 1 and 3, Ctrl) and after 60 minutes OGD were used (lanes 2 and 4). Extracts from astrocytes were also treated with Vehicle (lane 5, Veh) and 300 nM thapsigargin (lane 6, Thap). Note the stress induced increase in PERK-P using the anti-PERKUT, but not the anti-PERKCM antibody.</p><p>(0.42 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0011925.s004.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0011925.s005"><label>Figure S5</label><caption><p>Quantification of PERK loading for GST pull-down assay.
