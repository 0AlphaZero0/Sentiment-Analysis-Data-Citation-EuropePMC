</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrate that calcineurin (CN), a Ca2+ dependent phosphatase, associates with the (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), and promotes PERK auto-phosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This association, in turn, increases the phosphorylation level of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 α (eIF2-α) and attenuates protein translation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Data supporting these conclusions were obtained from co-immunoprecipitations, pull-down assays, in-vitro kinase assays, siRNA treatments and [35S]-methionine incorporation measurements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The interaction of CN with PERK was facilitated at elevated cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations and involved the cytosolic domain of PERK. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CN levels were rapidly increased by ER stressors, which could be blocked by siRNA treatments for CN-Aα in cultured astrocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Downregulation of CN blocked subsequent ER-stress-induced increases in phosphorylated elF2-α. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CN knockdown in Xenopus oocytes predisposed them to induction of apoptosis. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The ER is a dynamic organelle that plays a critical role in a variety of processes, including Ca2+ storage and release, synthesis and folding of proteins, as well as post-translational protein modification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>These processes of signaling and biosynthesis are deeply inter-connected [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>When the load of newly synthesized proteins exceeds the folding and/or processing capacity of the organelle, the ER enters into a stress condition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>This activates a signal transduction pathway called the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) that attempts to restore homeostasis in the ER [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>An immediate response is the attenuation of protein translation via PERK, which phosphorylates the α subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) [7], [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>PERK is a type I ER membrane protein with a stress-sensing luminal domain connected by a transmembrane segment to a cytoplasmic-kinase domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>PERK is normally inactive due to the association of its luminal domain with the ER chaperone BiP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>During ER stress, BiP is competitively titrated from the luminal domain of PERK by the excess of unfolded proteins [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>This dissociation causes PERK to undergo homo-oligomerization and trans-autophosphorylation within its cytosolic kinase domain, thereby increasing its activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Additional changes that promote long-term adaptation are transcriptional up-regulation of ER chaperones and molecules involved in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>If ER damage is persistent or excessive, an apoptotic response is initiated by either ER specific caspases [10], [11] or by mechanisms related with the mitogen-activated protein kinase JNK or transcriptional activation of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) [12], [13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Maintenance of Ca2+ levels in the ER is primarily attained by the activity of SERCAs [14], [15], [16], which pump Ca2+ into the ER. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>These Ca2+-ATPases counteract the loss of Ca2+ via leaks and the opening of Ca2+ release channels [17], [18], [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The free Ca2+ in the ER is a balance between Ca2+ release, uptake and buffering by Ca2+-binding proteins in the lumen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Calreticulin (CRT) and CLNX are Ca2+ -binding chaperones that reside in the ER [20], [21] and play key roles in modulating SERCA 2b activity [3], [4], [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>CRT is entirely luminal and CLNX is a type I trans-membrane protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The carboxy-terminus of each protein is luminal and is responsible for interaction of the lectins with the monoglucosylated form of N-linked glycoprotein during protein folding [20], [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>In the cytosolic domain of CLNX, three phosphorylated residues have been identified [24] that are implicated in the modulation of the interaction of CLNX with the ribosome [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Dephosphorylation of CLNX causes dissociation of the chaperone from the ribosome [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Our group identified the carboxy-terminal serine residue 562 in the rat isoform of CLNX as a phosphorylation site capable of controlling SERCA 2b activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Further, we demonstrated that CLNX phosphorylation acted as a cytosolic switch that regulated Ca2+ store refilling [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Calcineurin is a Ca2+ and calmodulin dependent serine/threonine phosphatase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>This heterodimer phosphatase is composed of a catalytic subunit, calcineurin A (CN-A) and a regulatory subunit, calcineurin B (CN-B) [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>CN-A contains specific domains with regulatory functions, including an amino-terminus domain with catalytic properties, a CN-B binding domain, a calmodulin (CaM) binding domain and finally, an autoinhibitory domain (AI) at the carboxy-terminus [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>At resting Ca2+ levels, the phosphatase is relatively inactive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>An increase in intracellular Ca2+ activates CN-A through Ca2+/CaM binding, which dissociates AI from the catalytic domain [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>To date, the involvement of Ca2+ signaling in a multitude of cellular pathways has been well documented [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the role of Ca2+ signaling in restoring ER homeostasis, once ER stress has been triggered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Here we reveal that CN plays key roles in restoring ER homeostasis during stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>CN activity boosts the refilling of Ca2+ stores so that optimal conditions for protein processing/folding are rapidly reached. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>CN also directly interacts with PERK to increase its auto-phosphorylation, which helps to attenuate protein translation while homeostasis is being restored. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Finally, we show that a knockdown of CN levels in Xenopus oocytes results in a decrease of protein synthesis inhibition and a rapid acceleration of apoptosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data underscore the importance of CN activity in the rescue of cells from ER stress. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Thapsigargin (Tg) is an irreversible inhibitor of the ER Ca2+-ATPases [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>It induces ER stress by depleting Ca2+ stores with a concomitant increase in cytosolic Ca2+, causing accumulation of malfolded proteins within the ER [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>By site directed mutagenesis, we previously demonstrated that phosphorylation of serine residue 562 in CLNX controlled an interaction with SERCA 2b. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of S562 inhibited Ca2+ store refilling while dephosphorylation increased SERCA 2b activity [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Given its ability to regulate SERCA 2b activity, we asked if ER stress altered the phosphorylation state of CLNX. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>To this end, CLNX mRNA (0.7 µg/µl) was overexpressed in Xenopus oocytes as previously described (Roderick et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>After 3 days of protein expression, oocytes were labelled with [γ32P]ATP for 20 minutes, the microsomal fraction was extracted and an anti-CLNX antibody was used to immunoprecipitate the protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>We observed a significant level of phosphorylation of CLNX under normal resting conditions (Figure 1A, 0 minutes). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>In a subpopulation, we treated CLNX overexpressing oocytes with Tg (1 µM) for 15, 30 and 60 minutes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>When the precipitates were examined with autoradiography, we observed significant (p&lt;0.05) dephosphorylation at all time points tested (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>To determine if overexpression of CLNX itself caused ER stress, we measured the levels of ER stress in native and overexpressing CLNX oocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>This was accomplished by a Western blot probed with an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated form of eIF2α (anti-phospho eIF2α) and an antibody against BiP, both are widely considered strong indicators of ER stress [8], [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of CLNX did not affect the level of phosphorylated eIF2α or BiP and hence, did not induce ER stress (Figure 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>These results show that ER Ca2+ depletion and/or increased cytosolic Ca2+ decreases CLNX phosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>To test whether CN may be mediating the Ca2+ sensitive dephosphorylation of CLNX, we repeated the above series of experiments using the CN inhibitors cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Preincubation of oocytes with these inhibitors completely reversed the dephosphorylation of CLNX in response to Tg (Figure 1C) and treatment consistent with a primary role of CN in this ER stress response. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have shown that CN works to restore ER homeostasis immediately after ER stress has been initiated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>CN performs this important function with the aid of two ER transmembrane proteins: CLNX and PERK. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Consequently, CN can now be viewed as an active participant in the UPR by virtue of its ability to couple the cytoplasmic side to the ER lumen in a Ca2+ dependent manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>We previously established that when the ER is optimally loaded with Ca2+, the most favorable condition necessary for protein processing and folding, CLNX is phosphorylated and physically interacts with SERCA 2b to inhibit its activity [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrated that IP3-mediated Ca2+ release caused a Ca2+ dependent dephosphorylation of serine residue (S562) in the cytosolic domain of CLNX. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>This removed the functional interaction of CLNX with the pump, removing inhibition and maximizing SERCA 2b-mediated Ca2+ store refilling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>CLNX phosphorylation had already been shown to regulate its association with the ribosome, which facilitated the presentation and binding of newly synthesized glycoproteins to the chaperone [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>Dephosphorylation of the dog CLNX isoform on the homologous serine residue [25] had been shown to dissociate the protein from the ribosome uncoupling the protein synthesis machinery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrate that CLNX is subject to dephosphorylation by CN under ER stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>This result is in agreement with Michalak's group [38], who recently found that CLNX deficient cells have constitutively active UPR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>This has been suggested to represent an acute stress response [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>We also show that another ER stressor, Tm, induced a small Ca2+ increase in the cytosol. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>These data are consistent with Tm-induced Ca2+ mobilization in fibroblast and CHO cells [40], [41] and suggest that both Tg and Tm are able to activate CN through a common and well characterized Ca2+/CaM dependent mechanism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>We suggest that CN phosphatase activity provides the cell with additional time to restore ER homeostasis while the organelle is being refilled with Ca2+. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, we discovered that CN-A levels were significantly increased in the cytosol of Xenopus oocytes within 30–60 minutes of being stressed by Tg or DTT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>We also found that CN-A interacted with PERK during stress, and that the kinetics of this association were correlated with the increase in CN-A levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>This suggested to us that the rise in CN levels could cause the subsequent interaction and activation of PERK. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>We confirmed this hypothesis in an independent model system, cultured mouse astrocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>We found that ER-stress induced by OGD or thapsigargin treatment in cultured astrocytes rapidly increases CN-Aα levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>Because we were able to block this increase by siRNA treatments in astrocytes, it appears that stress-induced increases in CN-Aα are translationally dependent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, the induction of the early UPR in astrocytes, as indicated by increased P-elF2α, was critically dependent on this rapid increase in CN-Aα. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>Specifically, when astrocytes were treated with siRNA specific for CN-Aα, we observed no significant increase in P-elF2α in response to Tg treatment. In vitro experiments with recombinant proteins also support this model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that the presence of CN-Aα/B significantly increased the autophosphorylation of GST-cPERK. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>A residual level of GST-cPERK phosphorylation in the absence of CN-Aα/B was likely due to dimerization of the GST-portion of GST-cPERK as reported by [42]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Another important observation from our pull-down experiments was that CN-A interacted with cPERK in a Ca2+ dependent manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>Association was significantly increased in conditions that mimic high cytosolic Ca2+. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>The significance of this finding is that this association should occur immediately after ER stress has been triggered when the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration initially increases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>It is worth noting that in contrast to the CaM dependence of CN phosphatase activity, the association of CN with PERK appears to be inhibited by CaM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>This interaction does not appear to be mediated by another protein, since no other protein was added to the in vitro assay. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we did not detect an interaction between CN-A and the catalytically inactive mutant GST-cPERK K/A. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>One explanation for this result is that lysine-618 is a critical residue in the CN binding site of PERK. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, CN may only be able to interact with PERK after a conformational change occurs in response to autophosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>In this light, lysine 618 is critical to either PERK autophosphorylation and to the subsequent conformational change [8], [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>In support of this, we and others [43] observe different mobilities for GST-cPERK and GST-cPERKK/A on SDS-PAGE (100 kD, and 85 kD, respectively), consistent with different protein conformations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>We suggest that CN associates with PERK only after the kinase has been activated and once bound, stimulates further autophosphorylation of PERK. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>Our model is consistent with the current of view of stress activated PERK. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>BiP is normally bound to the luminal domain of PERK and acts as negative regulator of activation [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>In response to ER stress, BiP dissociates from its luminal domain of PERK to assist in luminal protein folding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>This allows PERK oligomerization and its subsequent activation [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>Our data take this stress activation sequence one step further by showing that CN-A binds to PERK and induces additional autophosphorylation at high cytosolic Ca2+. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a ligand for PERK with the properties that we have described has been previously sought after [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>We suggest that CN is a strong candidate for this ligand. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>Modulation of PERK activity by CN would represent a fine-tuning mechanism for optimal ER stress signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>Moreover, CN/PERK interaction may constitute an example of at least partial dissociation from stress sensor activation, since ATF6, IRE1α and PERK would not all be activated by the same mechanism of titration from BiP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>In this scenario, members of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family, BAX and BAK [45], have been shown to interact with the cytosolic domain of IRE1α during ER stress [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>It would appear that both IRE1α and PERK are actively regulated by cytoplasmic signals. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>Another interesting finding was that PERK phosphorylated CN-A at resting concentrations of cytosolic Ca2+. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation decreased the Vmax of CN to 70%, without changing its affinity (Km) for substrate (Table S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>It is possible that phosphorylation of CN-A by PERK generates a more pronounced effect when CaM dissociates from CN upon Ca2+ decrease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>This event could have more physiological relevance when ER Ca2+ homeostasis is being restored after stress by Ca2+ removal from the cytosol. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of CN has previously been observed in vitro by both CaM Kinase II and PKC [47], [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>In all cases, phosphorylated CN exhibits less phosphatase activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, PERK phosphorylation was reduced at low Ca2+ concentration, when CN-A was phosphorylated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>This appears unlikely to be the result of dephosphorylation by CN, since its phosphatase activity is significantly reduced in both low Ca2+ and when it is phosphorylated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>The decrease of PERK phosphorylation is more likely a consequence of CN dissociating from PERK at low Ca2+ concentrations as suggested in Figure 3C. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>Physiologically, we presented evidence suggesting that knock down of early CN levels with morpholinos increased the susceptibility of the Xenopus oocytes to undergo apoptosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>This suggested an important regulatory role of CN in preventing or delaying apoptosis during ER stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>This interpretation is in agreement with other reports suggesting that the susceptibility of cells to undergo apoptosis during stress depends on the amount of releasable Ca2+ from the ER [49], [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>CN dependent dephosphorylation of CLNX, which increases SERCA 2b activity, is likely to minimize problems with protein folding during acute ER stress by rapidly restoring ER Ca2+ stores. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>At the same time, the interaction of CN with PERK would be expected to rescue cells from apoptosis by strongly attenuated new protein translation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>In summary, this study reveals a novel role for CN at the initiation of the ER stress cascade. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>We have incorporated these mechanistic insights into a comprehensive model (Figure 8) that also accommodates findings related to PERK activation and CLNX-ribosome association as described by others [8], [9], [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>Our discovery that CN activity plays an important role in the acute phase of ER Stress reveals an additional level of complexity to the UPR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>It is important to distinguish this new role of CN during the early UPR from its distinct cell death function during later time points of the UPR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>In particular, it has been reported that prolonged exposure of cells to CN inhibitors leads to upregulation of CHOP and subsequent apoptosis [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>The new function of CN that we uncovered in this manuscript occurs at an earlier step in the UPR, prior to induction of CHOP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="343" pm="."><plain>UPR has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes such as control of nutritional and differentiation programs [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>It is also associated with numerous diseases like neurodegenerative disorders [53], cancer [54], viral infection [55] or ischemic injury [56]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>Understanding the impact of CN activity in ER stress will yield new insights into the underlying causes of these physiological and pathological processes. </plain></SENT>
