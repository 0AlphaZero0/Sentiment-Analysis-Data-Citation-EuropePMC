The molecular defects underlying AS are heterogeneous, including large maternal deletions of chromosome 15q11&#8211;q13 (70%), paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 15 (5%), imprinting mutations (rare), and mutations in the E6-AP ubiquitin ligase gene <italic>UBE3A</italic> (15%). Although patients with <italic>UBE3A</italic> mutations have a wide spectrum of neurological phenotypes, their features are usually milder than AS patients with deletions of 15q11&#8211;q13. Using a chromosomal engineering strategy, we generated mutant mice with a 1.6-Mb chromosomal deletion from <italic>Ube3a</italic> to <italic>Gabrb3</italic>, which inactivated the <italic>Ube3a</italic> and <italic>Gabrb3</italic> genes and deleted the <italic>Atp10a</italic> gene. Homozygous deletion mutant mice died in the perinatal period due to a cleft palate resulting from the null mutation in <italic>Gabrb3</italic> gene. Mice with a maternal deletion (m&#8722;/p+) were viable and did not have any obvious developmental defects. Expression analysis of the maternal and paternal deletion mice confirmed that the <italic>Ube3a</italic> gene is maternally expressed in brain, and showed that the <italic>Atp10a</italic> and <italic>Gabrb3</italic> genes are biallelically expressed in all brain sub-regions studied. Maternal (m&#8722;/p+), but not paternal (m+/p&#8722;), deletion mice had increased spontaneous seizure activity and abnormal EEG. Extensive behavioral analyses revealed significant impairment in motor function, learning and memory tasks, and anxiety-related measures assayed in the light-dark box in maternal deletion but not paternal deletion mice. Ultrasonic vocalization (USV) recording in newborns revealed that maternal deletion pups emitted significantly more USVs than wild-type littermates. The increased USV in maternal deletion mice suggests abnormal signaling behavior between mothers and pups that may reflect abnormal communication behaviors in human AS patients. Thus, mutant mice with a maternal deletion from <italic>Ube3a</italic> to <italic>Gabrb3</italic> provide an AS mouse model that is molecularly more similar to the contiguous gene deletion form of AS in humans than mice with <italic>Ube3a</italic> mutation alone. These mice will be valuable for future comparative studies to mice with maternal deficiency of <italic>Ube3a</italic> alone.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with severe mental retardation, absence of language development, characteristic EEG abnormalities and epilepsy, happy disposition, movement disorders, and autistic features <xref rid="pone.0012278-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The molecular defects underlying AS are heterogeneous. About 70% of AS patients have a large chromosomal deletion of 15q11&#8211;q13, exclusively of maternal origin. Paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 15 is found in &#8764;5% of AS patients. Mutations of the E6-AP ubiquitin ligase gene (<italic>UBE3A</italic>) on maternal chromosome 15 are found in about 15% of AS patients. Rarely, a microdeletion in the region designated as an imprinting center is also found in some cases of AS. The finding of loss-of-function mutations in the maternal <italic>UBE3A</italic> gene in patients with typical features of AS indicates that maternal deficiency for <italic>UBE3A</italic> is responsible for the major clinical manifestations <xref rid="pone.0012278-Matsuura1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012278-Kishino1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In addition, maternal, but not paternal, duplication of 15q11&#8211;q13 has been reported in about 1&#8211;2% of idiopathic autism spectrum disorder patients <xref rid="pone.0012278-VeenstraVanderweele1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Recently, a small duplication covering from <italic>ATP10A</italic> to <italic>GABRB3</italic> was reported in one autism patient <xref rid="pone.0012278-Weiss1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. At the molecular level, AS patients with a large chromosomal deletion of 15q11&#8211;q13 have deficiency of the maternally expressed <italic>UBE3A</italic> gene and possibly of <italic>ATP10A</italic> in brain, and they are haploinsufficient for many other genes with biallelic expression within the 6-Mb deleted interval. These biallelically expressed genes include the GABA receptor cluster of <italic>GABRB3</italic>, <italic>GABRG5</italic>, and <italic>GABAG3</italic> telomeric of <italic>UBE3A</italic>, and <italic>CYFIP1</italic>, <italic>NIPA1</italic>, <italic>NIPA2</italic>, <italic>GCG5, WHCD1L1,</italic> and <italic>GOLGA8E</italic> at the centromeric end of the deletion in patients with a larger class I deletion <xref rid="pone.0012278-Chai1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012278-Jiang2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Reports have suggested that the <italic>ATP10A</italic> gene is maternally expressed in humans <xref rid="pone.0012278-Meguro1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012278-Herzing1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. One report found that <italic>ATP10A</italic> exhibits imprinted expression in brain but biallelic expression in non-neuronal tissues <xref rid="pone.0012278-Herzing1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Another study reported imprinted expression of <italic>ATP10A</italic> in lymphoblasts as well as brains <xref rid="pone.0012278-Meguro1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The most recent report found that <italic>ATP10A</italic> was expressed biallelically in brain in the majority of individuals examined while a small percentage exhibited variable monoallelic expression but not strictly maternal allele-specific. Monoallelic expression appeared to be favored by female gender <xref rid="pone.0012278-Hogart1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Reports of imprinting status of the mouse ortholog of <italic>ATP10A</italic> were also not consistent. One report indicated that <italic>Atp10a</italic> is maternally expressed in hippocampus and olfactory bulb <xref rid="pone.0012278-Kashiwagi1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, while two other studies found that <italic>Atp10a</italic> is biallelically expressed in all tissues <xref rid="pone.0012278-Kayashima1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012278-Dubose1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Similarly, there were reports suggesting paternal, maternal, and biallelic expression of <italic>GABRB3</italic> in humans and mice using different experimental designs <xref rid="pone.0012278-Meguro2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012278-Nicholls1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012278-Hogart2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. A recent report also suggested greatly reduced levels of the <italic>Gabrb3</italic> subunit in the brain of male mice with a maternally transmitted <italic>Gabrb3</italic> mutation but not in male mice with paternal origin of the same mutation <xref rid="pone.0012278-Liljelund1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>In humans, analyses of genotype and phenotype correlation among AS patients with different classes of molecular defects have been reported <xref rid="pone.0012278-ClaytonSmith1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012278-Lossie1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. These analyses have revealed that AS patients with large chromosome deletions of 15q11&#8211;q13 have more severe phenotypes than AS patients with <italic>UBE3A</italic> mutations, paternal UPD, and imprinting mutations. In addition, there were early reports suggesting that loss-of-function <italic>UBE3A</italic> mutations, paternal UPD of chromosome 15, or imprinting mutations in AS were associated with relatively milder epilepsy while AS patients with a deletion of chromosome 15q11&#8211;13 had more severe epilepsy <xref rid="pone.0012278-Minassian1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. However, other studies found no genotype-phenotype correlation for EEG abnormalities and epilepsy among AS patients with different genotypes <xref rid="pone.0012278-Paprocka1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012278-GalvanManso1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. One caveat of these studies was the relative small sample size which might bias the results and conclusion.</p><p>We have previously characterized an AS model with a null mutation of the <italic>Ube3a</italic> gene. Mice with maternal deficiency of the <italic>Ube3a</italic> gene recapitulated the brain-specific imprinted expression <xref rid="pone.0012278-Jiang3" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012278-Dindot1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Mice inheriting the <italic>Ube3a</italic> mutation maternally, but not paternally, displayed phenotypes that resemble AS with abnormal EEG and seizure activity, motor dysfunction, and defects in contextual fear conditioning and hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). These findings, together with a report by others, indicate that mice with maternal deficiency of <italic>Ube3a</italic> are a valid model for human AS with mutations in the <italic>UBE3A</italic> gene <xref rid="pone.0012278-Jiang3" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012278-Miura1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>Here we report generation and characterization of mutant mice with a 1.6-Mb chromosomal deletion from <italic>Ube3a</italic> to <italic>Gabrb3</italic>.

A total of three 129SvEv embryonic stem (ES) cell clones (P11A8, P11B6, and P11H8) with a deletion from <italic>Ube3a</italic> to <italic>Gabrb3</italic> were confirmed by DNA Southern analysis and injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts to obtain germline transmission. A total of 14 chimeric mice were produced. Germline transmission was obtained from ES cell clones P11A8 and P11B6 but not from P11H8. The <italic>Gabrb3</italic> and <italic>Ube3a</italic> double targeted mutations without a deletion between them were also obtained in germline (data not shown). Mice with a deletion from <italic>Ube3a</italic> to <italic>Gabrb3</italic> were identified by DNA genomic Southern analysis using genomic probes flanking and within the deletion interval as shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012278-g001">Figure 1E</xref>. Absence of signal in DNA Southern analysis using a probe hybridizing within the <italic>Atp10a</italic> gene indicated that the desired deletion was produced. A PCR-based mouse genotyping protocol was also developed for routine mouse colony management (data not shown). The estimated size of the deletion from <italic>Ube3a</italic> to <italic>Gabrb3</italic> was 1.6-Mb (from 64846987 bp to 66527319 bp) based on the NCBI Build 37 assembly of mouse genome sequences (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.ucsc.edu">www.genome.ucsc.edu</ext-link>).

There was no apparent difference between m&#8722;/p+ and m+/p&#8722; mice by visual inspection. The lifespan of m&#8722;/p+ and m+/p&#8722; mice was similar to their m+/p+ littermates. Homozygous mutant mice with a deletion from <italic>Ube3a</italic> to <italic>Gabrb3</italic> (m&#8722;/p&#8722;) were smaller at birth and most died within 1 to 3 days after birth due to a cleft palate and poor feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012278-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). At the weaning age, there was a significantly skewed distribution of genotypes from Mendelian inheritance (wild-type 20; heterozygotes 39; and homozygotes 2, p&lt;0.001) because of perinatal lethality. We carefully examined each pup (n&#8202;=&#8202;12) that died perinatally. Nine of 12 dead pups had a cleft palate, a representative example of which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012278-g003">Figure 3C</xref>. No other obvious structural defects were found in pups with a homozygous deletion from <italic>Ube3a</italic> to <italic>Gabrb3</italic>. Functional defects such as poor feeding may be considered as the cause of perinatal death for pups without a cleft palate. Because it was reported previously that a homozygous null mutation of <italic>Gabrb3</italic> caused cleft palate <xref rid="pone.0012278-Homanics1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, we also generated mice with single homozygous <italic>Gabrb3</italic> mutation for the purpose of comparison. A cleft palate was found in 6 out of 7 pups with a homozygous <italic>Gabrb3</italic> mutation. Two mice with a homozygous deletion from <italic>Ube3a</italic> to <italic>Gabrb3</italic> survived beyond the perinatal period but died at 24 and 28 days of age without a known cause. These two mice were &#8764;20% of smaller than their wild type littermates and without an apparent cleft palate. To determine whether embryonic lethality was associated with m&#8722;/p&#8722; mice, a total of 19 pups from three litters were dissected and genotyped at 16 days of gestational age. The distribution of genotypes was not significantly different from the expected Mendelian inheritance (wild-type 5; heterozygotes 10; and homozygotes 4, p&gt;0.05). These data suggested that a homozygous deletion from <italic>Ube3a</italic> to <italic>Gabrb3</italic> did not cause embryonic lethality and that the function of <italic>Atp10a</italic> is probably not critical for embryonic development.</p><fig id="pone-0012278-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0012278.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Perinatal lethality and cleft palate in newborn mice with a homozygous deletion from <italic>Ube3a</italic> to <italic>Gabrb3</italic> (m&#8722;/p&#8722;).</title><p>A.

Our analysis did not provide any evidence supporting exclusive maternal expression of <italic>Atp10a</italic> but indicated biallelic expression of <italic>Atp10a</italic> in the brain regions of mice examined by quantitative RNA expression analysis.

One possibility is the effect of mouse genetic background on imprinting, but this has not been fully investigated <xref rid="pone.0012278-Kayashima2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Our expression analysis of <italic>Atp10a</italic> was performed in mice with a relatively homogenous C57BL/6J genetic background that overlaps with, but is not the same as that used in the other studies. The technical limitations of the different methods used should also be considered. Our strategy of using <italic>Atp10a</italic> knockout mice was different from the other studies, which used strain-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms to determine the parental origin of expression, or studied in PWS imprinting center mutant mice. A limitation of our analysis is that we could not rule out a cell type-specific imprinting expression of <italic>Atp10a</italic>. In the future, expression analysis by RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization or immunohistochemistry may help to determine if cell type-specific imprinting is associated with <italic>Atp10a</italic> expression.

Homozygous mice with a deletion from <italic>Ube3a</italic> to <italic>Gabrb3</italic> died 1 to 3 days after birth and did not have any increased embryonic lethality or additional structural defects compared to mice with a null mutation of either <italic>Gabrb3</italic> or <italic>Ube3a</italic> alone, or <italic>Gabrb3</italic> and <italic>Ube3a</italic> double mutation without a deletion (Jiang and Beaudet, unpublished data). These observations suggest that the function of <italic>Atp10a</italic> is probably not essential during embryonic development. Studies of mice carrying a radiation-induced large deletion proximal to the 3&#8242;-end of <italic>Snrpn</italic> to the <italic>p</italic> locus that included <italic>Atp10a</italic>, indicated that <italic>Atp10a</italic> may have an important role in insulin resistance and glucose metabolism <xref rid="pone.0012278-Dhar1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012278-Dhar2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. However, no direct conclusion regarding the role of <italic>Atp10a</italic> could be made because the deletion is large and mice are haploinsufficient for many genes in addition to <italic>Atp10a</italic>. It would be interesting to perform the experiment described by Dhar et al. <xref rid="pone.0012278-Dhar1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> to determine whether insulin resistance can also be found in mice with the <italic>Ube3a</italic> to <italic>Gabrb3</italic> deletion.

Recording of USVs has been increasingly used as a tool to analyze behavioral phenotypes of mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders although interpretation of the findings remains a subject of debate <xref rid="pone.0012278-Scattoni1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Currently, there is no standardized protocol for recording USVs in the literature <xref rid="pone.0012278-Hahn1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. We followed a previously described protocol with minor modifications <xref rid="pone.0012278-Moles1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. The rationale for recording USVs on different beddings was based on the fact that different odors may present important cues for social stress or isolation <xref rid="pone.0012278-Hofer1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Recording in cold temperature was designed to evaluate the response to a known stress for USV production <xref rid="pone.0012278-Hahn2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. The protocol of recording on different days was based on the observation that the peak of USV production varied on different postnatal days and differed among different mouse genetic backgrounds <xref rid="pone.0012278-Branchi1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. From reviewing the limited reports of USVs recording in knockout mice in the literature, we anticipated the possibility that m&#8722;/p+ pups might have reduced USVs because of absence of language and autistic features in AS. Thus the finding of an overall increase in USVs in pups with a maternal deletion from <italic>Ube3a</italic> to <italic>Gabrb3</italic> was somewhat unexpected but not surprised. The comparable rate of USVs between m+/p+ and m&#8722;/p+ mice at cold temperature suggested that m&#8722;/p+ pups had a normal response to cold stress. The significantly increased production of USVs in different beddings and on different days for m&#8722;/p+ pups may indicate increased anxiety and response to social isolation stress. However, this interpretation seems counterintuitive because the difference between m+/p+ and m&#8722;/p+ was most significant in the mother's bedding which was intended to be less stressful because of the maternal odor. Alternatively, the significant difference in USV production between m+/p+ and m&#8722;/p+ pups recorded in the mother's bedding may reflect impairment related to maternal attachment behaviors between mother and offspring. In the earlier reports, the characteristic happy disposition and friendly behaviors in AS patients were considered to be contextually inappropriate and not related to the environment stimuli <xref rid="pone.0012278-ClaytonSmith1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. It has also been reported that AS patients have significant autistic features and often meet the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder through autism diagnostic evaluation <xref rid="pone.0012278-Peters1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012278-Veltman1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. In contrast, other recent behavioral studies suggest that happy disposition like smiling and laughing behaviors in AS were influenced by environmental clues and different social settings <xref rid="pone.0012278-Horsler1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012278-Oliver1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. By carefully observing social behaviors among children with AS caused by a deletion of 15q11&#8211;q13, Oliver et al. reported that AS patients smiled more and evoked a higher level of adult attention than the control group in different settings <xref rid="pone.0012278-Oliver1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. They concluded that the excessive smiling and laughing behaviors seen in AS patients may indicate an increase in signaling behaviors. Thus, the observation of increased production of USVs in m&#8722;/p+ pups may suggest that increased USVs is analogous to the increased signaling behaviors observed in human AS. It should be noted that the human AS behavioral observation studies by Oliver et al. were carried out only in a small number of AS patients, all with a deletion of 15q11&#8211;q13 <xref rid="pone.0012278-Oliver1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012278-Oliver2" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. An interesting question is whether AS patients with mutations in the <italic>UBE3A</italic> gene have the same behavioral profile related to smiling and laughing as those with a deletion of 15q11&#8211;q13. With the availability of AS mouse models with <italic>Ube3a</italic> mutation alone and a deletion from <italic>Ube3a</italic> to <italic>Gabrb3</italic> in this report, a similar question can also be addressed in mice by recording USVs in both AS mouse models and making a direct comparison. In addition, recording the USVs in adult mice or using a different protocol in newborn pups is also desirable to further characterize this intriguing phenotype in future.</p><p>The value of recording and analyzing USVs to model human autistic behaviors has been increasingly recognized, although the interpretation of data and biological meaning of USVs in rodents in relation to human behaviors is still a subject of debate <xref rid="pone.0012278-Hahn1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012278-Moy1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>.

These reports supported the value of this technique because a mutation in the <italic>FOXP2</italic> gene was implicated in a large family with characteristic language disorder, and mutations in <italic>NLGN4</italic> have been found in a few cases of autism spectrum disorders in humans <xref rid="pone.0012278-Lai1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012278-Jamain2" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. On the other hand, similar to maternal <italic>Ube3a</italic> to <italic>Gabrb3</italic> deletion mice, increased USVs were reported in <italic>Mecp2</italic> deficiency pups, a mouse model of Rett syndrome, in which autistic behavior is a major feature <xref rid="pone.0012278-Picker1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. The reason for increased USV in the Rett syndrome mouse model was also not clear. There was a suggestion that the increased USVs may be related abnormal respiratory function, a symptom commonly observed in Rett syndrome patients <xref rid="pone.0012278-Scattoni1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Interestingly, significant overlapping clinical features between AS and Rett syndrome have long been documented <xref rid="pone.0012278-Jedele1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. Thus, the increased USVs in both AS and Rett syndrome mouse models may suggest a shared pathogenesis between these two disorders. In addition, increased USVs in newborn pups was also reported in mice of BTBR T+tf/J, tuberous sclerosis gene <italic>Tsc2</italic> mutation, and paternal duplication of human 15q11&#8211;q13 region <xref rid="pone.0012278-Scattoni2" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012278-Nakatani1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012278-1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. These observations suggest that increased USVs may be a common feature in mutant mice related to autism.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>A mouse model for a contiguous gene deletion form of Angelman syndrome</title><p>Although the deletion from <italic>Ube3a</italic> to <italic>Gabrb3</italic> is smaller than the typical 6-Mb deletion frequently found in human AS patients, the deleted interval in mice includes <italic>Ube3a</italic>, <italic>Atp10a</italic>, and <italic>Gabrb3</italic> and covers a critical region of AS deletion. Haploinsufficiency of <italic>Atp10a</italic> and <italic>Gabrb3</italic> has been suggested to account for differences in the phenotypes between patients with a point mutation in <italic>UBE3A</italic> and the large deletion form of AS. Thus, mice with a maternal deletion from <italic>Ube3a</italic> to <italic>Gabrb3</italic> are molecularly more similar to the AS patients with a large maternal deletion of chromosome15q11&#8211;q13. Our extensive behavioral characterization of both maternal and paternal deletion mice supports that the maternal deletion mouse is a valid model for the contiguous gene deletion form of AS. The impairments in learning and memory tasks, including contextual fear conditioning and Morris water maze, were specific to maternal, but not paternal, deletion mice. Although both light-dark and open field tests were used to evaluate anxiety related behaviors, maternal deletion mice only displayed an impairment in light-dark task but not in open field test. This may suggest a selective deficit in anxiety related behavior in maternal deletion mice. Although maternal deletion mice have significant impairment in rotarod test, there was no difference for the travel distance and speed in open field test. This was not a surprise because these mice did not have apparent motor coordination problem and abnormal gaits. The abnormal behaviors specific to the maternal deletion mice are consistent with a brain-specific, maternal expression pattern for the <italic>Ube3a</italic> gene. Mice used for these behavioral tests were on a relatively homogenous C57BL/6J genetic background after more than 6 generations of backcrossing to C57BL/6J. This is generally acceptable for most behavioral tests in the transgenic mutant mice although additional backcrossing may result more homogenous genetic background on C57BL/6J <xref rid="pone.0012278-Crawley1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. It should also be noted that the genetic background of the region most closely linked to the deletion at the <italic>Ube3a</italic> anchor is likely to be 129 SvEv and not C57BL/6J, even after backcrossing. The genetic background of the region at the <italic>Gabrb3</italic> anchor is C57BL/6J because the targeting construct for <italic>Gabrb3</italic> was produced using a C57BL/6J genomic library. The different genetic backgrounds at the targeted loci may influence the expression of genes adjacent to the targeted region. While this is technically difficult to investigate, the influence of these different genetic backgrounds on observed behavioral differences between maternal deletion mice and wild type littermate controls is probably minimal. Behavioral data from mice with a maternal <italic>Ube3a</italic> to <italic>Gabrb3</italic> deletion are mostly consistent with previous studies of <italic>Ube3a</italic> mutant mice, but the current study is more extensive as summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0012278-t001">Table 1</xref>

Although mutations in the <italic>UBE3A</italic> gene cause typical AS in humans, it has been reported in some studies that the phenotypes such as seizures in AS patients with <italic>UBE3A</italic> mutations are milder than in AS patients with large deletions of 15q11&#8211;q13 <xref rid="pone.0012278-Minassian1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012278-Paprocka1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012278-GalvanManso1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In mice, we noticed that the frequency of observed seizure activity was not significantly different between deletion and <italic>Ube3a</italic> mutation mice <xref rid="pone.0012278-Jiang3" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. However, these data should be interpreted with caution because the seizure phenotype, at best, is only semi-quantifiable in mice. More extensive studies with a novel design or technique are needed to compare the seizure phenotype between mice with a deletion and <italic>Ube3a</italic> mutation alone in order to make a meaningful conclusion. Similarly, mice with a deletion from <italic>Ube3a</italic> to <italic>Gabrb3</italic> provide a unique tool to compare other behavioral impairments that observed in mice with <italic>Ube3a</italic> mutation alone. However, there are potential issues in designing such comparative studies, including that mice to be tested will have to be produced from two different breeding and tests may not be carried out at the same time in parallel because of the logistic support issues. Despite of these challenges, these studies are worth to pursue because they may help to elucidate the contribution of haploinsufficiency of <italic>Gabrb3</italic> and <italic>Atp10a</italic> in the pathogenesis of AS and further shed light on the pathogenesis of human AS caused by different molecular defects.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0012278-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0012278.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Comparison of phenotypes in Angelman syndrome mouse models with different mutations.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0012278-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0012278.t001"/></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><label/><p>*<bold>:</bold> Targeting construct disrupted exon 2 (corresponding to human <italic>UBE3A</italic> exon sequence of GenBank accession No. X98022).

Heterozygous females were bred to wild type C57BL/6J males to produce heterozygotes with a maternal deletion from <italic>Ube3a</italic> to <italic>Gabrb3</italic> (m&#8722;/p+) and wild type littermates (m+/p+). Because of a possible role of maternal factors in production of ultrasonic vocalization (USV) in offspring, newborn pups used for the USV recording were produced by using male or female heterozygotes that had a deletion paternally but not maternally. Homozygotes with a deletion from <italic>Ube3a</italic> to <italic>Gabrb3</italic> (m&#8722;/p&#8722;) were produced by crossing heterozygous mice with a deletion. All experimentation and animal husbandry involving animals in this report have been conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines and under the animal protocols approved by IACUC at Duke University and Baylor College of Medicine. Genotyping was routinely doing by PCR based method using the following primer pairS: UB-R:5&#8242; <named-content content-type="gene">ATT AGA GGT GAT GAG GGT ATT GAG</named-content>; UB-F:5&#8242; <named-content content-type="gene">CAT TGC AAA TCA AAG GTG TGT GGA</named-content>; pL13:5&#8242; TA<named-content content-type="gene">C TTC CAT TTG TCA CGT CCT GCA C</named-content>.

For RT-PCR analysis, DNase I-treated total RNA was reverse transcribed with Superscript RNase H<sup>&#8722;</sup> reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA) using random hexamers for <italic>Atp10a</italic>. PCR was carried out in 50 &#181;l reactions with cycling conditions of denaturation at 94&#176;C for 45 seconds, annealing at 62&#176;C for 45 seconds, and extension at 62&#176;C for 45 seconds, for 35 cycles.

Primers and probe for mouse &#946;-actin were provided by Roche (Roche applied science, Germany). Real-time quantitative PCR was carried out using a LightCycler 480 Instrument (Roche Diagnostics, Germany) and LightCycler 480 RNA Master Hydrolysis Probes following manufacturer's recommendations. Two &#181;l of the total RNA sample was used in a 20 &#181;l PCR reaction containing 1x LightCycler 480 RNA master mix with an appropriate concentration of primers and probe. All samples and experiments were run in triplicate. Each PCR run also included 3 samples without RNA template as negative controls as well as a consistent triplicate calibrator comprising a mixture of multiple mouse cerebellum RNA as template. Mouse &#946;-actin RNA expression was used as an internal reference to normalize the quantity of RNA input across samples for quantification analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Mouse brain tissues were homogenized in NP40/SDS buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.01% SDS, 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet; Roche Applied Sciences, Indianapolis, IN) on ice with a pellet pestle. Following polyacryl amide gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad; Hercules, CA) at 4&#176;C overnight.

Mice were anesthetized with Avertin (1.25% tribromoethanol/amyl alcohol solution, i.p.) using a dose of 0.02 ml/g. Teflon-coated silver wire electrodes (0.005 inch diameter) attached to a microminiature connector were implanted bilaterally into the subdural space over temporal, parietal, and occipital cortices. Digital EEG activity was monitored daily for up to two weeks during prolonged overnight and random 2 hr sample recordings (Stellate Systems, Harmonie software version 6.1b; Montreal Quebec, Canada).
