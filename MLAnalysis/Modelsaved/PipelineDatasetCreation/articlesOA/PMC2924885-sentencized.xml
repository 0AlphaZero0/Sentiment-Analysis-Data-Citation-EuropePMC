</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with severe mental retardation, absence of language development, characteristic EEG abnormalities and epilepsy, happy disposition, movement disorders, and autistic features [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The molecular defects underlying AS are heterogeneous. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>About 70% of AS patients have a large chromosomal deletion of 15q11–q13, exclusively of maternal origin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 15 is found in ∼5% of AS patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Mutations of the E6-AP ubiquitin ligase gene (UBE3A) on maternal chromosome 15 are found in about 15% of AS patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Rarely, a microdeletion in the region designated as an imprinting center is also found in some cases of AS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The finding of loss-of-function mutations in the maternal UBE3A gene in patients with typical features of AS indicates that maternal deficiency for UBE3A is responsible for the major clinical manifestations [2], [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In addition, maternal, but not paternal, duplication of 15q11–q13 has been reported in about 1–2% of idiopathic autism spectrum disorder patients [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Recently, a small duplication covering from ATP10A to GABRB3 was reported in one autism patient [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>At the molecular level, AS patients with a large chromosomal deletion of 15q11–q13 have deficiency of the maternally expressed UBE3A gene and possibly of ATP10A in brain, and they are haploinsufficient for many other genes with biallelic expression within the 6-Mb deleted interval. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>These biallelically expressed genes include the GABA receptor cluster of GABRB3, GABRG5, and GABAG3 telomeric of UBE3A, and CYFIP1, NIPA1, NIPA2, GCG5, WHCD1L1, and GOLGA8E at the centromeric end of the deletion in patients with a larger class I deletion [6], [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Reports have suggested that the ATP10A gene is maternally expressed in humans [8], [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>One report found that ATP10A exhibits imprinted expression in brain but biallelic expression in non-neuronal tissues [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Another study reported imprinted expression of ATP10A in lymphoblasts as well as brains [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The most recent report found that ATP10A was expressed biallelically in brain in the majority of individuals examined while a small percentage exhibited variable monoallelic expression but not strictly maternal allele-specific. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Monoallelic expression appeared to be favored by female gender [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Reports of imprinting status of the mouse ortholog of ATP10A were also not consistent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>One report indicated that Atp10a is maternally expressed in hippocampus and olfactory bulb [11], while two other studies found that Atp10a is biallelically expressed in all tissues [12], [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there were reports suggesting paternal, maternal, and biallelic expression of GABRB3 in humans and mice using different experimental designs [14], [15], [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>A recent report also suggested greatly reduced levels of the Gabrb3 subunit in the brain of male mice with a maternally transmitted Gabrb3 mutation but not in male mice with paternal origin of the same mutation [17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In humans, analyses of genotype and phenotype correlation among AS patients with different classes of molecular defects have been reported [18], [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>These analyses have revealed that AS patients with large chromosome deletions of 15q11–q13 have more severe phenotypes than AS patients with UBE3A mutations, paternal UPD, and imprinting mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In addition, there were early reports suggesting that loss-of-function UBE3A mutations, paternal UPD of chromosome 15, or imprinting mutations in AS were associated with relatively milder epilepsy while AS patients with a deletion of chromosome 15q11–13 had more severe epilepsy [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>However, other studies found no genotype-phenotype correlation for EEG abnormalities and epilepsy among AS patients with different genotypes [21], [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>One caveat of these studies was the relative small sample size which might bias the results and conclusion. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>We have previously characterized an AS model with a null mutation of the Ube3a gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Mice with maternal deficiency of the Ube3a gene recapitulated the brain-specific imprinted expression [23], [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Mice inheriting the Ube3a mutation maternally, but not paternally, displayed phenotypes that resemble AS with abnormal EEG and seizure activity, motor dysfunction, and defects in contextual fear conditioning and hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>These findings, together with a report by others, indicate that mice with maternal deficiency of Ube3a are a valid model for human AS with mutations in the UBE3A gene [23], [25]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Here we report generation and characterization of mutant mice with a 1.6-Mb chromosomal deletion from Ube3a to Gabrb3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>The chromosomal deletion was generated by a chromosome engineering technique using cre/loxP and two halves of a Hprt (hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase) minigene as described previously [26], [27], [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The deletion disrupted both the Ube3a and Gabrb3 genes and also deleted the 1.6-Mb interval that contains the Atp10a gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Analyses of maternal (m−/p+), paternal (m+/p−), and homozygous (m−/p−) deletion mice indicate that mice with a maternal deletion from Ube3a to Gabrb3 provide an AS mouse model that is molecularly more similar to the common contiguous deletion form of AS, and thus valuable for future comparative studies. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Mice with a deletion from Ube3a to Gabrb3 were identified by DNA genomic Southern analysis using genomic probes flanking and within the deletion interval as shown in the Figure 1E. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Absence of signal in DNA Southern analysis using a probe hybridizing within the Atp10a gene indicated that the desired deletion was produced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>A PCR-based mouse genotyping protocol was also developed for routine mouse colony management (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>The estimated size of the deletion from Ube3a to Gabrb3 was 1.6-Mb (from 64846987 bp to 66527319 bp) based on the NCBI Build 37 assembly of mouse genome sequences (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.ucsc.edu">www.genome.ucsc.edu</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Both the Ube3a and Gabrb3 genes were disrupted as shown in Figure 1D and confirmed by the RNA and protein analyses shown in Figure 2A and 2B using fetus with a homozygous deletion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Mice with a Ube3a single mutation have been characterized and reported previously [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Mice with a Gabrb3 single mutation and Ube3a and Gabrb3 double mutations produced from this experiment have not been fully characterized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>However, Gabrb3 mutant mice with a different mutation have been reported previously by others [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Because of involvement of imprinting in the region, a specific breeding scheme diagramed in supplemental Figure S4 was followed to produce mice for experiments described below. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>The expression pattern of Ube3a in the cerebellum and hippocampus in maternal deletion mice was consistent with previous reports of exclusive maternal expression of Ube3a in these regions [23], [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>We also observed that the expression in the cerebral cortex was almost exclusively maternal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>This is slightly different from the previous report that the expression of Ube3a was predominantly maternal and region specific in the cerebral cortex by RNA in situ in UPD mice [23], [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>The discrepancy could be due to the sensitivity of different techniques or different mutations analyzed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Using mice carrying a paternal or maternal deletion of Atp10a and Gabrb3, we were able to examine the parental origin of expression for Atp10a and Gabrb3 directly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Our analysis did not provide any evidence supporting exclusive maternal expression of Atp10a but indicated biallelic expression of Atp10a in the brain regions of mice examined by quantitative RNA expression analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>This analysis also did not reveal monoallelic expression of Atp10a that was reported in a small fraction of human brains and associated with gender [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>This is in agreement with two studies that found no imprinted expression in any tissue examined [12], [13] but differs from a third report suggesting predominant maternal expression of Atp10a in hippocampus and olfactory bulb in mice [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>It is not immediately clear why the results from these studies are different. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>One possibility is the effect of mouse genetic background on imprinting, but this has not been fully investigated [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Our expression analysis of Atp10a was performed in mice with a relatively homogenous C57BL/6J genetic background that overlaps with, but is not the same as that used in the other studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>The technical limitations of the different methods used should also be considered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Our strategy of using Atp10a knockout mice was different from the other studies, which used strain-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms to determine the parental origin of expression, or studied in PWS imprinting center mutant mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>A limitation of our analysis is that we could not rule out a cell type-specific imprinting expression of Atp10a. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>The function of Atp10a in mammals is unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Homozygous mice with a deletion from Ube3a to Gabrb3 died 1 to 3 days after birth and did not have any increased embryonic lethality or additional structural defects compared to mice with a null mutation of either Gabrb3 or Ube3a alone, or Gabrb3 and Ube3a double mutation without a deletion (Jiang and Beaudet, unpublished data). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that the function of Atp10a is probably not essential during embryonic development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>Studies of mice carrying a radiation-induced large deletion proximal to the 3′-end of Snrpn to the p locus that included Atp10a, indicated that Atp10a may have an important role in insulin resistance and glucose metabolism [40], [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>However, no direct conclusion regarding the role of Atp10a could be made because the deletion is large and mice are haploinsufficient for many genes in addition to Atp10a. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in neonatal mice have been studied both as early communicative behavior between pups and mothers, and as a sign of response to environmental stress such as separation and cold temperature [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Recording of USVs has been increasingly used as a tool to analyze behavioral phenotypes of mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders although interpretation of the findings remains a subject of debate [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>Currently, there is no standardized protocol for recording USVs in the literature [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>We followed a previously described protocol with minor modifications [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>The rationale for recording USVs on different beddings was based on the fact that different odors may present important cues for social stress or isolation [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>Recording in cold temperature was designed to evaluate the response to a known stress for USV production [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>The protocol of recording on different days was based on the observation that the peak of USV production varied on different postnatal days and differed among different mouse genetic backgrounds [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>From reviewing the limited reports of USVs recording in knockout mice in the literature, we anticipated the possibility that m−/p+ pups might have reduced USVs because of absence of language and autistic features in AS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Thus the finding of an overall increase in USVs in pups with a maternal deletion from Ube3a to Gabrb3 was somewhat unexpected but not surprised. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>The comparable rate of USVs between m+/p+ and m−/p+ mice at cold temperature suggested that m−/p+ pups had a normal response to cold stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>The significantly increased production of USVs in different beddings and on different days for m−/p+ pups may indicate increased anxiety and response to social isolation stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>However, this interpretation seems counterintuitive because the difference between m+/p+ and m−/p+ was most significant in the mother's bedding which was intended to be less stressful because of the maternal odor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, the significant difference in USV production between m+/p+ and m−/p+ pups recorded in the mother's bedding may reflect impairment related to maternal attachment behaviors between mother and offspring. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>In the earlier reports, the characteristic happy disposition and friendly behaviors in AS patients were considered to be contextually inappropriate and not related to the environment stimuli [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>It has also been reported that AS patients have significant autistic features and often meet the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder through autism diagnostic evaluation [48], [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>In contrast, other recent behavioral studies suggest that happy disposition like smiling and laughing behaviors in AS were influenced by environmental clues and different social settings [50], [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>By carefully observing social behaviors among children with AS caused by a deletion of 15q11–q13, Oliver et al. reported that AS patients smiled more and evoked a higher level of adult attention than the control group in different settings [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>They concluded that the excessive smiling and laughing behaviors seen in AS patients may indicate an increase in signaling behaviors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>Thus, the observation of increased production of USVs in m−/p+ pups may suggest that increased USVs is analogous to the increased signaling behaviors observed in human AS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>It should be noted that the human AS behavioral observation studies by Oliver et al. were carried out only in a small number of AS patients, all with a deletion of 15q11–q13 [51], [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>An interesting question is whether AS patients with mutations in the UBE3A gene have the same behavioral profile related to smiling and laughing as those with a deletion of 15q11–q13. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>With the availability of AS mouse models with Ube3a mutation alone and a deletion from Ube3a to Gabrb3 in this report, a similar question can also be addressed in mice by recording USVs in both AS mouse models and making a direct comparison. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>In addition, recording the USVs in adult mice or using a different protocol in newborn pups is also desirable to further characterize this intriguing phenotype in future. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>The value of recording and analyzing USVs to model human autistic behaviors has been increasingly recognized, although the interpretation of data and biological meaning of USVs in rodents in relation to human behaviors is still a subject of debate [44], [53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>Reduced USVs were reported in Foxp2 and Nlgn4 deficiency pups [54], [55], [56], [57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>These reports supported the value of this technique because a mutation in the FOXP2 gene was implicated in a large family with characteristic language disorder, and mutations in NLGN4 have been found in a few cases of autism spectrum disorders in humans [58], [59]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, similar to maternal Ube3a to Gabrb3 deletion mice, increased USVs were reported in Mecp2 deficiency pups, a mouse model of Rett syndrome, in which autistic behavior is a major feature [60]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>The reason for increased USV in the Rett syndrome mouse model was also not clear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>There was a suggestion that the increased USVs may be related abnormal respiratory function, a symptom commonly observed in Rett syndrome patients [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, significant overlapping clinical features between AS and Rett syndrome have long been documented [61]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>Thus, the increased USVs in both AS and Rett syndrome mouse models may suggest a shared pathogenesis between these two disorders. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>In addition, increased USVs in newborn pups was also reported in mice of BTBR T+tf/J, tuberous sclerosis gene Tsc2 mutation, and paternal duplication of human 15q11–q13 region [62], [63], [64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that increased USVs may be a common feature in mutant mice related to autism. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>Although the deletion from Ube3a to Gabrb3 is smaller than the typical 6-Mb deletion frequently found in human AS patients, the deleted interval in mice includes Ube3a, Atp10a, and Gabrb3 and covers a critical region of AS deletion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>Haploinsufficiency of Atp10a and Gabrb3 has been suggested to account for differences in the phenotypes between patients with a point mutation in UBE3A and the large deletion form of AS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>Thus, mice with a maternal deletion from Ube3a to Gabrb3 are molecularly more similar to the AS patients with a large maternal deletion of chromosome15q11–q13. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>Our extensive behavioral characterization of both maternal and paternal deletion mice supports that the maternal deletion mouse is a valid model for the contiguous gene deletion form of AS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>The impairments in learning and memory tasks, including contextual fear conditioning and Morris water maze, were specific to maternal, but not paternal, deletion mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>Although both light-dark and open field tests were used to evaluate anxiety related behaviors, maternal deletion mice only displayed an impairment in light-dark task but not in open field test. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>This may suggest a selective deficit in anxiety related behavior in maternal deletion mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>Although maternal deletion mice have significant impairment in rotarod test, there was no difference for the travel distance and speed in open field test. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>This was not a surprise because these mice did not have apparent motor coordination problem and abnormal gaits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>The abnormal behaviors specific to the maternal deletion mice are consistent with a brain-specific, maternal expression pattern for the Ube3a gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>Mice used for these behavioral tests were on a relatively homogenous C57BL/6J genetic background after more than 6 generations of backcrossing to C57BL/6J. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>This is generally acceptable for most behavioral tests in the transgenic mutant mice although additional backcrossing may result more homogenous genetic background on C57BL/6J [65]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>It should also be noted that the genetic background of the region most closely linked to the deletion at the Ube3a anchor is likely to be 129 SvEv and not C57BL/6J, even after backcrossing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>The genetic background of the region at the Gabrb3 anchor is C57BL/6J because the targeting construct for Gabrb3 was produced using a C57BL/6J genomic library. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>The different genetic backgrounds at the targeted loci may influence the expression of genes adjacent to the targeted region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>While this is technically difficult to investigate, the influence of these different genetic backgrounds on observed behavioral differences between maternal deletion mice and wild type littermate controls is probably minimal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="343" pm="."><plain>Behavioral data from mice with a maternal Ube3a to Gabrb3 deletion are mostly consistent with previous studies of Ube3a mutant mice, but the current study is more extensive as summarized in Table 1 [23], [25], [66]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>Although mutations in the UBE3A gene cause typical AS in humans, it has been reported in some studies that the phenotypes such as seizures in AS patients with UBE3A mutations are milder than in AS patients with large deletions of 15q11–q13 [20], [21], [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>In mice, we noticed that the frequency of observed seizure activity was not significantly different between deletion and Ube3a mutation mice [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>However, these data should be interpreted with caution because the seizure phenotype, at best, is only semi-quantifiable in mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>More extensive studies with a novel design or technique are needed to compare the seizure phenotype between mice with a deletion and Ube3a mutation alone in order to make a meaningful conclusion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>Similarly, mice with a deletion from Ube3a to Gabrb3 provide a unique tool to compare other behavioral impairments that observed in mice with Ube3a mutation alone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>However, there are potential issues in designing such comparative studies, including that mice to be tested will have to be produced from two different breeding and tests may not be carried out at the same time in parallel because of the logistic support issues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>Despite of these challenges, these studies are worth to pursue because they may help to elucidate the contribution of haploinsufficiency of Gabrb3 and Atp10a in the pathogenesis of AS and further shed light on the pathogenesis of human AS caused by different molecular defects. </plain></SENT>
