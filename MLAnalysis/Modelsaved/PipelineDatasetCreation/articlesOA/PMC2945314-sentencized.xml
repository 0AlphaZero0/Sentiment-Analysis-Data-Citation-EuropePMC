</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Oocytes in newborn rodents are present in ‘nests’ that are composed of many adjacent oocytes with no intervening cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Follicle assembly occurs in the first few days after birth in rodents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In humans, follicle assembly begins during mid-gestation near week 18 and continues into the third trimester [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>During the developmental process of follicle assembly primordial follicles are formed from oocyte nests [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The reproductive lifespan of a female is determined in part by the size of the primordial follicle pool generated [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Initially in the embryonic ovary oogonia undergo mitotic proliferation and then enter the first meiotic division to become oocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>These unassembled oocytes are present directly adjacent to one another in nest structures which are surrounded by somatic cells (i.e. precursor granulosa cells) [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The process of follicle assembly results in the breakdown of oocyte nests, due partially to apoptotic cell death of many of the oocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Somatic cells move into the nests and intersperse between the remaining oocytes [10], [11], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>An oocyte must be surrounded by an adequate number of pre-granulosa cells to form a primordial follicle [13], [14], [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The primordial follicles formed constitute a pool of follicles having oocytes arrested in prophase I of meiosis [3], [4], [5], [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Primordial follicles gradually leave the arrested pool by undergoing the primordial to primary follicle transition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>After transition follicles as they grow either undergo apoptosis/atresia or the follicles ovulate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In humans, when the pool of follicles is depleted reproduction ceases and women enter menopause [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Some studies have suggested the possibility that new follicles with oocytes may form in adulthood [21], [22], [23], but the preponderance of literature suggests that a defined and finite pool of primordial follicles exists [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>It is possible that if the size of the follicle pool could be manipulated the reproductive capacity and fertile lifespan of the organism may change. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Although several signal transduction and transcription factors have been shown to influence the primordial follicle pool [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], few extracellular signaling factors have been shown to have an effect on ovarian follicle assembly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Treatment of neonatal mice with activin resulted in an increase in the initial pool size [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that both estrogen and progesterone slow the rate of follicle assembly [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>This study also demonstrated that progesterone acts at least in part through an inhibition of oocyte apoptosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated that apoptosis of oocytes is part of follicle assembly [9], [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The actions of progesterone were later found to be inhibited by tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>TNFα did not have an effect on the rate or percentage of assembled follicles, but promoted the apoptosis of oocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>TNFα was found to block the inhibitory actions of progesterone and promote normal primordial follicle assembly [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the inhibitory actions of progesterone on follicle assembly using a microarray analysis of the ovarian transcriptome demonstrated that progesterone promoted a dramatic up-regulation of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), as well as an increase in the TGFβ family member TGFβ-3 [33]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The current study was designed to investigate the role of CTGF in primordial follicle assembly due to its altered gene expression during this process [33], [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) has been shown to be expressed by multiple cell types and to have numerous functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>CTGF is well known for its roles in tissue remodeling [35] and extra-cellular-matrix formation [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Tissue remodeling and extracellular matrix are important for follicular development [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>CTGF is the most studied member of the CCN family of proteins, which is composed of cysteine-rich protein 61 (CYR61, CCN1), CTGF (CCN2), nephroblastoma overexpressed gene (NOV, CCN3), and Wnt-inducible secreted proteins 1–3 (WISP-1, WISP-2, WISP-3), which are also known as CCN4 through CCN6 [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>CTGF mRNA has been shown to be present in ovaries in pre-antral to preovulatory follicles in both rats and pigs [39], [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>CTGF and transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ-1) have been shown to modify the functions of each other. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>For instance, CTGF regulates connective tissue fibroblasts [41] and vascular smooth muscle cells [42] through a modulation of TGFβ-1 actions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Transforming growth factor beta-one (TGFβ-1) has been shown to be present in both rat and human ovaries during follicle assembly [43], [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>TGFβ-1, TGFβ-2, and TGFβ-3 are known to be expressed throughout adulthood in ovarian follicles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>TGFβs have been shown to stimulate oocyte meiotic maturation in pubertal 23–25 day old rats [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>In humans, TGFβ-1 has been localized primarily to oocytes during the period from 18–22 weeks of gestation [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in 1–3 day old rats, TGFβ-1 has been localized primarily to granulosa cells [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The role of TGFβ-1 in neonatal ovary development has not been determined. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The present study is designed to determine if CTGF and/or TGFβ-1 affect the process of follicle assembly or alter primordial pool size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Since the expression of CTGF changes during follicle assembly, as shown in recent microarray studies [33], [34], the functional role of CTGF was investigated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, CTGF was found to induce primordial follicle assembly while TGFβ reduced primordial follicle pool size. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Oocytes were microscopically examined and were classified as being not yet assembled into follicles (i.e. the oocyte was part of an unassembled oocyte nest), as primordial (stage 0) or as one of the developing pre-antral stages (stages 1–4) as described previously [31], [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Unassembled oocytes are recognized from being grouped together without any intervening stromal cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>As assembly occurs, the surrounding pre-granulosa cells and the developing basement membrane around the follicle provide a more distinct and visible division of one oocyte from another. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Primordial follicles consist of an oocyte partially or completely surrounded by a single layer of squamous pre-granulosa cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Developing (stages 1–4) follicles contain successively more cuboidal granulosa cells in layers around the oocyte [4], [5], [46], [47]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>Previous ovarian transcriptome analysis demonstrated that TGFβ-1 is highly expressed during the follicle assembly process when compared to ovaries containing primordial or primary follicles [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>In addition, the ability of progesterone to inhibit follicle assembly resulted in a dramatic increase in expression of CTGF [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>CTGF and TGFβ-3 were among the few growth factors shown to be regulated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>TGFβ-1 and TGFβ-3 act on the same receptor complex to stimulate the same signaling cascade. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>CTGF and TGFβ-1 are also known to regulate each others' functions [41], [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Therefore, CTGF and TGFβ-1 were investigated as potential regulators of primordial follicle assembly utilizing whole ovary organ cultures. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Observations from the two-day ovary culture experiments demonstrates that CTGF promotes primordial follicle assembly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>TGFβ-1 treatment was not found to have an effect alone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>The combined treatment of CTGF and TGFβ-1 stimulated follicular assembly to the same degree as CTGF alone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Therefore, TGFβ-1 had no effect on the proportion of oocytes assembled into follicles after two days of culture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Treatment with progesterone (P4) inhibited follicle assembly as previously described [31], and was used as a positive control in these experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Analysis of oocyte density demonstrated that the combined treatment of CTGF with TGFβ-1 induced a significant decrease in oocyte number. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the two factors synergize to modify oocyte number and demonstrates that initially it is possible to manipulate follicle pool size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>One possible way to stimulate follicular or ovarian development and decrease pool size is by increasing apoptosis of the oocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>This was tested with a cellular apoptosis assay, but no significant effect of any treatment was demonstrated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Therefore, CTGF and the combined CTGF &amp; TGFβ-1 treatment groups appear not to act through altering apoptosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>However, it is possible that a difference in apoptosis rates may not be detectable at two days of culture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Further studies with shorter or longer culture periods are needed to clarify if there is a period at which CTGF and TGFβ-1 affect apoptosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, CTGF may modify the extra-cellular matrix (ECM) of either pre-granulosa cells or the oocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>In summary, after two days of ovary culture CTGF was found to induce primordial follicle assembly while a combined CTGF and TGFβ-1 treatment initially reduced the pool of oocytes in the ovary. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Morphologically, the basement membranes of the nests are degraded and new membranes around primordial follicles are formed during follicle assembly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>This ECM formation and breakdown is essential for follicular development [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>CTGF has previously been shown to affect ECM structure and stability in other tissues [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>CTGF was primarily localized to the ECM of nest basement membranes and to the cell membranes of individual oocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with the general sub-cellular localization of CTGF in other tissues [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>So one mechanism of action for CTGF may be for CTGF to affect ECM during follicle assembly, possibly promoting the cell migration that is a part of primordial follicle formation [37]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Ovaries were also treated for ten days in culture to investigate the possibility of manipulating the primordial follicle pool size at a time near the end of follicle assembly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>In the event the number of assembled follicles could be affected with a growth factor treatment, observations would indicate the possibility of affecting the primordial follicle pool size and thus reproductive lifespan of a female. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>The nests found after 10 days of treatment were markedly smaller than nests after two days (Figure 2D). In vivo no unassembled nests would be observed after 10 days of postnatal development, but the ovary organ culture system has the capacity to retain small nests of unassembled oocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>After 10 days of culture, CTGF was not found to increase the proportion of assembled follicles as was observed after two days of treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>The likely explanation for this is that CTGF only increases the rate of follicle assembly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>The control untreated ovaries appear to have “caught up” developmentally over the longer 10-day culture time period. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the combined treatment of both CTGF and TGFβ-1 was observed to increase the proportion of assembled follicles over ten days. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>This suggests that CTGF and TGFβ-1 act synergistically to promote follicle development since the CTGF treatment group alone did not have an effect after ten days of culture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>This also indicates this treatment may affect follicle transition which takes place immediately after assembly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>In contrast, progesterone was seen to inhibit follicle assembly and development over ten days [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>Progesterone was found to increase the proportion of unassembled follicles, and the combined CTGF and TGFβ-1 treatment decreased the proportion of unassembled follicles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the inhibitory effects of progesterone and stimulatory effects of the combined CTGF and TGFβ-1 treatment on primordial follicle assembly can be explained by their respective actions on the unassembled follicle pool, even without their having effects on the total number of oocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>The separate actions of TGFβ-1 and CTGF on follicle assembly appear different than their combined effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>For example, TGFβ-1 alone decreased total oocyte number in 10-day ovary cultures, while TGFβ-1 plus CTGF did not. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>This suggests that their actions combined are not simply the additive result of their separate actions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>It is likely that the synergism of signaling pathways from both CTGF and TGFβ regulate specific and novel cellular functions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Observations suggest the expression of progesterone, CTGF and TGFβ expression are coordinated with each other. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Previous studies of rat follicle assembly indicates progesterone treatment of ovaries resulted in a 2.7-fold change in CTGF mRNA expression, and a 1.6-fold change in TGFβ-3 expression [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>In the current study microarray analysis revealed that CTGF treatment resulted in a small (1.1-fold) but statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) increase in TGFβ-3 expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>In other organ systems it has been shown that CTGF and TGFβ-1 modulate each other's expression and actions [41], [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>The signaling pathways that link the expression suggest the assembly-inhibiting actions of progesterone stimulates the expression of CTGF and TGFβ's that in turn can promote follicle assembly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Observations suggest the inhibition of follicle assembly may prime the factors that in turn stimulate assembly. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>The total number of oocytes per ovarian cross-section was measured in the ten-day culture experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, none of the treatments that affected the percentage of assembled follicles (i.e. CTGF and TGFβ-1, or P4) resulted in a significantly different number of oocytes when compared to controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the altered percentage of primordial follicles was due to corresponding alterations in the assembly of unassembled oocytes into primordial follicles and not from altered oocyte number. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>However, TGFβ-1 treatment was found to significantly reduce the total number of oocytes per cross section compared to controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Observations indicate that TGFβ-1 reduced the total oocyte number, such that the actions of TGFβ may reduce the future capacity for follicular development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Although the postnatal alteration in oocyte number suggests the possibility of manipulating the primordial follicle pool and reproductive lifespan for a female, previous studies have suggested that at puberty the primordial follicle pool may normalize. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>For example, an increased number of assembled follicles caused by activin treatment prepubertally was reduced to normal levels during puberty [30]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>The gene network identified suggested an extracellular growth factor (CXCL2), receptor signaling (GPR132 and CTNNB1), numerous signaling systems and transcriptional factors are all involved in primordial follicle assembly, Figure 7. </plain></SENT>
