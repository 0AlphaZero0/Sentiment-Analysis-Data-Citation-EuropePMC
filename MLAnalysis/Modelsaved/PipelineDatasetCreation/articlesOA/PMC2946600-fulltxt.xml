The rapid clearance of the drug from the circulation, caused by its active uptake in the liver, has lead to complicated clinical applications. Different forms of plasminogen activators have been developed to treat thrombotic disease. Deletion of the first three domains of t-PA by gene manipulation techniques has shown a significant increase in its plasma half life. In order to compensate the disadvantage of higher bleeding risk, a novel chimeric truncated form of t-PA with 394 amino acids and more fibrin affinity compared to the truncated form was designed to be expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovarian (CHO) cells. The recombinant chimeric plasminogen activator consists of kringle 2 and serine protease (K2S) domains of t-PA, namely GHRP-SYQ-K2S. The level of expression was found to be 752&#8201;IU/ml with 566,917&#8201;IU/mg specific activity, based on amidolytic activity. The fibrin binding of this novel chimeric truncated t-PA was 86% of the full length t-PA at a fibrinogen concentration of 0.2&#8201;mg/ml. This could be a promising approach with more desirable pharmacodynamic properties compared to existing commercial forms.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="section" id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>   Myocardial infarction (MI) is  an irreversible necrosis or death of heart muscles due to prolonged ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].  According to the third monitoring  report of the World Health Organization, cardiovascular diseases cause 12 million deaths throughout the world each year  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].   Thrombolytic drugs play a crucial role in the management of patients with acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, acute thrombosis of retinal vessel, extensive coronary emboli, and peripheral vascular thromboembolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Recognition of the importance of fibrinolytic system in thrombus resolution has resulted in the development of various fibrinolytic agents and plasminogen activators (PAs) with different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].  Three different generations of PAs have been introduced to the market.  The first generation agents are Streptokinase and Urokinase.  The second generation agents are Alteplase and Acylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (APSAC).  The third generation agents are Vampire bat plasminogen activator (BatPA), Reteplase, Tenecteplase, Lanatoplase, and Staphylokinase  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) is the dominant PA involved in fibrinolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].  T-PA is a glycoprotein with 67&#8201;kDa, 527 amino acids, which promotes conversion of plasminogen to plasmin in the presence of fibrin.   The protein molecule is divided into five structural domains: finger domain (F) followed by a growth factor domain (EGF) near the N-terminal region and the two kringle 1 (K1) and kringle 2 (K2) domains.   Next to kringle 2 domain is the serine protease domain with the catalytic site at the C terminus.   Both finger and kringle 2 bind to the fibrin and accelerate t-PA activation on plasminogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].  However, full length t-PA has some major disadvantages among which the rapid clearance from plasma due to the recognition of structural elements on first three N-terminal domains by certain hepatic receptors   is the most important     [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].  Furthermore, prokaryotic production and refolding process of full length form is challenging  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].   These two substantial reasons, have  lead to synthesis of the smallest active molecule such as  Reteplase and Lanatoplase  that are commercially available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. </p><p>   Reteplase is a deletion mutant of t-PA with prolonged half-life, in which the F, EGF, and K1 region of wild type t-PA molecular have been deleted.  Finger domain is the responsible domain for fibrin affinity.   Therefore,   Reteplase has weaker affinity for fibrin and causes more fibrinogen depletion than full length forms     [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].    The chimeric tetrapeptide selection was based on following evidences.  Human fibrinogen can be converted to fibrin through thrombin-catalyzed release of small peptides from the amino-terminal segments of the K and L chains that are named fibrinopeptides A and B, respectively     [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].    The tetrapeptide GHRP can interact with a complementary site on the L lobe of fibrin monomers and prevent polymerization     [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].  Furthermore, it has been reported that histidine-16 of the BL chain plays an important role in the association of fibrin    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>   In this study, the first three domains of t-PA were deleted in order to increase half life. The other crucial change made to the protein was that a chimeric tertapeptide  Gly-His-Arg-Pro (GHRP) with high fibrin affinity, was added upstream of K2S to compensate for diminished fibrin affinity due to F domain deletion.  Therefore, a novel truncated form t-PA was designed to be expressed in Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO).    This experiment was primarily designed and analyzed based on in silico analysis of the molecule.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec2"><title>2.

Therefore, assuming that the control full-length form has 100% of fibrin affinity, the chimeric-truncated form represented 86% of fibrin affinity of full length protein.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec4"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>          Plasminogen activators (PAs) are used in treating cardiovascular and cerebrovascular obstructions    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].    Apart from laborious production and refolding process, short plasma half life has complicated full-length t-PA's clinical application     [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].   Deletion-variants of t-PA such as Lanotaplase and Reteplase are nonglycosylated truncated forms constructed to increase plasma half life     [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].  It seems that deletion of these regions could be an advantage.  In addition, presence of GHRP amino acids sounds beneficial for improving fibrin affinity    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].   Taking advantage of these two factors a chimeric truncated form of t-PA was designed based on <italic>in silico</italic> analysis.  The analysis showed that the molecule preserves the crucial regions of full length t-PA.  As previously reported the first 3 amino acids of t-PA (SYQ) are important for the protein activity, and we decided to conjugate this part to the K2S (functional domain) the same as what is done in Reteplase (truncated form of t-PA). This truncated form  has proven to be active while SYQ is juxtaposed to K2S domain without any other interfering amino acids. So, we proposed that SYQ-K2S arrangement is responsible for the serine protease activity. On the other hand, the aim of this study was to improve some pharmacodynamic properties of an existing truncated t-PA (Reteplase). So, in order to compare our proposed form with the previous one we should keep all other parts intact; that is, SYQ-K2S should have been persevered to observe the sole effect of GHRP addition in fibrin-binding affinity. The chimeric GHRP was designed to increase fibrin affinity compared to Reteplase. We proposed that in order to have better access to fibrin cloths in purpose of improved interaction of the chimeric protein with fibrin cloths it is better to have the chimeric GHRP situated in the N-terminus and not between other residues the same as what is done in Jiao et al.'s article.  </p><p>    Apart from cell line development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]  and synergism strategies    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] improving efficacy by protein engineering is greatly promising.  Principal focus of these efforts is eliminating regions to reduce the size of molecule and increase half life.  Deleting F, E, and k1 domains reduces both fibrin binding and fibrin enhancement of plasminogen activator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].  In order to compensate this disadvantage, inserting additional fibrin-binding sites into the molecule enhances specifity.</p><p>    Our chimeric-truncated form showed desirable protein stability based on Ramachandran plot predictions and RSMD values. In Ramachandran plot analysis, nearly, 1% of the residues, including residues 4 and 5 were found to be in outliner region.  Given that the residues 4 and 5 are representing an unnatural, chimeric junction, less than 1% of residues are not modeled well which is favorable compared to similar strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].  Additionally, the best RMSD value was the result of superimposing our model on 1BDA template which consists of 300 amino acids; 76% of total protein residues and the active site as well. </p><p>   The experimental analysis confirmed our <italic>in silico </italic>analysis findings.  Chimeric-truncated t-PA was expressed in CHO DG44 cells. The level of expression was found to be 752&#8201;IU/mL  in optimized condition.  This level of expression is promising  compared to enzymatic activity of produced t-PA in E. coli (3&#8211;7&#8201;IU/mL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], nonmodified rCHO (50&#8201;IU/mL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], Aspergillus nidulans (0.1&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g/mL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], or <italic>Leishmania tarentolae</italic> (70&#8201;IU/mL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>   Enhancing productivity of cell lines is crucial for reducing costs.  Among nonrecombinant mammalian cell producers Bowes melanoma cell line is perhaps the best choice with the productivity more than 30&#8201;IU per 10<sup>6</sup> cells per day (0.1&#8201;mg/L conditioned medium)    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].  Epithelial cells like guinea pig ear keratocytes (GPK) have yields of production ranged over 5&#8211;10&#8201;mg/L from perfusion cultures with (7&#8211;10)&#215;10<sup>6</sup> anchored cells per milliliter    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].  Between recombinant mammalian cells with inserted copies of human t-PA gene, mouse C127 fibroblasts (with 55&#8201;mg/L production rate ), rat myeloma (with 52&#8201;mg/L production rate), and CHO cells (with 65&#8201;mg/L production rate) in perfused or fed-batch systems are worth mentioning     [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].  </p><p>  Considering other recombinant cultures, Saccharomyces cervisiae has a low yield of production with extensive hyper glycosylated and heterogenic forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].  Bacterium Escherchia coli produces t-PA as inclusion bodies consisting 5%&#8211;10% of cell proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].  Because of low recovery of active t-PA from inclusion bodies, bacterial production process does not seem feasible.  In one study, coexpressing of native or heterologous cysteine oxidoreductases  increased expression levels to 180&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].  Despite the complexity of renaturation from inclusion bodies  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], E. coli fermentation is far less demanding than animal cell culture.  Furthermore, glycosylation is not necessary for biological activity; also nonglycosylated forms show increased plasma half lives,   hence, t-PA.</p><p>Production in bacteria is still desirable and perhaps become feasible either with advances in renaturation methods or with reduction in number of disulfide bonds via protein engineering.  The suggested chimeric-truncated form is promising due to potential of production in prokaryotic systems similar to its nonglycosylated commercial relative, Reteplase.  </p><p>    We designed our cassette gene by having t-PA signal sequence upstream of chimeric-truncated molecule via SOEing PCR in order to take advantage of proper folding and glycosylation in CHO.  Different sizes of templates is a problematic matter in applying SOEing PCR procedure and closer template sizes are preferred in this strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].  Here, owing to appropriate  primer design, two remarkably different sizes of templates, 134&#8201;bp and 1089&#8201;bp, were successfully sued by using sensible molar ratios of both templates and primers.  In addition, deletion and insertion were performed concurrently.</p><p>     The protein migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 43&#8201;kDa on SDS-PAGE; also, an 86&#8201;kDa bond was obvious while western blotting was performed.  All the dimer form was converted to monomer form by dissolving the protein in 8&#8201;M urea, and just one bond at 43&#8201;KD was observed on Western Blot   (data not shown).    These data confirmed that the doubled molecular mass size could be due to aggregation of truncated t-PA.</p><p>     Biological activity was tested with electrophoretic zymography analysis. Previous studies have shown that the main extracellular protease band secreted by the CHO was approximately 92 or 95&#8201;KDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].   This indicates that the extra higher size bonds are probably from CHO itself.  However, presence of an obvious band of almost 43&#8201;KDa and its drastic diminish after inhibition by antibody confirms that the proteolytic activity was exclusively due to t-PA and not other probably existing serine proteases.  As it is shown in  <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3">Section 3</xref>, (lane 5 of  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), significant decline of proteolytic zone in the presence of special t-PA antibody is apparent. The degree of inhibition by antibody is dependent upon the t-PA concentration, but is nevertheless dramatically reduced when compared to the equivalent concentration in samples without antibody  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. </p><p>     Both fibrin specifity and fibrin affinity are touted as desirable properties in PAs     [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].  The fibrin-specific agents are much more likely to bind to fibrin bound plasminogen as opposed to free plasminogen.  Therefore, the lack of systemic plasminemia limits systemic fibrinogenolysis, which is associated with bleeding complications    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Reteplase was initially thought to have desired fibrin-specifity    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], but in practice it was less fibrin specific than full-length form  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].   Subsequently, higher frequency of bleeding was reported by Reteplase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].    Previous studies showed that Reteplase has the in vitro fibrin binding equal to 30% of that of full-length form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].  The fibrin-binding experiment demonstrated that chimeric-truncated t-PA had 86% of fibrin-binding capacity of full-length form, Actylase, suggesting that our novel protein could be targeted to fibrin clot with GHRP.  However, considering controversies now besetting advantages of fibrin affinity, to what extent this increase of fibrin affinity is beneficial for drug is now under investigation in our group for further steps of research.  Nevertheless, as the chimeric protein has yet less fibrin affinity than full-length one, it can be said that this degree of increase is not   at least pernicious.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>This paper was supported by a grant from the Pasteur Institute of Iran.</p></ack><ref-list><ref
