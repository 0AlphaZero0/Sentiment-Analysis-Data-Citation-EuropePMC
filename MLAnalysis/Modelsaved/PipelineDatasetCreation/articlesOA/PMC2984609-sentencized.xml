<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A number of recent publications emphasize that the approach did not entirely meet the expectations: Although GWAS provided important insights in genetics of particular disorders [1], it failed to detect a major portion of genetic influence on traits of interest [1-5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In most cases genetic variants found in GWAS cannot explain heritability estimates calculated for such traits in the pre-genomic era. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An important conclusion emerged from many such studies was that the complex traits are typically affected by a large number of common alleles, each of little predictive value, with small or statistically non-significant effect [1-5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recent suggestion to focus on the search for rare alleles with significant phenotypic effects in small population subgroups [6] requires new SNP data with minor allele frequencies (MAF) less than 1%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(Traditional GWAS deal will MAF &gt;1%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>More results could be obtained by sequencing selected areas of the genome [7,8] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this paper we show that the use of extended approach to GWAS allows for addressing the issues of lost genetic influence on complex traits by analysing regularities of joint action of many small-effect-low-significance alleles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Using longevity trait as an example we show that the results of our analyses bring important insights into mechanisms of genetic regulation of this trait. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In this approach we hypothesized that value of the complex trait (life span) depends on number of the small-effect “longevity” alleles, contained in individual genomes and tested this hypothesis using genome wide data on 550K SNPs from the original cohort of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The results show that the joint influence of small-effect alleles on life span is both significant and substantial and can be described as the “genetic dose - phenotypic response” relationship. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The existence of such relationship brings a new perspective to GWAS of complex traits and can at least partly justify sizable efforts and resources that have recently been invested in GWAS. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>We evaluated associations between 550,000 SNPs and life spans in 1,173 genotyped participants of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) original cohort. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>After performing a standard quality control procedure [9], (call rate ≥80%; MAF&gt;1%; HWE &gt; 10-7) for each SNPs we evaluated parameters of the linear regression model by considering individuals' life span as function of SNP genotype (categorical variables) using code “0” for homozygote with respect to the major allele; “1” for heterozygote; and 2 for homozygote with respect to the minor allele. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The SAS program SAS PROC REG (© SAS Institute, Inc.) has been used for this purpose. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The SNPs for which the estimate of the slope parameter was positive and had p≤10-6 were selected as “longevity” SNPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Note that this threshold is larger than 10-7 used in traditional GWAS with correction for multiple comparisons in data samples of similar size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>This procedure resulted in selection of 169 “longevity” SNPs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>To evaluate joint effect of genetic variants on life span, we calculated the number of longevity SNPs (from selected set of 169 SNPs) contained in the genome of each individual in the study and performed regression analyses considering lifespan as a linear function of the number of longevity SNPs contained in person's genome. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>This estimate seems to be reasonable if one takes into account that narrow sense heritability in life span is estimated at the level about 25% [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The estimated relationship between life span and the number of longevity SNPs shown in Figure 1 is the main result of this paper. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>It shows that in studies of genetic determinants of longevity the joint influence of many small-effect genetic variants may be substantial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>We suggest that similar “genetic dose” - “phenotypic response” relationship is likely to characterize genetic influence on many other complex traits. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The two aspects of performed analyses require additional testing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The first is the use of data on all genotyped individuals from the original FHS cohort, which include first degree relatives from 618 families. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The second is the fact that the two procedures: (i) selection of longevity SNPs and (ii) testing the presence of their joint influence on life span used data on the same individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>To check whether the exclusion of relatives from the list of study subjects modifies the results of analyses, we randomly selected 618 individuals, one from each family, identified a set of “longevity” SNPs using the procedure described above, and estimated dependence of life span on the number of selected longevity SNPs in these individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>To diminish the effect of sampling, we repeated this procedure 10 times. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>In each such analysis, the estimates of slope and intercept were positive and highly statistically significant with p≤10-19. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the conclusion about joint influence of longevity SNPs on life span does not depend on the presence or absence of relatives among the study subjects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>To take into account variants selected in each experiment, we unified sets of longevity SNPs selected in each of 10 experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>This procedure resulted in the set with 70 genetic variants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Note that the reduction in the number of study subjects (because of excluding genetically dependent individuals) increases the chances of selecting false positive variants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>To diminish the number of such variants, we intersected the set of 70 SNPs with the set of 169 SNPs, selected earlier using data on the entire FHS cohort. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>This procedure resulted in 39 longevity SNPs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>This set of 39 SNPs was then used in regression analyses where life span was considered as a linear function of the number of longevity SNPs contained in person's genome. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Since cell-cell adhesion proteins play crucial role in cell sensitivity to contact inhibition and because insensitivity to contact inhibition is critical for cancer development, especially for manifestation of invasion and metastasis, we speculate that this enrichment might potentially be linked to a higher resistance to cancer among long-living individuals. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>If the procedures, described above, do select longevity variants, and if the detected pattern of joint influence of such variants on life span is a property of a biological mechanism, then genetic variants selected using data on one population should be able to predict life spans in other genetically independent population of individuals who experienced similar environmental and living conditions. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>To reduce the sampling effect, the procedure of random division of the 618 families into two groups with subsequent selection of longevity variants and estimating regression coefficients in the “genetic dose - phenotypic response” relationship was repeated 10 times. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>These analyses show that developed approach has predictive power, and that joint influence of longevity SNPs on life span can be replicated in populations of genetically independent individuals. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Some recent studies provide arguments that the Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons, traditionally used in GWAS, are too rigid and should be relaxed [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>The results of this study support this view: many genetic variants involved in the “genetic dose - phenotypic response” relationship would not be selected by traditional GWAS methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>We found that relaxing the procedure for selecting longevity alleles (the use of selection threshold p≤10-6 instead of p≤10-7) increases the number of selected longevity SNPs having small effects and improve the fit of the life span data by the “number of longevity SNPs - life span” curve. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>This suggests that taking effect size of alleles into account may help reveal additional features of genetic influence on complex traits. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>The possibility of using a straight line for approximating “the number of longevity SNPs -- life span” relationship indicates the presence of substantial additive component of the genetic contribution to longevity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>It is relevant to note that additive genetic effects were the subject of numerous studies in quantitative genetics of the pre-genomic era. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Many genetic calculations (e.g., estimates of narrow sense heritability of complex traits) were based on the assumption about the additive nature of genetic component of phenotypic variation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>The availability of genome-wide data nowadays allows for evaluating such effects directly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Moreover, evaluating the non-additive (non-linear) joint genetic influence (epistasis) becomes also possible with the use of more sophisticated patterns of the “dose - response” relationship. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>While the replication of findings became a standard requirement in GWAS, the results of our analyses suggest that in studying joint effect of many alleles this practice needs to be revised. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Our analyses show that one should not expect that exactly the same sets of genetic variants will contribute to “genetic dose - phenotypic response” relationship evaluated using data on other population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>One reason for this may be gene-environment interaction: difference in populations' exposure to external conditions is likely to produce difference in genetic regulation of the trait in these populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Identification of genetic variants “sensitive” to specific external signals will open new opportunities for studying the role of genetic and non-genetic factors in complex traits. </plain></SENT>
