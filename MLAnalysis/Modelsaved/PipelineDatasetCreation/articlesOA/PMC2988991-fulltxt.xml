Many of these plants are excellent sources for polyphenols that are potent antioxidant compounds which exhibit a wide range of biological effects as consequences of their antioxidant properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. <italic>Tamarindus indica L.</italic> (<italic>T. indica</italic>) or locally known as asam jawa belongs to the family Leguminosae and grows naturally in many tropical and subtropical regions. Various parts of the plants are used as food components and in herbal medicine. The <italic>T. indica</italic> fruits have irregular curved pods. When ripe, the pods are filled with brown or reddish-brown pulp that coats the seeds. The pulp has a sweet/sour taste and is widely used as flavouring in cooking. There are wide differences in fruit size and flavour in seedling trees. The Indian types have longer pods with 6&#8211;12 seeds, while the West Indian types have shorter pods, containing only 3&#8211;6 seeds. The pulp is believed to be rich in vitamins and minerals such as niacin and calcium, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The <italic>T. indica</italic> fruit pulp is commonly used in traditional medicine including as a digestive, laxative, expectorant and an antipyretic agent. Biochemical analysis in support of the beneficial effects of the <italic>T. indica</italic> fruit pulp extracts includes a study by Martinello et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] who showed that the <italic>T. indica</italic> fruit extracts were able to decrease the levels of serum cholesterol and triglycerides in hypercholesterolaemic hamsters. The <italic>T. indica</italic> fruit pulps have also been shown to contain phenolic antioxidants such as epicatechins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] that were able to inhibit low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Chan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] had shown that epicatechins from jasmine green tea were able to reduce serum levels of TG, and cholesterol in hamsters fed a high-fat diet, but the hypolipidaemic effects were not through the inhibition of liver HMGCoA reductase or intestinal ACAT. They further postulated that the observed hypolipidaemic effects of epicatechins were probably associated with the inhibition of absorption of dietary fat, cholesterol or reabsorption of bile acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Another group of researchers, Landi Librandi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], reported that the fruit pulp extract was able to modulate the activity of the complement system when tested both in vitro and in vivo. Scientific data based on molecular analysis to support the beneficial effects of the pulp extracts are, however, still lacking. Therefore, in this study, we decided to analyse the global gene expression in response to low concentration of the fruit pulp extracts of <italic>T. indica</italic> in HepG2 cell line, a widely used in vitro model for human liver hepatocytes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Preparation of <italic>T. indica</italic> fruit pulp extracts</title><p>Whole, ripe <italic>T. indica</italic> fruits were collected from Kedah in the northern region of Malaysia. The voucher specimen of the sample with an identification number, KLU 45976, was deposited in the Rimba Ilmu Herbarium, the University of Malaya. The fruit pulp extracts were prepared as previously described by Razali et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Briefly, the fruit pulp was separated from the seeds, air-dried and then powdered. The powdered <italic>T. indica</italic> fruit pulp (2.5&#160;g) was then placed in a conical flask and soaked in 50&#160;ml methanol at room temperature for 24&#160;h. The resulting extracts were then filtered, roto-evaporated and redissolved in 10% DMSO. The samples were kept at &#8722;20&#176;C until further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Cell culture</title><p>The human hepatoma cell line HepG2 (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) was grown in Dulbecco&#8217;s modified Eagle&#8217;s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (Flowlab, Australia), 1% penicillin (Flowlab, Australia) and 1% streptomycin (Flowlab, Australia). Cells were maintained in humidified air with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37&#176;C.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Cell viability assay</title><p>A cell viability assay was carried out using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) as described by Mosmann [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], with minor modifications. Briefly, HepG2 cells at a density of 5,000 cells per well were seeded in a 96-well ELISA microplate. The cells were incubated at 37&#176;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 24&#160;h. After 24&#160;h, the pulp extracts, at various concentrations (100&#8211;9,000&#160;&#956;g/ml), were added into the wells. The cells were left to grow in the incubator for 48&#160;h. After 48&#160;h, MTT reagent (Merck) was added, and the mixture was further incubated for 4&#160;h. Next, the mixture in each well was removed, and formazan crystals formed were dissolved in 10&#160;&#956;l of 75% isopropanol. Spectrophotometric measurement of the mixture was performed in a microplate reader (Bio-Rad) at wavelengths of 570 and 620&#160;nm. A  log plot of cell viability (%) against the concentrations of plant extracts were constructed. From the plot, a near non-toxic concentration of the extracts was chosen to study the modifications of gene expression patterns in HepG2 cells in response to treatment with methanol extracts of the <italic>T. indica</italic> fruit pulp. The concentration of the methanol extracts of the <italic>T. indica</italic> fruit pulp that reduced cell viability by 50% (IC<sub>50</sub>) was also calculated from the plot.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Treatment of HepG2 cells with methanol extracts of <italic>T. indica</italic> fruit pulp</title><p>Confluent HepG2 cells maintained in DMEM were treated with methanol extracts at 300&#160;&#956;g/ml, a non-toxic concentration determined from the MTT assay. The cells were then incubated at 37&#176;C for 24&#160;h. As a control, cells were incubated in the absence of the methanol extracts. After 24&#160;h, cells were trypsinized and then precipitated by centrifugation at 1,300&#160;rpm for 5&#160;min. Cells were washed with PBS twice before total cellular RNA (tcRNA) was extracted from the cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Total cellular RNA preparation from the control and treated HepG2 cells</title><p>tcRNA from both untreated (control) and <italic>T. indica</italic>-treated HepG2 cells was isolated and then purified using RNAEasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. Briefly, the cells were lysed with guanidine thiocyanate-containing buffer (RLT buffer) followed by homogenization with a QIAshredder. Ethanol (75%) was then added to the mixture, and the mixture was then loaded into RNA spin columns. Following this, the columns were washed with RW1 and RPE buffers that were supplied by the manufacturer. After washing with a reduced volume of buffer RW1, the RNA was treated with DNase I using RNase-free DNase Set (Qiagen) while bound to the RNAEasy membrane. The DNase I was removed by a second wash with buffer RW1. Then, washing with buffer RPE and elution of RNA were then performed. In the final step, the tcRNA was eluted using RNase-free water into collection tubes. The quality of the tcRNA was estimated by measuring the absorbance ratio of 260&#8211;280&#160;nm. Values above 1.8 indicate that the tcRNA is of good quality. The integrity of the tcRNA was also analysed using denaturing gel electrophoresis. The integrity of the tcRNA is indicated by the presence of two distinct bands corresponding to the ribosomal 28S and 18S subunits, with the intensity of the larger 28S band approximately twice than that of the smaller 18S band.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Preparation of the sense strand DNA for microarray gene expression analysis</title><p>Gene expression analysis was performed on the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 S.T (sense target) arrays according to the conventional Affymetrix eukaryotic RNA labelling protocol (Affymetrix). Briefly, the tcRNA (100&#160;ng) isolated from the untreated (control) and the <italic>T. indica</italic>-treated HepG2 cells was first converted to single-stranded sense strand DNA (cDNA) in two cycles using the whole transcript (WT) cDNA synthesis, amplification kit and sample clean-up module. In the first cycle, the tcRNA was converted to double-stranded cDNA using random hexamers tagged with a T7 promoter sequence. Each strand of the double-stranded cDNA was then used as a template to synthesize antisense RNA (cRNA). In the second cycle, the cRNA was reversed transcribed into sense strand DNA in the presence of random hexamers (3&#160;&#956;g/ml) and dNTPs mix containing dUTP (10&#160;mM).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Sense strand DNA labelling and hybridization to the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 S.T arrays</title><p>The sense strand DNA was cleaned up using the sample clean-up kit and then cleaved into small fragments using a mixture of UDP and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 or APE1. The fragmented sense strand DNA was then end-labelled through a terminal transferase reaction that incorporates biotinylated dideoxynucleotides using the WT terminal labelling kit. The fragmented, biotinylated sense strand DNA (5.5&#160;&#956;g) was then hybridized to the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 S.T array at 45&#176;C for 16&#160;h in a hybridization Oven 640. After hybridization, the arrays were stained and then washed in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450 under standard conditions. The stained arrays were then scanned at 532&#160;nm using an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000, and CEL files for each array were generated using the Affymetrix GeneChip<sup>&#174;</sup> Operating Software (GCOS).

The mixture was then incubated at 42&#176;C for 50&#160;min followed by inactivation at 70&#176;C for 15&#160;min. The cDNA was then used as templates for PCR amplification of selected up-regulated and down-regulated genes using primer pairs listed in Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. A PCR mixture containing cDNA (2000&#160;ng), PCR buffer (1 X), 5&#8242; and 3&#8242; primers for GADPH and the selected genes of interest (1&#160;&#956;M), dNTPs (10&#160;mM), DMSO (10%&#160;v/v) and <italic>Taq</italic> DNA polymerase (5 units) were prepared to a final volume of 50&#160;&#956;l with sterile distilled water (Sigma).

In this study, the methanol extracts of the <italic>T. indica</italic> fruit pulp were shown to have an IC<sub>50</sub> of 4.57&#160;mg/ml. For the microarray analysis, we decided to use a low concentration of 300&#160;&#956;g/ml where cell viability was still above 90%. We decided to use a low concentration of the extracts instead of the usual IC<sub>50</sub> concentration, because it is known that dietary antioxidants are present in circulation in small amount because they are either poorly absorbed from the intestine or once absorbed they are quickly metabolized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. At this low concentration, we found that the methanol extracts of the <italic>T. indica</italic> fruit pulp were able to significantly regulate a total of 1501 genes (<italic>P</italic>&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05) with a fold change of at least 1.5.</p><p>Amongst the significantly up-regulated genes were those that code for the metallothioneins (MTs), <italic>MT1M</italic>, <italic>MT1F</italic>, <italic>MT1X</italic> and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) namely <italic>GSTA1</italic>, <italic>GSTA2</italic> and <italic>GSTO2</italic>. MTs and GSTs have protective roles over heavy metals such as cadmium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and oxidative DNA, protein and lipid damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In this study, only genes encoding MT-1 but not the other two isoforms, MT-2 and MT-3, were induced by low concentration of the <italic>T. indica</italic> fruit pulp extracts. In addition, GSTs are involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics such as toxins and carcinogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and regulate cellular stress response to the formation of reactive oxygen species through the JNK-associated apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Omega class GSTs have dehydroascorbate reductase and thioltransferase activities and also catalyse the reduction of monomethylarsonate, an intermediate in the pathway of arsenic biotransformation. Other diverse actions of human GSTO1-1 include modulation of ryanodine receptors and interaction with cytokine release inhibitory drugs. Glutathione S-transferase omega 1 and omega 2 (GSTO1 and GSTO2) catalyse monomethyl arsenate reduction during arsenic biotransformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>Diseases of the cardiovascular system are the most common cause of death in developed countries. It has been established that hyperlipidaemia including high cholesterol levels in blood represents a major risk factor for the premature development of atherosclerosis and its cardiovascular complications. Presently, statin, which is an inhibitor of HMGCoA reductase, is widely used to decrease plasma LDL and is able to reduce cardiovascular events by 20&#8211;40% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Patients who cannot tolerate or respond poorly to statin are given other hypolipidaemic therapies such as fibrates and nicotinic acid. Scientists are now tapping into the rich biodiversity of the world to look for functional foods that can reduce cholesterol and lipid levels and are as potent, well-tolerated, cheaper, safer alternatives to the currently marketed drugs.</p><p>The extracts of the <italic>T. indica</italic> fruit pulp have the potential to be used as lipid-lowering agents. An earlier study by Martinello et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] showed that the extracts of the <italic>T. indica</italic> fruit pulp were able to decrease the levels of serum cholesterol and triglycerides in hypercholesterolaemic hamsters. The molecular mechanism of the lipid-lowering activity of the fruit extracts is, however, still unknown. Our microarray analysis did not detect changes in the expression of the HMGCoA reductase gene, suggesting that the lipid-lowering activity is not through the inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis. Our microarray data showed that amongst others, three genes that critically regulate lipid metabolism were differentially expressed: <italic>APOA4</italic>, <italic>APOA5</italic>, <italic>ABCG5</italic> and <italic>MTTP.</italic></p><p>Apoliporotein A-V (ApoA-V) that is coded by <italic>APOA5</italic> gene plays a vital role in the regulation of TG metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. ApoA-V is thought to reduce TG levels by activating lipoprotein lipase (LPL), the enzyme that is responsible in catabolizing TG-rich lipoproteins, chylomicrons and VLDL, hence improving the clearance of these lipoproteins from blood. Mutations in the <italic>APOA5</italic> gene have been shown to cause hypertriglyceridaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In our study, we found that in the methanol extract-treated HepG2 cells, <italic>APOA5</italic> gene was up-regulated by 1.9-fold. This could be contributed by procyanidin, a phenolic compound found in grape seed that was able to lower TG levels in rats, up-regulate <italic>apoA5</italic> gene expression in mouse liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and was shown to also be present in the <italic>T. indica</italic> fruit pulp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p><italic>APOA4</italic> gene codes for the apolipoprotein A-IV (ApoA-IV) which is like cholecystokinin (CCK), a known gastrointestinal satiety signal proteins whose synthesis and secretion from the gut are stimulated by fat absorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Apart from the intestine, apoA-IV is also synthesized by the hypothalamus, and the gene has also been shown to be expressed in the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In human hepatoma HepG2 cells, <italic>APOA4</italic> mRNA was up-regulated when cells were treated with liver X receptors (LXR) agonists. LXRs are oxysterol receptors that can mediate cholesterol homeostasis. Treatment of C57B6 mice with a synthetic LXR agonist, T0901317, resulted in significant increases in plasma apoA-IV that was associated with an increase in high-density lipoprotein. Examination of both intestinal and liver apo A-IV mRNA revealed specific increases in liver mRNA only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. ApoA-IV had also been shown to be a potent endogenous antioxidant that inhibits lipid peroxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>In this study, the gene encoding an ATP-binding cassette sterol transporter, ABCG5, was also up-regulated by the methanol extracts of the <italic>T. indica</italic> fruit pulp. ABCG5 has been shown to be regulated in the liver and intestine by the LXRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. An overexpression of <italic>ABCG5</italic> was found to promote cholesterol excretion through bile and reduce absorption of dietary cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In addition, mutations in the <italic>ABCG5</italic> gene were implicated in sitosterolaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], characterized by elevated plasma levels of plant sterols and cholesterol due to increased absorption and decreased excretion of the neutral sterols into biles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The increased circulating levels of these sterols are associated with the deposition of cholesterol in the skin and tendons (xanthomas), and in the walls of the coronary arteries, resulting in premature coronary atherosclerosis.</p><p>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR&#945;) is a key regulator in hepatic lipid metabolism, and apoA-IV had been identified as a potential therapeutic target for dyslipidaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Oral administration of PPAR&#945; agonist KRP-101 in dogs caused a decrease in serum TG accompanied by an increase in serum apoA-IV levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In addition, administration of a potent and selective PPAR&#945; agonist, LY570977 <sc>l</sc>-lysine decreased TG and increased circulating apoA-V levels in cynomolgus monkeys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Functional PPAR-binding element in the promoter of the human <italic>APOA5</italic> gene was found in human, which is somewhat degenerate and non-functional in the corresponding mouse <italic>Apoa5</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. <italic>APOA5</italic> resides on the <italic>APOAI/CIII/AIV</italic> gene cluster on human 11q23 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Gene coding for the apolipoprotein C-III which is a marker of TG-rich lipoproteins was up-regulated in this study but at a lower fold change compared to that of the <italic>APOA5</italic> with <italic>APOA5</italic>/<italic>APOC3</italic> ratio of 1.3.</p><p>In our study, we found that the crude extracts from the <italic>T. indica</italic> fruit pulp up-regulated the expression of genes that code for apoA-IV, apo A-V and ABCG5. Since the methanol extracts up-regulated three genes, we postulated that there are components in the crude extracts that may act as PPARalpha agonist which can regulate TG and HDL levels and may eventually be able to be used as a lipid-lowering agent. It is postulated that there may be components in the extracts that could also regulate cholesterol homeostasis by increasing the expression of the ABCG5 gene that could promote biliary cholesterol secretion and reduce dietary cholesterol absorption which could potentially be used to reduce TG levels in blood and help to prevent coronary heart disease.</p><p>We also found that the crude extract down-regulated the expression of the <italic>MTTP</italic> gene that codes for microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP). MTTP is required for the assembly and secretion of TG-rich lipoproteins from both enterocytes and hepatocytes. MTTP inhibitor, JTT-130, had been shown to lower plasma lipid mainly plasma TG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The inhibition of <italic>MTTP</italic> gene expression, especially in the intestine, may subsequently lead to reduction in the levels of cholesterol in blood.</p><p>Other genes that were down-regulated in response to the extracts of the <italic>T. indica</italic> pulp were <italic>PDE3A</italic>, <italic>PTTG1</italic> and <italic>CYP1A1</italic>. PDE3 is one of the phosphodiesterases (PDEs) that regulate intracellular concentrations of second messengers, cAMP and cGMP, by catalysing the hydrolysis of their 3&#8242;-5&#8242;-phosphodiester bond [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The PDE3 family comprises 2 genes, the <italic>PDE3A</italic> and <italic>PDE3B</italic>. The PDE3A has higher affinity towards cAMP than cGMP and is directly inhibited by cGMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Known inhibitors of the PDE3 include cilostamide and milrinone, but these inhibitors do not differentiate between PDE3A and PDE3B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The crude extracts of the <italic>T. indica</italic> fruit pulp suppressed the expression of only the <italic>PDE3A</italic>, by 5.1-fold, suggesting that the extracts contain bioactive compound(s) that is (are) selective inhibitor(s) of <italic>PDE3A</italic>.</p><p>PTTG1 is an oncogene involved in cell cycle regulation and sister chromatid separation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. High levels of PTTG1 expression have been reported in various tumours including thyroid, pituitary, lung, colon, oesophagus, ovary and breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Studies had shown that nude mice developed cancer when subcutaneously injected with PTTG1-transfected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. CYP1A1 is one of the most important detoxification enzymes, but it is also capable of generating carcinogenic intermediate metabolites from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Resveratrol, an antioxidant widely found in fruits such as grapes, was found to inhibit the transcription of <italic>CYP1A1</italic> in the HepG2 cells supposedly by preventing the activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Our microarray results showed that the crude extracts of the <italic>T. indica</italic> fruit pulp have the potential application as a chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of cancer through the inhibition of the transcription of <italic>CYP1A1</italic> and <italic>PTTG1</italic> genes. In addition, a set of genes that are involved in regulating the cell cycle checkpoints namely the cyclins, <italic>CCNG1</italic>, <italic>CCNG2</italic>, <italic>CCNA2</italic>, <italic>CCNB1</italic>, <italic>CCNB2</italic> and <italic>CDC2</italic> were also significantly down-regulated.</p><p>In conclusion, low concentration of <italic>T. indica</italic> fruit pulp extracts was able to significantly regulate a total of 1501 genes. Amongst the up-regulated genes were those that code for the metallothioneins and glutathione S-transferases which are well known for their stress response activities. The extracts may act as hypolipidaemic agents by regulating the expression of <italic>APOA4</italic>, <italic>APOA5</italic>, <italic>ABCG5</italic> and <italic>MTTP</italic> genes. The fruit pulp extracts also have anti-cancer potential by regulating genes involved in the cell cycle checkpoints.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was funded by the following research grants: EScience Fund (12-03-02-2061) from the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation Malaysia (MOSTI), FRGS (FP004/2003C) from the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia (MOHE), Postgraduate Research Fund (PS166/2008C) and Tutorship from the University of Malaya.
