</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plants and herbs have been used for years traditionally as food and for various medicinal purposes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Many of these plants are excellent sources for polyphenols that are potent antioxidant compounds which exhibit a wide range of biological effects as consequences of their antioxidant properties [7, 21]. Tamarindus indica L. (T. indica) or locally known as asam jawa belongs to the family Leguminosae and grows naturally in many tropical and subtropical regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Various parts of the plants are used as food components and in herbal medicine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The T. indica fruits have irregular curved pods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When ripe, the pods are filled with brown or reddish-brown pulp that coats the seeds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The pulp has a sweet/sour taste and is widely used as flavouring in cooking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There are wide differences in fruit size and flavour in seedling trees. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The Indian types have longer pods with 6–12 seeds, while the West Indian types have shorter pods, containing only 3–6 seeds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The pulp is believed to be rich in vitamins and minerals such as niacin and calcium, respectively [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The T. indica fruit pulp is commonly used in traditional medicine including as a digestive, laxative, expectorant and an antipyretic agent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Biochemical analysis in support of the beneficial effects of the T. indica fruit pulp extracts includes a study by Martinello et al. [26] who showed that the T. indica fruit extracts were able to decrease the levels of serum cholesterol and triglycerides in hypercholesterolaemic hamsters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The T. indica fruit pulps have also been shown to contain phenolic antioxidants such as epicatechins [44] that were able to inhibit low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation in vitro [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Chan et al. [9] had shown that epicatechins from jasmine green tea were able to reduce serum levels of TG, and cholesterol in hamsters fed a high-fat diet, but the hypolipidaemic effects were not through the inhibition of liver HMGCoA reductase or intestinal ACAT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>They further postulated that the observed hypolipidaemic effects of epicatechins were probably associated with the inhibition of absorption of dietary fat, cholesterol or reabsorption of bile acids [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Another group of researchers, Landi Librandi et al. [22], reported that the fruit pulp extract was able to modulate the activity of the complement system when tested both in vitro and in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Scientific data based on molecular analysis to support the beneficial effects of the pulp extracts are, however, still lacking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in this study, we decided to analyse the global gene expression in response to low concentration of the fruit pulp extracts of T. indica in HepG2 cell line, a widely used in vitro model for human liver hepatocytes. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>We decided to use a low concentration of the extracts instead of the usual IC50 concentration, because it is known that dietary antioxidants are present in circulation in small amount because they are either poorly absorbed from the intestine or once absorbed they are quickly metabolized [18, 46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>At this low concentration, we found that the methanol extracts of the T. indica fruit pulp were able to significantly regulate a total of 1501 genes (P &lt; 0.05) with a fold change of at least 1.5. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Our microarray analysis did not detect changes in the expression of the HMGCoA reductase gene, suggesting that the lipid-lowering activity is not through the inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Our microarray data showed that amongst others, three genes that critically regulate lipid metabolism were differentially expressed: APOA4, APOA5, ABCG5 and MTTP. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Apoliporotein A-V (ApoA-V) that is coded by APOA5 gene plays a vital role in the regulation of TG metabolism [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>ApoA-V is thought to reduce TG levels by activating lipoprotein lipase (LPL), the enzyme that is responsible in catabolizing TG-rich lipoproteins, chylomicrons and VLDL, hence improving the clearance of these lipoproteins from blood. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>An overexpression of ABCG5 was found to promote cholesterol excretion through bile and reduce absorption of dietary cholesterol [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>In addition, mutations in the ABCG5 gene were implicated in sitosterolaemia [17, 19, 25], characterized by elevated plasma levels of plant sterols and cholesterol due to increased absorption and decreased excretion of the neutral sterols into biles [3, 4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>The increased circulating levels of these sterols are associated with the deposition of cholesterol in the skin and tendons (xanthomas), and in the walls of the coronary arteries, resulting in premature coronary atherosclerosis. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>It is postulated that there may be components in the extracts that could also regulate cholesterol homeostasis by increasing the expression of the ABCG5 gene that could promote biliary cholesterol secretion and reduce dietary cholesterol absorption which could potentially be used to reduce TG levels in blood and help to prevent coronary heart disease. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>We also found that the crude extract down-regulated the expression of the MTTP gene that codes for microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>The PDE3 family comprises 2 genes, the PDE3A and PDE3B. </plain></SENT>
