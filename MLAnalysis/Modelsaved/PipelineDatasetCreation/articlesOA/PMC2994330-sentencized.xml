<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Despite the great advances in understanding of lens structure and function, the relationships among cataract morphology, etiology, and pathologic mechanisms are still unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Congenital cataracts remain the leading cause of visual disability in children worldwide [1-4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In 2000, the major intrinsic protein (MIP, MP26, AQP0) was reported to be associated with autosomal dominant congenital cataract (ADCC) [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>To date, seven mutations in the MIP gene have been identified from seven unrelated human families; five missense mutations (T138R, E134G, R33C, R233K, and V107I) [5-8], one deletion mutation causing a frameshift that alters 41 of 45 subsequent amino acids and creates a premature stop codon (G213VfsX45) [9], and one splice-site mutation causing autosomal dominant congenital cataract (ADCC) with “snail-like” phenotype in a large Chinese family (our laboratory’s recently reported finding, c.607–1G&gt;A) [10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The effect of mutations that alter critical amino acids and generate premature stop codons can be predicted from triplet codon analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, it is difficult to predict the effects of changes in intronic sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The production of mature mRNA requires an accurate and efficient removal of introns from pre-mRNA by the spliceosome [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The regulation of alternative splicing usually relies on a choice from among candidate splice sites, either alternative 5′ or alternative 3′ sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Mutations can disrupt splicing by directly inactivating or creating an alternative splicing site, by activating a cryptic splice site or by interfering with splicing regulatory elements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Although the activation of cryptic splice sites has been reported as a mechanism in human disease, to the best of our knowledge currently there is no report of activation of cryptic splice site in the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR, sequences on the 3′ end of mRNA which are not translated into protein) [12]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>It is reported that mutations in acceptor splice sites can result in exon skipping or activation of cryptic sites, either upstream or downstream of authentic sites [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>In the present study, there was a mutation in the invariant AG dinucleotide of the last intron, so none of the existing canonical AG sites downstream are available at the 5′ border of following exon as an alternative acceptor splice site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>According to previous studies, it is advisable to identify possible splicing defects by analyzing the mRNA available from the individual patients [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we collected blood specimens and the cataracts from the proband during surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>However, we failed to extract MIP mRNA from the blood specimens or the cataract probably due to the lower mRNA expression levels in the mutant alleles (unpublished). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>To confirm the role of this mutation, we finally made use of a simple minigene splicing assay [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, we demonstrated that the acceptor splice-site mutation (c.607–1G&gt;A) resulted in activation of a cryptic splice site in the 3′ UTR of the MIP gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, cryptic acceptor splice site in the 3′ UTR has not been reported in human disease genes to date (summery in Table 1) [12,16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>According to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.umd.be/HSF/">Human Splicing Finder</ext-link> [19], the natural acceptor splice site is scored 96.46, while the cryptic acceptor splice site is scored 74.48. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, there is a consensus motif (TCTTTC) upstream of the acceptor splice site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Further study is required to determine whether there is a role for the TCTTTC motif in the aberrant splicing. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated that the AQP0 COOH-terminus is crucial for both lens development and transparency because of its interactions with calmodulin [20], the cytoskeletal proteins filensin and CP49 [21], and connexin 45.6 [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Cleavage of the intracellular COOH-terminus decreases water permeability [23] and enhances the adhesive properties of the extracellular surface of AQP0, indicating a conformational change in the molecule [24] such that AQP0-LHS may fail to form a functional channel. </plain></SENT>
