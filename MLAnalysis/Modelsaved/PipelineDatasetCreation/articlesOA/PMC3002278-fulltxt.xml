An extensive entomological survey was performed in 2009 to establish the presence and distribution of mosquito arboviruses in this region, with particular reference to flaviviruses.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>From May 6 to October 31, a total of 190,516 mosquitoes were sampled in georeferenced stations, grouped in 1,789 pools according date of collection, location, and species, and analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the presence of RNA belong to <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus. WNV was detected in 27 mosquito pools, producing sequences similar to those of birds and human strains obtained in 2008 outbreak, pointed out the probable virus overwintering. Isolation of WNV was achieved from one of these pools. Moreover 56 pools of mosquitoes tested positive for Usutu virus (USUV). Most PCR positive pools consisted of <italic>Culex pipiens</italic>, which also was the most analyzed mosquito species (81.4% of specimens); interestingly, USUV RNA was also found in two <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquito pools. Simultaneous circulation of WNV and USUV in the survey area was highlighted by occurrence of 8 mosquito WNV- and USUV-positive pools and by the overlaying of the viruses &#8220;hot spots&#8221;, obtained by kernel density estimation (KDE) analysis. Land use of sampled stations pointed out a higher proportion of WNV-positive <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> pool in rural environments respect the provenience of total sampled pool, while the USUV-positive pools were uniformly captured in the different environments.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Obtained data highlighting the possible role of <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> mosquito as the main vector for WNV and USUV in Northern Italy, and the possible involvement of <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquito in USUV cycle.

This hypothesis was confirmed by the high identity also observed between WNV-sequences obtained by mosquito pools and sequences obtained by birds in the same area and available in GenBank. These sequences were also very similar to those obtained the year before in mosquitoes, birds and human, suggesting the virus overwintering between 2008 and 2009. The high identity between sequences obtained and 2008 Israeli sequences suggest a common origin of WNV strains circulating in the two countries in last two years, but further data are necessary to support this observation.</p><p>Results of several studies imply a silent circulation of WNV in Europe <xref rid="pone.0014324-Buckley1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014324-Rizzoli1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, but the factors triggering WN clinical disease are largely unknown. The abundance of vectors and reservoirs and their distinctive characteristics, like vector competence, vector host preference and host viremia intensity, have a great influence on viral load in the environment; as well as the vector-host interactions, for instance the host availability for vector. Furthermore the interactions of these complex ecological factors are strongly influenced by environmental conditions, such as temperature and rainfall, making the WN outbreak occurrence almost unpredictable. In addition the regular introduction of new virus strains from Mediterranean Asia and Africa <xref rid="pone.0014324-Bakonyi2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014324-Hublek2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014324-Malkinson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> could be significant in the amplification of the viral cycle, as the high identity between the obtained WNV sequences and the 2008 Israeli sequences could suggest.</p><p>The USUV sequences published on GenBank and containing homologous part of obtained USUV sequences are scarce. Among them the USUV strains originating from Vienna and Budapest showed the highest nucleotide identity rates with the Italian viruses, implying that - following a single introduction of USUV to central Europe - the same USUV strain is now circulating in central Europe.</p><p>Twenty-four sequences obtained from positive flavivirus-PCR not referred to WNV or USUV, are due to the presence of RNA of two viruses, also detected during the 2007&#8211;2008 survey and probably resulting from the presence of mosquito-only flaviviruses <xref rid="pone.0014324-Calzolari1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Moreover two of these sequences are more similar to the arthropod-transmitted flavivirus, and could be a clue of other viruses that are still unknown. These sequence detections in pooled mosquitoes should be taken into consideration in differential diagnosis respect to other flaviviruses.</p><p>During 2009, WNV was detected in <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> pools only, confirming the evidence obtained in 2008 <xref rid="pone.0014324-Calzolari1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, and suggesting this species as the principle vector of WNV in the 2008/2009 outbreak in Northern Italy.

Further experimental studies are needed to confirm the vector competence and the role of the Tiger mosquito in the spread of this virus.

Furthermore, the KDE analysis produced a largely overlaying area of the two viruses &#8220;hot spots&#8221; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014324-g003">Figure 3</xref>), but this situation could be hidden in scarcely sampled areas.

The PCR detections showed a stronger and longer USUV circulation in mosquitoes with respect to WNV, as displayed by the higher number of USUV-positive pools detected and by the presence of USUV-positive pools two weeks earlier than WNV. Indeed the land use data highlighted differences between the ecology of the two viruses. While the USUV-positive pools were uniformly captured in different environments, the number of WNV-positive pools was significantly higher in rural areas, highlighting a greater circulation of this virus in this environment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0014324-t004">Table 4</xref>).
