<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An extensive entomological survey was performed in 2009 to establish the presence and distribution of mosquito arboviruses in this region, with particular reference to flaviviruses. </plain></SENT>
</text></SecTag></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Methodology/Principal Findings </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From May 6 to October 31, a total of 190,516 mosquitoes were sampled in georeferenced stations, grouped in 1,789 pools according date of collection, location, and species, and analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the presence of RNA belong to Flavivirus genus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>WNV was detected in 27 mosquito pools, producing sequences similar to those of birds and human strains obtained in 2008 outbreak, pointed out the probable virus overwintering. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Isolation of WNV was achieved from one of these pools. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover 56 pools of mosquitoes tested positive for Usutu virus (USUV). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Most PCR positive pools consisted of Culex pipiens, which also was the most analyzed mosquito species (81.4% of specimens); interestingly, USUV RNA was also found in two Aedes albopictus mosquito pools. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous circulation of WNV and USUV in the survey area was highlighted by occurrence of 8 mosquito WNV- and USUV-positive pools and by the overlaying of the viruses “hot spots”, obtained by kernel density estimation (KDE) analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Land use of sampled stations pointed out a higher proportion of WNV-positive Cx. pipiens pool in rural environments respect the provenience of total sampled pool, while the USUV-positive pools were uniformly captured in the different environments. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>West Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV) are mosquito-borne flaviviruses of the Japanese encephalitis antigenic complex [1]; these two viruses are also phylogenetically closely related, as shown by nucleotide sequence data [2], [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Even if USUV ecology is less known than the WNV one, the two viruses seem to show biological cycle similarities: the principal vectors of WNV and USUV are largely ornithophilic mosquitoes, mainly of the genus Culex, wild birds are principal reservoirs of WNV and they are suspected of being also of USUV, both viruses can be pathogenic for these animals [5], [6], [7], [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Besides, migratory birds are considered to play a key role in the diffusion of the two viruses in Europe from Africa [4], [9], [10], [11], where they were discovered [12], [13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>WNV can be transmitted occasionally by mosquitoes to vertebrates other than birds; these are considered dead-end host or seem to have only a minor role in the environmental maintenance of the virus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>USUV was rarely isolated from mammals; only reported isolations were from Praomys rat and from man [7], [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>While the WNV risks for human health is well recognized, medical importance of USUV is not fully understood, but in summer 2009 USUV-related illness were reported in two immunecompromised patients in Emilia-Romagna region [14], [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Usutu virus was detected in serum of two organ donors tested in a retrospective WNV screening performed in Italy in 2009 [16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The first detection of USUV in Europe dates back to 2001 in Vienna [9], where the virus caused the death of hundreds of wild birds; subsequent virological and serological surveys pointed out the presence of USUV in different European countries, including Czechland and Poland [10], Spain [17], England [18], Hungary [19], Switzerland [20] and Northern Italy [21], [22], [23]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>WNV is widely distributed through Africa, Asia, Europe, and Australia, and it is also present in America, since 1999. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In Europe, epidemics with tens to hundreds of human cases have been observed in southern Russia, south France, Spain, Romania and Hungary since the 1960s [10], [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In Italy an equine outbreak of WNV, without human clinical reported cases, occurred in 1998 in “Padule del Fucecchio”, a wetland area in the Toscana region [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Ten years later, in 2008, WNV re-circulated in three different Regions of Northern Italy (Emilia-Romagna, Veneto and Lombardia), causing illness in horses [26] and also 9 human cases of neuroinvasive disease [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The epidemic resumed in 2009 affecting a wider area and causing 16 neuroinvasive human disease cases since the end of August [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Moreover the evidence of seroconversion due to WNV in sentinel chickens obtained in Italy [21] and in United Kingdom [18], without contemporaneous clinical disease in animals or men, implies a silent circulation of this virus. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Detections of different human diseases due to mosquito-borne viruses in Emilia-Romagna in recent years (chikungunya virus in 2007, WNV in 2008 and USUV in 2009) strongly suggested the need for an investigation to determine the presence and geographic distribution of arboviruses in this region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, a mosquito based survey was started in late summer 2007; this plan was implemented to cover the whole season in 2008, sampling and analyzing 47,453 specimens belonging to nine mosquito species from Emilia-Romagna [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The survey continued in 2009, detecting the presence of USUV besides that of WNV in tested mosquitoes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>In this work, the spread of these two viruses in the survey area is described and their possible interactions investigated. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Both WNV and USUV biomolecular data showed a high homology between detected sequences and suggested that a single strain of both WNV and USUV circulated in 2009 in the surveyed area. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>The high identity between sequences obtained and 2008 Israeli sequences suggest a common origin of WNV strains circulating in the two countries in last two years, but further data are necessary to support this observation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Results of several studies imply a silent circulation of WNV in Europe [18], [21], but the factors triggering WN clinical disease are largely unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>The abundance of vectors and reservoirs and their distinctive characteristics, like vector competence, vector host preference and host viremia intensity, have a great influence on viral load in the environment; as well as the vector-host interactions, for instance the host availability for vector. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Furthermore the interactions of these complex ecological factors are strongly influenced by environmental conditions, such as temperature and rainfall, making the WN outbreak occurrence almost unpredictable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>In addition the regular introduction of new virus strains from Mediterranean Asia and Africa [4], [10], [11] could be significant in the amplification of the viral cycle, as the high identity between the obtained WNV sequences and the 2008 Israeli sequences could suggest. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>The USUV sequences published on GenBank and containing homologous part of obtained USUV sequences are scarce. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Among them the USUV strains originating from Vienna and Budapest showed the highest nucleotide identity rates with the Italian viruses, implying that - following a single introduction of USUV to central Europe - the same USUV strain is now circulating in central Europe. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four sequences obtained from positive flavivirus-PCR not referred to WNV or USUV, are due to the presence of RNA of two viruses, also detected during the 2007–2008 survey and probably resulting from the presence of mosquito-only flaviviruses [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Moreover two of these sequences are more similar to the arthropod-transmitted flavivirus, and could be a clue of other viruses that are still unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>These sequence detections in pooled mosquitoes should be taken into consideration in differential diagnosis respect to other flaviviruses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>During 2009, WNV was detected in Cx. pipiens pools only, confirming the evidence obtained in 2008 [28], and suggesting this species as the principle vector of WNV in the 2008/2009 outbreak in Northern Italy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>WNV wasn't found in other mosquito species abundantly sampled, like Ae. vexans and Ae. caspius, which leads us to hypothesize the poor involvement of these mosquito species in the virus circulation in Emilia-Romagna. Cx. modestus mosquito, which is consider a highly competent species for WNV [10], [31], [32], is scarce in the Po plain, and sampled specimens tested negative for WNV, not showing any evidence of involvement of this species in the epidemic. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>Further experimental studies are needed to confirm the vector competence and the role of the Tiger mosquito in the spread of this virus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>If this hypothesis will be proved the epidemicity of USUV should be reconsidered, taking into account the uninterrupted spread of Tiger mosquito in the world and the abundance of this invasive species in man-made environments, moreover the health risk connected to the presence of this exotic mosquito will be reconfirmed [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this finding could support the ability of Ae. albopictus mosquito to serve as a bridge vector, capable of mediating the spillover of a virus from rural-cycle to urban-cycle, role already suggested for this species in regard to other viruses, including WNV [34], [35]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>The highest number of mosquitoes analyzed was sampled in regularly working fixed stations (Table 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>The use of extraordinary traps in proximity of reported WND horse cases allowed the capture of 8 WNV-positive pools, confirming the persistence of virus up to 3 weeks in area surrounding horse clinical cases, probably due to the persist of ecological conditions favorable to viral circulation in the environment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>The simultaneous circulation of USUV and WNV in Emilia-Romagna was demonstrated by the presence of positive mosquito pools in the same area and in the same period and also by the presence of mosquito positive pools for both viruses. </plain></SENT>
