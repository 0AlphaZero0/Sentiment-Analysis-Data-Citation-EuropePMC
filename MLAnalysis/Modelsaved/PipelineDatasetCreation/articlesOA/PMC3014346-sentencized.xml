</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Venous malformations are mainly of sporadic origin, but a small proportion, including glomuvenous malformations (OMIM #138000) and cutaneomucosal venous malformations (VMCMs; OMIM #600195), are inherited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>VMCMs present as bluish patches mainly at the mucosa, and are caused by dilation of blood vessels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VMCMs have been genetically linked to endothelial-specific receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (TIE2; also known as TEK): several different mutations in this gene have been identified in VMCM patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In line with the proposed roles of TIE2 in vascular remodeling and maintenance of mammalian vessel integrity, VMCM patients have a relative lack of mural cells in affected regions of the endothelium, and some VMCM patients have ventricular septal defects. Tie-2−/−mice die during embryogenesis mainly owing to heart defects, providing clues about the role of TIE2 in the pathology of VMCM in humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the precise functions of TIE2 in vascular stability and development are still not fully understood. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this study, the authors generate a zebrafish tie-2 loss-of-function mutant and show that, in contrast to the phenotype of Tie-2−/− mice, tie-2 mutant zebrafish are viable and show no defects in embryonic angiogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, morpholino-mediated knockdown of Tie-1 function in tie-2 zebrafish mutants shows that combined loss of Tie-1 and Tie-2 function results in defects of myocardial-endocardial contact. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Given that a role has been proposed for Tie-2 in vascular permeability, the authors also challenge vessel stability in tie-2 mutants by using statins, which have been shown to induce hemorrhages in specific vascular regions of the zebrafish embryo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, tie-2 mutants are resistant to statin-induced bleeding, and further experiments indicate that this effect depends on VE cadherin, an important intercellular junction protein. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This work introduces an additional vertebrate model in which to study the function of Tie-2 in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Because Tie-1 and Tie-2 have redundant roles in cardiac development in zebrafish, this model will allow the study of Tie-2 function in vivo without the complication of cardiac defects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Tie-2 is generally considered to be a vascular stabilizing factor, because it recruits support cells to the endothelium; however, the effect of statins in tie-2 mutants observed in this study suggest that the function of Tie-2 and/or its ligands might be more context-dependent than previously appreciated. </plain></SENT>
