</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The liver is one of the important organs in our bodies, playing a vital role in glucose homeostasis, the synthesis of bile acids for the metabolism of cholesterol, and the secretion of proteins to aid clotting [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the liver is primarily responsible for the detoxification of foreign substances, including a variety of environmental toxicants, alcohol, cigarette smoke, and drugs [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Hepatocytes are the principal cells in the liver, comprising over 80% of its mass and performing several characteristic functions of this organ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Liver culture systems such as hepatocyte monolayers (HMs) and collagen sandwiches (CSs) are routinely used to test adverse effects of drugs and environmental toxicants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In HMs, hepatocytes are cultured on a single collagen gel. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Such cells progressively lose their phenotypic characteristics over time [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In CS systems, hepatocytes are maintained between two collagen gels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Hepatocytes in CS cultures remain stable over extended periods of time, and maintain differentiated hepatic functions [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>While morphological and physiological characteristics of hepatocytes in CS cultures have been studied extensively, comprehensive transcriptional studies of these culture systems do not appear to have been reported. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in an earlier study, we performed a systematic temporal study of genome-wide gene expression programs in HMs and in CS cultures over an eight-day period [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>We used Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) [6] to compare the transcriptional programs in the two culture systems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrated that gene expression in hepatocytes in CS cultures steadily and comprehensively diverges from that in HMs [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Gene sets up-regulated in CS cultures included several hepatic functions, such as metabolism of lipids, amino acids, carbohydrates, and alcohol, and synthesis of bile acids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Monooxygenases such as Cytochrome-P450 enzymes did not show any change between the culture systems after one day, but exhibited significant up-regulation in CS cultures after three days and later in comparison to HMs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>This analysis did not consider the fact that a cell's response to its environment is governed by an intricate network of molecular interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>These interactions dynamically change in response to a myriad of cues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Therefore, discovering the set of molecular interactions that are active in a given cellular context is a fundamental question in computational systems biology [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In the current work, we reanalyze the CS-HM transcriptional data in the light of an underlying molecular interaction network. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>We propose a novel approach called “Contextual Biological Process Linkage Network” (CBPLN) that focuses on computing which processes in the cell are perturbed in a particular context and how these processes are linked to each other. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Our approach is predicated on the belief that high-level linkages between pathways and processes make identification of important biological trends more tractable and intuitive than through interactions between individual genes and molecules alone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Our method requires three inputs: </plain></SENT>
</text></p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>-values representing the statistical significance of the differential expression of each gene (upon comparing a treatment to a control), which we refer to hereafter as expression   -values, </plain></SENT>
</text></p></list-item><list-item><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>a functional or physical interaction network connecting genes and proteins, and </plain></SENT>
</text></p></list-item><list-item><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>a dataset of functional annotations for genes and proteins. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></list-item></list><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>We extend the method developed by Dotan-Cohen et al. [8] to detect directed linkages between gene sets in the context of a functional interaction network. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Given two biological processes  and  and the sets of genes that are members of each, these authors computed the number of genes annotated by  that are themselves not annotated by  and interact with at least one gene annotated by . </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>They estimated the statistical significance of this count using the one-sided version of Fisher's exact test. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Similar methods developed by Pandey et al. [9], [10] for regulatory and physical interaction networks are aimed at discovering chains of significantly linked biological processes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>In this work, we extend the ideas of Dotan-Cohen et al. to incorporate gene expression measurements to determine which inter-process links are significantly perturbed between the measured conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Informally, we compute a score for a link from process  to process  based upon the expression -values of pairs of interacting genes, where one gene belongs to process  and the other to process . </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Our score takes estimates of confidence in the interactions into account. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>High-confidence interactions with highly perturbed incident genes make large contributions to the score. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>We estimate the statistical significance of the score by computing an empirical distribution of scores under two different hypotheses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>The first hypothesis tests the dependence of the score on the particular set of genes annotated by , i.e., it asks if we would observe a particular score from process  to  even if we selected the genes annotated by  uniformly at random from the set of all annotated genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>This test directly extends the approach used by Dotan-Cohen et al. The second hypothesis tests the dependence of the score on the specific interactions in the network, i.e., it asks if we would observe the score from  to  even with an interaction network drawn from a distribution of networks with the same node degrees. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Under either hypothesis, we report the significance of the link, after multiple testing correction, as a -value. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Hereafter, we refer to this quantity as the link   -value, to distinguish it from the expression -values that are inputs to our method. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Existing databases of protein interactions contain very few experimentally detected Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) for rat: seven different widely-used sources [11]–[17] contained a total of just 1,274 non-redundant rat PPIs spanning 974 proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we decided to use the rat functional linkage network predicted by the STRING system [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The interaction type in STRING is a functional association, which the authors define as “the specific and meaningful interaction between two proteins that jointly contribute to the same functional process.” Apart from incorporating experimental interaction data, STRING uses multiple methods to predict possible functional linkages including interolog-based interaction transfer, similar transcriptional response across a variety of conditions (co-expression), text-mining, and gene families that share above-random similarities in their evolutionary histories. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>STRING includes a scheme to score each predicted interaction in the range 150–1000 against a common reference of functional partnership based on the KEGG database [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>STRING version 8.3, released on May 26, 2010 contains 975,454 predicted interactions among 15,178 rat proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>We used the subset of these interactions with a weight of at least 500; there were 204,992 such interactions among 9,925 proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>We selected 500 as a cutoff based on the reasoning that interactions with at least this weight were more likely to connect genes belonging to the same process than to connect genes belonging to different processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>When we further pruned the network to include genes with at least one annotation (see below), we obtained 47,002 interactions among 4,714 genes. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>In that work, we focused our analysis on gene sets that showed monotonically diverging patterns of expression between CS and HM cultures. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>First, in Table 3, irrespective of the hypothesis test used, the number of links increased with time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon parallels our earlier observation that the transcriptional programs of hepatocytes in CS cultures steadily diverged from that in HMs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Second, the size of the intersection between the two sets of links also increased with time, as did the Jaccard similarity coefficient of the two sets (i.e., the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Further, for each day, the number of links deemed to be significant by both hypothesis tests was itself statistically significant, based on Fisher's Exact Test (see File S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>These trends suggest that once the transcriptional programs of the two culture systems have diverged (day 2 and later), both hypothesis tests find very similar sets of process pairs to be significantly linked at the 0.01 level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>However, the number of common links is very close to the number of links identified by the second hypothesis test, indicating that the second test is more conservative than the first in deciding whether a link is statistically significant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>We observed similar results when we repeated these analyses with other cutoffs on the link -value (0.005, 0.05, and 0.1) (see File S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Third, normalizing the linkage score (see “Methods”) pruned out a small number of links. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Finally, the overlap between the intersection of the results from both hypothesis tests and the BPLN was small in days 1 and 2 and more substantial in days 3 and 8 (Table 4), although the overlap was still statistically significant by Fisher's Exact Test (see File S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that only a subset of the links in a BPLN may have some relevance to the particular biological conditions being investigated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>By incorporating measurements of gene expression, CBPLNs can identify those inter-process links that correspond to the phenotypic differences observed in the two conditions being compared (e.g., hepatocytes in CS versus HM). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Although both hypothesis tests find very similar sets of process pairs to be significantly linked at the 0.01 level, especially in later days, we found that the actual link -values computed for each process pair were not very highly correlated to each other (see File S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, we decided to consider a linkage between a pair of gene sets only if this link was significant at the 0.01 level with both hypothesis tests with normalization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>The resulting CBPLNs are displayed in Figures 1, 2, 3, 4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>For reference, we have displayed the BPLN in Figure 5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>We discuss the properties of these CBPLNs in the rest of the paper. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>We focus primarily on the day 8 CBPLN (Figure 4), noting that many of the features we discuss are also apparent in the day 3 CBPLN (Figure 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>When we discuss some pairs of linked gene sets, we refer to the underlying functional interaction network connecting the genes in those sets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>We start by discussing properties of liver-specific genes, focusing particularly on the regulation of these genes by the transcription factor HNF1. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Both HSA03320_PPAR_SIGNALING_PATHWAY and HSA00120_BILE_ACID_BIOSYNTHESIS are up-regulated in CS cultures in contrast to HMs (Fig. 8C and Fig. 8D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Bile acids directly induce the expression of PPAR [36], which supports interpreting the observed link from HSA00120_BILE_ACID_BIOSYNTHESIS to HSA03320_PPAR_SIGNALING_PATHWAY as a regulatory one. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, although it is tempting to infer that the reverse of that link, from HSA03320_PPAR_SIGNALING_PATHWAY to HSA00120_BILE_ACID_BIOSYNTHESIS, also implies the PPAR pathway up-regulates bile acid biosynthesis, such a conclusion may be incorrect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Since the up-regulation trends arise from the comparison of CS cultures to HMs, it is possible that bile acid production in CS cultures is constant (or even decreasing) over time and that bile acid levels in HMs are decreasing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>In fact, when we compare the expression values of these two gene sets exclusively within the CS cultures, we observe that there is no statistically significant change between the expression levels of the bile acid biosynthesis genes between days 3 and 8, and that there is a barely statistically significant up-regulation of the genes in the PPAR signaling pathway between the same two days (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Moreover, PPAR has been shown to directly inhibit production of Cholesterol 7-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) [37], [38]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>Links and local network features in CBPLNs are generalizations of diverse physiological phenomena such as regulation, feedback, and downstream signal flow from the gene/protein level to the scale of biological processes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>Our approach is a complement to a suite of methodologies that integrate physical, signaling, regulatory, and functional networks with measurements of molecular profiles such as transcriptional, proteomic, or metabolic data to compute the response network, which may be defined as the sub-network of interactions that are perturbed in a particular condition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>A wide variety of methods have been developed for computing such response networks [63]–[67]. </plain></SENT>
