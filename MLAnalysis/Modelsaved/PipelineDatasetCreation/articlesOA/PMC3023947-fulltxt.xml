Fewer reports describe trehalose accumulation in mycorrhiza where, in contrast with rhizobia, there is no flux of carbohydrates from the microsymbiont to the plant. However, the trehalose dynamics in the Mycorrhiza-Rhizobium-Legume tripartite symbiosis is unknown. The present study explores the role of this tripartite symbiosis in the trehalose content of nodules grown under contrasting moisture conditions. Three wild genotypes (<italic>P. filiformis</italic>, <italic>P. acutifolis</italic> and <italic>P. vulgaris</italic>) and two commercial genotypes of <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic> (Pinto villa and Flor de Mayo) were used. Co-inoculation treatments were conducted with <italic>Glomus intraradices</italic> and a mixture of seven native rhizobial strains, and trehalose content was determined by GC/MS. The results showed a negative effect of mycorrhizal inoculation on nodule development, as mycorrhized plants showed fewer nodules and lower nodule dry weight compared to plants inoculated only with <italic>Rhizobium</italic>. Mycorrhizal colonization was also higher in plants inoculated only with <italic>Glomus</italic> as compared to plants co-inoculated with both microsymbionts. In regard to trehalose, co-inoculation negatively affects its accumulation in the nodules of each genotype tested. However, the correlation analysis showed a significantly positive correlation between mycorrhizal colonization and nodule trehalose content.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Mycorrhiza-Rhizobium co-inoculation</kwd><kwd>Trehalose</kwd><kwd>Drought stress.</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Common beans represent the most important source of dietary protein in developing countries. However, in most of these countries, its cropping has been relegated to marginal production areas, characterized for their poorly developed soils and low nutrient content. Generally speaking, beans are sown under rainfed systems which expose the plant to variable periods of drought. In this regard, an important effort has been made to produce common bean cultivars tolerant to these challenging conditions. An agronomic practice associated with increased yield in these systems is inoculation with <italic>Rhizobium</italic>. This type of inoculation improves not only the nutritional status of nodulated plants, derived from the biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) process, but recently it has been recognized that this inoculation may also increase drought or osmotic tolerance of nodulated legumes such as acacia, common bean, lotus, and medicago, through the biosynthesis of trehalose (&#945;-D-glucopyranosyl-[1-1]-&#945;-D- glucopyranoside) [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The accumulation of trehalose by different organisms (bacteria, yeast, fungi, nematodes, etc.) has been related to survival under different environmental stresses, like osmotic, low pH, high and low temperatures and dehydration [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the nodule, disaccharide is synthesized by the bacteroid, and its accumulation depends on the rhizobial strain, legume genotype and environmental conditions [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It was reported that under well-watered conditions, there is a basal amount of trehalose in the nodules, having a negative correlation with the BNF, but under drought conditions, nodule trehalose levels increase significantly and may contribute to maintain BNF under these circumstances [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and to improve the plant tolerance to drought [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"> 8</xref>]. Under field conditions, it was observed that trehalose is detected in seeds from nodulated plants, with a positive correlation with seed longevity [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>It has been reported that mycorrhizal inoculation increases the plant&#8217;s tolerance to drought. The most accepted mechanism for this effect is the improvement of water-use efficiency of the mycorrhized plant [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Interestingly, it is also known that ecto and endo mycorrhizae synthesize trehalose [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"> 15</xref>]. Nevertheless, in this case, it was demonstrated trough the use of <sup>14</sup>C that there is no carbohydrate flux from the fungi to the plant [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and fungi trehalose is mostly localized at the spores where it may serve, as in <italic>Trichoderma</italic> and <italic>Aspergillus</italic>, to increase the survival of the spores [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In a recent <italic>in vitro</italic> study, it was observed that mycorrhizal roots under osmotic stress mobilized trehalose from the mycorrhizal root to the external mycelia (Farias-Rodriguez, unpublished data), supporting the idea that trehalose biosynthesis in mycorrhizal symbiosis is only localized in fungal tissues and does not contribute to plant stress tolerance as in <italic>Rhizobium</italic>.</p><p>In the case of co-inoculation (rhizobia and mycorrhiza) experiments on legumes, most of the reports argue for a synergistic effect of both microsymbionts on plant development [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, in common bean, examples in the literature show a negative effect of mycorrhiza on nodule development [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The objective of this work was to study the effect of mycorrhiza inoculation on trehalose accumulation in the nodule.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Biological Material</title><p>The common bean genotypes used here were the wild accessions <italic>Phaseolus filiformis</italic> P1535309, <italic>P. acutifolius</italic> G40142 and <italic>P. vulgaris</italic> P1325687, and the commercial cultivars <italic>P vulgaris</italic> cv.

In this sense, the wild accession of P. vulgaris P1325687 showed the highest number of nodules under both watering regimes and inoculation treatments. In the well-watered treatment (Fig. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref></bold>), P. vulgaris P1325687 presented on average 500 nodules per plant when inoculated only with the rhizobial mixture, but when co-inoculated with Glomus, the number of nodules in this bean genotype significantly decreased (p&lt;0.05) to an average of 300 per plant. The commercial P. vulgaris genotypes (Flor de Mayo and Pinto Saltillo) inoculated only with Rhizobium presented 65 nodules per plant on average, but when co-inoculated with Glomus, the number of nodules decreased to 45. <italic>P. filiformis</italic> and <italic>P. acutifolius</italic> showed a low number of nodules, with an average of 12 nodules per plant; under co-inoculation they showed an average of 7 nodules per plant.</p><p>When drought was imposed on these bean plants, the number of nodules decreased in the two inoculation treatments when compared with their well-watered counterparts (Fig. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref></bold>). <italic>P. vulgaris</italic> P1325687 had 350 nodules per plant when inoculated with <italic>Rhizobium</italic>, and only 100 when co-inoculated with <italic>Glomus</italic>. Under watering conditions, there was a significant difference among the two commercial bean cultivars. <italic>P. vulgaris</italic> cv.

This would indicate that bean genotypes that have the highest mycorrhizal colonization showed the highest number of nodules, nodule dry weight and nodule trehalose content (Fig. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref></bold>), regardless of the fact that individually, in each genotype mycorrhizae decreased the values of these parameters. The correlation index values for <italic>Glomus</italic> colonization were r=0.38 for nodule number, r=0.63 for nodule dry weight, and r= 0.48 for trehalose content. However, under drought conditions, some changes were observed in these correlations indices (Fig. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref></bold>). The number of nodules had a negative correlation with mycorrhization (r=0.15).

Also, considering only the inoculated treatments, it was observed that in <italic>P. filiformis</italic> and<italic> P. acutifolius</italic> plants, co-inoculation resulted in a negative effect by reducing the leaf area when compared to the maximum area obtained under inoculation, which corresponded to <italic>Rhizobium</italic> inoculation. On the other hand, co-inoculation had a positive effect on <italic>P. vulgaris</italic> P1325687 and<italic> P. vulgaris</italic> cv.

Leaf area in fertilized control plants decreased to 85 cm<sup>2</sup>, and the smallest leaf area was recorded in co-inoculated plants (84 cm<sup>2</sup>). Again, considering only inoculation treatments, it was observed that in <italic>P. acutifolius</italic> and<italic> P. vulgaris</italic> P1325687, the maximum leaf area was obtained under <italic>Glomus</italic> inoculation, and co-inoculation negatively affected this parameter. On the other hand, <italic>P. acutifolius</italic> and<italic> P. vulgaris</italic> cv.

In this case, the <italic>Rhizobium</italic> inoculation produced the highest biomass of all five genotypes tested, both under well-watered and drought stressed plants. The total biomass for <italic>Rhizobium</italic> inoculated plants under well-watered conditions was 2 mg plant<sup>-1</sup>, followed by plants inoculated with <italic>Glomus</italic>, with a biomass of 1.5 mg plant<sup>-1</sup>, and of the inoculated plants, those that were co-inoculated showed the lower biomass (1.4 mg plant<sup>-1</sup>).

Several efforts have been made to obtain transgenic plants that express the microbial genes for the synthesis of trehalose, with the aim of increasing plants&#8217; tolerance to dehydration [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Up until today, the presence of trehalose genes in several plants has been reported [24-26], but the carbohydrate has been rarely detected [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and assays on transgenic plants continue [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>-<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. On the other hand, when plants are in symbiosis with different microorganisms, trehalose is commonly detected. The role of trehalose in these interactions has been mostly studied in the <italic>Rhizobium</italic>-legume symbiosis and less work has been conducted in regard to fungi-plant interaction.</p><p>Today, there are no reports in the literature that have considered the effect of co-inoculation with bacteria and fungi on plant trehalose accumulation. In this sense, studies on co-inoculation of <italic>Rhizobium</italic> and mycorrhiza on legumes have focused on mycorrhiza performance and its effect on plant nutrient uptake and, only in a few cases, on plant drought tolerance. For example, in faba bean (<italic>Vicia faba</italic>) it has been reported that mycorrhizal inoculation increased nodule number when compared to non-mycorrhized plants, and this positive effect on nodulation was also observed under drought conditions, but when plant drought tolerance was discussed, only the mycorrhizal parameters were considered [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. </p><p>There are scarce reports on common bean, and these reports point to a negative effect of mycorrhiza on nodule development and nitrogen fixation [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, considering all the reports that establish that trehalose accumulation in legume nodules is related to increased plant drought stress, the aim of the present work was to analyze the effect of mycorrhizal colonization on nodulated common bean based on parameters related to drought tolerance.</p><p>This work is in agreement with previous reports on common bean, which support the idea that co-inoculation has a negative effect on the microsymbionts that are involved in this process [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], since nodulation and mycorrhizal colonization were higher when inoculated independently, and both parameters decreased with co-inoculation. Of the three wild beans used in this work, <italic>P. filiformis</italic> and <italic>P. acutifolius</italic> showed the lowest number of nodules in all treatments. This could be attributed to the origin of the rhizobial strains, which were isolated from a field devoted to common bean production and may not be the most adequate strains for these two genotypes. On the contrary, there was no difference in mycorrhizal colonization between these three genotypes under well-watered conditions. <italic>P. filiformis</italic> showed high mycorrhizal colonization under drought conditions. When co-inoculation was assayed, both mycorrhizal colonization and nodulation decreased in all bean genotypes tested. This behavior was probably due to a competition for plant photosynthates between both microorganisms, imposed by the experimental conditions used at this work. Interestingly, when the data from the five bean genotypes were combined to compute the correlation indexes, the opposite correlations were observed</p><p>Under well-watered conditions, nodule number and dry weight correlate positively with mycorrhizal colonization. In other words, among the different bean genotypes, the higher the mycorrhization the higher the nodulation; however, as mentioned earlier, this type of co-inoculation reduced the value of these two parameters when compared to plants inoculated only with <italic>Rhizobium</italic>. In drought stressed plants, correlation indexes between nodulation and mycorrhizal colonization parameters were negative, indicating that nodulation is more sensitive to dehydration than the mycorrhiza. Also, as mycorrhiza is more widely distributed in the root, there is the possibility that this fungus could better exploit the limited photosynthates available in this condition. </p><p>In regard to trehalose accumulation, in co-inoculation treatments there was a decrease in its nodule content when compared with plants inoculated only with rhizobia. It was observed that under both watering regimes, the correlation index was positive, and under drought it became highly significant (r=0.98). Up until today, the precise biochemical and molecular control of trehalose biosynthesis in the nodule is not understood. Although some data suggest that nodule trehalose could be mobilized to the plant, there is no conclusive evidence. Therefore, if there is a trehalose release from the nodule under drought to the plant tissue, it would be possible, under this circumstance, for the mycorrhiza to utilize it and export the trehalose to the external mycelia and spores, and this fungal dependency on nodule trehalose may provoke this high correlation index. The mobilization of trehalose from the mycorrhizal roots to the external mycelia has been previously observed in an experiment using as a study model transformed carrot roots, which once mycorrhized, were submitted to osmotic stress; it was observed that under these conditions, there was a higher trehalose content in the external mycelia as compared to the non-stressed controls (Farias-Rodriguez, unpublished data). As this work focused on reproducing the soil environment under field conditions, it&#8217;s very difficult to understand the basic mechanisms underlying this observation; in order to elucidate this relationship, future work should be conducted with the use of <italic>in vitro</italic> systems, that will allow a better understanding of the phenomena reported here.</p><p>When considering biomass production as an estimate of drought tolerance, it was observed once again that plants inoculated only with rhizobia or mycorrhiza were less affected by drought, whereas when co-inoculated, a higher decrease in biomass production was observed as compared to the plants&#8217; well-watered counterparts. In conclusion, the results presented in this work support the idea that the use of rhizobial or mycorrhizal inoculation separately would result in better bean drought tolerance than the co-inoculation treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group
