</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Common beans represent the most important source of dietary protein in developing countries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, in most of these countries, its cropping has been relegated to marginal production areas, characterized for their poorly developed soils and low nutrient content. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Generally speaking, beans are sown under rainfed systems which expose the plant to variable periods of drought. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In this regard, an important effort has been made to produce common bean cultivars tolerant to these challenging conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>An agronomic practice associated with increased yield in these systems is inoculation with Rhizobium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This type of inoculation improves not only the nutritional status of nodulated plants, derived from the biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) process, but recently it has been recognized that this inoculation may also increase drought or osmotic tolerance of nodulated legumes such as acacia, common bean, lotus, and medicago, through the biosynthesis of trehalose (α-D-glucopyranosyl-[1-1]-α-D- glucopyranoside) [1-4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The accumulation of trehalose by different organisms (bacteria, yeast, fungi, nematodes, etc.) has been related to survival under different environmental stresses, like osmotic, low pH, high and low temperatures and dehydration [5-7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In the nodule, disaccharide is synthesized by the bacteroid, and its accumulation depends on the rhizobial strain, legume genotype and environmental conditions [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>It was reported that under well-watered conditions, there is a basal amount of trehalose in the nodules, having a negative correlation with the BNF, but under drought conditions, nodule trehalose levels increase significantly and may contribute to maintain BNF under these circumstances [2] and to improve the plant tolerance to drought [2, 8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Under field conditions, it was observed that trehalose is detected in seeds from nodulated plants, with a positive correlation with seed longevity [9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that mycorrhizal inoculation increases the plant’s tolerance to drought. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The most accepted mechanism for this effect is the improvement of water-use efficiency of the mycorrhized plant [10-13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, it is also known that ecto and endo mycorrhizae synthesize trehalose [14, 15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, in this case, it was demonstrated trough the use of 14C that there is no carbohydrate flux from the fungi to the plant [16], and fungi trehalose is mostly localized at the spores where it may serve, as in Trichoderma and Aspergillus, to increase the survival of the spores [17-18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In a recent in vitro study, it was observed that mycorrhizal roots under osmotic stress mobilized trehalose from the mycorrhizal root to the external mycelia (Farias-Rodriguez, unpublished data), supporting the idea that trehalose biosynthesis in mycorrhizal symbiosis is only localized in fungal tissues and does not contribute to plant stress tolerance as in Rhizobium. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In the case of co-inoculation (rhizobia and mycorrhiza) experiments on legumes, most of the reports argue for a synergistic effect of both microsymbionts on plant development [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, in common bean, examples in the literature show a negative effect of mycorrhiza on nodule development [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The objective of this work was to study the effect of mycorrhiza inoculation on trehalose accumulation in the nodule. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>The biosynthesis of trehalose has been correlated with tolerance to different types of stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Although this carbohydrate is widespread in nature, it is considered to be absent in superior vascular plants in the past decade. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>Several efforts have been made to obtain transgenic plants that express the microbial genes for the synthesis of trehalose, with the aim of increasing plants’ tolerance to dehydration [22, 23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Up until today, the presence of trehalose genes in several plants has been reported [24-26], but the carbohydrate has been rarely detected [27], and assays on transgenic plants continue [28-31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, when plants are in symbiosis with different microorganisms, trehalose is commonly detected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>The role of trehalose in these interactions has been mostly studied in the Rhizobium-legume symbiosis and less work has been conducted in regard to fungi-plant interaction. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Today, there are no reports in the literature that have considered the effect of co-inoculation with bacteria and fungi on plant trehalose accumulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>In this sense, studies on co-inoculation of Rhizobium and mycorrhiza on legumes have focused on mycorrhiza performance and its effect on plant nutrient uptake and, only in a few cases, on plant drought tolerance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>For example, in faba bean (Vicia faba) it has been reported that mycorrhizal inoculation increased nodule number when compared to non-mycorrhized plants, and this positive effect on nodulation was also observed under drought conditions, but when plant drought tolerance was discussed, only the mycorrhizal parameters were considered [32]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>There are scarce reports on common bean, and these reports point to a negative effect of mycorrhiza on nodule development and nitrogen fixation [20, 33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Therefore, considering all the reports that establish that trehalose accumulation in legume nodules is related to increased plant drought stress, the aim of the present work was to analyze the effect of mycorrhizal colonization on nodulated common bean based on parameters related to drought tolerance. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>This work is in agreement with previous reports on common bean, which support the idea that co-inoculation has a negative effect on the microsymbionts that are involved in this process [33], since nodulation and mycorrhizal colonization were higher when inoculated independently, and both parameters decreased with co-inoculation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Of the three wild beans used in this work, P. filiformis and P. acutifolius showed the lowest number of nodules in all treatments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>This could be attributed to the origin of the rhizobial strains, which were isolated from a field devoted to common bean production and may not be the most adequate strains for these two genotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, there was no difference in mycorrhizal colonization between these three genotypes under well-watered conditions. P. filiformis showed high mycorrhizal colonization under drought conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>When co-inoculation was assayed, both mycorrhizal colonization and nodulation decreased in all bean genotypes tested. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>This behavior was probably due to a competition for plant photosynthates between both microorganisms, imposed by the experimental conditions used at this work. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, when the data from the five bean genotypes were combined to compute the correlation indexes, the opposite correlations were observed </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Under well-watered conditions, nodule number and dry weight correlate positively with mycorrhizal colonization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>In other words, among the different bean genotypes, the higher the mycorrhization the higher the nodulation; however, as mentioned earlier, this type of co-inoculation reduced the value of these two parameters when compared to plants inoculated only with Rhizobium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>In drought stressed plants, correlation indexes between nodulation and mycorrhizal colonization parameters were negative, indicating that nodulation is more sensitive to dehydration than the mycorrhiza. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Also, as mycorrhiza is more widely distributed in the root, there is the possibility that this fungus could better exploit the limited photosynthates available in this condition. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>In regard to trehalose accumulation, in co-inoculation treatments there was a decrease in its nodule content when compared with plants inoculated only with rhizobia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>It was observed that under both watering regimes, the correlation index was positive, and under drought it became highly significant (r=0.98). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Up until today, the precise biochemical and molecular control of trehalose biosynthesis in the nodule is not understood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Although some data suggest that nodule trehalose could be mobilized to the plant, there is no conclusive evidence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Therefore, if there is a trehalose release from the nodule under drought to the plant tissue, it would be possible, under this circumstance, for the mycorrhiza to utilize it and export the trehalose to the external mycelia and spores, and this fungal dependency on nodule trehalose may provoke this high correlation index. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>The mobilization of trehalose from the mycorrhizal roots to the external mycelia has been previously observed in an experiment using as a study model transformed carrot roots, which once mycorrhized, were submitted to osmotic stress; it was observed that under these conditions, there was a higher trehalose content in the external mycelia as compared to the non-stressed controls (Farias-Rodriguez, unpublished data). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>As this work focused on reproducing the soil environment under field conditions, it’s very difficult to understand the basic mechanisms underlying this observation; in order to elucidate this relationship, future work should be conducted with the use of in vitro systems, that will allow a better understanding of the phenomena reported here. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>When considering biomass production as an estimate of drought tolerance, it was observed once again that plants inoculated only with rhizobia or mycorrhiza were less affected by drought, whereas when co-inoculated, a higher decrease in biomass production was observed as compared to the plants’ well-watered counterparts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the results presented in this work support the idea that the use of rhizobial or mycorrhizal inoculation separately would result in better bean drought tolerance than the co-inoculation treatment. </plain></SENT>
