Aberrant splicing can occur due to mutations that disrupt or create canonical splice sites or splicing regulatory sequences. The assessment of their pathogenic role may be difficult, and is further complicated by the phenomenon of alternative splicing. We describe an HNPCC patient, with early-onset colorectal cancer and a strong family history of colorectal and breast tumors, who harbours a germ line MLH1 intronic variant (IVS9 c.790 +4A&gt;T). The proband, together with 2 relatives affected by colorectal-cancer and 1 by breast cancer, have been investigated for microsatellite instability, immunohistochemical MMR protein staining, direct sequencing and Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification. The effect of the intronic variant was analyzed both by splicing prediction software and by hybrid minigene splicing assay. In this family, we found a novel MLH1 germline intronic variant (IVS9 c.790 +4A&gt;T) in intron 9, consisting of an A to T transversion, in position +4 of the splice donor site of MLH1. The mutation is associated with the lack of expression of the MLH1 protein and MSI in tumour tissues. Furthermore, our results suggest that this substitution leads to a complete skip of both exon 9 and 10 of the mutant allele. Our findings suggest that this intronic variant plays a pathogenic role.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Intronic mutation</kwd><kwd>MLH1</kwd><kwd>Minigene assay</kwd><kwd>Colon cancer</kwd><kwd>Breast cancer</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC), or Lynch syndrome, is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder that accounts for approximately 3&#8211;5% of all colorectal cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Lynch syndrome is associated with germline mutations in MMR genes, in particular in <italic>MLH</italic>1 and <italic>MSH2</italic>, that have been found in up to 90% of HNPCC patients, and less frequently in <italic>MSH6</italic>, <italic>PMS2</italic> and MSH3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. MMR deficiency leads to accumulation of replication errors, typically at short repetitive DNA sequences in the tumour cells, giving rise to the molecular hallmark of HNPCC: the microsatellite instability (MSI).</p><p>Individuals carrying germ line mutations of MMR genes have a high lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer as well as an increased risk of tumours in extracolonic sites such as endometrium, renal pelvis, ureter, stomach, small intestine, bile ducts, ovary and possibly breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Immunoistochemistry of MLH1 and MSH2 in tumour tissue can be used as a complementary screening method, providing information about the presence or absence of the protein tested and, thus the specific gene defect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>As mutations in <italic>MLH1</italic> and <italic>MSH2</italic> are spread throughout the genes, without &#8220;hot spots&#8221;, the detection of a predisposing mutation requires entire genes to be screened. To date approximately 450 different mutations are listed in the database of the International Society for Gastrointestinal Hereditary Tumours (InSiGHT/LOVD database) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.insight-group.org/mutations/">http://www.insight-group.org/mutations/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Many of these mutations (~50%) lead to truncated proteins (nonsense, frameshift, splice site mutations or large genomic deletions), and are considered pathogenic. However in Lynch syndrome families a substantial proportion of <italic>MLH1</italic> and <italic>MSH2</italic> mutations are single nucleotide substitutions, either within the coding sequence (missense, or silent mutations) or in intronic regions.</p><p>Whether these mutations affect the normal function of mismatch DNA repair proteins, and thus have a pathogenic role, is an essential piece of information in genetic counselling.</p><p>Traditionally, a missense mutation is considered more likely to be pathogenic when a highly conserved amino acid is involved, when its polarity is changed or when it is not present in a large number of controls. More recent studies have shown that some previously unclassified variants may interfere with normal splicing process. Aberrant splicing can occur due to mutations that disrupt the splice sites themselves or ESE or ESS motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. DNA mutations can affect RNA processing by destroying or creating target sequences for splicing regulatory proteins, thereby changing the complex of factors bound to the pre-mRNA. This can initially be assessed by bioinformatics methods that predict the creation or the destruction of protein binding sites.</p><p>Here we describe the case of an HNPCC patient with a strong family history, with a germ line <italic>MLH1</italic> intronic variant: intron 9 (IVS9 c.790 +4A&gt;T).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Case report</title><p>The proband was a 24&#160;year-old male (IV-1), diagnosed with mucinous adenocarcinoma of the right colon when he was 24, and underwent right hemicolectomy (pT3N1M0, G3).</p><p>Detailed four generation family history was collected.

This is often the case for synonymous, missense and intronic variants or when the nucleotide change affects or creates a (putative) splice-site.</p><p>It is not easy to clarify whether an UV contributes to the disease phenotype or merely represents a rare polymorphism. Several criteria are used to help in classifying these variants as pathogenic, if they: (1) segregate with disease; (2) are absent in controls; (3) result in a change of aminoacid polarity or size; (4) cause the substitution of an amino acid in a domain that is evolutionary highly conserved and/or is shared between proteins belonging to the same protein family; (5) exhibit altered function in an in vitro assay.</p><p>The correct classification of an UV is of obvious importance when assessing the cancer risk for the proband and his family.</p><p>We report a <italic>MLH1</italic> intronic mutation, in intron 9 donor site (IVS9 c.790 +4A&gt;T) affecting the inclusion of both exon 9 and exon 10.</p><p>The family studied fulfilled Amsterdam I criteria; all affected family members, in which we could perform the genetic test, carried the same <italic>MLH1</italic> intronic mutation (IVS9 c.790 +4A&gt;T). Moreover they all showed MSI-H and the lack of expression of MLH1 protein in tumour specimens. The mutation was not found in two unaffected relatives of the proband and in 100 healthy individuals.</p><p>In this family there were two cases of breast cancer (II-4, III-2). We could not examine a tumor specimen of the II-4 patient (she died approximately 30&#160;years ago), but she was an obligate mutation carrier. Both cases of breast cancer were diagnosed at an age compatible with what is reported in literature for HNPCC associated breast cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The inclusion of breast cancer in HNPCC is controversial but there are recent studies supporting this hypothesis. Although breast cancer is a common tumor and there may be phenocopies, approximately half of the cases in HNPCC families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] show lack of staining for the protein encoded by the mutated gene and the tumor samples show microsatellite instability (similar to our patient III-2). It is of note that HNPCC associated breast cancers seem to be more common in <italic>MLH1</italic> mutated families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>The bioinformatic predictions show weakening of the 5&#8242; splice site. Generally, the weakening of a strong 5&#8242; splice site makes the presence of additional alternative splicing forms lacking an exon or with alternative 5&#8242; splice site more probable. The lack of cryptic 5&#8242; splice sites near the mutation supports the former event that is exon skipping. Besides the weakening of the 5&#8242;ss, the SpliceAid tool prediction, showed the competition between ETR-3 and snRNP U1 factors for recognition of the 5&#8242;ss, enhances the hypothesis that the mutation gives rise to exon 9 skipping event in all alternative transcripts. Since the exon 9 length is not a multiple of 3, its skipping event would give rise to a frameshift resulting in premature stop codons. The intronic mutation can therefore dramatically alter <italic>MLH1</italic> exon 9 inclusion levels.</p><p>On the basis of the in silico predictions, we experimentally investigated the presence of aberrant splicing due to the IVS9c.790 +4A&gt;T mutation. The RNA analysis, from blood lymphocytes of all patients considered, showed, in addition to the wt band, one shorter fragment lacking exons 9&#160;+&#160;10 of and an additional band lacking exon 9.</p><p>Although several Authors have previously described deletion of exon 9 +10 and deletion of exon 9, as normal alternative MLH1 transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], their relative intensity appeared significantly lower than that of normal-sized fragments (wt) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The band corresponding to the deletion of exon 9 +10, from healthy subjects (100 controls) was of much lower intensity than the band in our patient. Whilst in our proband and his affected relatives the intensity of the bands relative to cDNA products was equal between the wt gene and the mutated gene A study of the functional role of the deletion of exons 9 +10, predicted that it does not contribute to MMR function in vivo since it failed to restore MMR in 293T [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Pagenstecher et al. published an intronic variant similar to ours: c.790 +4A&gt;G, which showed high correlation with phenotype, but they did not complete functional studies and concluded that its pathogenicity was uncertain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>In our proband the loss of heterozygosity analysis showed complete loss of wt allele in cDNA from tumor tissue and two alleles of equal molecular weight, corresponding to the wt allele and to the mutant allele.</p><p>We also studied the effect of the IVS9c.790 +4A&gt;T mutation by a functional splicing assay. Transient transfection of the minigene carrying the patient mutation in HeLa cells showed aberrant splicing with approximately 10% exon 9 skipping and 90% of both exons 9 and 10 skipping. Although the results resemble the patients aberrant splicing in tumor affected tissue, transfection of the minigene in other cell lines showed different proportions of the splicing variants (data not shown) suggesting that there is a strong influence of the splicing factors context on the splicing outcome. We also detected a band in the wt minigene corresponding to the partial retention of the minigene intron between alfa globin exon 2 and <italic>MLH1</italic> exon 3. The intron retention resulting from the activation of a cryptic donor site, could be because of the altered genomic context in the minigene system, as the cryptic donor site is never used by the MLH1 endogenous gene. The fact that we obtained similar results even in different minigene contexts (data not shown) strongly suggests a predisposition to disease caused by deep intronic variations in <italic>MLH1</italic> intron 8, since the creation of acceptor splice sites upstream of the cryptic donor site may result in pseudoexon inclusion as observed for the minigene.</p><p>In conclusion, we studied one patient and three relatives from a family with the hallmarks of HNPCC. All the patients studied (three with colon cancer and one with breast cancer) exhibited the same mutation and the laboratory features are, in our opinion, compatible with the pathogenicity of the c.790 +4A&gt;T mutation.</p><p>The reclassification of this variant as deleterious has significant implications in the management of this family.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The Authors acknowledge
