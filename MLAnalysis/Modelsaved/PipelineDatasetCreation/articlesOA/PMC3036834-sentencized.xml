</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC), or Lynch syndrome, is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder that accounts for approximately 3–5% of all colorectal cancers [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Lynch syndrome is associated with germline mutations in MMR genes, in particular in MLH1 and MSH2, that have been found in up to 90% of HNPCC patients, and less frequently in MSH6, PMS2 and MSH3 [2–4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>MMR deficiency leads to accumulation of replication errors, typically at short repetitive DNA sequences in the tumour cells, giving rise to the molecular hallmark of HNPCC: the microsatellite instability (MSI). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Individuals carrying germ line mutations of MMR genes have a high lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer as well as an increased risk of tumours in extracolonic sites such as endometrium, renal pelvis, ureter, stomach, small intestine, bile ducts, ovary and possibly breast [5, 6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Immunoistochemistry of MLH1 and MSH2 in tumour tissue can be used as a complementary screening method, providing information about the presence or absence of the protein tested and, thus the specific gene defect [7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>As mutations in MLH1 and MSH2 are spread throughout the genes, without “hot spots”, the detection of a predisposing mutation requires entire genes to be screened. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>To date approximately 450 different mutations are listed in the database of the International Society for Gastrointestinal Hereditary Tumours (InSiGHT/LOVD database) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.insight-group.org/mutations/">http://www.insight-group.org/mutations/</ext-link>) [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Many of these mutations (~50%) lead to truncated proteins (nonsense, frameshift, splice site mutations or large genomic deletions), and are considered pathogenic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>However in Lynch syndrome families a substantial proportion of MLH1 and MSH2 mutations are single nucleotide substitutions, either within the coding sequence (missense, or silent mutations) or in intronic regions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Whether these mutations affect the normal function of mismatch DNA repair proteins, and thus have a pathogenic role, is an essential piece of information in genetic counselling. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Traditionally, a missense mutation is considered more likely to be pathogenic when a highly conserved amino acid is involved, when its polarity is changed or when it is not present in a large number of controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>More recent studies have shown that some previously unclassified variants may interfere with normal splicing process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Aberrant splicing can occur due to mutations that disrupt the splice sites themselves or ESE or ESS motifs [8, 9, 12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>DNA mutations can affect RNA processing by destroying or creating target sequences for splicing regulatory proteins, thereby changing the complex of factors bound to the pre-mRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>This can initially be assessed by bioinformatics methods that predict the creation or the destruction of protein binding sites. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Here we describe the case of an HNPCC patient with a strong family history, with a germ line MLH1 intronic variant: intron 9 (IVS9 c.790 +4A&gt;T). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Some patients carry DNA changes considered genetic variants of unknown clinical significance (Unclassified Variants (UVs) with uncertainty about their cancer risks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>This is often the case for synonymous, missense and intronic variants or when the nucleotide change affects or creates a (putative) splice-site. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>It is not easy to clarify whether an UV contributes to the disease phenotype or merely represents a rare polymorphism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Several criteria are used to help in classifying these variants as pathogenic, if they: (1) segregate with disease; (2) are absent in controls; (3) result in a change of aminoacid polarity or size; (4) cause the substitution of an amino acid in a domain that is evolutionary highly conserved and/or is shared between proteins belonging to the same protein family; (5) exhibit altered function in an in vitro assay. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>The correct classification of an UV is of obvious importance when assessing the cancer risk for the proband and his family. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>We report a MLH1 intronic mutation, in intron 9 donor site (IVS9 c.790 +4A&gt;T) affecting the inclusion of both exon 9 and exon 10. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>The family studied fulfilled Amsterdam I criteria; all affected family members, in which we could perform the genetic test, carried the same MLH1 intronic mutation (IVS9 c.790 +4A&gt;T). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Moreover they all showed MSI-H and the lack of expression of MLH1 protein in tumour specimens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>The mutation was not found in two unaffected relatives of the proband and in 100 healthy individuals. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>In this family there were two cases of breast cancer (II-4, III-2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>We could not examine a tumor specimen of the II-4 patient (she died approximately 30 years ago), but she was an obligate mutation carrier. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Both cases of breast cancer were diagnosed at an age compatible with what is reported in literature for HNPCC associated breast cancers [28–31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>The inclusion of breast cancer in HNPCC is controversial but there are recent studies supporting this hypothesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Although breast cancer is a common tumor and there may be phenocopies, approximately half of the cases in HNPCC families [30, 31] show lack of staining for the protein encoded by the mutated gene and the tumor samples show microsatellite instability (similar to our patient III-2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>It is of note that HNPCC associated breast cancers seem to be more common in MLH1 mutated families [28]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>The bioinformatic predictions show weakening of the 5′ splice site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Generally, the weakening of a strong 5′ splice site makes the presence of additional alternative splicing forms lacking an exon or with alternative 5′ splice site more probable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>The lack of cryptic 5′ splice sites near the mutation supports the former event that is exon skipping. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Besides the weakening of the 5′ss, the SpliceAid tool prediction, showed the competition between ETR-3 and snRNP U1 factors for recognition of the 5′ss, enhances the hypothesis that the mutation gives rise to exon 9 skipping event in all alternative transcripts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Since the exon 9 length is not a multiple of 3, its skipping event would give rise to a frameshift resulting in premature stop codons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>The intronic mutation can therefore dramatically alter MLH1 exon 9 inclusion levels. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the in silico predictions, we experimentally investigated the presence of aberrant splicing due to the IVS9c.790 +4A&gt;T mutation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>The RNA analysis, from blood lymphocytes of all patients considered, showed, in addition to the wt band, one shorter fragment lacking exons 9 + 10 of and an additional band lacking exon 9. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Although several Authors have previously described deletion of exon 9 +10 and deletion of exon 9, as normal alternative MLH1 transcripts [10, 13], their relative intensity appeared significantly lower than that of normal-sized fragments (wt) [11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>The band corresponding to the deletion of exon 9 +10, from healthy subjects (100 controls) was of much lower intensity than the band in our patient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Whilst in our proband and his affected relatives the intensity of the bands relative to cDNA products was equal between the wt gene and the mutated gene A study of the functional role of the deletion of exons 9 +10, predicted that it does not contribute to MMR function in vivo since it failed to restore MMR in 293T [32]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Pagenstecher et al. published an intronic variant similar to ours: c.790 +4A&gt;G, which showed high correlation with phenotype, but they did not complete functional studies and concluded that its pathogenicity was uncertain [33]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>In our proband the loss of heterozygosity analysis showed complete loss of wt allele in cDNA from tumor tissue and two alleles of equal molecular weight, corresponding to the wt allele and to the mutant allele. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>We also studied the effect of the IVS9c.790 +4A&gt;T mutation by a functional splicing assay. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Transient transfection of the minigene carrying the patient mutation in HeLa cells showed aberrant splicing with approximately 10% exon 9 skipping and 90% of both exons 9 and 10 skipping. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Although the results resemble the patients aberrant splicing in tumor affected tissue, transfection of the minigene in other cell lines showed different proportions of the splicing variants (data not shown) suggesting that there is a strong influence of the splicing factors context on the splicing outcome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>We also detected a band in the wt minigene corresponding to the partial retention of the minigene intron between alfa globin exon 2 and MLH1 exon 3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>The intron retention resulting from the activation of a cryptic donor site, could be because of the altered genomic context in the minigene system, as the cryptic donor site is never used by the MLH1 endogenous gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>The fact that we obtained similar results even in different minigene contexts (data not shown) strongly suggests a predisposition to disease caused by deep intronic variations in MLH1 intron 8, since the creation of acceptor splice sites upstream of the cryptic donor site may result in pseudoexon inclusion as observed for the minigene. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we studied one patient and three relatives from a family with the hallmarks of HNPCC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>All the patients studied (three with colon cancer and one with breast cancer) exhibited the same mutation and the laboratory features are, in our opinion, compatible with the pathogenicity of the c.790 +4A&gt;T mutation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>The reclassification of this variant as deleterious has significant implications in the management of this family. </plain></SENT>
