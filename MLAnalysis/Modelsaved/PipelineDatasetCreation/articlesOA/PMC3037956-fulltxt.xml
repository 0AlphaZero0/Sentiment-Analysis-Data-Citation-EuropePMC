Interestingly, binding of imatinib to the kinase-defective tyrosine-mutant restored the NLS function, suggesting that the kinase domain conformation induced by imatinib-binding is critical to the re-activation of the NLS function.

We found that the specific mutation of tyrosines 232, 253 and 257 (referring to ABL-1a amino acid numbering), but not six other tyrosine sites in the ABL kinase domain, including Y226 (Y245 in ABL-1b numbering) or Y393 (Y412 in ABL-1b numbering), can abolish the nuclear import of even a kinase-defective BCR-ABL fusion protein. We found that inhibition of the NLS function also involves the C-terminal region of the ABL protein, as a subset of mutations in the F-actin binding domain (FABD) could re-activate the NLS function of kinase-active and autophosphorylated BCR-ABL. However, we also identified other FABD mutations that did not re-activate BCR-ABL nuclear import despite the disruption of their binding to actin filaments. Thus the data presented here suggest that the kinase domain conformation, controlled by three specific tyrosines, and the folding of the C-terminal region, including the FABD, are key determinants in the regulation of the BCR-ABL NLS function.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Kinase defective BCR-ABL can be retained in the cytoplasm by kinase-active BCR-ABL</title><p>We have previously shown that the BCR-ABL protein can accumulate in the nucleus after the combined treatment with imatinib that inhibits its kinase activity and LMB that inhibits Crm1/exportin-1 to block nuclear export <xref rid="pone.0017020-Vigneri1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.

All numbering used herein refers to amino acid positions in the human ABL-1a isoform. The kinase-defective (KD) constructs bear a lysine-to-histidine substitution (K271H) in the ATP-binding site, which renders the kinase catalytically inactive. Abbreviations used are: SH3, src-homology 3; SH2 src-homology 2; FABD, F-actin binding domain; NLS, nuclear localization signal; NES nuclear export signal; cc, coiled-coil oligomerization domain; KD, kinase-defective. <bold>B and C</bold>: COS cells ectopically expressing active BCR<sub>63</sub>-ABL (<bold>B</bold>) or the kinase-defective mutant (BCR<sub>63</sub>-ABL<sup>KD</sup>) (<bold>C</bold>) were treated with the CRM1-inhibitor LMB (10 nM) for either 1 or 6 hours, which leads to accumulation in the nuclei of cells only if the protein is imported. The presence of nuclear staining in LMB-treated cells demonstrates that the protein is imported. Cells displaying notable nuclear staining (resulting from nuclear import) of BCR-ABL are marked with white arrows. The BCR-ABL kinase activity was also blocked by treatment with the kinase inhibitors imatinib (10 &#181;M) or PD166326 (10 nM) for 16 hours to enable nuclear import. BCR-ABL localization was determined by immunofluorescence staining with an anti-ABL antibody (8E9, shown in red). The endogenous ABL was not observed under the experimental conditions, which were designed to detect only the ectopically expressed proteins that were present at a much higher abundance than the endogenous ABL protein.

It thus appears that the configuration of the activation loop and helix &#945;C may not be important to the regulation of the NLS function. On the other hand, as to be shown below, the &#8220;DFG-Asp out&#8221; conformation imposed by binding to imatinib or PD166326, is likely to be critical to the regulation of the NLS function.</p><p>The kinase-defective BCR<sub>63</sub>-ABL<sup>KD</sup>, which is catalytically inactive through Lys271His (Lys290 in ABL-1b numbering) substitution in the kinase domain <xref rid="pone.0017020-Welch1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, was predominantly cytoplasmic in COS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017020-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), but became partially nuclear after 1 hour LMB treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017020-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and mostly nuclear after 6 hours LMB exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017020-g001">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017020-g002">2C</xref>).

Inhibition of the co-expressed p185-BCR-ABL kinase with imatinib re-activated the nuclear import of BCR<sub>63</sub>-ABL<sup>KD</sup>, indicated by its nuclear accumulation in response to LMB.

Conversely, mutation of tyrosines 232, 253 and 257 to phenylalanines was sufficient to block nuclear import, i.e., the BCR<sub>63</sub>-ABL<sup>3Y/F-KD</sup> required the combined treatment with imatinib and LMB to accumulate in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017020-g004">Figure 4D</xref>).

We then mutated the three critical tyrosines (Tyr232, 253 or 257) individually to glutamic acid, which mimics phosphorylation, in the BCR<sub>63</sub>-ABL<sup>KD</sup> context and found that each Y/E substitution alone is sufficient to block the nuclear import of this kinase-defective BCR<sub>63</sub>-ABL<sup>KD</sup> protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017020-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).

Because the phosphomimetic mutation of any of these three tyrosines to glutamic acid is sufficient to inhibit the nuclear import of a kinase-defective BCR<sub>63</sub>-ABL<sup>KD</sup>, phosphorylation of any of these three tyrosines is likely to block the NLS function. The unexpected finding that mutations of these three tyrosines to phenylalanines also affected the NLS function lends additional support to the notion that these three tyrosines in the ABL kinase domain are involved in the regulation of nuclear import. Tyr253 and Tyr257 are in the P-loop of the kinase N-lobe, and their hydroxyl side-chain interactions with neighboring amino acids contribute to the P-loop conformation in the current crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017020-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Tyr232 is in the SH2-kinase linker, and the X-ray structure of the ABL kinase domain shows it to be located next to the kinase N-lobe with its hydroxyl side-chain being solvent-exposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017020-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).

Together, these results suggest that autophosphorylation occurring at specific tyrosines in the SH2-kinase linker (Y232) and the kinase P-loop (Y253, 257) can affect the N-lobe conformation, which controls the NLS function.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Regulation of BCR-ABL nuclear import by the F-actin binding domain</title><p>The oligomerization of BCR-ABL also stimulates its association with F-actin stress fibers and cortical actins through an F-actin binding domain (FABD) at the C-terminus of ABL <xref rid="pone.0017020-McWhirter2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017020-McWhirter3" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017020-Skourides1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.

The kinase domain autophosphorylation-induced occlusion of the NLS also requires the C-terminal region beyond the third NLS (NLS-3) and including an intact helix-3 of the FABD. Binding of imatinib reverts the kinase domain back to the &#8220;DFG-Asp out&#8221; N-lobe conformation that alters the folding of the C-terminal region to un-mask the NLS (indicated by the green color of the three nuclear localization signals).

Previous studies have shown that phosphorylation of Tyr226 (Tyr245 in ABL-1b numbering) in the SH2-kinase linker and Tyr393 (Tyr412 in ABL-1b numbering) in the activation loop can stimulate ABL kinase activity by disrupting the auto-inhibitory assembly of the SH3/SH2/kinase domains <xref rid="pone.0017020-Brasher1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017020-Tanis1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017020-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. We have found that mutations of Tyr226, Tyr393 and four other phosphorylation sites (Tyr115, Tyr185, Tyr264, Tyr469, in ABL-1a numbering) did not have any detectable effect on the NLS function. Instead, we found that mutations of three tyrosines (Tyr232, Tyr253 and Tyr257) in the SH2-kinase linker and the kinase P-loop cause a dominant inhibition of the NLS function even in a kinase-defective BCR<sub>63</sub>-ABL. Phosphomimetic mutation of any one of those three tyrosines to glutamic acid is sufficient to inhibit the NLS function. In addition, triple mutations of all three tyrosines to phenylalanines (3Y/F) also inhibit the NLS function even in a kinase-defective BCR<sub>63</sub>-ABL. Interestingly, direct binding to imatinib can restore the NLS function in the 3Y/F mutant. These results suggest that the conformation of the kinase domain, particularly its N-lobe, plays a critical role in the regulation of the NLS function. Drawing on the X-ray structures showing that the kinase domain can adopt one of three stable configurations <xref rid="pone.0017020-Levinson1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, it appears that the NLS is only active when the kinase is in the &#8220;DFG-Asp out&#8221; configuration, which is stabilized by imatinib binding. Phosphorylation at any of these three tyrosines may shift the N-lobe away from the &#8220;DFG-Asp out&#8221; conformation and thus resulting in the inhibition of the NLS function. Removal of the hydroxyl side-chains of these three tyrosines may also alter the N-lobe conformation to inhibit the NLS function.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Regulation of BCR-ABL nuclear import by the FABD</title><p>Because BCR-ABL binds F-actin and co-localizes with actin filaments in cells <xref rid="pone.0017020-McWhirter2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017020-McWhirter3" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017020-Skourides1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, it has been suggested that BCR-ABL is tethered to F-actin and hence not imported into the nucleus <xref rid="pone.0017020-Hantschel1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Indeed, we show here that C-terminal mutations, including those that disrupt helix-3 of the FABD, can restore the NLS function even under conditions when the BCR<sub>63</sub>-ABL kinase is active and autophosphorylated. However, we found that deletion of helix-4 of the FABD (&#916;1127 and &#916;1121) was unable to release the block on the NLS function. Because helix-4 mutations disrupt the F-actin binding function of the FABD, these results show that F-actin binding <italic>per se</italic> is not required for the inhibition of the NLS function. Rather, the C-terminal region beyond the NLS-3, including the integrity of helix-3 of the FABD, is required for the activated BCR<sub>63</sub>-ABL kinase conformation to induce a blockade of the NLS function.</p><p>Taken together, our results can be accommodated by a model where the kinase domain conformation may affect the folding of the C-terminal region including the FABD to regulate the NLS function. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017020-g008">Figure 8</xref>, which represents but one of several possible scenarios, the activated kinase conformation with autophosphorylation at one of three specific tyrosine sites can influence the folding of the C-terminal region to mask the three NLS through interactions that involve an intact FABD helix-3. The imatinib-bound kinase conformation causes a change in the folding of the C-terminal region, leading to the un-masking of the three NLS.</p><p>The interplay between the kinase N-lobe conformation and the FABD is also supported by the results that FABD mutations can affect the kinase sensitivity to imatinib. In the absence of three-dimensional structural data, we can only imagine how the FABD and the region between aa-612 and aa-774, which contains the NLS-2 and NLS-3, might influence the kinase N-lobe conformation. It appears that disruption of the FABD helix-4 can shift the equilibrium of the kinase N-lobe towards those conformations that do not bind imatinib and thus causing imatinib resistance through a mechanism that also requires the sequences surrounding the NLS2 and the NLS-3 region (aa-612 to aa-774). The precise understanding of the conformational interactions among the kinase domain, the NLS region, and the FABD will await the elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of the BCR-ABL or the full-length ABL protein.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="s3c1"><title>Cell culture and reagents</title><p>The simian kidney cell line COS1 (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.
