</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>By examining the subcellular localization of mutant BCR-ABL proteins under conditions of imatinib and/or leptomycin B treatment to inhibit nuclear export, we have found that mutations of three specific tyrosines (Y232, Y253, Y257, according to ABL-1a numbering) in the kinase domain can inhibit the NLS function of kinase-proficient and kinase-defective BCR-ABL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, binding of imatinib to the kinase-defective tyrosine-mutant restored the NLS function, suggesting that the kinase domain conformation induced by imatinib-binding is critical to the re-activation of the NLS function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The C-terminal region of ABL contains an F-actin binding domain (FABD). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We examined the subcellular localization of several FABD-mutants and found that this domain is also required for the activated kinase to inhibit the NLS function; however, the binding to F-actin per se is not important. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Expression of BCR-ABL is a hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a clonal disease of hematopoietic progenitor cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The BCR-ABL fusion protein arises from a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, such that a variable portion of the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene replaces the first exon of the Abelson murine leukemia virus (ABL) proto-oncogene [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The kinase activity of the ABL non-receptor kinase is tightly regulated in normal cells [3], [4], [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>When BCR sequences are fused to ABL, oligomerization through a coiled-coil domain at the N-terminus of BCR [6], [7], [8] plus deletion of the ABL N-terminal CAP region [4], [5] constitutively activate the kinase and unleash its transforming potential [9], [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The critical role of the BCR-ABL kinase in CML has been demonstrated by the clinical efficacy of a small molecule inhibitor imatinib mesylate (STI-571, the active ingredient in GleevecTM), that binds to the ABL kinase domain [11], [12], [13], [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, the emergence of imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL in CML patients has called for the development of additional inhibitors and alternative strategies to sustain disease remission [15], [16], [17], [18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The ABL protein contains three nuclear localization signals (NLS) and a leucine-rich nuclear export sequence (NES) [19], [20], [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The normal ABL protein shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus in proliferating cells, and it accumulates in the nucleus when cells are treated with leptomycin B (LMB) [21], [22], [23], [24], an inhibitor of the nuclear export receptor Crm1/exportin-1 [25], [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The three NLS and the NES of ABL are present in the BCR-ABL fusion protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, BCR-ABL is localized exclusively to the cytoplasm [19], [27], [28], [29] and it does not accumulate in the nucleus even after LMB treatment [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase with imatinib, however, re-activates nuclear import, leading to nuclear accumulation of this oncoprotein when nuclear export is blocked with LMB [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>When trapped in the nucleus, BCR-ABL can induce cell death [22], suggesting that the oncogenic activity of BCR-ABL requires its exclusion from the nucleus. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>To gain further insights into the inhibition of the NLS function in BCR-ABL, we focused on (a) the inverse correlation between BCR-ABL kinase activity and its nuclear import, and (b) the notion that F-actin-binding is required to retain BCR-ABL in the cytoplasm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>We found that the specific mutation of tyrosines 232, 253 and 257 (referring to ABL-1a amino acid numbering), but not six other tyrosine sites in the ABL kinase domain, including Y226 (Y245 in ABL-1b numbering) or Y393 (Y412 in ABL-1b numbering), can abolish the nuclear import of even a kinase-defective BCR-ABL fusion protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>We found that inhibition of the NLS function also involves the C-terminal region of the ABL protein, as a subset of mutations in the F-actin binding domain (FABD) could re-activate the NLS function of kinase-active and autophosphorylated BCR-ABL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>However, we also identified other FABD mutations that did not re-activate BCR-ABL nuclear import despite the disruption of their binding to actin filaments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Thus the data presented here suggest that the kinase domain conformation, controlled by three specific tyrosines, and the folding of the C-terminal region, including the FABD, are key determinants in the regulation of the BCR-ABL NLS function. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that the BCR-ABL protein can accumulate in the nucleus after the combined treatment with imatinib that inhibits its kinase activity and LMB that inhibits Crm1/exportin-1 to block nuclear export [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>With a kinase-defective (KD) BCR-ABL mutant, generated by substitution of the critical Lysine in the ATP-binding site, nuclear accumulation is achieved by treatment with LMB alone, suggesting that the NLS is active in BCR-ABLKD [22] (supplementary Figure S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>We have examined the contribution of BCR sequences to the inhibition of BCR-ABL nuclear import, specifically focused on the BCR Tyr177 phosphorylation site and the BCR R91ASASRP97 region that binds to the adaptor protein 14-3-3-delta, because these BCR sequences mediate protein-protein interactions that might contribute to the cytoplasmic retention of BCR-ABL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>We have found that BCR-ABL-Y177F and BCR-ABL-Δ91-97 are localized exclusively to the cytoplasm even after LMB treatment (supplementary Figure S1), suggesting that pY177 and 14-3-3-binding are not the major determinants for the cytoplasmic localization of BCR-ABL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Previously, we have shown that fusion of the N-terminal 63 amino acids, which contain a coiled-coil oligomerization domain, is sufficient to activate the BCR-ABL kinase and cause its nuclear exclusion [6], [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>To investigate how the activated kinase causes the inhibition of its NLS function, we conducted this study with a BCR63-ABL fusion protein containing only the N-terminal BCR oligomerization domain that is necessary and sufficient for the constitutive activation of the BCR-ABL kinase activity [6], [7] (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>The subcellular localization of BCR63-ABL and its response to imatinib and LMB are therefore similar to that of p210- and p185-BCR-ABL [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>The nuclear accumulation of BCR63-ABL was also achieved with the combined treatment of LMB plus PD166326, which is another ABL kinase inhibitor (Figure 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Binding of PD166326 and imatinib to the ABL kinase domain requires the “DFG-Asp out” conformation of the kinase N-lobe [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>However, the catalytic site conformation, particularly the activation loop and the helix αC of PD166326- and imatinib-bound ABL kinase domains are not identical [4], [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>It thus appears that the configuration of the activation loop and helix αC may not be important to the regulation of the NLS function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, as to be shown below, the “DFG-Asp out” conformation imposed by binding to imatinib or PD166326, is likely to be critical to the regulation of the NLS function. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>This demonstrates that BCR63-ABLKD, similar to BCR-ABLKD [22](supplementary Figure S1), can undergo nucleo-cytoplasmic shutting, and the continuous nuclear import allows its nuclear accumulation when export is blocked by LMB. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>To determine if autophosphorylation is responsible for inhibiting the NLS function, we co-expressed p185-BCR-ABL with BCR63-ABLKD to allow trans-phosphorylation of the kinase-defective protein via oligomerization through the BCR coiled-coil (Figure 2B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>When co-expressed with p185-BCR-ABL, the BCR63-ABLKD protein became tyrosine phosphorylated and did remain cytoplasmic after LMB treatment, as revealed by immunofluorescence against the HA-tag present only in the BCR63-ABLKD protein (Figure 2C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of the co-expressed p185-BCR-ABL kinase with imatinib re-activated the nuclear import of BCR63-ABLKD, indicated by its nuclear accumulation in response to LMB. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>We then repeated these experiments with β53-BCR63-ABLKD, which has a β-turn inserted at position 53 to disrupt the coiled-coil oligomerization domain [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Co-expression with p185-BCR-ABL induced a very low level of phosphotyrosine in the β53-BCR63-ABLKD (Figure 2B), and correspondingly, it did not inhibit the nuclear import of β53-BCR63-ABLKD (Figure 2C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>We also found that p185-BCR-ABL did not affect the subcellular localization of ABL, which does not become tyrosine phosphorylated and showed continuous nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling (supplementary Figure S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of BCR63-ABL, rather than its catalytic activity per se, can lead to the inhibition of its nuclear import. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>To further address the role of autophosphorylation in the regulation of the NLS function, we mutated those nine tyrosines to phenylalanines creating a mutant termed BCR63-ABL9Y/F (Figure 3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Indeed, this 9Y/F-mutant was poorly autophosphorylated (Figure 3B), and was weakly phosphorylated in trans by p185-BCR-ABL (Figure 3C). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, imatinib could again override the 9Y/F effect and induce nuclear import of BCR63-ABL9Y/F-KD (Figure 4B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the stimulatory effect of imatinib on the nuclear import of the 9Y/F-KD-mutant was indeed caused by binding of the drug to the mutant protein, we introduced another amino acid substitution, T315I, which confers imatinib-resistance through interference with drug binding [18]. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>The interplay between the kinase N-lobe conformation and the FABD is also supported by the results that FABD mutations can affect the kinase sensitivity to imatinib. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>In the absence of three-dimensional structural data, we can only imagine how the FABD and the region between aa-612 and aa-774, which contains the NLS-2 and NLS-3, might influence the kinase N-lobe conformation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>It appears that disruption of the FABD helix-4 can shift the equilibrium of the kinase N-lobe towards those conformations that do not bind imatinib and thus causing imatinib resistance through a mechanism that also requires the sequences surrounding the NLS2 and the NLS-3 region (aa-612 to aa-774). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>The precise understanding of the conformational interactions among the kinase domain, the NLS region, and the FABD will await the elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of the BCR-ABL or the full-length ABL protein. </plain></SENT>
