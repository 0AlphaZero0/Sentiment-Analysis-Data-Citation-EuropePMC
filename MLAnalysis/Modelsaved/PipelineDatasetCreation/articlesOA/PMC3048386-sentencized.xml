<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The established hypothesis is that the reduced affinity of the phosphorylated munc18a to syntaxin-1a is a result of local electrostatic repulsion between the two proteins, which interferes with their compatibility. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we suggest that the reduced affinity of the phosphomimetic mutant/phosphorylated munc18a is a result of the closed-cavity conformation, which makes syntaxin binding energetically and sterically unfavorable. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Intracellular membrane fusion in eukaryotes is mediated by a well-conserved fusion machinery composed of SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) and SM (Sec1/munc18-like) proteins [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In the early studies, munc18a was shown to bind syntaxin, one of the central SNARE members and block ternary SNARE complex formation, suggesting that it plays a negative regulatory role [2], [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>However, genetic and biochemical studies indicated that SM proteins play a positive essential role as demonstrated by their null mutants; studies with mutated worms, flies and mice lacking munc18a, revealed a dramatic decrease in secretory granule fusion, docking and priming [4], [5], [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the central hypothesis, to date, is that SM proteins play several roles depending on their mode of binding to the SNARE members [7], [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The first mode of interaction that was discovered [9] relates to the binding of munc18a to a stable closed-conformation of syntaxin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>This mode of interaction allows the specific transfer of syntaxin through the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane, keeping syntaxin from engaging to ectopic intracellular SNARE complexes [10], [11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Recent studies demonstrate that SM proteins bind only or additionally to a short peptide present at the N-terminus of syntaxin, designated as the N-peptide [1], [10], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>This mode of interaction was intensively investigated in the last few years and its importance is under a strong debate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>One of the main hypotheses for the role of the interaction of munc18a with the N-terminal of syntaxin is that this interaction allows munc18a to bind the SNARE ternary complex suggesting a stimulatory role for munc18a in the last stages of SNARE-mediated fusion [13]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) or phosphomimetic mutations in residues 306 and 313 (S306D, S313D) of munc18a modulate this interaction by reducing the affinity to form a complex [14], [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have suggested that replacement of the polar serine moieties in domain 3a of munc18a by phosphate groups or negatively charged glutamates disrupts the complex due to electrostatic repulsion between munc18a and the adjacent area of syntaxin (Figure 1B), which contains acidic residues [14]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>The β-hairpin in domain 3a of munc18a (residues 261–280) plays a prominent role in the interaction of munc18a with syntaxin-1a. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Eight amino-acid residues out of the 19 that compose the β-hairpin are engaged in interactions with the H3 domain of syntaxin, making the hairpin an essential element in the binding of syntaxin, and in keeping syntaxin in its closed (inactive) structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Therefore, any fluctuations in the position of the β-hairpin might influence the affinity of syntaxin to munc18a and might cause syntaxin to alternate to its open structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the munc18a structure to the crystal structure of Sly1p, the yeast Golgi homolog of munc18a (1mqs.pdb, downloaded from PDB [23]) indicates that the hairpin of the later, although partially unstructured, resides in a much higher position than in the munc18a crystal structure (Figure 3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>In this structure, the Golgi resident syntaxin (sed5p) is absent from the cavity area and the crystal structure only includes its N-terminal peptide which is bound to the area of domain 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in simulation 2 of munc18a (Table 1), we traced a prominent motion of the β-hairpin of the protein, moving during the simulation from its original location in the crystal structure outwards and upwards, protruding from the rest of the protein (Figure 3, B and C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>This motion, resulting in a position similar to that seen in the crystal structure of the Sly1p, confirms the possibility raised before that the motion of the β-hairpin might serve as a mechanism for the release of syntaxin from the cavity area [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>To further confirm this notion, we reconstructed the full structure of Sly1p (see Methods) and performed a simulation of its dynamics under the same conditions of the munc18a simulations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>We focused on the movement of the β-hairpin in domain 3a (residues 298 to 327) during the simulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Indeed, during the 20 ns of the simulation, we observed an extensive rotation-translation movement of this region downwards approaching domain 3a (Figure 3D) and consequently narrowing the width of the cavity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Thus, the β-hairpin might serve as a gate for the cavity, opening and closing the cavity when needed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we show that this motion can occur spontaneously with no interference from any additional factor(s); although we cannot determine the probability of this type of motion in the free or syntaxin-bound munc18a, these data support the hypothesis that the β-hairpin serves as a switch for syntaxin-binding or unbinding. </plain></SENT>
