</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Marine invertebrates such as sponges, ascidians, and mollusks are sources of abundant and diverse secondary metabolites, many of which are drugs or drug leads [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The metabolites impact marine environments, and many have defined biological roles, for example helping animals to evade predation on coral reefs [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A major unanswered question has been what controls the distribution and synthesis of these animal compounds across the oceans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Marine invertebrate natural products are often very sporadic in their occurrence, and chemistry varies between seemingly identical samples, even from animals living next to each other [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that a number of marine invertebrate natural products are actually synthesized by symbiotic bacteria [5], [6], [7], which is especially striking because some of these “bacterial” molecules may be critical for survival of hosts. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Secondary metabolism represents one of the most common and varied features of bacterial genomes [8], [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Animals harness this diverse bacterial metabolism for their survival, and it is increasingly apparent that this is a widespread phenomenon on both land and sea [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>For example, in wasps a symbiotic bacterial species synthesizes a mini-library of antibiotic secondary metabolites to protect the animal larvae from bacterial infection [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, very little is known about how animals obtain these defenses or about what controls variation in defensive chemicals found in animals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In cultivated bacteria, even in closely related strains chemistry is quite variable, but these strains have been removed from their environment, so that no immediate environmental relevance can be discerned. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In addition, in cultivated bacteria there are usually many mutations between strains, so that precise genomic changes underlying chemical variation cannot be readily determined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>By contrast, symbiosis affords an opportunity to examine immediately the effects of genomic changes in the real environment, and very precise genomic changes can be identified [10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>For example, about 1000 natural products have been isolated from marine ascidian animals, including more than 60 cyclic peptides of the cyanobactin class that form large families of related compounds [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>These potently cytotoxic compounds are often abundant components of the biomass, to the point that they are the major constituents of whole animal extracts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In addition, some species of ascidians house uncultivated cyanobacterial symbionts, Prochloron didemni, which form near monocultures in whole animals that can be readily observed by eye because of the resulting bright green color of the hosts (Figure 1) [13]. P. didemni is important to both the primary and secondary metabolism of host ascidians, and in some cases it has been shown to be essential for ascidian survival. P. didemni transfers fixed carbon and recycles nitrogen waste for the host ascidians, allowing the animals to survive in low-nutrient, high-light intensity environments [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>We previously demonstrated that P. didemni synthesizes cyanobactin secondary metabolites isolated from whole ascidians and that bacterial strain variation underlies the varied “ascidian” natural products (Figure 1) [6], [15], [16], [17]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Ascidian colonies are able to divide and fuse in just a few days [20], possibly facilitating such exchange. P. didemni inhabits many different species of ascidians that occupy different habitats [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Here, we apply metagenomic sequencing and chemical analysis to examine variation over whole genomes across the tropical Pacific. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Three samples containing P. didemni were deeply sequenced, providing high-resolution data of the genomic changes across the tropical Pacific and defining three types of precise genomic changes that lead to libraries of natural products in animal-bacteria associations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>We show that the observed strain variation is largely focused in sporadically distributed secondary metabolic gene clusters, providing the animal-bacterial assemblages with a variable arsenal of chemical products in an otherwise conserved genomic background. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates the power of analyzing biosynthetic genes from closely related symbionts for the study of pathway evolution as well as for drug discovery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Two new cyanobactins were identified in chemical extracts, and three types of pathway evolution were observed at a very fine scale. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>The phenomenon of secondary metabolite variation within and between strains is very well known. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Pathway variation has been extensively studied in actinomycetes at the genomic level, although in general too many changes in gene content, conservation, and order are present to draw the conclusions apparent from this study [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Similar myxobacterial strains have been examined chemically, showing sporadic presence/absence of pathway types, but it is currently unclear how this will manifest at the genome level [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>We previously described hypervariability within pat and tru precursors, and more recently extreme hypervariability in ribosomal precursor peptide sequences has been described in a number of additional bacterial strains, using bacteria that are not as closely interrelated as in this study [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>However, in no case so far is the DNA sequence identical except in the very small core region of these peptides. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>The closely related symbionts, P. didemni, provide a laboratory in which three levels of precisely observable genomic change lead to an arsenal of variable natural products. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>We speculate that this sporadic pattern might be driven by the processes controlling the symbiosis and a need to evolve new defense strategies for the host. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>As one example, the patellamides, trunkamide, and relatives comprise up to 1% of the dry weight of whole animal-bacterial assemblages, and in some cases they exhibit low nanomolar toxicity to human cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Therefore, cyanobactins are potent enough and present in great enough quantity to influence the ascidian animal and, potentially, predators or competing bacteria, although this is a speculative role. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Moreover, other pathways discovered in P.didemni are predicted to synthesize compounds active against possible competing microbes, such as the products of pyr and nkd. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>It is worth re-emphasizing here that the observed distribution was sporadic – that is, there was no pattern of co-occurrence, defying simplified attempts at defining roles for these compounds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Such simplified statements about natural products are unfortunately very common but serve to obscure the reality of extreme metabolite variation that is actually observed in nature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>In this study, we show that natural products are distributed in a truly sporadic manner across a population and that it is the major variable feature in that population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Since the primary role of bacterial recombination is to repress diversity [38], we propose that the variation itself, and not the persistence of individual molecules, is the important factor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Instead of producing only a few compounds, this mechanism allows the population of P. didemni to obtain and combinatorialize diverse small molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>In turn, access to these molecules would help the ascidians and bacteria to face the varying challenges that are actually encountered in nature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Ascidian fusion and fission takes place in the course of just a few days [20], allowing this selection to play out rapidly in response to new challenges. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>It has long been anecdotally known that seemingly identical marine animals contain different natural products, even when they live adjacently. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>This has been especially true in the didemnid family ascidians, where neighboring colonies seem to have different chemistry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Here, we take a whole genome approach and demonstrate a new process of genetic exchange governing the distribution of secondary metabolites in the ocean. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>The sporadic variation hypothesis explains the observed variation of natural products in ascidians that harbor Prochloron, and similar types of pathway variation may impact distribution of other important marine natural products from ascidians, sponges, and other groups of invertebrates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the Piel group recently described polyketide synthase genes and a housekeeping gene from bacterial symbionts of sponges [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Although the polyketide synthase genes were sometimes present and sometimes absent, a housekeeping gene was very nearly identical in samples harboring or missing the polyketide pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>It thus appears that pathway variation within otherwise nearly identical symbionts may be a widespread phenomenon that governs the distribution of many marine invertebrate natural products. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>The resulting natural products play major roles in the environment, in physiological function, and in drug development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>However, this trend is not universal: for example, it is likely that the bryostatin pathway in bryozoans does not follow this model [40]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that analysis of symbiotic metagenomes provides precise resolution of pathway presence and evolution and may therefore be of use in informing synthetic biology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>These results also help to explain the distribution of pharmaceutically important natural products from marine invertebrates and support continuing exploring a species for new natural compounds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Since colonies of otherwise identical ascidians can vary in the chemistry produced, there is potentially an enormous reservoir of undiscovered compounds in these organisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>This chemical diversity can be explored by simple PCR-based analysis, which can direct chemical efforts as exemplified by the discovery of mollamides D and E. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Although ribosomal peptides afford a relatively simple example since the products are directly genetically encoded, as technologies improve this discovery method will be possible for other natural product pathway types as well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>We provide proof-of-concept that individual, adjacent animal colonies differ in their natural product arsenal, implying a new model for discovery of marine natural products. </plain></SENT>
