</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) is a disease of unknown aetiology characterised by arthritis and systemic symptoms starting before the age of 16.1 The most characteristic feature at onset is spiking fever, which is often associated with an evanescent skin rash, hepatosplenomegaly and pericarditis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, methotrexate and antitumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents are often only partially effective.2 3 The anti-interleukin 6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab was effective in one randomised withdrawal trial.4 Patients with a persistently systematically active course 6 months after disease onset, while receiving corticosteroid treatment, are at high risk of longlasting, non-remitting or polycyclic disease.5 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Interleukin 1 (IL-1) has an important role in SJIA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In particular, serum samples from patients with SJIA induce IL-1β transcription on healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and treatment with the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) anakinra leads to the normalisation of a disease-specific gene expression profile.6 7 Non-controlled pilot studies provide evidence of dramatic, quick responses to anakinra in a subgroup of patients with SJIA.6 8–10 However, some patients may have a self-remitting course, and no placebo-controlled studies have been published to evaluate the effects of IL-1 blockade. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>We therefore designed a trial aiming at assessing the efficacy of anakinra treatment, and its effect on blood gene expression profiling, in patients with SJIA displaying active systemic disease despite corticosteroid treatment. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>This double-blind, placebo-controlled study demonstrated the efficacy of anakinra in treating corticosteroid-dependent patients with SJIA, as a significantly higher proportion of responders was observed after 1 month of treatment compared with placebo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>However, a loss of response was observed in most patients over time. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of anakinra treatment in SJIA, at least in the short term, concorded with previous reports.6 8–10 However, the only other placebo-controlled trial testing anakinra in JIA showed no significant improvement versus placebo,18 illustrating that marked response to IL-1 inhibition is not characteristic of all JIA subtypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>The lack of sustained response in several patients may have been related to several factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>First, most patients had diffuse polyarthritis at enrolment but no fever; as previously reported,9 anakinra seemed less effective on the arthritis than on systemic features. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Second, PK data suggested that low-weight children might have benefited from a higher anakinra dosage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Third, we included patients with active SJIA, steroid-dependency and a minimal disease duration of 6 months, therefore difficult to treat5; loss of responses may have been favoured by the study design that precluded the use of associated DMARDs and allowed tapering of the corticosteroid dose at an early stage, a strategy designed to minimise the risk of treatment-related complications. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>This study has limitations owing to the small number of patients and the short duration of the double-blind phase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>In particular, we were unable to properly assess which patients' characteristics might predict response to treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>In recent reports, the absence of small joint involvement, a smaller number of joints with active disease and an increased absolute neutrophil count were reported to be predictive of response to anakinra.9 10 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>No severe infections occurred in this trial and anti-pneumococcal Ab response was not affected by anakinra treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>However, severe infections have been reported under anakinra in adults with rheumatoid arthritis.19 One patient here was diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease, a complication reported in some patients initially diagnosed with JIA and treated with anti-TNF agents.3 20 21 An additional patient experienced a sudden rise in serum transaminases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>In order to draw definitive conclusions about the safety of anakinra in SJIA, further studies with larger numbers of patients and longer follow-up need to be implemented. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>As expected, the ex vivo genomic analysis of patient blood at D1 showed upregulation of transcripts related to innate immunity and haematopoiesis (supplementary table S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Although several hereditary and sporadic IL-1β-mediated diseases involve alterations in NLRP3 inflammasome components,22 no altered expression of NLRP3 inflammasome-related transcripts was observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>However, two different flagellin receptors (CARD12 and TLR5) were significantly upregulated in the majority of patients at D1 (supplementary table S2) and normalised in the responder group at M6 (supplementary table S5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Whether the triggering of flagellin receptors is involved in the pathogenesis of SJIA remains to be elucidated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Alterations in the blood gene expression profiles of patients with SJIA at the time of randomisation were highly reproducible in the treatment and placebo groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>This was best visualised using a strategy based on the analysis of modules composed of transcriptionally co-regulated genes.14 Longitudinal changes correlating with disease resolution were found upon follow-up. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Changes probably induced by treatment, regardless of clinical response, were also identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, an upregulation of type I IFN-regulated transcripts, which is not a feature of untreated SJIA,7 23–25 was induced in the majority of anakinra-treated patients at M1 and M6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, two IFN-inducible proteins were also significantly upregulated in the serum samples of patients at M6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>The molecular and cellular basis for an IL-1 β/type I IFN cross-regulation in SJIA remains unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of type I IFN signalling by IL-1β might occur through the induction of SOCS3, which is a negative regulator of IL-1-dependent acute inflammatory arthritis and osteoclast generation.26 27 Conversely, type I IFN decreases IL-1β and induces IL-1Ra production by PBMCs in vitro.28 A similar cross-regulation has been described for type I IFN and TNFα. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Thus, patients with SJIA treated with TNF antagonists develop a blood IFN signature.29 Furthermore, a significant proportion of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease treated with TNF antagonists develop anti-nuclear Abs and some of them display symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus, a type I IFN-mediated disease.29 Whether the upregulation of type I IFN-inducible genes in anakinra-treated patients could have clinical consequences through the triggering of adaptive immunity remains to be determined. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a significant proportion of patients with SJIA responded to IL-1 blockade as dramatically as patients with autoinflammatory syndromes, confirming a key role for IL-1 in a wide spectrum of diseases.30 Furthermore, clinical response and cytokine cascades induced upon IL1 blockade can be followed using blood gene expression profiling. </plain></SENT>
