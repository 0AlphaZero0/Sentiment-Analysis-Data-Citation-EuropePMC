</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Traditional antibiotics are increasingly suffering from the emergence of multidrug resistance amongst pathogenic bacteria leading to a range of novel approaches to control microbial infections being investigated as potential alternative treatments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One plausible antimicrobial alternative could be the combination of conventional antimicrobial agents/antibiotics with small molecules which block multidrug efflux systems known as efflux pump inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bioassay-driven purification and structural determination of compounds from plant sources have yielded a number of pump inhibitors which acted against gram positive bacteria. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this study we report the identification and characterization of 4′,5′-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid (4′,5′-ODCQA) from Artemisia absinthium as a pump inhibitor with a potential of targeting efflux systems in a wide panel of Gram-positive human pathogenic bacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Separation and identification of phenolic compounds (chlorogenic acid, 3′,5′-ODCQA, 4′,5′-ODCQA) was based on hyphenated chromatographic techniques such as liquid chromatography with post column solid-phase extraction coupled with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Microbial susceptibility testing and potentiation of well know pump substrates revealed at least two active compounds; chlorogenic acid with weak antimicrobial activity and 4′,5′-ODCQA with pump inhibitory activity whereas 3′,5′-ODCQA was ineffective. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These intitial findings were further validated with checkerboard, berberine accumulation efflux assays using efflux-related phenotypes and clinical isolates as well as molecular modeling methodology. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The calculated energetics of the docking poses supported the biological information for the inhibitory capabilities of 4′,5′-ODCQA and furthermore contributed evidence that CQAs show a preferential binding to Major Facilitator Super family efflux systems, a key multidrug resistance determinant in gram-positive bacteria. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Multi-drug resistant microbial infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis represent an exponentially growing problem affecting communities worldwide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Efflux mechanisms have become broadly recognized as major components of resistance to many classes of antibiotics [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Some efflux pumps selectively extrude specific antibiotics while others, referred to as multidrug efflux pumps (MEPs), expel a variety of structurally and functionally diverse compounds [3] in addition to a variety of other physiological roles [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>A novel and promising approach to deal with multidrug resistance is to improve the clinical performance of various antibiotics by employing efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) [5], [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Plants have been explored comprehensively as potential sources of antimicrobials [7], [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>It has been established that disabling MEPs in Gram-negative species using a combination of MEP mutants and synthetic EPIs leads to a striking increase in the activity of numerous plant compounds [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Several Berberis medicinal plants (Berberis repens, B. aquifolia, and B. fremontii) that produce the plant antimicrobial berberine also synthesized an inhibitor of the Staphylococcus aureus NorA MEP identified as 5′-methoxyhydnocarpin (5′-MHC) [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Identification of 5′-MHC intensified the search for natural EPIs of plant origin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Bioassay driven purification and structural determination of compounds from various plant sources yielded a number of EPIs acting against Gram- positive bacteria with activities similar to 5′-MHC [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Gram-negative bacteria and fungi comprise the main groups of plant pathogens, and it is important to determine whether the antimicrobial/EPI synergy is a general mechanism of plant defense. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Artemisia is a fairly large genus within the family of the Asteraceae (Compositae), with more than 200 individual species [17]. Artemisia absinthium, best known as the principal ingredient in the infamous Absinthe drink, has been used medicinally since the times of ancient Greece, and also in western European systems of traditional medicine [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>It was recently reported that the essential oils occurring in flowers and aerial parts from A. absinthium have antimicrobial properties [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Moreover aqueous extracts of A. absinthium are rich in caffeoyl and dicaffeoylquinic acids, which are known to inhibit HIV-1 integrase from integrating the reversibly transcribed viral DNA into host cell DNA [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these components are hepatoprotective, anti-histaminic, hypocholesterolemic, anti-spasmodic, and potentially antimicrobial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>They also demonstrate high antioxidant activity [19] due to their o-quinone moieties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Caffeoylquinic acids could inhibit oxidative damage to both low-density lipoprotein [20] and linolenic acid [21] by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) related to cancer and cardiovascular diseases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that chlorogenic acid (5-O-caffeoylquinic acid) had inhibitory effects on carcinogenesis in the large intestine, liver, and tongue, and exhibited protective effects on oxidative stress in vivo [22]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The effort to discover plant EPIs, a process ranging from identifying a hit to isolating a pure compound, presents a distinct bottleneck: the lack of comprehensive, chemically and biologically representative natural product extract libraries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Analysis of natural product extracts is time-consuming and laborious, consisting of the isolation of different components of the extract and the successive identification of these compounds by spectrometric data acquisition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>We have identified EPI activity against Gram-positive bacteria in A. absinthium extracts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>We dramatically expedited the analysis of A. absinthium aquatic infusions using analytical techniques (LC-SPE-NMR and LC-MS), revealing caffeoylquinic acids as key components. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Subsequent antimicrobial susceptibility testing of berberine uptake and a competitive efflux assay employing the pure compounds was conducted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>An array of pathogens, including knock out and over expression MEP mutants, strongly supported the hypothesis that 4′,5′-ODCQA behaves as a designated EPI for the major facilitator super family (MFS) MEPs of the Gram-positive bacteria: S. aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The experimental approach to detect EPI activity was to test the combined action of a plant extract (the no alkaloid fraction) with berberine added at a sub inhibitory concentration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Extracts that inhibited cell growth in the presence of berberine and had no activity when added alone were likely to contain an EPI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Chloroform extracts of leaves from A. absinthum had no antimicrobial activity alone at up to 500 µg/ml ( Table 1 ), but inhibited Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus growth completely in the presence of 30 µg/ml berberine (15 µg/ml berberine for Bacillus cells), a concentration one-eighth the MIC for this substance (data not shown). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>We obtained 5′-O-caffeoylquinic (5′-OCQA) acid and peracetylderivatives 1′,3′- and 1′,5′-ODCQA, 3′,5′-ODCQA and 4′,5′-ODCQA, and tested their direct antimicrobial and EPI activity ( Table 1 ). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>5′-OCQA was the only molecule with weak direct antimicrobial activity against the Gram-positive bacteria (B. cereus and E. faecalis, MIC 64 µg/ml). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>There was a 4-fold difference between MICs in S. aureus 8325-4 and the isogenic NorA mutant providing supporting evidence for 5′-OCQA as a potential substrate of MFS efflux systems. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Hemolysis experiments using sheep erythrocytes and DCQA derivatives demonstrated no hemolytic activity at 50 µM, a concentration higher than the MICs for Gram-positive and significantly higher than the concentration used for antimicrobial potentiation ( Figure 1 ). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>There are a few brief reports discussing the toxic effect of 5′-OCQA on human oral squamous cell carcinoma (HSC-2) and salivary gland tumor (HSG) cell lines, as compared with that against human gingival fibroblast (HGF), and erythrocytes in a mM range [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The toxic effect is attributed to the potential of the compound to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>A dose-response experiment using erythrocytes was also able to detect toxicity of 5′-OCQA at fairly low concentrations, (1-5 µM) whereas 3′,5′- and 4′,5′-ODCQAs did not exhibit any cell-lytic properties at significantly higher concentrations (50 µM). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>This trend, together with existing studies [22], [26], suggest that 5′-OCQA is toxic at high concentrations, and implies that the other derivatives appear to have a different interaction pattern with mammalian cells, suggesting that a therapeutic window may exist in both cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>3′,5′-ODCQA and 4′,5′-ODCQA showed extremely low toxicity to the blood cells indicating that the antimicrobial activity and toxicity patterns are relatively similar related to the differences in substitution moieties. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>This indicated a synergistic effect for 4′,5′-ODCQA, an′d competition for the other two derivatives. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>We employ a clinical MRSA strain (CA-300) and conducted extensive checkerboard assays using an array of known MFS substrates and 4′,5′-ODCQA suggesting a promising range of activity both in different strains and clinically relevant compounds ( Table 3  ). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>We further evaluated the ability of 4′,5′-ODCQA to potentiate designated substrates of MFS and known antibiotics against a panel of Gram-positive phenotypes ( Tables 4  ,   5 ). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>The activity of all of the MFS substrates increased significantly in the presence of the compound against the wild-type strains tested (8-fold for berberine, and 4-8-fold for EtBr and fluroquinolones). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>The addition of 4′,5′-ODCQA in the more susceptible E. faecalis NorA knock out mutant ( Table 5 ) increased the susceptibility of EtBr and norfloxacin (2–4 fold). </plain></SENT>
