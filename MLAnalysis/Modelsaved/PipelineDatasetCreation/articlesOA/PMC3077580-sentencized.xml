<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It inhibits microvessel formation but not the larger, pre-existing vessels, pointing toward tumor specificity (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The profound anti-tumor effect is found both on tumor growth and on established tumors in human xenograft mouse models (2). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A two-hybrid screen using anginex as bait revealed the small soluble lectin galectin-1 as a potential target, and the requirement of galectin-1 for the anti-angiogenic effect of anginex was demonstrated using galectin-1-null mutant mice (3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This and other studies on galectin-1 (4–6) suggested a rate-limiting role of galectin-1 in tumor angiogenesis and indicated that anginex interferes with the pro-angiogenic effect of galectin-1. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Galectin-1 consists of an ∼135-amino acid canonical galectin carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD),2 which exists as a mixture of monomers and dimers at physiological concentrations (7, 8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Similar to other galectins, its main known biochemical function is to bind β-galactoside-containing glycoproteins and cross-link them, which may result in various cellular signals and consequent effects in immunity, inflammation, and cancer (5, 9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore we analyzed the effect of anginex on the carbohydrate binding activity of galectin-1, with the hypothesis that it would act as an inhibitor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, we instead found that anginex may strongly enhance binding of galectin-1 to certain glycoconjugates. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The interaction between anginex and galectin-1 was investigated using an FA assay (8, 15). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In this assay, the interactions of galectin-1 with fluorescein-tagged saccharide probes were studied, as well as the perturbing effects of potential inhibitors/modifiers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>With a fixed concentration of a newly designed high affinity tdga-probe (8) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/C111.229096/DC1">supplemental Fig. S2A</ext-link>) and increasing concentrations of galectin-1, the anisotropy rose from a value of ∼30 mA (A0 = anisotropy of the free probe) to ∼170 mA (Amax = anisotropy of the galectin-probe complex) following a curve of shape consistent with a 1:1 interaction and position along x axis consistent with a Kd ∼0.4 μm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>With the same probe and galectin concentrations in the presence of 8 μm anginex (Fig. 1A), the curve shifted to the left, indicative of higher binding affinity (Kd ∼0.02 μm), and Amax became higher (∼235 mA), indicative of more restricted mobility of the fluorescein tag in the galectin-probe complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>With the LNT-probe (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/C111.229096/DC1">supplemental Fig. S2B</ext-link>), there was no rise in the anisotropy with increasing galectin-1 concentrations, due in part to lower affinity (Kd ∼100 μm) but also higher segmental mobility of the fluorescein tag even in the galectin-probe complex, probably because the galectin binds the terminal disaccharide (as indicated in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/C111.229096/DC1">supplemental Fig. S2B</ext-link> and discussed in detail for other galectins (10, 14)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In the presence of anginex, however, the LNT-probe also gave a clear rise in anisotropy (to ∼120 mA) and a curve consistent with a Kd ∼5 μm (Fig. 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>With both probes, in the presence of anginex, the anisotropy values started to drop when the galectin concentration started to exceed the anginex concentration, most likely due to competition by anginex-free galectin for the probe. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>However, this is not the case for fetuin, where a residual of about 10–20% bound probe is observed even at higher fetuin concentrations, which may be due to the fact that fetuin is a poor inhibitor for free galectin-1.

<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>In this assay type, a range of galectin concentrations was mixed with fixed concentrations of tdga-probe (0.1 μm), glycoprotein (0 or 0.1 μm), and anginex (0 or 8 μm), the percentage of bound probe was calculated from the fluorescence anisotropy (Fig. 2C), and the concentrations of free and glycoprotein-bound galectin-1 were calculated to construct Scatchard plots (Fig. 2E). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Galectin-2 and -7 and the N-terminal CRDs of galectin-8 and -9, but not galectin-3 and -4 and the C-terminal CRD of galectin-9, showed an increased anisotropy, indicating interaction with anginex (Fig. 3C). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>In summary, we have found that the synthetic anti-angiogenic peptide anginex dramatically enhances the affinity of galectin-1 for certain ligands, including biologically relevant glycoproteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>In fact, this apparently monovalent interaction has among the highest affinities (Kd low nm) ever reported for a lectin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the precise mechanism of this and its consequences in cellular systems will require further study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Because anginex tends to form dimers and larger aggregates (3, 13), the mechanism for its effect may entail increased cross-linking of galectin-1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>However, more specific conformational modification of a single CRD is also possible. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>One possible general explanation for the biological effects of anginex may be due to shifts of galectin-1 receptor binding equilibria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Many of the proposed regulatory effects of galectin-1 appear to involve reversible binding to receptors with affinities in the low μm range (17–19), perhaps with reversible formation and dissolution of cross-linked lattices (4, 9, 20, 21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>If affinity for certain ligands were increased hundred- to thousand-fold, as seen here, such equilibria would be dramatically altered. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>The anginex effect on galectin-1 may also mimic a normal function; it is hard to believe that an artificial peptide can show such dramatic effects without speculating that there is a natural counterpart in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>This also becomes an intriguing thought because galectin-1 in some cases showed biological effects at nm concentrations (e.g. Fig. 3 in Ref. 6) or surprisingly little was needed to rescue the null phenotype in mice in vivo (22) despite the fact that, as mentioned above, most known ligands have affinities in the μm range. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>There are many text book cases where strong binding activity of one protein is induced by another protein or smaller molecule, but it has not been found before for the carbohydrate binding activity of galectins, or perhaps not even lectins in general (except for cations). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>The fluorescence anisotropy assay used here provides a simple screening method to find natural modifiers of galectin ligand binding and also to select designed peptides with similar effects, for example, in the search for new improved versions of anginex as anti-cancer agents. </plain></SENT>
