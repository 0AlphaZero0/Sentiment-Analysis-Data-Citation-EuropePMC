</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Large datasets consisting of hundreds of thousands and even millions of sequences are produced with high-throughput sequencing technologies, and developing methods for accurate and efficient analysis of these datasets is a growing challenge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>It is currently computationally intractable to make individual taxonomic assignments with de novo phylogenetic tree construction approaches for such large numbers of sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In order to make taxonomic divisions for large 16S rRNA gene datasets two fundamentally different approaches have been used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>16S rDNA sequences from bacteria have been grouped into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with distance-based agglomerative clustering approaches such as MOTHUR [1] Cd-hit [2], and QIIME [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Alternatively 16S rDNA sequences have been identified and classified by comparing novel sequences to a comprehensive reference database for which taxonomic assignments have previously been made. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>General reference databases include the GenBank nucleotide database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore</ext-link>) and the more highly curated and specialized Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) (rdp.cme.msu.edu/), SILVA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arb-silva.de">www.arb-silva.de</ext-link>) and greengenes (greengenes.lbl.gov) databases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Tools for identification and assignment of sequences against databases include Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) [4], BLAST-Like Alignment Tool (BLAT) [5], RDP Sequence Match [6] and the RDP Classifier [7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Agglomerative approaches such as MOTHUR [1] are particularly valuable for characterization of understudied microbial communities because they can be applied without prior knowledge of the taxonomy of the community. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>But a disadvantage for analysis of better-defined communities is lack of connection to taxonomic assignments made on the basis of information beyond the 16S sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Although the general concept of species divisions for bacteria has been regarded as problematic, there are a number of species definitions that are meaningful in the context of human health and disease, and being able to use this information with 16S sequencing efforts is important. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Another problem inherent in agglomerative approaches is the inability to link short sequences from different regions of the 16S gene that belong to the same OTU. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Identification of 16S sequences by comparison to curated databases offers the potential to address these problems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Taxonomic information can be attached to sequences, and fragments from different regions of the same 16S sequence can be linked. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Short sequences can be matched to longer reference sequences for which it is possible to more robustly reconstruct phylogeny and make taxonomic assignments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>However, despite curation efforts, many of the sequences in the large public databases are of questionable quality [8], [9], [10], [11], or are inaccurately classified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>A study using a Bayesian classifier found that as many as 5.5% of near full length sequences from well-characterized species were taxonomically anomalous at the level of genus in a test against the RDP [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The problem of identification is undoubtedly greater for the shorter reads of high-throughput sequencing methods, for uncharacterized OTUs, and at the level of species, which may be critical for human microbiome studies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In addition, the number of incompletely characterized sequences in the public databases has been growing at a rapid rate, especially in GenBank. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>As a result, when new 16S sequence data are compared via BLAST to GenBank and other public databases, the high-scoring pairs may include only uncultured and unclassified bacteria that are of little use for identification and taxonomic assignment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The oral microbiome includes many uncultivated and unclassified bacteria, making studies to elucidate the etiology of chronic oral infectious diseases, such as dental caries and periodontitis, challenging. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>For the large datasets generated using high-throughput methods it is impractical to manually examine and correct taxonomic assignments, so the development of accurate and efficient approaches to characterizing the human microbiome is essential. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In order to address these problems, we developed a 16S database of the core human oral microbiome (CORE). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The intent was to include a comprehensive, minimally redundant representation of the bacteria that regularly reside in the human oral cavity with computationally robust classification at the level of species and genus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The oral microbiome of humans has been studied extensively, and nearly half of the species-level taxa detectable by 16S rDNA analysis have been cultured, characterized and named. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>This provided the starting material for assembly and curation of the database. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The database was expanded using clinically derived 16S sequences from a large number of subjects, by deep sequencing of samples, and extensive curation using computational methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>A number of classification and naming inconsistencies, especially at the level of genus, were resolved, and species and genus-level groupings were made for sequences from uncultivated taxa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>This resulted in a database that performed much better than large public databases for identification of human oral 16S sequence data by several criteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>In addition, the resulting phylogenetic tree provides a framework for measures of divergence such as UNIFRAC [12] that are useful for the comparison of health and disease-associated communities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>The development and testing of the CORE database is described in the following sections. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>An initial list was generated by extracting the names of taxa (species and phylotypes) from published surveys of oral bacterial communities conducted using 16S rDNA sequencing [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>GenBank was then searched for 16S sequences from each of the taxa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The initial list included 3131 sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Highly similar sequences were grouped using a script coded in PHP, and one representative was manually selected from each group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>A 0.3% similarity threshold was empirically chosen as a level of divergence that would allow for sequence errors that might occur between identical sequences, about 5 nucleotide positions in the approximately 1.5 kb 16S sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>The script took the first sequence as a query for BLAST against the remaining unmatched sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>The script then formed a group based on the query sequence plus those sequences within the 99.7% similarity threshold. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>A sequence was then randomly selected from among the remaining, unmatched sequences and the BLAST process repeated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>This was done until no ungrouped sequences remained. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>The criteria for selection of a group representative included length and quality of sequence as well as the quality of the metadata for the sequence (i.e. strain deposited in public database, type strain for a species, human and oral provenance). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The large amount of publicly available sequence often includes genetic variability within species, and multiple sequences within a taxon were retained if divergence was &gt;1%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Since the database is designed to find sequences that are 98% identical by BLAST, multiple highly similar sequences do not need to be retained. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>After this step the database consisted of 1235 sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>A single representative from each bacterial phylum that was not otherwise represented was added to facilitate identification of novel clinical sequences. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>In the case of the Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, which represent a large number of species, alignments were generated for each class. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Alignments were examined in Mesquite [23], manually edited, and the 5′ and 3′ ends were trimmed to minimize areas with missing sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>The edited and trimmed multiple sequence alignments were used as the input for phylogenetic analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>For the whole database alignment maximum likelihood trees were calculated using the MPI version of raxmlHPC [24] on a Linux cluster of 32 PCs containing 32 AMD Opteron cpus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>For single phylum alignments the web server RAxML BlackBox [25] was used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Analyses were performed selecting the tree with the best log-likelihood out of a set of 1000 replicates, using the GTRGAMMA model of nucleotide substitution. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>The first step was to examine maximum-likelihood-based topology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Bootstrap values of 70% have been previously estimated to correspond to 95% confidence [28], so a bootstrap value of ≥70% was considered to be statistical support for the separation of sister groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Evolutionary distance was then considered. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>These names were maintained wherever possible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Prior to assigning species level OTU designations, sequence groupings were generated with similarity thresholds of 97, 98 and 99 percent using MOTHUR [1] and examined. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>There were instances when all three criteria (previous naming, evolutionary distance, and bootstrap support) could not be met. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Instead previous naming at the level of genus was maintained wherever possible, and unnamed sequences were assigned to named genera when doing so resulted in a monophyletic group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>In some cases no named genus could be found that represented a group of uncultured organisms. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>In the second stage we used 1,304,223 sequences generated by FLX amplicon pyrosequencing from the V4 region of the 16S gene from 75 patients, while the third stage utilized 523,359 sequences from the V1 region from a 60-patient subset of the V4 group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>In each case, we searched the database with BLAST and assigned sequences to their best matches in the database if they were at least 98% similar. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>We grouped the remaining sequences using the in-house written PHP script described above. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>For groups containing more than 25 sequences, we selected a representative and performed a BLAST search against the GenBank nucleotide database. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>If sequences longer than our test sequence matched at greater than 98% sequence similarity, we added that sequence to the database. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>If multiple sequences were found, we used the following criteria to select one: (1) greatest length (2) highest level of identity (3) oral cavity or airway provenance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>After adding sequences we repeated alignments, chimera checking, tree building, and taxonomic assignment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>For a few groups, we found no sequences with 98% or greater identity in public databases. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Designations have previously been made for over 250 cultivated OTUs from the oral microbiome, and we determined empirically that a similarity threshold of 98% for the 16S rDNA sequence most closely preserved these divisions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Using maximum-likelihood-based topology with bootstrap support and genetic distance for curation of an oral 16S database, another 365 uncultivated OTUs were defined, for a total of 636 computationally supported species level taxa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>This is fewer than the 1,179 taxa reported by Dewhirst et al [33], who have collected a similar database. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>The difference between the two databases is the way in which taxa were defined, not in the range of sequence included. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>In fact, CORE tested as more comprehensive as discussed below. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>For the CORE database only computationally supported divisions were made, resulting in fewer divisions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the CORE database is to provide the most accurate possible identification for unknown sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>To this end phylogenetic analysis based on maximum likelihood and bootstrap support values was used to define taxa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>It was clear that divisions based on previous species identifications or on distance analysis of 16S sequence in some cases are not supported, and in these cases taxa were combined to avoid ambiguous or erratic blast results. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>The phylogenetic reconstruction of the oral microbiome did not indicate clear and unambiguous divisions based on a furthest neighbor clustering approach (whereby sequences are included in an OTU only if they meet a similarity threshold for all members of the cluster). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>So a nearest neighbor clustering approach was used whereby sequences were included in an OTU if they met the similarity threshold for any sequence within that cluster. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Using this approach the average divergence within species-level OTUs was 1.3%, and the maximum distance was 4.6%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>This approach did not lead to infinite expansion of the groups, suggesting that natural species-level divisions occur. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Some previously named, distinct species could not be distinguished from each other. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>An example occurred with the important group, Streptococcus mitis, S. pneumoniae, S. infantis, and S. oralis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>There is not sufficient diversity in the 16S among these to establish them as independent taxa, therefore they were combined into a single clade and a combination name was used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>In a few cases recognized species could be divided into subclades that were well supported and distant, and in these cases we divided the species into two clades. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>In a few cases sequences attributed to one named species appeared in well-supported clades represented by a different named species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>In these cases, we assumed the discrepancy was the result of misidentification and renamed the sequence based on the supported clade. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>The average similarity within previously named genus-level groups was 92.7%, somewhat less than the typically suggested 95% identity [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>A large range was observed, with a similarity ≤ 85% within 10 genus groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>This unevenness along with many instances of ambiguity and inconsistency demonstrates that current naming is less than systematic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>For example, the Eubacterium genus designation was particularly ambiguous, occurring broadly in unrelated clades. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>To provide nomenclature that is useful for epidemiologic studies corrected “genus group” designations based on previous naming and phylogenetic reconstruction were provided. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>These new genus groups are internally consistent as demonstrated by the LOOCV test, but the range is still large (78–97%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>New categories based on a 95% similarity threshold would have so completely departed from previous naming that they were not attempted. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>It was important to exclude from the database chimeras and other artifacts that could be misinterpreted to represent new taxa, and to exclude contaminating bacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>The human oral cavity is an open system with exposure to a wide variety of environmental bacteria including soil, animal and plant bacteria present in food and water, so that an unfiltered survey would include many nonresident taxa. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>This challenge has increased as high-throughput sequencing technologies increase the size of datasets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>The availability of a targeted, well-curated database for oral bacterial 16S sequences provides a useful tool to minimize the time and resources needed for analysis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="s4a6"><title><text><SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Usage </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>The CORE database is available as a searchable web-based interface or for download at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://microbiome.osu.edu">http://microbiome.osu.edu</ext-link>. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>It can be used either by submitting query sequences to a BLAST client at the above site, or by downloading the entire database and running command-line blast searches on a remote computer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>It is anticipated that the second mode will be most useful to users with large datasets such as those from pyrosequencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>The relatively small size of CORE can speed searches of large numbers of queries relative to larger BLAST databases. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>In addition to being used for BLAST searches to identify sequences, the CORE database could be used to train classifiers such as the RDP classifier [7] or the Bayesian classifier implemented in mothur [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Since discrepancies in classification have been minimized in CORE, it is likely that classifiers using CORE as a training set will show improved performance over less closely curated databases. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Specialized highly curated 16S rDNA databases outperformed larger public databases for the analysis of clinical datasets in important ways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Although the two larger databases, GenBank and RDP, returned named matches for a slightly higher fraction of the sequences, the focused databases, CORE and HOMD, were much more likely to accurately identify sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>CORE provided the lowest level of ambiguity and was the more comprehensive of the specialized oral databases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>The larger databases are still important supplements to the specialized databases for identification of rare sequences. </plain></SENT>
