chemotherapeutic combinations for clinical trials. The most widely used
genetic model for preclinical testing of neuroblastoma is the TH-MYCN mouse.
This neuroblastoma-prone mouse recapitulates many of the features of human
neuroblastoma. Limitations of this model include the low frequency of bone
marrow metastasis, the lack of information on whether the gene expression
patterns in this system parallels human neuroblastomas, the relatively slow
rate of tumor formation and variability in tumor penetrance on different
genetic backgrounds. As an alternative, preclinical studies are frequently
performed using human cell lines xenografted into immunocompromised mice,
either as flank implant or orthtotopically. Drawbacks of this system include
the use of cell lines that have been in culture for years, the inappropriate
microenvironment of the flank or difficult, time consuming surgery for
orthotopic transplants and the absence of an intact immune system.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>Here we characterize and optimize both systems to increase their utility for
preclinical studies. We show that TH-MYCN mice develop tumors in the
paraspinal ganglia, but not in the adrenal, with cellular and gene
expression patterns similar to human NB. In addition, we present a new
ultrasound guided, minimally invasive orthotopic xenograft method. This
injection technique is rapid, provides accurate targeting of the injected
cells and leads to efficient engraftment. We also demonstrate that tumors
can be detected, monitored and quantified prior to visualization using
ultrasound, MRI and bioluminescence. Finally we develop and test a
&#8220;standard of care&#8221; chemotherapy regimen. This protocol, which is
based on current treatments for neuroblastoma, provides a baseline for
comparison of new therapeutic agents.</p></sec><sec><title>Significance</title><p>The studies suggest that use of both the TH-NMYC model of neuroblastoma and
the orthotopic xenograft model provide the optimal combination for testing
new chemotherapies for this devastating childhood cancer.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuroblastoma (NB) is responsible for 15% of all childhood cancer deaths and
is the most common cancer diagnosed during the first year of life <xref rid="pone.0019133-Maris1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. NB arises in the
developing sympathetic nervous system, in precursor cells thought to be derived from
the neural crest tissues <xref rid="pone.0019133-Hoehner1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The tumors appear in the adrenal medulla or along the
paraspinal ganglia in the abdomen, chest, pelvis or neck <xref rid="pone.0019133-Maris2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019133-JanoueixLerosy1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>A new International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) classification system of the
disease divides the patients to 16 risk groups from the lowest risk group with
localized tumor that can be removed by surgery and has a greater than 95%
survival rate, to the highest risk group that presents with metastasis to bone
marrow and bone and currently has only 40 to 50% survival rate <xref rid="pone.0019133-Cohn1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019133-Monclair1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. A unique
patient group is the 4S which usually occurs in infants less then one year of age
and has a favorable prognosis with a greater than 90% survival rate. Although
the tumors in the 4S group develop very early, they undergo spontaneous regression
<xref rid="pone.0019133-Matthay1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Full
regression is also seen in some of the stage 1 tumors with localized disease <xref rid="pone.0019133-Hero1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Amplification of N-MYC (&gt;10 copies per cell) occurs in about 30% of NB
human patients and is strongly correlated with advanced disease stage and poor
outcome <xref rid="pone.0019133-Brodeur1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0019133-Tang1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Several studies show that MYC proteins can act as master
transcriptional factors to activate or repress a wide variety of genes <xref rid="pone.0019133-Fernandez1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019133-Murphy1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In addition
the MYC family proteins including MYCN can influence expression of genes through
deregulation of microRNAs <xref rid="pone.0019133-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0019133-Schulte2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Importantly, high expression of N-myc is sufficient to
induce neuroblastoma tumor formation in transgenic mice <xref rid="pone.0019133-Weiss1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>The TH-MYCN transgenic mouse model, in which N-myc expression is driven by a 4.5 Kb
promoter of the rat tyrosine hydroxylase gene (TH) which is expressed specifically
in neural crest lineage cells, is now a widely used murine model of NB <xref rid="pone.0019133-Weiss1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Tumor
penetrance in this transgenic NB model is strain dependent <xref rid="pone.0019133-Weiss1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. NB tumors arise in the TH-MYCN
transgenic model at high frequency on the 129SvJ background, with &#8764;33% of
the hemizygous transgenic mice and 100% of the homozygous mice developing
tumors. The reason for the high tumor frequency on the 129SvJ background compared to
other murine genetic backgrounds, such as the BL6 strain which has only 5%
tumor occurrence, is still not clear but is attributed to strain-specific modifiers
not identified yet.</p><p>Overexpression of N-MYC in the mouse peripheral neural crest of the TH-MYCN mice
gives rise to NB tumors that recapitulate many of the histological and pathological
aspects of human NB <xref rid="pone.0019133-Weiss1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0019133-Hansford1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In addition, genome-wide array CGH analysis of the
murine tumors identified distinct genomic aberrations that share some similarity
with those in human tumors <xref rid="pone.0019133-Hackett1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Cell lines derived from the mouse tumors display many of
the molecular characteristics of human NB <xref rid="pone.0019133-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> although the tumors rarely
exhibit loss of the mouse gene region that is syntenic with chromosome 1p36 or
metastasize to distant organs such as bone marrow <xref rid="pone.0019133-Hackett1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019133-Teitz1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>Several recent studies have utilized the TH-MYCN transgenic model to understand the
<italic>in vivo</italic> functions of additional genes involved in NB
pathogenesis such as p53 and Mdm2 <xref rid="pone.0019133-Chesler1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019133-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Importantly, this murine model has been very useful in
assessing the clinical efficacy of potential new drugs for NB like the angiogenesis
inhibitor HPMA copolymer-TNP-470 conjugate (caplostatin) <xref rid="pone.0019133-Chesler1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and the ornithine
decaroboxylase inhibitor &#945;-difluoromethylornithine <xref rid="pone.0019133-Rounbehler1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we provide additional characterization of the TH-MYCN mouse model
using multiple diagnostic imaging methodologies and gene profiling. In addition, we
present a new approach for generating orthotopic xenografts of neuroblastoma using
ultrasound guided injections of neuroblastoma cells into the adrenal or para-adrenal
space, where 40% of human NB tumors arise <xref rid="pone.0019133-Maris2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. To demonstrate the utility of
this new orthotopic xenograft method for neuroblastoma and provide a clinically
relevant benchmark for future preclinical studies, we tested a chemotherapeutic
regimen that is similar to the current standard of care for induction chemotherapy
for neuroblastoma in the xenograft model. These data set the stage for future
generation of orthotopic xenografts of primary human neuroblastoma and for testing
new agents for this devastating childhood cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Characterization of the cellular features of TH-MYCN neuroblastoma</title><p>To obtain NB tumors from the TH- MYCN model, hemizygous TH-MYCN transgenic mice
were bred onto the 129SvJ background. Tumors arose on this background at a
frequency of &#8764;33%. Tumors could first be detected visually in the
abdomen of the transgenic mice at 9&#8211;13 weeks of age. Earlier tumors could
be routinely identified by imaging (MRI and ultrasound) at week 6(see below).
The TH-MYCN mouse tumors appeared to arise in the ganglion cells, in line with
the sympathetic ganglion chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019133-g001">Figure 1A</xref>.). We characterized these tumors histologically by
Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019133-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019133.s001">Figure S1</xref>),
by electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019133.s002">Figure S2</xref>) and by immunohistochemistry (IHC)
staining with neuronal markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019133-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Ki67 staining was also employed to evaluate proliferation
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019133-g001">Figure 1M</xref>). H&amp;E and
IHC staining revealed substantial heterogeneity within the primary tumors and
the presence of microscopic (&lt;1 mm<sup>3</sup>) metastatic lesions in the
lungs (100% of the animals), ovaries (44%), abdominal lymph nodes
(32%) and bone marrow (5%) of 3&#8211;5 months old mice. The
majority of the H&amp;E stained tumor cells were variably sized, blue cells,
with generally prominent nucleoli and distinct nuclear membranes that grew in
solid sheets, cords and molded pavement patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019133-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019133.s001">Figure

that had a more ganglion-like appearance in the primary mouse tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019133-g001">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019133.s001">Figure

(<bold>F</bold>) and neurofilament protein (<bold>G</bold>).
However, only the ganglion-like cells within the tumor stained strongly

Tyrosine Hydroxylase (<bold>L</bold>). These ganglion-like cells were
negative for the proliferation marker Ki67 (<bold>M</bold>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0019133.g001"/></fig><p>Analysis of the developing primary TH-MYCN tumors (mouse ages 9&#8211;13 weeks)
by immunohistochemistry revealed that the mouse tumors stained homogenously for
the neuronal markers: protein gene-product 9.5 (PGP9.5), chromogranin A,
synapthopysin and neurofilament protein (NFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019133-g001">Figure 1D&#8211;G</xref>). However, there was
heterogeneity in the staining patterns with other neuronal markers including
neuron specific enolase (NSE), microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) and
tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a marker of more differentiated cells. These proteins
were strongly expressed only in areas of ganglion-like cells within the tumors
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019133-g001">Figure 1H&#8211;L</xref>). The
regions of the tumors that stained positive for the markers NSE, MAP-2 and TH
were also the only areas that were not undergoing proliferation as judged by the
absence of Ki67 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019133-g001">Figure
1M</xref>). In contrast, the majority of the cells in the tumors stained
positive for Ki67, indicating potential proliferation, but failed to express the
markers NSE, TH and MAP-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019133-g001">Figure
1H&#8211;L</xref>). Numerous mitotic figures were also present in these
areas while the areas surrounded by the more differentiated ganglion-like cells
exhibited an absence of mitotic figures and often surrounded by necrotic and
apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019133-g001">Figure 1H,
J</xref>). Electron microscopy of the TH-MYCN tumors and human tumors
revealed features consistent with neuronal differentiation including dense core
neurosecretory vesicles, synaptic junctions and processes typical of neuronal
cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019133.s002">Figure
S2</xref>). There were also areas of lipids dispersed throughout the
tumors.</p><p>Overall, these data are consistent with previous characterization of the TH-MYCN
neuroblastomas and they suggest that the mouse neuroblastomas most closely
resembled a class of aggressive human neuroblastoma tumors classified as large
cell neuroblastoma <xref rid="pone.0019133-Tornoczky1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0019133-Tornoczky2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. This subgroup of tumors
is composed of cells that are markedly larger than other NB subgroups and have
unique, sharply outlined nuclear membranes and 1&#8211;4 prominent nucleoli.
Tumor with this morphology are found within the undifferentiated and poorly
differentiated classes of NB and are seen most often in cases with MYCN
amplified tumors.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Molecular profiling of mouse neuroblastomas</title><p>To extend these findings, we isolated RNA from 18 samples of hemizygous abdominal
TH-MYCN tumors and performed Affymetrix gene expression array analysis. These
tumors which were representative of full grown progressive tumors, weighing 1.5
gr+/&#8722;0.75 gr, were harvested from 12 females and 6 males 8&#8211;13
week old mice. All eighteen samples clustered tightly on principle component
analysis (PCA) analysis (data not shown). Human NB data were obtained from three
previously published neuroblastoma studies using the Affymetrix U133 v2 chip and
combined to give a total of 125 gene expression arrays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019133.s003">Figure S3</xref>)
for comparison. The data was then examined by PCA and collated with meta data
describing each tumor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019133.s003">Figure S3</xref>). The 125 arrays were adjusted by
batch correction method included in Partek Genomics Suite 6.4. Data from
Affymetrix human U133 v2 arrays and mouse Affymetrix 430 v2 arrays were
processed using the RMA algorithm. This data was then used to examine data
quality by PCA for each species separately. The corrections described above
removed much of the variability across the human array data from the different
studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019133.s003">Figure
S3</xref>).</p><p>Next were removed genes that did not have documented orthologs, between humans
and mice, using the Affymetrix's ortholog mapping document derived from
National Center for Biotechnology Information's (NCBI) Homologene database.
The probesets corresponding to 15646 unique human and mouse unigene pairs were
retained. Each subset of the original data from mouse and human data sets was
then converted to quartiles to further normalize the data and to concentrate on
large differences between the species. Once quartiled, the data within each
unigene id was averaged and the resulting means were compared across
species.</p><p>The batch corrected set of human neuroblastomas and the mouse N-MYC tumors
unigene pairs were then assigned grades (A+ - D) based on the performance
of probesets that were designed to measure the same transcript in the same
array. The purpose of this grading was to distinguish consistent measurements
from variable ones. The quartile range across all observations within a given
unigene and species represents technical and biological variability but does not
influence grade. However, the range of probeset signals within a unigene does
influence the grade. If the range for all probesets for a particular unigene
within a species was less than or equal to 1 quartile it was given an A+
grade. A total of 424 A+ unigene pairs (2.7% of the total unigenes,
424/15646 unigenes) from all stages and MYCN status exhibited expression
differences of one or more quartiles between human and mouse and were termed
differential (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019133.s005">Table S1</xref>). Gene ontology, using DAVID's GO analysis <xref rid="pone.0019133-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> showed
statistically significant enrichment for genes in the immune response among the
424 differential genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019133.s005">Table S1</xref>). 125 of these genes showed

species across all disease stages and MYCN status (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019133.s006">Table S2</xref>).
When we compared the expression of the 424 differential unigenes to their
expression in normal adrenal tissue (A+ only) of the appropriate species
and subtracted these species differences there were 18 unigenes that were
differentially expressed between human tumors and mouse tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019133.s007">Table S3</xref>).
These 18 unigenes are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019133.s007">Table S3</xref>. Among them we find breast cancer 2
early onset gene 2 (BRCA2) which was expressed at significantly higher levels in
the mouse tumors.</p><p>When we compared the TH-MYCN mouse tumor microarray expression data to the human
NB patient data (A+ quality data only as described above) classified by
disease stage and restricted to MYCN amplified patients, we found high
similarity between stages 3 and 4 of human disease and the mouse model (see
<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019133-t001">Table 1</xref>).
Interestingly, there were no genes that had a statistically different level of
expression in the stage 4 N-MYC amplified human tumors versus mouse tumors and
only 53 genes were differentially expressed between mouse and human stage 3
MYCN&#8211;amplified samples. Taken together the histological analysis and the
molecular analysis suggest that the TH-MYCN mouse model most closely resembles
stages 3 and 4 N-MYC amplified human neuroblastoma.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0019133-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0019133.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Differential gene expression between MYCN amplified human

amplified human neuroblastomas, one major difference was the relatively low rate
of distant metastasis in these mice. It is possible that orthotopic xenografts
of primary human neuroblastomas or cell lines would more efficiently metastasize
than the tumor cells in the TH-MYCN mouse model. Most previous studies focused
on xenografts of neuroblastoma have involved flank engraftment or engraftment to
the kidney capsule or more rarely engaftment into the adrenal using surgical
procedures. However, the microenvironment of the flank is very different from
that of the normal site of neuroblastoma initiation and the surgical procedure
is relatively slow and can be associated with morbidity. In order to establish a
minimally invasive, high throughput method for efficient introduction of
neuroblastoma cell lines and primary human tumor cells into the mouse we
developed an ultrasound guided technique to inject cells directly into the
adrenal or the para-adrenal space. These two areas were chosen because a high
percentage of human tumors (40%) are found in these areas <xref rid="pone.0019133-JanoueixLerosy1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The
advantage of this technique is that it is relatively rapid (10&#8211;12 mice can
be injected per hour), it leads to efficient engraftment of neuroblastoma cell
lines (&gt;80%) and there is no morbidity associated with the technique
(see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p><p>Five human NB cell lines were chosen to demonstrate the feasibility and utility
of this approach - NB5, NB7, NB1691 <xref rid="pone.0019133-Teitz1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019133-Tekautz1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019133-Thiele1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, SKNAS (ATCC CRL-2137) and
SKNSH (ATCC HTB-11). These cell lines were selected because they differ in N-myc
amplification, caspase-8 expression, p53 mutation status and 1p36 LOH <xref rid="pone.0019133-Teitz1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019133-Tekautz1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The cells
were labeled with luciferase by stable transfection with a retrovirus expressing
the luciferase gene. Luciferase expression was tested and quantified in the
Xenogen Imager before injecting the cells into the mice. Single suspension cells
were mixed with matrigel in a total volume of 10 &#181;l and implanted into the
para-adrenal area, between the adrenal and the kidney or into the adrenal
medulla itself. Injections were done with the aid of an ultrasound-guided
catheter and needle (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and
Methods</xref>). Tumor formation and growth was monitored for up to 24
weeks.</p><p>Orthotopic ultrasound guided xenografts faithfully recapitulated many of the
histological hallmarks of neuroblastoma. Xenografts showed some heterogeneity in
terms of cell size and immunohistochemical staining patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019133-g002">Figure 2</xref>), and the presence of
cells with a more differentiated somewhat ganglion-like appearance in tumors
from some but not all cell lines. Similar to the mouse tumors, all tumors of the
xenografts tumors stained positive for the neuroendocrine marker PGP 9.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019133-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Mitotic figures
were consistently seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019133-g002">Figure

around blood vessels and at the peripheral margins of the tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019133-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Regions of
xenografts were also immunoreactive for synaptophysin, neuron specific enolase

20% (3/15) of paradrenal SKNSH xenografts reached a volume of 600

(n&#8202;=&#8202;3) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019133.s004">Figure S4</xref>). The remainder of SKNSH xenografts
either failed to engraft (based on permanent loss of the Xenogen signal that was
present immediately after injection) or regressed (initially signal was
maintained or increased slightly during first few weeks and then gradually
disappeared). Similarly, NB7 xenografts demonstrated inconsistent engraftment
and growth with only 2/19 mouse tumors reaching a volume of 600 mm<sup>3</sup>,
one after 43 days and the other after 142 days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019133.s004">Figure S4</xref>).
The remaining NB7 xenografts either failed to engraft or remained as steady
disease (maintained bioluminescent signal without evidence of growth) throughout

For these studies, we imaged a cohort of 26 mice TH-MYCN hemizygous weekly or
bi-weekly after initial detection of the tumors by ultrasound and assessed 13
mice with NB5 orthotopic xenografts. TH-MYCN mice were typically followed from

enrolling animals with an initial tumor burden for the NB5-Luc cell line between
1&#215;10<sup>4</sup> and 3&#215;10<sup>7</sup> cells. To determine if 6
courses of therapy was essential for these studies to identify those animals

tumor model systems. At the cellular level the two models were highly similar in
terms of appearance, immunohistochemical staining patterns and the presence of
cellular junctions and synaptic dense core vesicles. Tumors from both models also
contained a high percentage of proliferating cells characterized by both Ki67
staining and a large number of mitotic cells and exhibited regions with substantial
numbers of necrotic and apoptotic cells. The similarities between the mouse and
human tumors are also highlighted by the gene expression microarray studies which
found a 68.1% Pearson correlation in quartiled and grade adjusted gene
expression. However, there are also several differences including: the presence of
large non-dividing ganglion-like cells in all the mouse tumors and larger, somewhat
ganglion-like cells in only some of the human xenografts (xenograft SKNAS, for
example, did not contain ganglion-like cells). In addition, the majority of the
mouse tumors fail to macrometastasize beyond the local area. Eighteen genes were
also differentially expressed (greater than one quartile difference) in the human
and mouse tumors. These differences may contribute to their tumorigenicity and/or
metastatic abilities. For example the mouse tumors expressed higher levels of BRCA2,
a known tumor suppressor gene in breast and ovarian cancer and involved in
maintenance of genome stability, specifically the homologous recombination pathway
for double-strand DNA repair <xref rid="pone.0019133-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019133-Stracker1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. We do not yet know if any of these 18 genes account for
the differences in disease progression between the human and mouse neuroblastomas
but our ultrasound guided engraftment procedure is suited for testing these
hypotheses.</p><p>Our ultrasound studies showed that 81% of initial tumors in the TH-MYCN mice
are found surrounding or in the vicinity of the aorta in the paravertebral ganglia.
The percentage of tumors in humans originating from the paraspinal ganglia is
&#8764;60% <xref rid="pone.0019133-Maris1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019133-JanoueixLerosy1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. We speculate that this site in the mouse provides factors
from the blood system and from the adjacent adrenal that can enhance tumor growth
and progression. Surprisingly, none of the mouse NB tumors originated in the adrenal
medulla itself as confirmed by ultrasonography, histology and electron microscopy.
These results are in agreement with recent works observing initial tumor formation
in the TH-MYCN mouse in early postnatal sympathetic ganglia and not in the adrenal
<xref rid="pone.0019133-Hansford1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019133-Alam1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. However, in a
few cases we observed that the mouse tumors invaded the adrenal at later stages of
tumor progression. This is in contrast to the human disease where approximately
40% of the patient tumors originate in the adrenal medulla <xref rid="pone.0019133-Maris1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019133-JanoueixLerosy1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Recording the <italic>in vivo</italic> regression of a small group of TH-MYCN tumors
by ultrasound and MRI opens the possibility of using this model to study this
process and suggests these tumors may exhibit similarities to human stage 4S tumor
which also spontaneously regress. Understanding the regression process <italic>in
vivo</italic> could help identify the biological pathways that will facilitate
tumor growth arrest and drive the tumor to complete regression.</p><p>The standard of care protocol described in this paper will be useful for testing new
drug compounds, alone or in combination with the standard CAE/CE treatment, for
their efficacy in treating neuroblastoma. Our study suggests that the most accurate
data will be obtained from combination of both mouse models in association with
multiple imaging modalities since the TH-MYCN system allows testing of the drugs in
an immune proficient model while the orthotopic xenograft system uses human cells
grown in the proper microenvironment. The ultrasound guided injection technique can
also be used to generate a new bank of neuroblastoma patient xenografts by injecting
cells directly from the patient tumors into mice and subsequently passaging the
tumors without ever growing the cells in culture. This xenograft bank would
facilitate future drug testing and could potentially lead to treatments that are
more tailored to individual patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>TH-MYCN hemizygote mouse were purchased from NCI mouse repository (strain #

RMV-706 probe. Cells were suspended in Matrigel (BD Worldwide, Cat#354234) at a
concentration of 2&#215;10<sup>4</sup> cells per microliter and placed on ice.
Anesthetized recipient CD1 nude mice (isoflurane 1.5% in O<sub>2</sub>
delivered at 2 liters/min) were placed laterally on the imaging bed such that
the left flank faced upward. In order to provide a channel for delivery of the
implant, a 22 gauge catheter (BD Worldwide, Cat# 381423) was gently inserted
through the skin and back muscle into the para-adrenal region and the hub was
removed. A chilled Hamilton syringe fitted with a 27 gauge needle (1.25 inch)
and loaded with 10 &#181;l of the cell suspension was guided steretoactically
through the catheter and positioned between the kidney and adrenal gland as
visualized using ultrasound. The cells were injected into the region and the
needle was left in place for 0.5&#8211;1 min in order to permit the matrigel
component to set. The needle was then slowly removed, followed by gentle removal
of the catheter. The same procedures were used for intra-adrenal injections
although in these studies the needle was used to pierce the adrenal capsule and
cells were deposited into the medulla of the adrenal gland.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Bioluminescent Imaging and Quantification</title><p>For Xenogen imaging mice were given intraperitoneal injections of Firefly
D-Luciferin (Caliper Life Sciences 3 mg/mouse). Bioluminescent images were taken
five minutes later using the IVIS&#174; 200 imaging system. The Living Image 3.2
software (Caliper Life Sciences) was used to generate a standard region of
interest (ROI) encompassing the largest tumor at maximal bioluminescence signal.
The identical ROI was used to determine the average radiance
(photons/s/cm<sup>2</sup>/sr) for all xenografts from all time points.
Biolumicescence and ultrasound volume per individual animal were plotted on a
double Y axis using Kaleidagraph Software using the most appropriate scale for
each cell line.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Ultrasound imaging of the TH-MYCN mice and Xenografts</title><p>All ultrasound studies were performed using the VisualSonics VEVO-770 High
Frequency Ultrasound system (VisualSonics, Toronto, Canada). Briefly, animals
were anesthetized (isoflurane 1.5% in O<sub>2</sub> delivered at 2
liters/min) and hair covering the area to be imaged removed by application of
hair removal cream (Nair). For scanning, animals were placed prone on the
imaging stage, ultrasound transmission gel (Parker Labs inc., USA) liberally
applied and the relevant transducer (RMV-706 at 40 MHz) lowered stereotactically
to the surface of the animal. Tumor (normally characterized by irregular regions
of hypoechoicity) was identified relative to normal tissue landmarks and volumes
were determined by acquisition of high resolution (50&#8211;100 &#181;m
in-plane) images with a step size of 100 &#181;m providing a close to isotropic
data set. Tumor perimeters were then traced at 0.5 mm intervals and the
VisualSonics software used to render and calculate calibrated volumes.</p><p>Once luminescence was above 10<sup>6</sup> photons/s/cm<sup>2</sup>/sr in the
xenografted animals, imaging was perfomed weekly with the Visualsonic VIVO-770
ultrasound system fitted with the RMV-706 probe at a frequency of 40 MHz. The
field of view was set 15&#215;15 mm. Weekly three-dimensional scans of the
tumors were reconstructed using the Visualsonics software. Tumor margins were
traced and volume measurements were determined by the Visualsonics software.
Bioluminescence and ultrasound volume per individual animal were plotted on a

animal MRI scanner (Bruker BioSpin MRI GmbH, Germany) equipped with a Bruker
BGA12S gradient (660 mT/m with 4570 T/m/s slew rate). Animals were anesthetized
using isoflurane (1.5&#8211;3% in O<sub>2</sub>) for the duration of data
acquisition. Briefly, animals were restrained on an MR safe bed (Bruker BioSpin

VIBE <xref rid="pone.0019133-Rofsky1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> was
used to rapidly acquire a T1 weighted 3D volume before and after injection.
Orientation, matrix and FOV were identical to the T2 weighted images. 3D slab
thickness was 14 mm with 56 slice encoding steps; the resulting voxel size was
0.14&#215;0.14&#215;0.25 mm<sup>3</sup>. Other sequence parameters were:
TR&#8202;=&#8202;10 ms, TE&#8202;=&#8202;2 ms, flip
angel&#8202;=&#8202;15&#176;. A partial Fourier factor of 6/8 was used
in phase encoding, and slice selection direction. Each scan took 1.5 minutes and
was repeated 12 times without pause to provide a time-course. Injection of
contrast agent was performed immediately after the 4<sup>th</sup> VIBE sequence.

during days 6&#8211;21 during each course.</p><p>The health of the animals was monitored daily throughout the therapy. Standard
complete blood counts with differential (CBC-Ds) were obtained prior to the

30 &#181;L of blood was collected from the facial vein and diluted with
standard amounts of EDTA. Samples were processed immediately using the FORCYTETM
Hematology Analyzer (Oxford Scientific, Oxford, CT). Moribund status was defined
as tumor burden greater than 20% body mass, at which point the animal was
