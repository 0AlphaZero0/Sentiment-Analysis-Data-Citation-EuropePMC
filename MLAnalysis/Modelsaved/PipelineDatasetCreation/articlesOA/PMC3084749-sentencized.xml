<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most widely used genetic model for preclinical testing of neuroblastoma is the TH-MYCN mouse. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This neuroblastoma-prone mouse recapitulates many of the features of human neuroblastoma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Limitations of this model include the low frequency of bone marrow metastasis, the lack of information on whether the gene expression patterns in this system parallels human neuroblastomas, the relatively slow rate of tumor formation and variability in tumor penetrance on different genetic backgrounds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As an alternative, preclinical studies are frequently performed using human cell lines xenografted into immunocompromised mice, either as flank implant or orthtotopically. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Drawbacks of this system include the use of cell lines that have been in culture for years, the inappropriate microenvironment of the flank or difficult, time consuming surgery for orthotopic transplants and the absence of an intact immune system. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In addition, we present a new ultrasound guided, minimally invasive orthotopic xenograft method. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Neuroblastoma (NB) is responsible for 15% of all childhood cancer deaths and is the most common cancer diagnosed during the first year of life [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>NB arises in the developing sympathetic nervous system, in precursor cells thought to be derived from the neural crest tissues [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The tumors appear in the adrenal medulla or along the paraspinal ganglia in the abdomen, chest, pelvis or neck [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>A new International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) classification system of the disease divides the patients to 16 risk groups from the lowest risk group with localized tumor that can be removed by surgery and has a greater than 95% survival rate, to the highest risk group that presents with metastasis to bone marrow and bone and currently has only 40 to 50% survival rate [5], [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>A unique patient group is the 4S which usually occurs in infants less then one year of age and has a favorable prognosis with a greater than 90% survival rate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Although the tumors in the 4S group develop very early, they undergo spontaneous regression [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Full regression is also seen in some of the stage 1 tumors with localized disease [8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Amplification of N-MYC (&gt;10 copies per cell) occurs in about 30% of NB human patients and is strongly correlated with advanced disease stage and poor outcome [9]–[11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Several studies show that MYC proteins can act as master transcriptional factors to activate or repress a wide variety of genes [12], [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In addition the MYC family proteins including MYCN can influence expression of genes through deregulation of microRNAs [14]–[17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Importantly, high expression of N-myc is sufficient to induce neuroblastoma tumor formation in transgenic mice [18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The TH-MYCN transgenic mouse model, in which N-myc expression is driven by a 4.5 Kb promoter of the rat tyrosine hydroxylase gene (TH) which is expressed specifically in neural crest lineage cells, is now a widely used murine model of NB [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Tumor penetrance in this transgenic NB model is strain dependent [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>NB tumors arise in the TH-MYCN transgenic model at high frequency on the 129SvJ background, with ∼33% of the hemizygous transgenic mice and 100% of the homozygous mice developing tumors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The reason for the high tumor frequency on the 129SvJ background compared to other murine genetic backgrounds, such as the BL6 strain which has only 5% tumor occurrence, is still not clear but is attributed to strain-specific modifiers not identified yet. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of N-MYC in the mouse peripheral neural crest of the TH-MYCN mice gives rise to NB tumors that recapitulate many of the histological and pathological aspects of human NB [18]–[20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In addition, genome-wide array CGH analysis of the murine tumors identified distinct genomic aberrations that share some similarity with those in human tumors [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Cell lines derived from the mouse tumors display many of the molecular characteristics of human NB [22] although the tumors rarely exhibit loss of the mouse gene region that is syntenic with chromosome 1p36 or metastasize to distant organs such as bone marrow [21], [23]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Several recent studies have utilized the TH-MYCN transgenic model to understand the in vivo functions of additional genes involved in NB pathogenesis such as p53 and Mdm2 [24], [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Importantly, this murine model has been very useful in assessing the clinical efficacy of potential new drugs for NB like the angiogenesis inhibitor HPMA copolymer-TNP-470 conjugate (caplostatin) [24] and the ornithine decaroboxylase inhibitor α-difluoromethylornithine [26]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>In this study, we provide additional characterization of the TH-MYCN mouse model using multiple diagnostic imaging methodologies and gene profiling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>In addition, we present a new approach for generating orthotopic xenografts of neuroblastoma using ultrasound guided injections of neuroblastoma cells into the adrenal or para-adrenal space, where 40% of human NB tumors arise [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>To demonstrate the utility of this new orthotopic xenograft method for neuroblastoma and provide a clinically relevant benchmark for future preclinical studies, we tested a chemotherapeutic regimen that is similar to the current standard of care for induction chemotherapy for neuroblastoma in the xenograft model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>These data set the stage for future generation of orthotopic xenografts of primary human neuroblastoma and for testing new agents for this devastating childhood cancer. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>To obtain NB tumors from the TH- MYCN model, hemizygous TH-MYCN transgenic mice were bred onto the 129SvJ background. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Tumors arose on this background at a frequency of ∼33%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Tumors could first be detected visually in the abdomen of the transgenic mice at 9–13 weeks of age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Earlier tumors could be routinely identified by imaging (MRI and ultrasound) at week 6(see below). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The TH-MYCN mouse tumors appeared to arise in the ganglion cells, in line with the sympathetic ganglion chain (Figure 1A.). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>We characterized these tumors histologically by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining (Figure 1 and Figure S1), by electron microscopy (Figure S2) and by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining with neuronal markers (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Ki67 staining was also employed to evaluate proliferation (Figure 1M). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>H&amp;E and IHC staining revealed substantial heterogeneity within the primary tumors and the presence of microscopic (&lt;1 mm3) metastatic lesions in the lungs (100% of the animals), ovaries (44%), abdominal lymph nodes (32%) and bone marrow (5%) of 3–5 months old mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The majority of the H&amp;E stained tumor cells were variably sized, blue cells, with generally prominent nucleoli and distinct nuclear membranes that grew in solid sheets, cords and molded pavement patterns (Figure 1B and Figure S1A–D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>However, there were also regions of much larger cells that had a more ganglion-like appearance in the primary mouse tumors (Figure 1C and Figure S1E,F). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>These ganglion-like cells were negative for the proliferation marker Ki67 (M). </plain></SENT>
</text></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0019133.g001"/></fig></SecTag><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the developing primary TH-MYCN tumors (mouse ages 9–13 weeks) by immunohistochemistry revealed that the mouse tumors stained homogenously for the neuronal markers: protein gene-product 9.5 (PGP9.5), chromogranin A, synapthopysin and neurofilament protein (NFP) (Figure 1D–G). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>However, there was heterogeneity in the staining patterns with other neuronal markers including neuron specific enolase (NSE), microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a marker of more differentiated cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>These proteins were strongly expressed only in areas of ganglion-like cells within the tumors (Figure 1H–L). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>The regions of the tumors that stained positive for the markers NSE, MAP-2 and TH were also the only areas that were not undergoing proliferation as judged by the absence of Ki67 staining (Figure 1M). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the majority of the cells in the tumors stained positive for Ki67, indicating potential proliferation, but failed to express the markers NSE, TH and MAP-2 (Figure 1H–L). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Numerous mitotic figures were also present in these areas while the areas surrounded by the more differentiated ganglion-like cells exhibited an absence of mitotic figures and often surrounded by necrotic and apoptotic cells (Figure 1H, J). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy of the TH-MYCN tumors and human tumors revealed features consistent with neuronal differentiation including dense core neurosecretory vesicles, synaptic junctions and processes typical of neuronal cells (Figure S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>There were also areas of lipids dispersed throughout the tumors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Overall, these data are consistent with previous characterization of the TH-MYCN neuroblastomas and they suggest that the mouse neuroblastomas most closely resembled a class of aggressive human neuroblastoma tumors classified as large cell neuroblastoma [27]–[29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>This subgroup of tumors is composed of cells that are markedly larger than other NB subgroups and have unique, sharply outlined nuclear membranes and 1–4 prominent nucleoli. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Tumor with this morphology are found within the undifferentiated and poorly differentiated classes of NB and are seen most often in cases with MYCN amplified tumors. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>To extend these findings, we isolated RNA from 18 samples of hemizygous abdominal TH-MYCN tumors and performed Affymetrix gene expression array analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>These tumors which were representative of full grown progressive tumors, weighing 1.5 gr+/−0.75 gr, were harvested from 12 females and 6 males 8–13 week old mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>All eighteen samples clustered tightly on principle component analysis (PCA) analysis (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Human NB data were obtained from three previously published neuroblastoma studies using the Affymetrix U133 v2 chip and combined to give a total of 125 gene expression arrays (Figure S3) for comparison. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>The data was then examined by PCA and collated with meta data describing each tumor (Figure S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>The 125 arrays were adjusted by batch correction method included in Partek Genomics Suite 6.4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Data from Affymetrix human U133 v2 arrays and mouse Affymetrix 430 v2 arrays were processed using the RMA algorithm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>This data was then used to examine data quality by PCA for each species separately. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>The corrections described above removed much of the variability across the human array data from the different studies (Figure S3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Next were removed genes that did not have documented orthologs, between humans and mice, using the Affymetrix's ortholog mapping document derived from National Center for Biotechnology Information's (NCBI) Homologene database. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>The probesets corresponding to 15646 unique human and mouse unigene pairs were retained. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Each subset of the original data from mouse and human data sets was then converted to quartiles to further normalize the data and to concentrate on large differences between the species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Once quartiled, the data within each unigene id was averaged and the resulting means were compared across species. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>The batch corrected set of human neuroblastomas and the mouse N-MYC tumors unigene pairs were then assigned grades (A+ - D) based on the performance of probesets that were designed to measure the same transcript in the same array. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this grading was to distinguish consistent measurements from variable ones. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>The quartile range across all observations within a given unigene and species represents technical and biological variability but does not influence grade. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>However, the range of probeset signals within a unigene does influence the grade. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>If the range for all probesets for a particular unigene within a species was less than or equal to 1 quartile it was given an A+ grade. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>The studies in this report reveal similarities and differences between the two mouse tumor model systems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>At the cellular level the two models were highly similar in terms of appearance, immunohistochemical staining patterns and the presence of cellular junctions and synaptic dense core vesicles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Tumors from both models also contained a high percentage of proliferating cells characterized by both Ki67 staining and a large number of mitotic cells and exhibited regions with substantial numbers of necrotic and apoptotic cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>The similarities between the mouse and human tumors are also highlighted by the gene expression microarray studies which found a 68.1% Pearson correlation in quartiled and grade adjusted gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>However, there are also several differences including: the presence of large non-dividing ganglion-like cells in all the mouse tumors and larger, somewhat ganglion-like cells in only some of the human xenografts (xenograft SKNAS, for example, did not contain ganglion-like cells). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>In addition, the majority of the mouse tumors fail to macrometastasize beyond the local area. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Eighteen genes were also differentially expressed (greater than one quartile difference) in the human and mouse tumors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>These differences may contribute to their tumorigenicity and/or metastatic abilities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>For example the mouse tumors expressed higher levels of BRCA2, a known tumor suppressor gene in breast and ovarian cancer and involved in maintenance of genome stability, specifically the homologous recombination pathway for double-strand DNA repair [33], [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>We do not yet know if any of these 18 genes account for the differences in disease progression between the human and mouse neuroblastomas but our ultrasound guided engraftment procedure is suited for testing these hypotheses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Our ultrasound studies showed that 81% of initial tumors in the TH-MYCN mice are found surrounding or in the vicinity of the aorta in the paravertebral ganglia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>The percentage of tumors in humans originating from the paraspinal ganglia is ∼60% [1], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>We speculate that this site in the mouse provides factors from the blood system and from the adjacent adrenal that can enhance tumor growth and progression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, none of the mouse NB tumors originated in the adrenal medulla itself as confirmed by ultrasonography, histology and electron microscopy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>These results are in agreement with recent works observing initial tumor formation in the TH-MYCN mouse in early postnatal sympathetic ganglia and not in the adrenal [20], [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>However, in a few cases we observed that the mouse tumors invaded the adrenal at later stages of tumor progression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>This is in contrast to the human disease where approximately 40% of the patient tumors originate in the adrenal medulla [1], [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>Recording the in vivo regression of a small group of TH-MYCN tumors by ultrasound and MRI opens the possibility of using this model to study this process and suggests these tumors may exhibit similarities to human stage 4S tumor which also spontaneously regress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Understanding the regression process in vivo could help identify the biological pathways that will facilitate tumor growth arrest and drive the tumor to complete regression. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>The standard of care protocol described in this paper will be useful for testing new drug compounds, alone or in combination with the standard CAE/CE treatment, for their efficacy in treating neuroblastoma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that the most accurate data will be obtained from combination of both mouse models in association with multiple imaging modalities since the TH-MYCN system allows testing of the drugs in an immune proficient model while the orthotopic xenograft system uses human cells grown in the proper microenvironment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>The ultrasound guided injection technique can also be used to generate a new bank of neuroblastoma patient xenografts by injecting cells directly from the patient tumors into mice and subsequently passaging the tumors without ever growing the cells in culture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>This xenograft bank would facilitate future drug testing and could potentially lead to treatments that are more tailored to individual patients. </plain></SENT>
