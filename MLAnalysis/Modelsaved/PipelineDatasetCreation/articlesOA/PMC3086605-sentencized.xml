</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Glaucoma is a group of disorders that cause progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells, optic nerve cupping, and visual field loss. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>It is the most common cause of irreversible blindness worldwide [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Of glaucoma’s multiple sub-types, the most common is primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) [1,2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>POAG is currently responsible for an estimated 3.3 million cases of bilateral blindness worldwide [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>POAG treatment is currently limited to modification of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), an established risk factor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>A greater understanding of other risk factors and molecular mechanisms will likely improve treatment and detection [2]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Genetic risk factors are known to contribute to POAG as first-degree relatives of affected individuals are 3–9 fold more likely to develop the disease [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Identification of genetic risk factors could greatly improve detection and treatment of POAG. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>However, POAG has a complex inheritance pattern that confounds many approaches used to study Mendelian traits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Only a small proportion of POAG cases have been traced to mutations in individual genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Instead, the majority of POAG cases appear to be influenced or caused by multiple genetic factors [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>To date, 15 POAG-associated loci have been identified [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Within these loci several genes have been identified including myocilin (MYOC) [5], optineurin [6], WD repeat-containing protein 36 (WDR36) [7], and cytochrome p450 1B1 [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Among these genes, MYOC has been found to harbor more glaucoma-causing mutations than any other identified risk gene [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The role of MYOC in POAG was first identified through genetic linkage analysis of families carrying juvenile-onset forms of POAG [5,9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In these families, MYOC mutations were found to associate with glaucoma phenotypes characterized by: 1) juvenile or early-age onset (&lt;40 years); 2) high intraocular pressure; and 3) autosomal dominant inheritance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Some MYOC mutations are associated with adult-onset (&gt;40 years) POAG and appear responsible for 3%–5% of cases worldwide [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Over 70 unique mutations have been identified [10], with many of these mutations being specific to a single population or ethnic group [11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Given that many MYOC mutations are found only in a single population, it is useful to screen MYOC in multiple populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>For example, a previous screen of 90 POAG cases from Ghana West-Africa yielded two novel glaucoma-causing mutations that have not been reported in any Caucasians cases [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>At present, work in numerous populations has led to a large catalog of mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>This catalog is useful for genetic screening, especially for first-degree relatives of individuals with POAG [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The catalog also provides targets for functional studies with mutant MYOC protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have suggested that MYOC mutations alter the solubility of MYOC protein [13,14] and disrupt its secretion [15-18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>These studies have benefitted from the growing assortment of mutations observed in humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Future studies will likely benefit from identifying additional MYOC mutations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Novel MYOC mutations will likely be found in sub-Saharan Africa populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>There is more genetic diversity within Africa than anywhere else on Earth [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Current data on sub-Saharan Africa is limited to two studies that focused on West Africans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>The first was conducted on a Ghanaian cohort in West Africa [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The second was conducted on an African American cohort [20], the majority of which were likely of West African ancestry [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>No studies have been reported in East or South African populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Here we report the first mutation screen of MYOC in black South Africans with POAG. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Our study can help to establish the contribution of MYOC mutations to POAG in this population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>It also can help identify novel mutations for future functional work and genetic screening. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>However, it was observed in one sample from the general population by Fingert et al. [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Functional predictions on Lys500Arg are conflicting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>One group predicted that the Lys500Arg substitution might have structural consequences similar to Ile499Phe [29], a glaucoma-causing mutation [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>However, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph/">Polyphen</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sift.jcvi.org/">SIFT</ext-link> predict Lys500Arg to be tolerated and Ile499Phe to be possibly damaging [27,28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Lys500Arg is of interest given its close proximity to a cryptic peroxisomal-targeting motif that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of MYOC-associated glaucoma [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>More evidence is needed to establish if Lys500Arg contributes to glaucoma. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>The Tyr453MetfsX11 mutation was observed at a relatively high rate in South Africans compared with previously reported populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>It was observed in 2.6% of South African cases (n=113). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>For comparison, it was observed in 0.3% of African American cases (n=312) [20], and no Ghanaian cases from West Africa (n=90) [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>This sequence variant has not been reported in any non-African populations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>This study was the first to find Tyr453MetfsX11 in a control. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>The one unaffected carrier was an 80 year old female with no evidence of glaucoma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Given the identification of an unaffected carrier, the Tyr453MetfsX11 mutation might be pathogenic but incompletely penetrant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Incomplete penetrance has been observed for other known glaucoma-causing mutations such as Gln368stop in Caucasian populations and Arg46stop in Asian populations [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Like these mutations, Tyr453MetfsX11 truncates the MYOC protein; however, it is a frameshift mutation that results in the addition of 10 ectopic amino acids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Only a small number of frameshift mutations have been reported to date, and these have been strongly associated with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.myocilin.com">glaucoma</ext-link> [10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>The Glu352Lys variant was also highly represented in this group of black South Africans compared with other populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>We observed the variant in 4.4% of our cases and 3.8% of our controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>By comparison, Glu352Lys has been reported at frequencies of 0.6% in African American (n=312) cases and 0.1% in Caucasian cases (n=727) [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>These low frequencies in other populations have made classification of the Glu352Lys variant difficult [20,24,25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>However, Glu352Lys appears to be benign in black South Africans as it was observed in several controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>This result is consistent with a previous functional study that found Glu352Lys did not alter MYOC protein solubility like some known pathogenic mutations [13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>It is not clear why an intronic variant, c.731–73C&gt;T, was overrepresented in the controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>One possibility was the variant could be overrepresented in IsiXhosa-speaking subjects, who constituted 31% of control subjects compared to only 20% of POAG subjects (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>However, the IsiXhosa controls carried the variant at a similar frequency (10%) as the total control frequency (9.9%) for this variant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this variant has not been reported in any previous studies of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.myocilin.com">MYOC</ext-link>. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>It is listed in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/">dbSNP</ext-link> database as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=79255460">rs79255460</ext-link>. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>While it is conceivable that the variant could protect against POAG, it is important to note that a Bonferroni correction would have eliminated significance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Replication of our result would warrant further study of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=79255460">rs79255460</ext-link>. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>One challenge with studying POAG in black South Africans is the low rate of diagnosis within this population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>A previous study found that, among an urban subpopulation of black adults, only 13% of POAG cases had been diagnosed [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>The low rate of diagnosis causes problems for both personal disease history and family history. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Reported family histories are likely to include many false negatives due to undiagnosed family members. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>In our study, only one carrier of a MYOC mutation claimed to have a parent with glaucoma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>The lack of family members with glaucoma may result from historically low rates of diagnosis among black South Africans. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Our results agree with previous work that suggests MYOC is not related to population differences in POAG prevalence [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Black South Africans, like other African groups, have a high rate of POAG compared to Caucasians [31-34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>However, black South Africans did not have a correspondingly high rate of MYOC mutations in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Based on this result, it appears that MYOC mutations are not responsible for increased levels of POAG in black South Africans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>This result is consistent with previous work with African populations [12,20]. </plain></SENT>
