Orthology alignment and functional genomics approaches allow the effective identification of signaling proteins by cross-species data integration. Recently, functional annotation of orthologs was transferred across organisms to predict novel roles for proteins. Despite the wide use of these methods, annotation of complete signaling pathways has not yet been transferred systematically between species.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>Here we introduce the concept of &#8216;signalog&#8217; to describe potential novel signaling function of a protein on the basis of the known signaling role(s) of its ortholog(s). To identify signalogs on genomic scale, we systematically transferred signaling pathway annotations among three animal species, the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, and humans. Using orthology data from InParanoid and signaling pathway information from the SignaLink database, we predict 88 worm, 92 fly, and 73 human novel signaling components. Furthermore, we developed an on-line tool and an interactive orthology network viewer to allow users to predict and visualize components of orthologous pathways. We verified the novelty of the predicted signalogs by literature search and comparison to known pathway annotations. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <underline>6 out</underline> of the predicted novel Notch pathway members were validated experimentally. Our approach predicts signaling roles for 19 human orthodisease proteins and 5 known drug targets, and suggests 14 novel drug target candidates.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Orthology-based pathway membership prediction between species enables the identification of novel signaling pathway components that we referred to as signalogs. Signalogs can be used to build a comprehensive signaling network in a given species. Such networks may increase the biomedical utilization of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. In humans, signalogs may identify novel drug targets and new signaling mechanisms for approved drugs.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Signal transduction pathways are involved in the control of various cellular processes, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and stress response in divergent animal phyla <xref rid="pone.0019240-PiresdaSilva1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In humans, dysregulation of signaling systems has been implicated in diverse pathologies, such as cancer, neuronal degeneration, muscle atrophy, immune deficiency and diabetes <xref rid="pone.0019240-Sakharkar1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. To understand better the physiological and pathological roles of signaling pathways, one should generate a comprehensive signaling map (network) that ideally contains all components of distinct signaling pathways and their genetic and physical interactions. Currently, studies in model organisms ranging from invertebrates to mammals are increasingly used to create such a network <xref rid="pone.0019240-Beyer1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The effort to map novel signaling components and interactions has largely benefited from network alignment techniques and other widely used functional genomics methods, allowing the integration of functional data both among and within species <xref rid="pone.0019240-Gabaldon1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019240-Kuzniar1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. For example, recent publications applied large-scale data integration and machine learning techniques to predict gene function, including signaling pathways in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0019240-Yan1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019240-Costello1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Most of these methods predict new gene or protein properties (annotations) on the basis of sequence homology and similarities between known functions. Similar annotation transfer approaches have been applied to predict structural properties (e.g., domain composition), expression profiles, and physical interactions for thousands of proteins <xref rid="pone.0019240-Yellaboina1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0019240-Salgado1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. For predicting interactions, for example, the network-based concept of &#8220;interologs&#8221; has been suggested: two proteins are predicted to physically interact, if their orthologs interact in another organism <xref rid="pone.0019240-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Interologs, however, were found to be less conserved than orthologs <xref rid="pone.0019240-Persico1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and less reliable than interactions generated by high-throughput (HTP) approaches <xref rid="pone.0019240-Cusick1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. A clear definition of interologs and their applicability to estimate the reliability of HTP experiments <xref rid="pone.0019240-Jensen1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019240-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> have been found to be useful in expanding protein interaction networks <xref rid="pone.0019240-Persico1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019240-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0019240-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The concept of interologs has been extended to &#8220;regulogs&#8221;, which can be identified by an orthology-based prediction of a regulatory interaction between a protein (i.e., a transcription factor) and a corresponding DNA sequence (i.e., a transcription factor binding site). In addition, recently, &#8220;phenologs&#8221; were used as predictors of disease-associated genes in model organisms <xref rid="pone.0019240-McGary1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>In large-scale analyses, protein-protein interaction data are usually obtained from HTP experiments, such as yeast two-hybrid screens. However, the low abundance of extracellular, membrane-bound and nuclear signaling components (e.g., ligands, receptors, and transcription factors) makes these experimental techniques only moderately efficient for identifying signaling interactions. Accordingly, several signaling pathway databases have been created manually by collecting relevant data from the literature <xref rid="pone.0019240-BauerMehren1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. However, so far most of them lack those key features (e.g., uniform pathway curation across more than one species) that would be necessary for transferring signaling pathway membership information between species. Reliable and detailed signaling pathway databases are crucial for signaling predictions because they are needed (1) as sources of known pathway information from which the predictions can be performed (i.e., seed data) and (2) as reference data sets against which the novelty of the predictions can be tested (i.e., those predicted signaling pathway member proteins that are already known pathway members should be removed from the list of predictions, while all others can be regarded as predicted components). Steps towards these goals have been taken, e.g., by Reactome <xref rid="pone.0019240-JoshiTope1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, where pathway curation is standardized and human signaling functions are transferred from other species. Further steps could be (i) to compare predictions with already published experimental evidence in target species, (ii) to predict signaling reactions in other species, and (iii) to use a database that explicitly allows orthology-based predictions for pathway components between organisms. A recent, comprehensive pathway resource from our lab, SignaLink, applies uniform curation rules to keep the levels of details to be identical in all examined pathways for <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and humans <xref rid="pone.0019240-Korcsmaros1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Moreover, the structure of the SignaLink dataset allows the systematic transfer of pathway annotations between two species on the basis of sequence orthology.</p><p>Interestingly, in two different organisms the same signaling pathway is often known at different levels of detail. This may be due to evolutionary divergence or to differences between the current coverage of the two organisms' interaction maps. Therefore, large-scale pathway annotation transfer between these 3 organisms can extend our current knowledge of their signaling pathways. Note that in cases of rapid evolution, orthology-based predictions are less reliable as even the orthologs exist, they no longer participate in the same signaling pathway <xref rid="pone.0019240-Beltrao1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>The topology of signaling pathways is important for selecting possible novel drug target candidates <xref rid="pone.0019240-Chaudhuri1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. As an example, drugs used for inhibiting a specific signaling protein in order to affect proliferation may actually activate the pathway by triggering an unknown negative feedback loop <xref rid="pone.0019240-Sergina1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Transferring signaling pathway annotations across species may alleviate such difficulties and can provide a more comprehensive signaling network. Identification of novel signaling components may help to discover drug targets as (i) these signaling components can increase the applicability of model organisms for testing drugs and drug target candidates, (ii) in humans, they can serve as potential novel drug targets, and (iii) in the case of already used target proteins they can help to uncover possible side-effects.</p><p>Here we introduce the concept of &#8216;signalog&#8217; to predict a protein as a novel component of a signaling pathway based on the signaling pathway membership of its ortholog in another organism. We identify signalogs on genomic scale in 8 signaling pathways, including the MAPK, TGF-&#946;, and WNT pathways (for a complete list, see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref>) from 3 intensively investigated species: <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and humans, and verify their novelty and predictive power, using both bioinformatics and experimental methods. We also show the utility of the signalog concept in drug target discovery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Source of signaling components and interactions</title><p>To predict a role for a protein (i.e. provide a successful annotation), the quality of the original sources from which the annotation transfer (prediction) can be performed is crucial. The original pathway data, including the lists of proteins of 8 distinct signaling pathways and their interactions were obtained from the SignaLink database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.signalink.org">http://www.signalink.org</ext-link>) <xref rid="pone.0019240-Korcsmaros1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The 8 pathways examined in this study were the EGF/MAPK (epidermal growth factor/mitogen activated protein kinase), TGF-&#946; (transforming growth factor-beta), insulin/IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1), Notch, WNT/Wingless, Hedgehog, JAK/STAT (Janus activating kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription), and NHR (nuclear hormone receptor) pathways. The basic properties of the SignaLink database are as follows: the components of the 8 pathways in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, and <italic>H. sapiens</italic> were compiled by applying uniform curation rules to keep the level of detail identical for all pathways examined; proteins were assigned to pathways based on literature data; and interactions were listed manually from original publications presenting biochemical evidence <xref rid="pone.0019240-Korcsmaros1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Note that the lower number of pathways in SignaLink, compared to other sources, is largely due to its more precise pathway definition rules. This approach avoids artificial grouping and reduces the number of pathways without reducing the numbers of proteins and interactions. (For an extensive comparison and benchmarking, see the <xref rid="pone.0019240-Korcsmaros1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.) Note that SignaLink uses more than 20 reviews per each pathway to list pathway components, in contrast to the average 5&#8211;15 reviews per a pathway in other resources <xref rid="pone.0019240-Korcsmaros1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The structure of SignaLink allows the systematic transfer of pathway annotations between two species on the basis of sequence orthology (see the next section).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Orthology assignment for identifying signalogs</title><p>Sequence-based approaches, also in combination with interaction networks, have been frequently applied to detect orthology relationships between proteins <xref rid="pone.0019240-Bandyopadhyay1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019240-Koonin1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. For example, the tool PathBLAST aligns an ordered list of proteins or pathways on the basis of their ortholog relations <xref rid="pone.0019240-Kelley1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) database, orthologous groups are defined through reciprocal best BLAST matches between proteins from at least three species <xref rid="pone.0019240-Tatusov1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019240-Altschul1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Furthermore, sequence clustering techniques incorporate a range of BLAST scores (not only the absolute best hits) and can achieve a higher sensitivity <xref rid="pone.0019240-Berglund1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. One of these techniques, InParanoid <xref rid="pone.0019240-Berglund1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, distinguishes between outparalogs, i.e., homologous sequences that emerged by duplication before speciation, and inparalogs that emerged after speciation. Compared to outparalogs, inparalogs are more likely to share functions. InParanoid incorporates the entire list of BLAST E-values (not only the top values) to group the proteins of the two compared organisms into orthologous clusters <xref rid="pone.0019240-Berglund1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Each cluster contains proteins with related sequences from the two species, and each protein has an Inparalog score (for the calculation of this score, see <xref rid="pone.0019240-Berglund1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>).</p><p>Previously, during the compilation of the SignaLink database, InParanoid data (version 6.1) were applied to find known signaling proteins by orthology searches <xref rid="pone.0019240-Korcsmaros1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019240-Berglund1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Based on SignaLink, now we can link a protein with a previously unknown signaling role to a signaling system, if the protein has an ortholog as a clearly identified component of a signaling pathway in another organism. For a protein with more than one ortholog (according to its InParanoid orthologous cluster), we used only those orthologs that have an Inparalog score higher than 0.3. To confirm that signalogs have no previously identified signaling interactions, we checked them with the protein-protein interaction search engines iHOP and ChiliBot <xref rid="pone.0019240-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019240-Fernandez1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Orthology-based pathway annotation transfer</title><p>In each of the three species examined (<italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, and <italic>H. sapiens</italic>), we listed those proteins that have no known signaling interactions but have at least one signaling pathway member ortholog in the other two species. Similarly to the concept of functional orthology <xref rid="pone.0019240-Bandyopadhyay1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, for each of these proteins we assumed that their pathway annotations (i.e., signaling role) can be transferred between species.

During this process, direct manual curation and Python scripts checking multiple proteins in one webservice were used. In each of the 3 species examined, we classified the predicted signalogs into 5 groups on the basis of their known properties in the literature: (1) no orthology information and/or no biochemical function is available; (2) there are known orthologs with unknown biochemical function; (3) orthology information: unknown, biochemical function: known; (4) known orthologs with known biochemical function(s); (5) known orthologs with known biochemical function and already known pathway annotation(s). Categories 1 to 5 denote a decreasing level of novelty. However, even category (5) contains signalogs for which at least one novel signaling pathway membership is predicted. Furthermore, to check the novelty of the predicted signaling pathway memberships, we compared the list of signalogs and their predicted pathway memberships to known pathway membership annotations from Reactome and KEGG <xref rid="pone.0019240-JoshiTope1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019240-Ogata1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>Next, we applied interologs to verify the novelty of our ortholog predictions.

To reveal the presence of signalogs in current orthology-based prediction databases, we compared already identified interologs in worms, flies, and humans using 3 species-specific datasets (WI8, DroID, and HomoMINT) <xref rid="pone.0019240-Persico1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019240-Yu2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019240-Simonis1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> with interologs generated from SignaLink data. Neither SignaLink <xref rid="pone.0019240-Korcsmaros1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> nor the current signalog identification approach identify interologs directly, thus we used an indirect method. First, we deduced interologs from SignaLink data by linking two proteins in an organism, if their orthologs interact in at least one other of the three organisms.

Note that the KEGG database contains pathway data for all three species examined, while Reactome database contains only human data <xref rid="pone.0019240-JoshiTope1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019240-Ogata1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. For <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>H. sapiens</italic>, we found 23, 19 and 35 signalog proteins, respectively, already present in KEGG, i.e., 20%, 26%, and 47% of all signalogs in the three organisms. From these proteins only 11, 5 and 15, respectively &#8211; i.e., 13.3% on average &#8211; were assigned to the same pathway in KEGG as in our prediction. Reactome contains 16 of the listed human signalogs (22% of all), but only 1 in the same pathway, as in our prediction. We conclude that, depending on the organism and the database, 20 to 47% of all signalog proteins are already present in KEGG or Reactome, however, the large majority (86.7%) of pathway memberships we predicted for them are novel.</p><p>Finally, to reveal the presence of signalogs in current orthology-based prediction databases, we used interologs (orthology-based predicted interactions). We compared the interologs generated for this test from the SignaLink dataset with the interologs listed for worms, flies and humans by 3 species-specific databases (WI8, DroID, and HomoMINT <xref rid="pone.0019240-Persico1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019240-Yu2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019240-Simonis1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>) (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref>). We examined only those interologs, where at least one of the interactors is a signalog protein. We found that in worms, flies and humans, respectively 34, 30, and 48 signalogs are present only in the SignaLink dataset,indicating that a high portion of the predicted proteins has not yet been investigated by this orthology-based prediction method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019240-g003">Fig. 3a</xref>). Altogether, in SignaLink and in the 3 species-specific resources, we found 1028, 1338, and 465 interologs in worms, flies and humans, respectively. The overlap between interologs generated from SignaLink and the interologs from any of the other 3 databases was relatively low: 5.5% in worms, 38.8% in flies and 12.5% in humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019240-g003">Fig. 3b</xref>). Shared interologs can be interpreted as already known orthology-based predictions. A low number of overlapping interologs suggests that most of our current signalog predictions are novel. The high number of novel interologs is probably due to (i) the uniform curation method used for compiling SignaLink for all three species; (ii) the underrepresentation of signaling proteins in the three species-specific interolog datasets [5% of all signaling proteins in worms (WI8) and flies (DroID), and 2.8% in humans (HomoMINT)]; and (iii) the stringency of the interolog filtering algorithm HomoMINT <xref rid="pone.0019240-Persico1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. We conclude that uniformly curated data sources, such as SignaLink, can facilitate orthology-based predictions.</p><p>While this study was in progress, Yan <italic>et al.</italic> predicted gene function for <italic>Drosophila</italic> with a large-scale machine learning technique <xref rid="pone.0019240-Yan1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. 1121 genes were predicted to function in the same pathways as those examined in our study.

Out of the 92 fly signalogs predicted by the current paper, only 27 genes are listed in this large-scale study, i.e., two-thirds of all fly signalogs still remain novel predicted signaling components. In the large-scale study of Yan <italic>et. al.</italic> these shared 27 genes have 42 pathway annotations (many of them belong to more than one pathway), while here we predict 34 pathway annotations for them. 15 out of these pathway annotations are identical (for 14 of the 27 shared genes).

We developed an interactive ortholog network viewer available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://signalink.org">http://signalink.org</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://signalink.org/signalog">http://signalink.org/signalog</ext-link>. This viewer can simultaneously visualize known and predicted pathway membership information, i.e., pathway annotation transfers (see snapshot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019240-g005">Fig. 5</xref> as an example), and allows the user to analyze, individually or together, the examined 8 signaling pathways in the 3 species. Interactive features of this signaling network viewer include zooming in/out and panning possibilities, and switching the pathway view between organisms. Proteins are hyperlinked to species-specific databases and interactions are hyperlinked to the PubMed abstract of the article(s) providing experimental evidence. Known signaling pathway member proteins and signaling interactions are visualized with colors different from predicted ones.</p><fig id="pone-0019240-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0019240.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Snapshot of the Notch pathway visualized with the ortholog network viewer.</title><p>This figure displays a subset of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Notch pathway with selected predicted pathway member proteins and their properties.

To analyze the drug target related importance of the 73 human signalog proteins identified, we first selected 2 proteins (ANPRA [P16066] and CASK [O14936]) that have all 4 key properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019240-g006">Fig. 6b</xref>). Both are established drug targets which supports the relevance of our analysis based on the 4 key properties. Our prediction suggests signaling roles for ANPRA and CASK in the WNT and EGF/MAPK pathways, respectively. We also predicted signaling roles for 3 additional proteins already used as drug targets (ABL2 [P42684], UGDH [O60701], and NDST1 [P52848]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019240-g006">Fig. 6b</xref>). Novel pathway annotations of these drug targets are likely to provide additional details about their mechanisms of action, enrich therapeutic relevance, and warn of potential side effects. Following the top scoring set we analyzed those 2 proteins, INSRR [P14616] and MARK2 [Q7KZI7], that still have 3 of the 4 key properties, but are currently not used as drug targets and are not known to be disease-related. We predicted that INSRR functions in the IGF/Insulin pathway, while MARK2 functions in both the EGF/MAPK and Wnt pathways. Participation of MARK2 in more than one pathway increases its relevance for drug target discovery <xref rid="pone.0019240-Korcsmaros1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019240-Hopkins1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019240-t002">Table 2</xref> lists the predicted signaling roles and drug target-like properties for the most promising drug target candidates and the drugs targeting the already used drug targets.

We identified altogether 253 signalog proteins in two model organisms &#8211; <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> &#8211; and humans. In addition, we developed and on-line tool allowing the users to predict signalogs and visualized known pathway data and predictions simultaneously with an ortholog network viewer. This viewer has distinctive features that can facilitate the interactive (user-defined) investigation of orthologous signaling networks, and it can visualize the predicted pathway components and their possible interactions, leading to the establishment of additional signalogs in later updates of the SignaLink database. The novelty of our predictions was verified by analyzing key properties, known pathway annotations, and already predicted interactions of signalogs. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we experimentally validated the signaling role of 6 predicted novel Notch pathway proteins. We anticipate that signalogs and, especially, orthodisease proteins of model organisms (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019240-t003">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019240-t004">Table 4</xref> and ref. <xref rid="pone.0019240-McGary1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>) can facilitate the design of novel, low cost primary drug screens with fewer tests in vertebrates. Our current study predicted signaling pathway memberships for 5 currently used drug target proteins and suggested 14 additional proteins that can be used as novel drug target candidates, based on their predicted pathway annotations and other properties (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019240-t002">Table 2</xref>). Our predictions may (i) reveal novel therapeutic intervention points (e.g., the use of signalogs as novel targets to block specific pathways); (ii) suggest novel applications of current drugs to diseases, where the newly predicted signaling pathway of their target is relevant, and (iii) help to identify possible side effects of currently used drugs <xref rid="pone.0019240-Berger1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019240-Schadt1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019240-Wist1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>.</p><p>The identification of novel signaling components may have an impact on various fields of biology. Extended signaling annotation may allow a better explanation of unexpected mutant phenotypes by linking the altered (signalog) gene to a signaling pathway with known phenotypes. Biological research often focuses on altering the function(s) of a single selected protein. However, this may cause undesired dysregulation of a signaling pathway, interfere with multiple cellular processes and lead to pleiotropic effects. Therefore, constructing more comprehensive signaling networks and identifying novel signaling components can certainly improve the design and evaluation of experiments.</p><p>In the postgenomic era novel tools and methods are constantly needed to integrate genomic information with cellular processes. Current knowledge on signaling pathways is far from complete. &#8216;White spots&#8217; can often be filled with the orthology-based transfer of &#8216;complete&#8217; signaling system annotations between species, for example, by the method presented here. This method can be effectively used for the prediction of novel signaling proteins. The InParanoid database contains more than 100 eukaryotic genomes and its downloadable algorithm can be applied to other genomes as well, thus, orthology information is not a limiting factor for signalog predictions. Currently, signalog predictions for other genomes are limited mainly by the absence of proper signaling pathway data sources. Most importantly, the curation rules of databases should be uniform across all analysed organisms and signaling pathways. Such databases would be essential for signalog predictions both as seeds and as reference data sets. Unfortunately, for species not yet listed in the SignaLink database, current comprehensive signaling maps (databases) do not contain data curated with these guidelines in sufficient quantities that would allow the prediction of novel signaling components. The on-line tool was designed such that extensions can be added easily and we will include more species and pathways as soon as they become available. Based on the results, examples, and experimental work of this study, we believe that the predicted signaling pathway memberships (signalogs) will be a good source of functional hypotheses to be experimentally verified in all three investigated organisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0019240.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
