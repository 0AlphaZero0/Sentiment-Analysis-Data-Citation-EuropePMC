</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Signal transduction pathways are involved in the control of various cellular processes, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and stress response in divergent animal phyla [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In humans, dysregulation of signaling systems has been implicated in diverse pathologies, such as cancer, neuronal degeneration, muscle atrophy, immune deficiency and diabetes [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>To understand better the physiological and pathological roles of signaling pathways, one should generate a comprehensive signaling map (network) that ideally contains all components of distinct signaling pathways and their genetic and physical interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Currently, studies in model organisms ranging from invertebrates to mammals are increasingly used to create such a network [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The effort to map novel signaling components and interactions has largely benefited from network alignment techniques and other widely used functional genomics methods, allowing the integration of functional data both among and within species [4], [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>For example, recent publications applied large-scale data integration and machine learning techniques to predict gene function, including signaling pathways in D. melanogaster [6], [7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Most of these methods predict new gene or protein properties (annotations) on the basis of sequence homology and similarities between known functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Similar annotation transfer approaches have been applied to predict structural properties (e.g., domain composition), expression profiles, and physical interactions for thousands of proteins [8]–[10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>For predicting interactions, for example, the network-based concept of “interologs” has been suggested: two proteins are predicted to physically interact, if their orthologs interact in another organism [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Interologs, however, were found to be less conserved than orthologs [12], and less reliable than interactions generated by high-throughput (HTP) approaches [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>A clear definition of interologs and their applicability to estimate the reliability of HTP experiments [14], [15] have been found to be useful in expanding protein interaction networks [12], [16]–[18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The concept of interologs has been extended to “regulogs”, which can be identified by an orthology-based prediction of a regulatory interaction between a protein (i.e., a transcription factor) and a corresponding DNA sequence (i.e., a transcription factor binding site). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In addition, recently, “phenologs” were used as predictors of disease-associated genes in model organisms [19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In large-scale analyses, protein-protein interaction data are usually obtained from HTP experiments, such as yeast two-hybrid screens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>However, the low abundance of extracellular, membrane-bound and nuclear signaling components (e.g., ligands, receptors, and transcription factors) makes these experimental techniques only moderately efficient for identifying signaling interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, several signaling pathway databases have been created manually by collecting relevant data from the literature [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>However, so far most of them lack those key features (e.g., uniform pathway curation across more than one species) that would be necessary for transferring signaling pathway membership information between species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Reliable and detailed signaling pathway databases are crucial for signaling predictions because they are needed (1) as sources of known pathway information from which the predictions can be performed (i.e., seed data) and (2) as reference data sets against which the novelty of the predictions can be tested (i.e., those predicted signaling pathway member proteins that are already known pathway members should be removed from the list of predictions, while all others can be regarded as predicted components). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Steps towards these goals have been taken, e.g., by Reactome [21], where pathway curation is standardized and human signaling functions are transferred from other species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Further steps could be (i) to compare predictions with already published experimental evidence in target species, (ii) to predict signaling reactions in other species, and (iii) to use a database that explicitly allows orthology-based predictions for pathway components between organisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>A recent, comprehensive pathway resource from our lab, SignaLink, applies uniform curation rules to keep the levels of details to be identical in all examined pathways for C. elegans, D. melanogaster and humans [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the structure of the SignaLink dataset allows the systematic transfer of pathway annotations between two species on the basis of sequence orthology. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in two different organisms the same signaling pathway is often known at different levels of detail. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>This may be due to evolutionary divergence or to differences between the current coverage of the two organisms' interaction maps. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Therefore, large-scale pathway annotation transfer between these 3 organisms can extend our current knowledge of their signaling pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Note that in cases of rapid evolution, orthology-based predictions are less reliable as even the orthologs exist, they no longer participate in the same signaling pathway [23]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The topology of signaling pathways is important for selecting possible novel drug target candidates [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>As an example, drugs used for inhibiting a specific signaling protein in order to affect proliferation may actually activate the pathway by triggering an unknown negative feedback loop [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Transferring signaling pathway annotations across species may alleviate such difficulties and can provide a more comprehensive signaling network. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Identification of novel signaling components may help to discover drug targets as (i) these signaling components can increase the applicability of model organisms for testing drugs and drug target candidates, (ii) in humans, they can serve as potential novel drug targets, and (iii) in the case of already used target proteins they can help to uncover possible side-effects. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Here we introduce the concept of ‘signalog’ to predict a protein as a novel component of a signaling pathway based on the signaling pathway membership of its ortholog in another organism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>We identify signalogs on genomic scale in 8 signaling pathways, including the MAPK, TGF-β, and WNT pathways (for a complete list, see the Methods) from 3 intensively investigated species: C. elegans, D. melanogaster and humans, and verify their novelty and predictive power, using both bioinformatics and experimental methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>We also show the utility of the signalog concept in drug target discovery. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>To predict a role for a protein (i.e. provide a successful annotation), the quality of the original sources from which the annotation transfer (prediction) can be performed is crucial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>The original pathway data, including the lists of proteins of 8 distinct signaling pathways and their interactions were obtained from the SignaLink database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.signalink.org">http://www.signalink.org</ext-link>) [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The 8 pathways examined in this study were the EGF/MAPK (epidermal growth factor/mitogen activated protein kinase), TGF-β (transforming growth factor-beta), insulin/IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1), Notch, WNT/Wingless, Hedgehog, JAK/STAT (Janus activating kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription), and NHR (nuclear hormone receptor) pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The basic properties of the SignaLink database are as follows: the components of the 8 pathways in C. elegans, D. melanogaster, and H. sapiens were compiled by applying uniform curation rules to keep the level of detail identical for all pathways examined; proteins were assigned to pathways based on literature data; and interactions were listed manually from original publications presenting biochemical evidence [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Note that the lower number of pathways in SignaLink, compared to other sources, is largely due to its more precise pathway definition rules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>This approach avoids artificial grouping and reduces the number of pathways without reducing the numbers of proteins and interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>(For an extensive comparison and benchmarking, see the [22].) Note that SignaLink uses more than 20 reviews per each pathway to list pathway components, in contrast to the average 5–15 reviews per a pathway in other resources [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>The structure of SignaLink allows the systematic transfer of pathway annotations between two species on the basis of sequence orthology (see the next section). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Sequence-based approaches, also in combination with interaction networks, have been frequently applied to detect orthology relationships between proteins [26], [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>For example, the tool PathBLAST aligns an ordered list of proteins or pathways on the basis of their ortholog relations [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>In the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) database, orthologous groups are defined through reciprocal best BLAST matches between proteins from at least three species [29], [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, sequence clustering techniques incorporate a range of BLAST scores (not only the absolute best hits) and can achieve a higher sensitivity [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>One of these techniques, InParanoid [31], distinguishes between outparalogs, i.e., homologous sequences that emerged by duplication before speciation, and inparalogs that emerged after speciation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Compared to outparalogs, inparalogs are more likely to share functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>InParanoid incorporates the entire list of BLAST E-values (not only the top values) to group the proteins of the two compared organisms into orthologous clusters [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Each cluster contains proteins with related sequences from the two species, and each protein has an Inparalog score (for the calculation of this score, see [31]). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Previously, during the compilation of the SignaLink database, InParanoid data (version 6.1) were applied to find known signaling proteins by orthology searches [22], [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Based on SignaLink, now we can link a protein with a previously unknown signaling role to a signaling system, if the protein has an ortholog as a clearly identified component of a signaling pathway in another organism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>For a protein with more than one ortholog (according to its InParanoid orthologous cluster), we used only those orthologs that have an Inparalog score higher than 0.3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>To confirm that signalogs have no previously identified signaling interactions, we checked them with the protein-protein interaction search engines iHOP and ChiliBot [32], [33]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>In each of the three species examined (C. elegans, D. melanogaster, and H. sapiens), we listed those proteins that have no known signaling interactions but have at least one signaling pathway member ortholog in the other two species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Similarly to the concept of functional orthology [26], for each of these proteins we assumed that their pathway annotations (i.e., signaling role) can be transferred between species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>In other words, we predicted that such a protein is a member of the signaling pathway(s) to which its ortholog(s) in the organism belong(s). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>These proteins were termed as signalog proteins (signalogs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Note also that in SignaLink [22] a protein can belong to more than one pathway. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>To grade the novelty of signalogs (signaling pathway annotations) and quantify the confidence level of each prediction, we performed semi-automated searches using PubMed, UniProt, GO, Wormbase, FlyBase, iHOP, and Chilibot web services [32]–[37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>During this process, direct manual curation and Python scripts checking multiple proteins in one webservice were used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>In each of the 3 species examined, we classified the predicted signalogs into 5 groups on the basis of their known properties in the literature: (1) no orthology information and/or no biochemical function is available; (2) there are known orthologs with unknown biochemical function; (3) orthology information: unknown, biochemical function: known; (4) known orthologs with known biochemical function(s); (5) known orthologs with known biochemical function and already known pathway annotation(s). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, to check the novelty of the predicted signaling pathway memberships, we compared the list of signalogs and their predicted pathway memberships to known pathway membership annotations from Reactome and KEGG [21], [38]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Next, we applied interologs to verify the novelty of our ortholog predictions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>(An interolog is a pair of proteins predicted to interact based on the interaction of the two proteins' orthologs in at least one other organism [11].) To reveal the presence of signalogs in current orthology-based prediction databases, we compared already identified interologs in worms, flies, and humans using 3 species-specific datasets (WI8, DroID, and HomoMINT) [12], [39], [40] with interologs generated from SignaLink data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Neither SignaLink [22] nor the current signalog identification approach identify interologs directly, thus we used an indirect method. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>First, we deduced interologs from SignaLink data by linking two proteins in an organism, if their orthologs interact in at least one other of the three organisms. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>In our report we introduced a method for predicting novel signaling pathway components, signalogs, in 3 species, based on the signaling roles of their orthologs in other organisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>We identified altogether 253 signalog proteins in two model organisms – C. elegans and D. melanogaster – and humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>In addition, we developed and on-line tool allowing the users to predict signalogs and visualized known pathway data and predictions simultaneously with an ortholog network viewer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>This viewer has distinctive features that can facilitate the interactive (user-defined) investigation of orthologous signaling networks, and it can visualize the predicted pathway components and their possible interactions, leading to the establishment of additional signalogs in later updates of the SignaLink database. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>The novelty of our predictions was verified by analyzing key properties, known pathway annotations, and already predicted interactions of signalogs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>In C. elegans, we experimentally validated the signaling role of 6 predicted novel Notch pathway proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>We anticipate that signalogs and, especially, orthodisease proteins of model organisms (see Table 3 and Table 4 and ref. [19]) can facilitate the design of novel, low cost primary drug screens with fewer tests in vertebrates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>Our current study predicted signaling pathway memberships for 5 currently used drug target proteins and suggested 14 additional proteins that can be used as novel drug target candidates, based on their predicted pathway annotations and other properties (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>Our predictions may (i) reveal novel therapeutic intervention points (e.g., the use of signalogs as novel targets to block specific pathways); (ii) suggest novel applications of current drugs to diseases, where the newly predicted signaling pathway of their target is relevant, and (iii) help to identify possible side effects of currently used drugs [59], [64], [65]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>The identification of novel signaling components may have an impact on various fields of biology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>Extended signaling annotation may allow a better explanation of unexpected mutant phenotypes by linking the altered (signalog) gene to a signaling pathway with known phenotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>Biological research often focuses on altering the function(s) of a single selected protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>However, this may cause undesired dysregulation of a signaling pathway, interfere with multiple cellular processes and lead to pleiotropic effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>Therefore, constructing more comprehensive signaling networks and identifying novel signaling components can certainly improve the design and evaluation of experiments. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>In the postgenomic era novel tools and methods are constantly needed to integrate genomic information with cellular processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>Current knowledge on signaling pathways is far from complete. ‘White spots’ can often be filled with the orthology-based transfer of ‘complete’ signaling system annotations between species, for example, by the method presented here. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>This method can be effectively used for the prediction of novel signaling proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>The InParanoid database contains more than 100 eukaryotic genomes and its downloadable algorithm can be applied to other genomes as well, thus, orthology information is not a limiting factor for signalog predictions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>Currently, signalog predictions for other genomes are limited mainly by the absence of proper signaling pathway data sources. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, the curation rules of databases should be uniform across all analysed organisms and signaling pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>Such databases would be essential for signalog predictions both as seeds and as reference data sets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, for species not yet listed in the SignaLink database, current comprehensive signaling maps (databases) do not contain data curated with these guidelines in sufficient quantities that would allow the prediction of novel signaling components. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>The on-line tool was designed such that extensions can be added easily and we will include more species and pathways as soon as they become available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>Based on the results, examples, and experimental work of this study, we believe that the predicted signaling pathway memberships (signalogs) will be a good source of functional hypotheses to be experimentally verified in all three investigated organisms. </plain></SENT>
