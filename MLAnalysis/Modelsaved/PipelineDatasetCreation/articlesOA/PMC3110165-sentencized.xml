</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sixty children were classified as having chronic, light, or no STH infections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured in medium for 5 days to measure cytokine accumulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RNA was isolated from peripheral blood and gene expression analysed using microarrays. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Different infection groups were compared for the purpose of analysis: STH infection (combined chronic and light vs. uninfected groups) and chronic STH infection (chronic vs. combined light and uninfected groups). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The chronic STH infection effect was associated with elevated production of GM-CSF (P = 0.007), IL-2 (P = 0.03), IL-5 (P = 0.01), and IL-10 (P = 0.01). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Data reduction suggested that chronic infections were primarily associated with an immune phenotype characterized by elevated IL-5 and IL-10, typical of a modified Th2-like response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Chronic STH infections were associated with the up-regulation of genes associated with immune homeostasis (IDO, P = 0.03; CCL23, P = 0.008, HRK, P = 0.005), down-regulation of microRNA hsa-let-7d (P = 0.01) and differential regulation of several genes associated with granulocyte-mediated inflammation (IL-8, down-regulated, P = 0.0002; RNASE2, up-regulated, P = 0.009; RNASE3, up-regulated, p = 0.03). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Chronic STH infections were associated with a cytokine response indicative of a modified Th2 response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>There was evidence that STH infections were associated with a pattern of gene expression suggestive of the induction of homeostatic mechanisms, the differential expression of several inflammatory genes and the down-regulation of microRNA has-let-7d. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Soil-transmitted helminth (STH or intestinal worm) infections are extremely common infectious diseases of childhood in developing countries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Infections tend be chronic and may last for many years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Chronic STH infections are associated with modulation of the immune response, a consequence of which may be a reduced prevalence of allergic inflammatory diseases such as asthma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms by which STH infections suppress inflammatory responses are poorly understood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In this study, we hypothesized that STH infections may affect immune responses through alterations of immune homeostasis (or the steady-state adjustments of the immune system that maintain equilibrium). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>We investigated the capacity of blood from children classified as having no, light, or chronic STH infections to produce cytokines at rest (i.e. no immunologic stimulation) and the expression of genes in blood samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Our data show that blood cells of children with chronic STH infections have an altered immune response that is likely to be associated with less allergic inflammation (the modified Th2 response) and that the expression of some inflammatory genes are reduced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms by which STH infections suppress immune responses in children to ensure the survival of the parasite and reduce inflammation. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>An estimated two billion people worldwide are infected with soil-transmitted helminth (STH or intestinal helminth or geohelminth) parasites of which Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura are the most prevalent [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>STH infections are associated with significant morbidity largely related to the nutritional effects of a chronically infected state among pre-school and school age children [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>STH infections have been associated with impaired immunity to vaccines [3], [4] and mucosal pathogens [5], and the modulation of inflammatory diseases such as asthma [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms by which chronic human STH infections modulate immune responses are poorly understood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>For STH parasites to have modulatory effects at distal sites (e.g. lung) to non-parasite antigens (e.g. aeroallergens), they would be expected to influence systemic immunity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Such influences could be mediated by alterations in immune homeostatic mechanisms that may include the enhanced production of immune modulatory cytokines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, alterations in immune homeostasis could occur through effects on mRNA and/or microRNA expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play an important role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and are considered to be critical for the regulation of innate and adaptive immunity [7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In the present study we investigated the impact of chronic STH infections on immune homeostasis by measurement of the production of a range of cytokines and chemokines by unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and on mRNA and microRNA expression in unstimulated peripheral blood from children. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>A mechanism by which STH infections may have wide-ranging effects on host immunity is through alterations of immune homeostasis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the effects of chronic STH infections on immune homeostasis by measurement of the accumulation of cytokines in vitro by unstimulated PBMCs and gene expression by unstimulated whole blood. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Our data show that PBMCs from children with chronic infections produce higher levels of GM-CSF, IL-2, IL-5, and IL-10 spontaneously compared to those from children without chronic infections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF and IL-5 have important roles in eosinophil recruitment, activation and survival in the tissues [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Elevated levels of GM-CSF and IL-5 in plasma from individuals infected with helminths have been associated with enhanced eosinophil survival [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Given that chronic infection effect was associated also with an upregulation of the genes for eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (RNASE2) and eosinophil cationic protein (RNASE3), such observations may indicate a mechanism by which parasite numbers are controlled during chronic infections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>In addition, IL-2 appears to be important for the induction of IL-5 in PBMCs in helminth-infected individuals [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that the frequency of individuals producing detectable IL-10 spontaneously is greater among children living in an unhygienic environment [18] and among those with STH infections [19], and IL-10 production has been associated with immune regulation during chronic helminth infections [20]–[22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>The elevated production of IL-10 spontaneously during helminth infections could contribute to immune homeostasis by raising the threshold for the induction of effector inflammatory responses in the tissues [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Data reduction provided evidence that chronic infections were associated with a cytokine profile (IL-5 and IL-10), consistent with a modified Th2 immune response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>The modified Th2 response was originally described to explain a ‘tolerant immune response’ to cat allergen that develops on high levels of allergen exposure and is associated with elevated allergen-specific IgG4 and T cells expressing IL-5 and IL-10 [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>The modified Th2 response thus describes a tolerant phenotype that is distinct from classical IL-4-induced Th2 immunity that is considered to drive allergic inflammation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, this term has been used to describe a similar immune response characteristic of chronic experimental helminth infections in mouse models [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that a modified Th2-like response develops among children with chronic STH infections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Such an immune response representing a regulated Th2 response may be an important feature of balanced parasitism that ensures parasite survival but protects the host from Th2-induced pathology. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Several genes were differentially regulated during chronic STH infection in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Given that we analysed unstimulated peripheral blood collected during chronic infections, we expected to see subtle alterations in the gene expression profiles using a cut-off of at least a 1.5-fold change in gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Large perturbations in gene expression might be expected to have significant morbid consequences and would be not be expected to occur in the context of a state of balanced parasitism as is the case of chronic STH infections in humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>The STH and chronic STH effects were associated with the differential regulation of genes linked with neutrophil-mediated inflammation: down-regulation of genes linked with the chemotaxis (IL-8) [26], activation (IL-8) [26], transendothelial migration (VNN2) [27], and inhibition of apoptosis (PBEF1) [28] of neutrophils, while a gene that inhibits the production by and release of neutrophils from the bone marrow (CCL23) [29] was up-regulated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Such gene regulation could have the effect of modulating potential pathology-inducing responses to migratory larvae of A. lumbricoides – neutrophils play a prominent role in pathology caused by the migration of Ascaris larvae through the lungs [30] and other tissues [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Both infection effects were associated also with the up-regulation of eosinophil mediators with potent helminthotoxic functions (RNASE2 [eosinophil-derived neurotoxin] and RNASE3 [eosinophil cationic protein] [32] perhaps indicating an up-regulation of signals promoting eosinophilia (i.e. in conjunction with the elevated production by PBMCs of spontaneous GM-CSF and IL-5 observed in chronic infections) and helminth-killing ability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>In addition, we observed up-regulation of several genes considered to be involved in immune homeostasis (e.g. IDO [33], CCL23 [34], and HRK [35]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Immune homeostasis reflects a complex state in which interactions between innate and adaptive immunity prevent inappropriate inflammatory responses to harmless immunogens but permit the development of appropriate but controlled immune responses to harmful exogenous immunogens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>IDO (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase) has a key role in the suppression of acute inflammatory responses and the promotion of immune tolerance [33] and has been shown to contribute to the establishment of chronic fungal infections by induction of regulatory T cells and the suppression of the Th17-inflammatory pathway [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>IDO may have also a role in the modulation of allergic inflammatory responses [33] and up-regulation of IDO as observed in the present study may, therefore, be relevant to the development of chronicity during STH infections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>The chronic STH effect was associated also with the differential regulation of genes for HLA class II molecules: HLA-DRB3 and HLA-DRB4 were upregulated but LOC731682 (HLA class II, DQ(1) alpha chain precursor-like) was downregulated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>The biological significance of these observations are not clear but could be addressed in future studies. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first reported study to investigate the potential role of miRNAs during chronic helminth infections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>In our analysis we observed the significant differential expression of a single miRNA, hsa-let-7d, that was down-regulated approximately 20-fold for both STH and chronic infection effects suggestive of the progressive down-regulation of this gene from uninfected to infected to chronically infected children. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>There is a growing literature on the potential role of hsa-let-7d in disease processes: decreased expression has been associated with decreased survival in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [40] and with impairment of pulmonary function and development of disease in a murine model of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Expression of hsa-let-7d may have a role also in iron metabolism in erythroid cells and the intestine [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>CCL23 was found to be a putative target for hsa-let-7d. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>The strong down regulation of hsa-let-7d during STH infection was associated with an increased expression of CCL23, a gene with several important functions including the suppression of the production and release of neutrophils from the bone marrow [29] and of colony formation by immune cells in vitro [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>There is evidence from murine models that antagonism of specific miRNAs may attenuate the inflammatory and clinical processes associated with Th2-driven airways inflammation [44]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>An important limitation was the small sample size that limited the power to detect relatively small changes in the expression of a large number of genes in peripheral blood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>The analysis was exploratory and our data provide evidence for the differential expression of several potentially relevant genes such as IL-8 and the microRNA hsa-let-7d. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>The sample size was limited by the high cost of these analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>We had to screen a relatively large population of school children to select our study population using strict selection criteria based on the presence or absence of STH infection in serial stool samples and anti-Ascaris IgG and IgG4 in plasma samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Although this selection process allowed us to identify well-defined sub-groups of children that were of specific interest for our study objectives, our findings cannot necessarily be generalized to all children with STH infections, particularly as the prevalence of our STH infection sub-groups as defined will be extremely variable between populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>We defined chronic infection on the basis of repeated stool samples being positive for A. lumbricoides and the presence of anti-A. lumbricoides IgG4 antibodies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>The presence of parasite-specific IgG4 is a well-recognised feature of chronic helminth infections [45] including those with STH parasites [19], [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>The use of anti-A. lumbricoides IgG4 to define chronic STH infection could have biased the results with respect to IL-10 production because this cytokine differentially induces IgG4 in B cells [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>However, elevated spontaneous IL-10 has been reported in children with STH infections previously [19], [48], [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>We defined homeostasis by the measurement of basal or unstimulated cytokine production by PBMCs and gene expression in unstimulated whole blood [18], [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Such a definition may be subject to significant limitations: 1) Measurements were taken at a single time point. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies conducted from the time of first exposures to STH infections in infancy will be required to indicate more strongly a causal association between the development of chronic STH infection and such effects on immune responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>2) The measurement of the accumulation of cytokines over 5 days by unstimulated PBMCs may be complicated by other processes such as the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages and cell death. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Such in vitro artefacts would be expected to occur in all cultures irrespective of study group and would mask rather than emphasize inter-group differences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Further, our findings are consistent with those of previous studies of helminth-infected individuals in which unstimulated whole blood or PBMCs were cultured for variable periods of one to five days [18], [19], [22], [48], [49], [51], [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Recently the cells producing IL-10 spontaneously in helminth-infected individuals have been identified as CD4+ T regulatory type 1 cells [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Further, we observed also elevated production of IL-10 (P = 0.04) and a trend of increased IL-5 in chronic versus non-chronic infections in PBMC cultures stimulated with A. lumbricoides antigen (data not shown), an observation that is consistent with the findings from unstimulated cultures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Because the study was cross-sectional and we had no data on previous parasite infections, we cannot exclude heavy previous infections in the light infection group or past infections in the uninfected group although, in the case of the latter, the children were unlikely to have been infected recently because of the absence of A. lumbricoides-specific IgG antibodies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>However, such misclassification would be expected to reduce the size of inter-group differences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>The comparisons were not controlled for potential confounders and there were differences, albeit non-significant, between the groups in nutritional factors such as the prevalence of anemia. </plain></SENT>
