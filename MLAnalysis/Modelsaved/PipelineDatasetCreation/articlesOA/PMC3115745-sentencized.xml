</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Cataract is the leading cause of visual impairment worldwide, with approximately 37 million people affected, accounting for 48% of global blindness and with approximately half of all cases originating in Africa and Asia [1,2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Approximately 80% of all cataracts are age-related and idiopathic [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Age-related cataract (ARC) has been deﬁned as the appearance of the clinical sign of cataracts in one or both eyes in a person older than 50 years [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>ARC accounts for 18 million cases of blindness and 59 million cases of reduced vision worldwide [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Depending on the location of the opacity within the lens, age-related cataracts can be divided into four categories: nuclear, cortical, posterior subcapsular, and mixed type [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The development of ARC is complex and multi-factorial, where genetic predisposition and environmental elements both contribute to the pathological condition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Family epidemiological investigations have showed that hereditary factors play an important role in the occurrence of ARC [7-11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it is known that cortical cataract is highly heritable among four types of age-related cataract [10,11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Over the past several years, to have better comprehension of the molecular processes that are associated with cataract development, attempts have been made to identify the genes and characterize the proteins they encode [3,12-18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>However, the exact genetic mechanism and pathogenesis of age-related cataract remain unclear. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Eph-receptor tyrosinekinase-type A2 (EPHA2) encodes a 976 amino acid, type-1 transmembrane protein with extracellular NH2-terminal and cytoplasmic COOH-terminal halves [19] and is a member of the largest sub-family of receptor tyrosine kinases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The human EPHA2 gene is located on chromosome 1p36, where linkage with autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive cataracts has been reported [20-24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Recently, several EPHA2 variants were found to be associated with age-related cortical cataracts in different worldwide Caucasian populations [5,13,25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, accumulated evidences have shown that genetic heterogeneity existed in different ethnic cohorts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we examined whether EPHA2 polymorphisms were associated with the susceptibility to age-related cataract in a Han Chinese population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In this study we found that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp?term=rs477558">rs477558</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp?term=rs7548209">rs7548209</ext-link> in EPHA2 were associated with age-related cortical cataract in a Han Chinese population. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>The results showed that <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp?term=rs477558">SNP rs477558</ext-link> and SNP <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp?term=rs7548209">rs7548209</ext-link> were associated with the susceptibility to age-related cortical cataract. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>EPHA2 belongs to the largest sub-family of receptor tyrosine kinases, and the Eph receptors and their membrane-anchored ephrin ligands form cell-contact-dependent bidirectional signaling pathways affecting diverse cellular processes including: actin cytoskeleton, cell-substrate adhesion, cell shape and cell movement, cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation [28-31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that the EPH/ephrin system is critical for vision processes in the midbrain [32] and for neural development [33], and it was recently reported that ephrin-A5, a ligand of EPHA2, acts as a regulator for EPHA2, and loss of ephrin-A5 function can lead to cataract by disrupting lens fiber cell-packing in mice [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>In 2009 [5], it was demonstrated that cytoplasmic trapping was likely to interrupt both signaling and structural functions of EPHA2/ephrinA system in lens fiber cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cataractogenesis in EphA2 knockout mice implied that EphA2 was essential for maintaining lens clarity [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>In addition, genetic variants of the EPHA2 gene were identified to confer risks for age-related cortical cataracts in a Caucasian population [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>The association of EPHA2 with age-related cataracts in Caucasians prompted us to investigate its association with ARC in the Han Chinese population. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp?term=rs7548209">rs7548209</ext-link> SNP was positively associated with ARC in the Han Chinese population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>This result is consistent with earlier findings of ARC studies in three worldwide Caucasian populations [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>We also detected an association between the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp?term=rs477558">rs477558</ext-link> SNP and ARC, a result which is in agreement with earlier findings reported in an ARC study of a Northern Italian population [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis showed a strong association of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp?term=rs3768293">rs3768293</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp?term=rs3754334">rs3754334</ext-link> in the EPHA2 gene with ARC in three worldwide Caucasian populations [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>In addition, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp?term=rs707455">rs707455</ext-link> has been reported to be associated with ARC in the Northern Italian population [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Our study failed to find an association of the aforementioned three SNPs with ARC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, two SNPs in EPHA2, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp?term=rs6603867">rs6603867</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp?term=rs6678616">rs6678616</ext-link>, have been investigated for their significant association with ARC in the different Caucasian groups [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>As <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp?term=rs6678616">rs6678616</ext-link> is not polymorphic and the minor allele frequency of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp?term=rs6603867">rs6603867</ext-link> is low (5%) in the Han Chinese population according to the International <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hapmap.org">HapMap</ext-link> data, they were ﬁnally excluded in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest that SNP-based allele frequencies and thereby association with a disease phenotype often vary among different ethnic groups. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>As association studies may be influenced by many factors, the following measures were used to validate the results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>First, only patients with primary cortical cataracts who underwent lens extraction were included in the present study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>If there was any doubt, patients were excluded from the study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Then, unrelated healthy individuals were selected from the same geographical regions as the ARC patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>The patients and controls were age-, sex-, and ethnically matched. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Finally, 20% of the samples were randomly chosen and analyzed by direct sequencing in an attempt to validate the PCR-RFLP data. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>As with other candidate gene studies, there are several limitations in our study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>First, as the power to detect disease susceptibility genes is influenced by the number of patient samples, the size of the patient sample group in our study seemed to be relatively small, and the patients were recruited only from the Han Chinese population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>The results observed in this study need to be confirmed using larger sample sizes and other ethnic populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>Second, the biologic functions of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp?term=rs477558">rs477558</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp?term=rs7548209">rs7548209</ext-link>, two associated SNPs demonstrated in our study, need to be further investigated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Third, age-related cataract is termed as nuclear, cortical, posterior subcapsular, or mixed cataract by the zone of opacification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>In this study, we included only cortical cataract cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>The association of SNPs in EPHA2 might account for all types of ARC, so our study also needs to detect the association of EPHA2 with the other three types. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our study identiﬁed the association of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp?term=rs477558">rs477558</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp?term=rs7548209">rs7548209</ext-link> in EPHA2 with age-related cortical cataract in a Han Chinese population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>A large number of well matched samples, multiple ethnic groups, and further functional studies will contribute to the understanding of genetic predisposition to risk of ARC, identiﬁcation of disease-causing variants, and knowledge of the underlying mechanisms by which disease-causing variants affect disease susceptibility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, the present study is the first report of a Han Chinese population on the association of EPHA2 with age-related cortical cataract. </plain></SENT>
