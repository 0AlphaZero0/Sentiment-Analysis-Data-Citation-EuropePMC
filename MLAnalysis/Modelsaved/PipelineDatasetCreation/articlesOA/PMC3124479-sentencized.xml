</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism in gene silencing and imprinting [1], [2], [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Aberrant epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressors by CpG island hypermethylation is commonly observed in human malignancies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) is characterized by propensity for widespread CpG island hypermethylation [4], [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>High degree of CIMP (CIMP-high) is a distinct phenotype in colorectal cancer, associated with older age, female gender, proximal tumor location, microsatellite instability, BRAF mutation, and high-level tumor LINE-1 methylation [6], [7], [8], [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>However, etiologic factors for CIMP-high remain largely speculative. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Despite a strong association between CIMP and BRAF mutation in colorectal cancer [5], [6], [7], [8], the hypothesis that BRAF mutation causes aberrant CpG island methylation [10] has been highly controversial [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Recently, DNMT3B has emerged as one of causes of CpG island methylation in tumor [12], [13], [14]; nonetheless, the association between DNMT3B and CIMP in colorectal cancer is at most modest [13] and tumor CpG island methylation appears to be influenced by additional factors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Folic acid and related vitamins B2, B6 and B12, are essential for DNA methylation and the production of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides required for DNA synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Considerable epidemiological evidence suggests that a low-folate diet is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [15], [16], [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Likewise, alcohol consumption increases colorectal cancer risk [18], likely through its anti-folate effects [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>We have recently shown that adequate folate intake and low consumption of alcohol are protective against LINE-1 hypomethylated colon cancer, but not against LINE-1 hypermethylated colon cancer [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>While a recent study demonstrated an association between folate and CpG island methylation in normal colorectal tissue [21], how folate or other B vitamin intake influences CpG island methylation or BRAF mutation in tumor remains less well understood, and the literature data are somewhat limited [22], [23], [24], [25]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>We therefore assessed whether the influence of folate on colon cancer risk differed according to CIMP and BRAF status. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, we used tumor specimens from a prospective cohort study that has previously shown that folate intake was inversely associated with the risk of colon cancer [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The availability of detailed and updated information on folate intake and tumor specimens within this cohort permitted a more comprehensive examination of the effect of folate intake on risk of developing CIMP-high and non-CIMP-high colon cancers as well as by BRAF mutational status. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Specificity in the association between folate and colon cancer to particular tumor phenotypes would further enhance the case for causality and would provide important insights into the carcinogenic mechanisms of folate deficiency. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Dietary intake of various nutrients including folate, vitamin B6, B12, and methionine were assessed by self-administered semiquantitative food frequency questionnaires (SFFQ), which were completed in 1980, 1984, 1986, 1990, 1994, and 1998. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Nutrient intakes were calculated by multiplying the reported frequency of consumption of each specified food item by the nutrient content of the specified portion size and then summing these products for all food items. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Information on multivitamin use and the use of other supplements was also collected, including details on which brand name and type. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>In a previous analysis of this cohort, folate intake was significantly associated with the risk of colon cancer but had no influence on the risk of rectal cancer [26]; as a result, we did not consider incident rectal cancer among the study participants in this analysis. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Our current study is a prototypical study in “Molecular Pathological Epidemiology”, the concept of which has been recently described and consolidated by Ogino et al. [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>It represents a relatively new, specialized field of epidemiology based on the molecular classification of cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>In molecular pathologic epidemiology, a known or suspected etiologic factor is examined in relation to a specific somatic molecular change, in order to gain insights into the carcinogenic mechanism [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Assume, a given etiologic factor (lifestyle, dietary, environmental or genetic) is hypothesized to cause a certain somatic molecular change. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>If we can demonstrate a specific relationship between the etiologic factor and the molecular change, it can provide evidence for causality. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>In addition, for an individual who has a susceptibility to a specific somatic molecular change leading to cancer, we may be able to develop a personalized preventive measure, which targets specific molecules or pathways [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>Therefore, molecular pathologic epidemiology research can contribute to deciphering the carcinogenic process as well as optimizing preventive strategies [45]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>In this prospective cohort study, we found suggestions for both low folate and vitamin B6 intakes to be associated with an increased risk of CIMP-low/0 colon cancers but not with that of CIMP-high tumors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>The elevation in risk was principally limited to participants with the lowest levels of folate and vitamin B6 intake. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>In addition, we observed that the effect of a higher methionine intake on colon cancer risk modestly differed by tumoral CIMP status, with the beneficial effect of methionine being principally limited to CIMP-high cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the effects of folate or B vitamins on colon cancers stratified by BRAF status. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Moreover, none of the observed associations reached statistical significance. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Mechanistically, it appears plausible that chronic folate deficiency may be involved in CpG island methylation [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>In a Japanese population, reduced activity of the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) due to the MTHFR codon 429 variant (rs1801131), thereby impairing folate metabolism, has been associated with CIMP-high tumors in the proximal colon [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>In a Caucasian population, genetic variation in the MTHFR rs1801131 variant appears to increase risk of CIMP-high colon tumors [48], [49] although this has not been confirmed by the Netherlands Cohort Study data [22], [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>The relation between the MTHFR SNP and CIMP in colon cancer is strong in combination with low folate and methionine intake as well as high alcohol consumption [49], [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>A more recent study suggests that low expression of gamma-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH) is strongly associated with CIMP-high tumors, providing further support for a role of one-carbon metabolism in this phenotype [52]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>A prior case-control study of 1,154 colon tumors assessed the influence of one-carbon nutrient intake on CIMP as well as BRAF status in these tumors and found them not to be associated with either CIMP-high or BRAF mutation [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>However, compared to our current study, nonquantitative methylation-specific PCR on a different CpG island panel, and a less stringent definition of CIMP-high (2 or more of 5 markers methylated) were used in that study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the authors also observed that obesity was associated with a two-fold risk of having a non-CIMP-high tumor [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>In our study, after carefully adjusting for obesity, both folate and vitamin B6 (the intake of which is highly correlated in our population) were associated with risk of CIMP-low/0 tumors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>In another case-case study within the Netherlands Cohort Study, colorectal cancer patients in the low folate/high alcohol intake group are more likely to have promoter hypermethylation than patients in the high folate/low alcohol group [53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Notably, the Netherlands Cohort Study has shown a possible association between vitamin B6 and MLH1 methylation [22] and an inverse association between MTR rs1805087 polymorphism and CIMP in men [22]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>In one of the most recent study to evaluate associations between one-carbon metabolism and colon cancer by CIMP/BRAF status, to date, utilizing a nested case-control approach within the Northern Sweden Health and Disease study (190 cases and 1∶2 matched controls) [24], van Guelpen et al. show a lower risk of CIMP-low/CIMP-high colorectal tumors with very low folate levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Collectively, there is accumulating evidence for the hypothesis that a balance between various metabolic intermediates of methyl-group influences locus-specific CpG island methylation reaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Utilizing data from an adenoma prevention trial of folic acid and aspirin, finally, higher RBC folate levels, but not higher dietary folate consumption, was associated with higher methylation levels [21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Besides influence of one-carbon nutrients, evidence suggests that local DNA sequence context may influence assembly of a methylation reaction machinery and locus-specific DNA methylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Studies have shown that cis-acting elements cause allele-specific methylation in the mammalian genome [54], [55], [56]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Thus, germline variations in cis-acting elements may influence epigenetic status including DNA methylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>The MLH1 rs1800734 promoter SNP has been associated with MLH1 promoter methylation [57], [58] and MSI [59] in colorectal cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Another study has shown that MGMT rs16906252 promoter SNP is strongly associated with MGMT promoter methylation and loss of expression in colorectal cancer [60], and with MGMT methylation in peripheral blood cells and normal colonic mucosa in individuals without colorectal cancer [61], [62]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>It remains to be investigated whether these or other cis-acting germline variants interact with other one-carbon-related factors to modify susceptibility to aberrant DNA methylation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Our study has several important strengths. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>First, because we collected detailed, updated information on a number of dietary and lifestyle covariates relevant to colon carcinogenesis over 22 years of follow-up and with high follow-up rates, we were able to examine long-term exposures to one-carbon nutrients and to take into consideration important confounding factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Second, our study is prospective, eliminating concerns on differential recall bias, particularly with regard to our dietary assessments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Any remaining bias from exposure misclassification were thus likely nondifferential by nature, biasing our results only toward the null. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Further, we have successfully linked these nutrients—as assessed via a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (SFFQ)—to other relevant endpoints in prior analyses, indicating that measurement error is not large enough to hide any real associations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Limitations of note relate to folate fortification, which became mandatory in 1998 [63]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>We have multiple assessments of one-carbon nutrient intakes prior to fortification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Further, our results remained unchanged when restricted to cases that arose prior to folate fortification (1998), which has also been demonstrated in prior analyses [20], [42], [64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Other limitations and caveats specific to molecular pathologic epidemiology in general have been discussed elsewhere [45]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>We cannot exclude the possibility of residual confounding as a potential explanation for our findings; nonetheless, in our multivariate analyses which included many known or suspected risk factors for colon cancer, the multivariate risk estimates did not materially differ from the age-adjusted results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Further, we were unable to obtain tumor tissue from all cases of confirmed colon cancer detected in the Nurses' Health Study cohort, but the risk factors in these cases did not appreciably differ from those in cases with tumor tissue available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Finally, even prior to mandated fortification in 1998 [63], our participants still had relatively high folate and vitamin B6 levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>It is therefore possible that we might have found even stronger associations in the present study if our folate levels would have included an even lower range. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>In summary, we demonstrate that the reduced risk of colon cancer associated with replete folate status is somewhat limited to CIMP-low/0 cancers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Additional studies are necessary to elucidate the exact mechanism of an abnormality in one-carbon metabolism leading to aberrant CpG island methylation. </plain></SENT>
