Key to both activities is the virally encoded alkaline exonuclease KSHV SOX. While the DNase activity of KSHV SOX is required for the resolution of viral genomic DNA as a precursor to encapsidation, its exact involvement in host shutoff remains to be determined. We present the first crystal structure of a KSHV SOX&#8211;DNA complex that has illuminated the catalytic mechanism underpinning both its endo and exonuclease activities. We further illustrate that KSHV SOX, similar to its Epstein&#8211;Barr virus homologue, has an intrinsic RNase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> that although an element of host shutoff, cannot solely account for the phenomenon.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Kaposi&#8217;s sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV, also known as Human Herpes Virus-8), is a member of the &#947;-herpesvirus family of double-stranded DNA viruses. KSHV infects both B and endothelial cells where it is the main causative agent of Kaposi&#8217;s sarcoma (KS) with epidemic or AIDS-related KS being the most common cancer associated with HIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In addition to KS, KSHV has also been linked to a number of lymphoproliferative disorders that include primary effusion lymphoma and Multicentric Castleman&#8217;s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4">2&#8211;4</xref>). While KS can be successfully treated in the early stages of HIV infection by anti-retroviral drugs, there are no effective treatments for the advanced disease or KSHV-associated disorders.</p><p>The KSHV life cycle, similar to all herpesviruses, can be divided into a latent and lytic phase. In the majority of infected cells, the virus remains in a latent state that is characterized by a highly restricted pattern of gene expression. This contrasts with the lytic phase that is dominated by the over expression of genes required for host cell lysis and viral replication. During the initial stages of the lytic phase, a highly conserved alkaline exonuclease is expressed that is encoded by ORF 37 in KSHV. The precise function of the viral alkaline exonucleases in the context of viral genomic DNA replication is unclear; however, evidence [mostly obtained from Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1)] suggests that they are involved in the processing of viral genomic DNA prior to encapsidation and facilitate the egress of viral particles from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7">5&#8211;7</xref>). Consistent with this, three-way viral genomic DNA junctions have been observed during HSV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In the absence of alkaline exonuclease activity, these junctions accumulate in the nucleus resulting in a marked reduction in the number of mature viral particles released from infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In support of this &#8216;resolvase&#8217; role, the viral alkaline exonucleases exhibit Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Mn<sup>2+</sup> dependent 5&#8242;&#8211;3&#8242; exonuclease activities <italic>in vitro</italic> (in addition to a less prevalent endonuclease activity) processing both double- and single-stranded DNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12 B13">10&#8211;13</xref>). Owing to the presence of a PD-(D/E)XK motif, the viral alkaline exonucleases have been classified as members of the type II restriction endonuclease-like superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), which has been confirmed by the recent crystal structures of the native KSHV enzyme and its Epstein&#8211;Barr virus (EBV) homologue BGLF5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Both reveal conservation of motifs key to DNase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) that were first observed in the restriction endonucleases EcoRI, BamHI and HincII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18 B19">17&#8211;19</xref>), together with a &#8216;bridge&#8217; spanning the N- and C-terminal lobes that is also present in bacteriophage &#955; exonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Bridge or arch structures are observed in a large variety of nucleases that in addition to type II restriction enzymes include members of the flap endonuclease family where they are thought to function in substrate recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p><p>Onset of the lytic phase in the herpesviruses not only coincides with viral replication, but also the rapid and global degradation of host mRNA. This is thought to be one of several mechanisms utilized by these viruses to evade immune detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). A key protagonist of host shutoff in the &#947;-herpesvirus subgroup is the alkaline exonuclease that has been renamed SOX (shutoff and exonuclease) in recognition of its dual role. While host shutoff has also been observed in HSV infection and extensively studied in HSV-1, it appears to be mechanistically dissimilar to that of the &#947;-herpesviruses owing to the requirement for the UL<sub>41</sub>-encoded viral host shutoff protein (vhs) that actively degrades mRNA and is unrelated to the SOX homologues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Although the exact mechanism in the &#947;-herpesviruses remains to be fully elucidated, the analysis of various SOX mutants has shown that the DNA processing and shutoff activities are genetically separable and occur in different cellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Until recently, it was thought that the global degradation of host mRNA could not be explained by an intrinsic RNase activity of the SOX homologues, since none had been detected <italic>in vitro.</italic> Alternatively, it was proposed to originate from subversion of a host cellular pathway involving the erroneous activation or targeting of proteins participating in mRNA degradation pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). A Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent RNase activity has, however, been recently characterized for BGLF5, where cleavage of both RNA and DNA are dependent on the same catalytic machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Since the available crystal structures show that the majority of non-catalytic residues implicated in host shutoff map to the N-terminal region of the molecule, and are therefore distant from the catalytic centre, it has been speculated that recognition of RNA and DNA substrates might require different structural motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). To probe the molecular basis underlying the DNase activities of KSHV SOX, we have determined the crystal structure of a KSHV SOX&#8211;DNA complex involving a linear duplex. This first structure of an alkaline exonuclease complex provides important insights into the catalytic mechanism utilized by these enzymes and suggests that the bridge functions in targeting substrates for endo or exonucleolytic cleavage. We further demonstrate that similar to BGLF5, KSHV SOX also has an intrinsic RNase activity, however, site-directed mutagenesis studies reveal that it is unlikely to be uniquely responsible for host shutoff.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cloning and expression</title><p>The gene-encoding KSHV SOX (GenBank protein ID: AA62609) was re-engineered to optimize codon usage for expression in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>.

Of these, residues within motifs III, IV and VI, which together form the canyon in the SOX molecule, interact directly with the duplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C) along with those in a loop between motifs IV and V (residues 315&#8211;320).

There are only two areas of specific contact that cluster at the 5&#8242;-end of strand 1 (close to the active site) and a more central region of the duplex involving strand 2 predominantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), although a plethora of van der Waals interactions involving the three DNA binding motifs and NLS2 are observed. Motif III features heavily in the recognition of the G3, G4 and A5 phosphate groups towards the 5&#8242;-end of strand 1. In this region, the N&#950; group of K246, located within the strictly conserved PD-(D/E)XK sequence, interacts with O1P of G3 via a water molecule while the main chain NH groups of K250 and F249 (both highly conserved) donate hydrogen bonds to O1P of G4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). The carbonyl oxygen of K250 also contributes a water mediated hydrogen bond to O1P of A5. Y373, located in motif VI, donates an additional hydrogen bond to O1P of G3 via its hydroxyl group. In contrast, recognition of the central duplex region is largely dependent on residues K318, R319 and K320 in NLS2, L297 and E300 in domain IV and R370 in motif VI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B). Hydrogen bonds are donated to O1P and O2P of G33 by the side chain NH1 and main chain NH groups of R370 and E300, respectively. The N&#950; moiety of K318 donates a hydrogen bond to O2P of A32 that is further stabilized by a water mediated hydrogen bond involving the carbonyl oxygen of L297. A32 is additionally recognized by a hydrogen bond donated by the peptide NH group of R319 to O1P. The side chain moiety of R319 is observed to protrude into the minor groove where it is able to mediate a range of van der Waals interactions with C12, C31 and A32 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Within this region, K320 additionally contributes direct and water mediated hydrogen bonds via its main chain NH and carbonyl oxygen moieties, respectively, to O1P of A13.

In the native structure, these together with E184, which is also strictly conserved in the SOX homologues, contribute ligands to a bound Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion (Mg1) via their carboxylate groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Mg1, though slightly shifted and less well ordered, is also present in our complex and, as a result of this re-positioning, falls within hydrogen bonding distance of the N&#950; group of K246 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). Since the predominant activity of SOX is that of a 5&#8242;&#8211;3&#8242; exonuclease, it has been suggested that the scissile bond, located at the 3&#8242;-end of the 5&#8242; nt, should be within hydrogen bonding distance of Mg1. This is inconsistent with the position of G2 in our complex, the site of exonucleolytic cleavage, whose partially ordered phosphate group is angled away from the catalytic region and &gt;7&#8201;&#197; from Mg1.</p><p>While cleavage at G2 based on our structure would be highly unlikely, G3 is more favourably juxtaposed with respect to the catalytic region. In our complex, the phosphate group of G3 forms water mediated hydrogen bonds with K246 of the PD-(D/E) XK motif as previously described and also contacts a second Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion (Mg2, present at a level of 5&#963; in mFo-DFc omit maps, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A) absent in the native KSHV structure. Mg2 is located a distance of &#8764;5&#8201;&#197; from Mg1 and is further liganded to O&#949;1 of E184, a water molecule and the peptide NH group of C247. The presence of two metal ions in the catalytic region is suggestive of a classical two metal S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>)]; however, the phosphate group of G3 is not in the canonical position for endonucleolytic processing. In most examples of two metal mechanisms, the metal ions are co-ordinated between the non-bridging oxygens of the scissile phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D) and are further liganded by a highly conserved aspartate. In this configuration, one metal ion acts to deprotonate a water molecule for generation of a hydroxyanion attacking nucleophile, while the other stabilizes the resultant pentavalent transition state intermediate. Even though Mg1 and Mg2 are both liganded to E184 that could substitute for an aspartate, only Mg2 is in direct contact with the phosphate group of G3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Mg1, located &#8764;7&#8201;&#197; from G3, would therefore be unable to generate a hydroxyanion for nucleophilic attack of the G3 P-O3 bond.

In this conformation, the two metal ions straddle the stereospecific oxygen O1P and the water molecule bound to K246 (A, light blue sphere) is well placed for inline attack.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkr111f5"/></fig></p><p>Although Mg1 is proposed to act as a hydroxyanion generator, structural and mutagenesis studies have suggested that highly conserved amino acid residues such as lysine, tyrosine or serine might fulfil this role [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>)]. Our complex suggests that in principle, K246 could activate the water molecule bound to O1P of G3 and has been shown to have a key catalytic role in support of this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). However, the so generated nucleophile would be poorly positioned for inline attack. Alternatively, the hydroxyl group of Y373 that is also hydrogen bonded to O1P of G3 could be deprotonated to form an oxyanion that could in turn generate a phosphotyrosyl covalent intermediate. This can be rejected on the basis of site directed mutagenesis studies that show Y373 is a non-essential residue (data not shown). Although there is still the possibility that KSHV&#8211;SOX might utilize a novel variant of a two metal mechanism in which G3 could be well placed for catalysis, the fact that the duplex used in our crystallization studies remains intact and that it fails to undergo processing in our <italic>in vitro</italic> assay strongly suggests that G3 is intractable to cleavage, similar to G2. This is strengthened by the observation that endonucleolytic processing appears to be restricted to plasmid substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) and has not been reported for linear duplexes. The inability of linear duplexes lacking a 5&#8242; phosphate to be efficiently targeted for exonucleolytic processing or undergo endonucleolytic cleavage can therefore be explained by the association of these oligonucleotides with KSHV-SOX resulting in potential scissile phosphate groups being inappropriately positioned for cleavage as observed in our complex.</p></sec><sec><title>5&#8242; phosphate recognition: the key to exo and endonucleolytic cleavage</title><p>Although the relative juxtapositions of the scissile phosphate, metal ions and attacking nucleophile are important factors for cleavage, substrate stabilization is also essential. For the exonucleolytic reaction, this would additionally involve recognition of the 5&#8242; phosphate. A putative 5&#8242; phosphate binding site, encompassing residues S144, S145 and S146 of motif I together with S219 of motif II, has been proposed for the SOX homologues based on the findings that these residues are associated with a sulphate ion and anion in the native KSHV and BGLF5 structures, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) (we also note a formate ion bound in this region of our complex). The importance of this &#8216;serine cluster&#8217; is further underpinned by mutagenesis studies where substitution of S219 in both the HSV-1 and baculovirus SOX homologues results in significant attenuation of exo and endonuclease activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). In order for a modelled 5&#8242; phosphate group on G1 in our complex to contact the cluster for exonucleolytic cleavage, the nucleotide would have to be rotated towards motif 1 from its position stacked against G2 (implied by the partially ordered density) to enable the formation of hydrogen bonds with S146 and S219. These in turn, would only be required to adopt the side chain rotamers observed in the native KSHV structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). Surprisingly, manipulating G1 into this position results in optimal placement of G2 as the scissile phosphate. In this configuration, Mg1 and Mg2 have the classical geometry in which both are liganded to the stereospecific, non-bridging oxygen O1P. In addition, the water molecule hydrogen bonded to both K246 and O1P (though out of the range for contacts with either Mg1 or Mg2), is now near optimally positioned as a nucleophile given an inline attack angle of 147&#176;. These results suggest that for exonucleolytic processing, stabilization of the 5&#8242; phosphate group is key to the correct positioning of the scissile bond for cleavage.</p><p>While mutagenesis studies focused on S219 have shown that the serine cluster has a more prominent role in exonucleolytic cleavage, as evidenced by the higher level of attenuation compared with that observed for endonucleolytic processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), it is nonetheless key to both reactions. Based on our model for exonucleolytic cleavage, the association of a phosphate group with this site in the context of a continuous duplex could only occur if the helix were locally denatured. In keeping with this, the recent studies of Mikhailov <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrate that endonucleolytic processing is only observed on single-stranded minicircle or supercoiled plasmid substrates that, in an attempt to relieve torsional stress, develop local regions of single-stranded DNA that are the likely targets for cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Though difficult to speculate on how supercoiled/mini-circle plasmids or indeed the natural substrate would be accommodated, comparison of our complex with the BGLF5 SOX homologue strongly implicates the bridge as being essential to this process. Bridge architectures, based on studies involving the flap endonucleases, were originally proposed to have a pivotal role in exonucleolytic cleavage by inducing strand separation for targeting of the scissile strand. It has further been suggested that they function as DNA &#8216;clamps&#8217; stabilizing specific types of DNA architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). In both our complex and native KSHV SOX, the bridge (that spans amino acid residues 154&#8211;180, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B) is only partially ordered. The analogous region, however, is completely intact in the BGLF5 SOX mutant D203S that shares &#8764;42% sequence identity with the KSHV enzyme.</p><p>Superposition of the BGLF5 D203S co-ordinates with those of our complex reveals that while both structures have a high degree of similarity overall (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr111/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2C</ext-link>), the duplex could not be accommodated in the canyon of the BGLF5 mutant without substantial re-modelling of the 5&#8242;-end of strand 1. This would be due to severe steric clashes between bridge residues G156 to V159 in BGLF5 (equivalent to A174 and L177 in KSHV SOX, absent in both our complex and the native enzyme) and all base pairs 5&#8242; to G4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). These unfavourable contacts arise from an &#8764;5.5&#8201;&#197; lateral movement of residues A160 and F161 (equivalent to A178 and F179 in KSHV SOX) towards the C-terminal lobe of the SOX molecule, away from the active site. The nucleotides 5&#8242; to G4 could only be favourably accommodated in the context of the BGLF5 bridge conformer if they were no longer stacked in a regular duplex but instead situated in largely single-stranded regions of DNA. The conformation of the bridge observed in the D203S BGLF5 mutant, therefore, seems more consistent with endonucleolytic cleavage in which major local distortion of the DNA appears to be required for recognition in contrast to the exonuclease reaction where only relatively minor changes focused on the 5&#8242;-nt are required. This suggests that conformational re-modelling of the bridge may be the trigger for switching SOX between endo and exonucleolytic cleavage modes.

It has been demonstrated that this activity involves the catalytic residues utilized for DNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). To establish whether KSHV SOX also shares this intrinsic activity, we performed a similar RNase assay using a uracil rich ssRNA 20-mer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). Our results show unequivocally that KSHV SOX possesses an RNase activity that cannot be attributed to contamination since experiments performed with the D221S and E244S mutants lacking DNase activity but competent in DNA binding (data not shown) reveal its complete abolition. These results are similar to those reported for BGLF5 confirming that both DNA and RNA processing utilize the same catalytic machinery and is consistent with the <italic>in vivo</italic> studies of Glaunsinger <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Unlike BGLF5, however, the RNase activity of KSHV SOX does not appear to be Mn<sup>2+</sup> dependent since similar activities are observed in assays performed in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> alone at the same concentration. Fluorescence Anisotropy studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C) further reveal that SOX is able to associate with single- and double-stranded RNA with similar affinities (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>&#8217;s of 87 and 95&#8201;&#181;M, respectively) that is suggestive of engagement with only one strand. Interestingly, the affinity for RNA is considerably weaker than for DNA (&#8764;15- to 16-fold weaker when ssRNA-5&#8242;P and dsRNA-5&#8242;P are compared with dsDNA-5&#8242;P, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C).</p><p>In addition to those involved in catalysis, residues within the N-terminal lobe of SOX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A) have also been shown to have an essential role in host shutoff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). To ascertain whether these non-catalytic shutoff residues contribute to the RNase activity of KSHV SOX, the mutants T24I, A61T, P176S, V369I, D474N and Y477STOP, shown to significantly attenuate or abolish global degradation of host mRNA, were generated (with the exception of T24I that was insoluble) and screened using our RNase and DNase assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B and C). All mutants exhibited wild-type RNase and DNase activities. Our results, therefore, suggest that host shutoff in KSHV cannot be entirely explained by the intrinsic RNase activity of KSHV SOX which would in turn support the view that SOX mediates host shutoff by interacting with as yet unidentified cellular factors.

Our complex has confirmed the involvement of the D-(D/E)XK motif and residues in conserved motifs III, IV, VI (previously implicated in DNase activity) and NLS2 in DNA binding. Although the duplex used in our studies did not undergo processing, the structure has provided key insights into the cleavage geometry utilized by the SOX nucleases. To this end, we have identified two Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions bound within the catalytic region and shown that alignment of the putative 5&#8242; phosphate binding site (serine cluster) with the 5&#8242; phosphate of the substrate results in a near classical two metal ion cleavage configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). A potential nucleophilic water molecule has also been identified based on this model that has near perfect geometry for inline attack. Interestingly, the association between this water molecule and K246 together with its overly long distance from either of the two metal ions is highly suggestive of K246 acting as the general base. Although this residue is strictly conserved among the SOX homologues and the equivalent lysine in the endonuclease MutH binds to a nucleophilic water molecule in a similar configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>), a major drawback in this assignment lies in its positive charge at pHs &lt;10.5. This would prevent abstraction of a proton and subsequent generation of an attacking nucleophile at the optimal pH of 8.5&#8211;9.0. The juxtaposition of K246 to Mg1 in our structure, however, would substantially lower its pKa rendering it capable of generating a hydroxyanion. Alternatively, it is possible that the two metal ions approach each other more closely than the 5&#8201;&#197; observed in our complex since 4&#8201;&#197; has been cited as the optimum separation distance for maximal transition state stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Following such movement, Mg1 might be well placed to assist in nucleophile generation.</p><p>In addition to addressing the cleavage geometry, our structure has also shown that endonucleolytic processing could only occur on highly distorted duplexes containing regions of single-stranded DNA in keeping with the reported biochemical studies. They also suggest that these structures are likely to be stabilized by the bridge and that conformational re-modelling of this region may be the trigger for their recognition. Although bridge or arch architectures were originally thought to function as strand separators forming an aperture through which a single DNA strand could be threaded for high processivity, there is no evidence of this in our complex or that it would be required for catalysis. It appears that exonucleolytically processed substrates are ostensibly bound as duplexes [as suggested by Dahlroth <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>)], and that the only re-arrangements required are those necessary for recognition of the 5&#8242; phosphate group. This is in good agreement with the similar <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>&#8217;s observed for the duplex used in our structural studies and the same duplex substituted with a 5&#8242; phosphate group. It is also difficult to envisage how a threading mechanism would address the endonuclease reaction satisfactorily with stabilization of highly distorted DNA structures by the bridge appearing a more likely scenario. This is in keeping with the bridge acting as a DNA &#8216;clamp&#8217; that has also been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In order to fully characterize the function of the bridge and further analyse the significance of the conformational states observed, additional biochemical and structural studies will have to be performed using more physiological branched substrates although there is still uncertainty regarding their exact nature.</p><p>While the DNase activity of the &#947;-herpesvirus SOX homologues is important in the maturation of virus particles, it has also been shown to compromise the integrity of the host genome in EBV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). This combined with the rapid and global degradation of host mRNA will ultimately culminate in cell death. Although the exact mechanism of host shutoff remains to be determined, it was initially thought not to involve an intrinsic RNase activity. Recently, it was reported that the EBV SOX homologue BGLF5 possesses an <italic>in vitro</italic> RNase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In the current study, we were able to characterize a similar but non-identical metal ion-dependent RNase activity that interestingly was not attenuated by the non-catalytic mutations associated with shutoff. While RNase activity is clearly an important element of shutoff, our results indicate that SOX is not solely responsible for the phenomenon and that additional factors, most likely involving protein&#8211;protein interactions (as initially suggested), are required for degradation of host mRNA. This is further supported by the relatively low affinity of SOX for RNA obtained from our fluorescence polarization studies that is suggestive of a requirement for an interacting partner to enhance binding and possibly increase processivity. Given the burden of disease caused by herpesviruses in general and KSHV specifically, understanding the molecular basis underlying their intrinsic DNase and RNase activities, together with the identification and characterization of potential interacting partners, will provide alternative strategies for the design of novel therapeutics. Our KSHV&#8211;SOX&#8211;DNA complex and preliminary characterization of the KSHV SOX RNase activity are therefore important steps towards this goal.</p></sec><sec><title>ACCESSION NUMBER</title><p>3POV.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr111/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Funding open access charge: <funding-source>Medical Research Council project</funding-source> grant (grant number <award-id>G0701236</award-id> to T.B.).</p><p><italic>Conflict of interest statement</italic>.
