</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Kaposi’s sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV, also known as Human Herpes Virus-8), is a member of the γ-herpesvirus family of double-stranded DNA viruses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>KSHV infects both B and endothelial cells where it is the main causative agent of Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) with epidemic or AIDS-related KS being the most common cancer associated with HIV infection (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition to KS, KSHV has also been linked to a number of lymphoproliferative disorders that include primary effusion lymphoma and Multicentric Castleman’s disease (2–4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While KS can be successfully treated in the early stages of HIV infection by anti-retroviral drugs, there are no effective treatments for the advanced disease or KSHV-associated disorders. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The KSHV life cycle, similar to all herpesviruses, can be divided into a latent and lytic phase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the majority of infected cells, the virus remains in a latent state that is characterized by a highly restricted pattern of gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This contrasts with the lytic phase that is dominated by the over expression of genes required for host cell lysis and viral replication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>During the initial stages of the lytic phase, a highly conserved alkaline exonuclease is expressed that is encoded by ORF 37 in KSHV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The precise function of the viral alkaline exonucleases in the context of viral genomic DNA replication is unclear; however, evidence [mostly obtained from Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1)] suggests that they are involved in the processing of viral genomic DNA prior to encapsidation and facilitate the egress of viral particles from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (5–7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this, three-way viral genomic DNA junctions have been observed during HSV infection (8,9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In the absence of alkaline exonuclease activity, these junctions accumulate in the nucleus resulting in a marked reduction in the number of mature viral particles released from infected cells (5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In support of this ‘resolvase’ role, the viral alkaline exonucleases exhibit Mg2+ or Mn2+ dependent 5′–3′ exonuclease activities in vitro (in addition to a less prevalent endonuclease activity) processing both double- and single-stranded DNA substrates (10–13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Owing to the presence of a PD-(D/E)XK motif, the viral alkaline exonucleases have been classified as members of the type II restriction endonuclease-like superfamily (14), which has been confirmed by the recent crystal structures of the native KSHV enzyme and its Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) homologue BGLF5 (15,16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Both reveal conservation of motifs key to DNase activity (7) that were first observed in the restriction endonucleases EcoRI, BamHI and HincII (17–19), together with a ‘bridge’ spanning the N- and C-terminal lobes that is also present in bacteriophage λ exonuclease (20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Bridge or arch structures are observed in a large variety of nucleases that in addition to type II restriction enzymes include members of the flap endonuclease family where they are thought to function in substrate recognition (21,22). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Onset of the lytic phase in the herpesviruses not only coincides with viral replication, but also the rapid and global degradation of host mRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>This is thought to be one of several mechanisms utilized by these viruses to evade immune detection (23). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>A key protagonist of host shutoff in the γ-herpesvirus subgroup is the alkaline exonuclease that has been renamed SOX (shutoff and exonuclease) in recognition of its dual role. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>While host shutoff has also been observed in HSV infection and extensively studied in HSV-1, it appears to be mechanistically dissimilar to that of the γ-herpesviruses owing to the requirement for the UL41-encoded viral host shutoff protein (vhs) that actively degrades mRNA and is unrelated to the SOX homologues (24). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Although the exact mechanism in the γ-herpesviruses remains to be fully elucidated, the analysis of various SOX mutants has shown that the DNA processing and shutoff activities are genetically separable and occur in different cellular compartments (25). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Until recently, it was thought that the global degradation of host mRNA could not be explained by an intrinsic RNase activity of the SOX homologues, since none had been detected in vitro. Alternatively, it was proposed to originate from subversion of a host cellular pathway involving the erroneous activation or targeting of proteins participating in mRNA degradation pathways (26,27). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>A Mn2+-dependent RNase activity has, however, been recently characterized for BGLF5, where cleavage of both RNA and DNA are dependent on the same catalytic machinery (16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Since the available crystal structures show that the majority of non-catalytic residues implicated in host shutoff map to the N-terminal region of the molecule, and are therefore distant from the catalytic centre, it has been speculated that recognition of RNA and DNA substrates might require different structural motifs (16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>To probe the molecular basis underlying the DNase activities of KSHV SOX, we have determined the crystal structure of a KSHV SOX–DNA complex involving a linear duplex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>This first structure of an alkaline exonuclease complex provides important insights into the catalytic mechanism utilized by these enzymes and suggests that the bridge functions in targeting substrates for endo or exonucleolytic cleavage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>We further demonstrate that similar to BGLF5, KSHV SOX also has an intrinsic RNase activity, however, site-directed mutagenesis studies reveal that it is unlikely to be uniquely responsible for host shutoff. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>In contrast, those labelled with a 5′ phosphate were highly susceptible to degradation while those that were lacking the modification showed little evidence of cleavage (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>The 5′ phosphate substitution, however, had only a modest impact on overall binding affinity based on the results of fluorescence polarization anisotropy assays that indicated similar modes of binding for the unmodified or modified duplexes dsDNA and dsDNA-5′P, respectively (Table 1 and Figure 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>The duplex CAdsDNA containing the CA mismatch but lacking the 5′ phosphate was therefore used for crystallization trials due to its apparent lack of susceptibility to cleavage. Figure 1.(A) Exonuclease assays involving the DNA substrates dsDNA and dsDNA-5′P illustrate that cleavage is only observed on duplexes in which one strand has been substituted with a 5′ phosphate group.

<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Recently, it was reported that the EBV SOX homologue BGLF5 possesses an in vitro RNase activity (16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we were able to characterize a similar but non-identical metal ion-dependent RNase activity that interestingly was not attenuated by the non-catalytic mutations associated with shutoff. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>While RNase activity is clearly an important element of shutoff, our results indicate that SOX is not solely responsible for the phenomenon and that additional factors, most likely involving protein–protein interactions (as initially suggested), are required for degradation of host mRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>This is further supported by the relatively low affinity of SOX for RNA obtained from our fluorescence polarization studies that is suggestive of a requirement for an interacting partner to enhance binding and possibly increase processivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Given the burden of disease caused by herpesviruses in general and KSHV specifically, understanding the molecular basis underlying their intrinsic DNase and RNase activities, together with the identification and characterization of potential interacting partners, will provide alternative strategies for the design of novel therapeutics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Our KSHV–SOX–DNA complex and preliminary characterization of the KSHV SOX RNase activity are therefore important steps towards this goal. </plain></SENT>
