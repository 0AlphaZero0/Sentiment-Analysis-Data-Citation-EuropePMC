However, few studies have developed microsatellites from cDNA despite the added potential for targeting candidate genes. Moreover, to develop microsatellites usually requires the evaluation of numerous primer pairs for polymorphism in the focal species. This can be time-consuming and wasteful, particularly for taxa with low genetic diversity where the majority of primers often yield monomorphic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products. Transcriptome assemblies provide a convenient solution, functional annotation of transcripts allowing markers to be targeted towards candidate genes, while high sequence coverage in principle permits the assessment of variability <italic>in silico</italic>. Consequently, we evaluated fifty primer pairs designed to amplify microsatellites, primarily residing within transcripts related to immunity and growth, identified from an Antarctic fur seal (<italic>Arctocephalus gazella</italic>) transcriptome assembly. <italic>In silico</italic> visualization was used to classify each microsatellite as being either polymorphic or monomorphic and to quantify the number of distinct length variants, each taken to represent a different allele. The majority of loci (<italic>n</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;36, 76.0%) yielded interpretable PCR products, 23 of which were polymorphic in a sample of 24 fur seal individuals. Loci that appeared variable <italic>in silico</italic> were significantly more likely to yield polymorphic PCR products, even after controlling for microsatellite length measured <italic>in silico</italic>. We also found a significant positive relationship between inferred and observed allele number. This study not only demonstrates the feasibility of generating modest panels of microsatellites targeted towards specific classes of gene, but also suggests that <italic>in silico</italic> microsatellite variability may provide a useful proxy for PCR product polymorphism.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microsatellites, also known as Short Tandem Repeats (STRs), Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) or Variable Number Tandem Repeats (VNTRs) are DNA segments comprising tandemly repeated motifs of 1&#8211;6 nucleotides. They are ubiquitous in eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes, present in both coding and non-coding regions, and also have a high enough mutation rate (between 10<sup>&#8722;3</sup> and 10<sup>&#8722;4</sup> mutations per gamete per generation) to generate and maintain extensive length polymorphism <xref rid="pone.0023283-Weber1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023283-Tautz1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. This makes them powerful genetic markers for a variety of applications ranging from the determination of parentage and other genetic relationships to genetic mapping <xref rid="pone.0023283-Jarne1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023283-Bruford1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, a major drawback of microsatellites is that for most species they need to be developed <italic>de novo</italic>, a process that is often costly and protracted <xref rid="pone.0023283-Zane1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>The most commonly used approach for developing microsatellites requires the construction of a partial genomic library enriched for repetitive motifs, cloning, hybridization to detect positive clones, plasmid isolation and Sanger sequencing followed by primer design and evaluation <xref rid="pone.0023283-Zane1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Although most of these steps involve relatively straightforward protocols, they can be time-consuming due to the frequent need for troubleshooting. Moreover, established protocols for enrichment and cloning can be highly inefficient. For example, the yield of positive clones typically averages only around 2&#8211;3% but can fall to as little as 0.03% <xref rid="pone.0023283-Zane1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. This can be particularly problematic when attempting to isolate markers from species with genomes that are relatively depauperate in microsatellites such as many birds <xref rid="pone.0023283-Primmer1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and fungi <xref rid="pone.0023283-Dutech1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Fortunately, recently developed next-generation sequencing platforms such as Roche's GS-FLX (454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT, USA) provide novel avenues for isolating microsatellites. A single 454 run is capable of generating around 400 Mb of sequence data, with individual reads long enough (up to 500 bp) to capture individual microsatellites along with enough flanking sequence to design PCR primers. Sequence generation on such a scale bypasses the need for enrichment because even a fraction of a 454 run can yield a sufficiently large number of random sequence reads to contain many thousands of microsatellites by chance <xref rid="pone.0023283-Abdelkrim1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0023283-Csesnics1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Moreover, by directing 454 sequencing towards expressed genes (i.e. transcriptome sequencing), the possibility now exists to develop panels of microsatellites that are ideal markers for genes underlying phenotypic variation <xref rid="pone.0023283-Scaglione1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>Given the clear advantages afforded by 454 sequencing, approaches based on this or other emerging hi-throughput technologies will inevitably supercede conventional microsatellite isolation protocols. However, it will continue to be necessary to design primers, optimize each primer pair for PCR and then test these for polymorphism in a sample of individuals of the study species. This is because not all primer pairs generate interpretable PCR products and a proportion of loci that amplify successfully are invariably monomorphic. The latter represent wasted effort, an issue that can be particularly acute in species with low genetic diversity where large numbers of loci often need to be evaluated in order to obtain just a handful of informative markers. An example comes from the endangered Hawaiian monk seal, in which Shultz et al. <xref rid="pone.0023283-Schultz1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> developed 163 microsatellite loci in order to obtain just 17 that were polymorphic. For systems such as this, but also to bring about more general improvements in efficiency, it would therefore be desirable to develop and evaluate potential approaches for pre-screening microsatellites for polymorphism <italic>in silico</italic>.</p><p>Just such an opportunity is provided by a large body of 454 sequence data recently generated for the Antarctic fur seal, <italic>Arctocephalus gazella</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0023283-Hoffman1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. A long-term genetic study of this colonially breeding polygynous pinniped species at Bird Island, South Georgia <xref rid="pone.0023283-Hoffman2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> has identified remarkably consistent relationships between heterozygosity measured at 9&#8211;76 microsatellite loci and a variety of important fitness traits, from male reproductive success through body size to attractiveness <xref rid="pone.0023283-Hoffman3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0023283-Hoffman6" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. However, despite several candidate genomic regions being identified through the mapping of individual microsatellites to the dog (<italic>Canis lupis familiaris</italic>) genome (seals and dogs diverged approximately 44 million years ago <xref rid="pone.0023283-Arnason1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and the canine genome is relatively well annotated), the underlying genes remain elusive <xref rid="pone.0023283-Hoffman5" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Plausibly, most if not all of these could be immune-related, with reduced parasite loads and disease leading to greater longevity, enhanced growth, behavioural dominance and attractiveness. However, an alternative possibility is that heterozygosity might directly impact an individual's metabolism <xref rid="pone.0023283-Mitton1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, allowing it to grow more quickly and to attain greater body size. Consequently, we 454 sequenced the skin transcriptome of this species <xref rid="pone.0023283-Hoffman1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, both to generate a preliminary genomic resource for pinnipeds in general and with a view towards identifying markers within suitable candidate genes.</p><p>Our experimental approach comprised two main stages (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Materials and Methods</xref> for further details). First, 454 sequencing was conducted on pooled cDNA from twelve Antarctic fur seal individuals (six adult males, two adult females and four pups) selected to capture much of the allelic diversity present within the population <xref rid="pone.0023283-Hoffman1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The resulting reads were then assembled <italic>de novo</italic> into isotigs, each representing a collection of transcripts of a given gene, which were in turn functionally annotated by reference to the dog genome using Gene Ontology (GO) codes. We then used freeware to interrogate all of the isotig sequences for microsatellite repeat motifs. Finally, candidate markers were selected by filtering for a subset of isotigs containing microsatellites and with GO annotation terms related to immunity and growth.</p><p>In the second stage, we attempted to quantify the variability of each locus <italic>in silico</italic> and relate this to observed polymorphism when the locus was PCR amplified in a panel of 24 unrelated fur seals (note that these individuals were different from those used to generate the initial transcriptome assembly). To estimate levels of <italic>in silico</italic> variability, microsatellite-containing isotigs were visualized within the program Tablet <xref rid="pone.0023283-Milne1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. This provides a graphical representation of each isotig in which the individual reads comprising it are shown aligned against the consensus sequence. Upon visual inspection, certain microsatellites appeared identical across multiple reads whereas others showed evidence of variation in the numbers of repeat units. We therefore quantified for a subset of loci the number of repeat units within each of the reads, allowing derivation of estimates of variability including the number of distinct motif length variants (each of which was taken to represent a different allele) and the number of reads differing from the consensus genotype.</p><p>In this manuscript, we evaluated a total of fifty primer pairs designed to PCR amplify putative microsatellites identified from the Antarctic fur seal transcriptome assembly. Our aims were twofold: (i) to generate a panel of microsatellites functionally linked to either immunity or growth; and (ii) to explore the relationship between <italic>in silico</italic> variability and PCR product polymorphism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Sequence data and bioinformatic analysis</title><p>Library construction, 454 sequencing, assembly, annotation and mapping to the dog genome are described in detail by Hoffman <xref rid="pone.0023283-Hoffman1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Briefly, a normalized cDNA library derived from skin samples of twelve Antarctic fur seal individuals was sequenced on a Roche GS-FLX DNA sequencer (Roche Diagnostic), generating 1,443,397 reads of mean length of 286 bp. These were then assembled <italic>de novo</italic> using Roche Newbler assembler version 2.3 into 23,025 isotigs, which in turn clustered into 18,576 isogroups (different isotigs from a given isogroup can be inferred as alternative splice-variants). Mean isotig length was 854 bp and the average depth of coverage was 19.4&#215;. Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) similarity searches to the non-redundant database with an e-value threshold of 1e<sup>&#8722;4</sup> produced matches for 10,825 isotig sequences (47.0%), with 76.9% of the top matches being to mammals and these most frequently comprising the dog. Restricting the BLAST search set to canine sequences, the majority of isotigs (<italic>n</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;22,541, 97.9%) were also mapped to unique locations within the dog genome (NCBI Build 2, &#8220;Dog2.0&#8221;, dated 10 May 2005). A final set of BLAST searches against a subset of sequences with known Gene Ontology (GO) annotations recovered a total of 111,446 annotation terms.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Microsatellite identification and selection</title><p>The program SSRIT <xref rid="pone.0023283-Temnykh1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> was used to identify isotigs containing perfect di-, tri- and tetranucleotide repeats with a minimum length of five repeat units. A total of 2271 loci were identified, 1871 (82.4%) of which comprised dinucleotides, 301 (13.3%) trinucleotides and 99 (4.4%) tetranucleotides (available via Dryad, doi: 10.5061/dryad.8268). These were located within 1939 different isotigs, of which 864 (44.6%) were functionally annotated and 1834 (94.6%) mapped to known regions in the dog genome. To target microsatellites residing within candidate immune or growth-related genes, we used a relational database to filter all of the isotigs for a subset with GO annotation terms containing the strings &#8216;immun&#8217; or &#8216;growth&#8217;, recovering a total of 316 and 1132 isotigs (1.37% and 4.92%) respectively. Of these, 26 (8.23%) and 106 (9.36%) contained repetitive motifs respectively. Oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify PCR products for a further subset that (i) contained sufficient flanking sequence on both sides of the repetitive motif to allow the design of both forward and reverse primers; (ii) had a minimum of 2&#215; coverage of both the microsatellite and adjacent flanking regions; (iii) were BLAST annotated with respect to the nr database, and (iv) mapped to known regions within the dog genome. To avoid redundancy, we also avoided designing primers for more than one representative of any given isogroup. Primers were designed using the program Primer 3 <xref rid="pone.0023283-Rozen1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> to amplify 100&#8211;250 bp products, to have a melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>) as close as possible to 60&#176;C and a maximum difference in T<sub>m</sub> between the two primers of 3&#176;C. A total of 50 primer pairs were designed. These comprised 13 and 27 pairs to amplify microsatellites residing within isotigs with immune and growth-related GO codes respectively (Agt1 to Agt13 and Agt14 to Agt40) plus a further 10 pairs developed to amplify loci selected on the basis of appearing highly variable <italic>in silico</italic> (Agt41 to Agt50, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0023283.s001">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0023283.s002">S2</xref> for details).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>

Polymorphism was initially modeled as a binary response variable (1&#8202;=&#8202;polymorphic, 0&#8202;=&#8202;monomorphic) using a Binomial error structure. Restricting the dataset to loci that generated clearly interpretable polymorphic PCR products, we then constructed a second GLM in which polymorphism was expressed as the number of observed alleles and modeled using a Poisson error structure. The following predictor variables were fitted in both models: microsatellite length (measured as the number of repeat units comprising the shortest allele observed <italic>in silico</italic>), the number of reads differing from the consensus sequence and the total number of alleles observed <italic>in silico</italic> (all of which were fitted as continuous variables), the basis on which the marker was selected (as a factor with three levels: immune-related, growth-related or appearing highly variable) and motif (also as a three level factor: dinucleotide, trinucleotide or tetranucleotide).

Consequently, we used an Antarctic fur seal transcriptome assembly to develop PCR primers to amplify microsatellites residing within transcripts related to immunity and growth, while at the same time looking for a potential relationship between <italic>in silico</italic> variability and PCR product polymorphism. We were successful on both counts, identifying 13 polymorphic microsatellites associated with these two primary classes of candidate gene and also demonstrating a clear link between <italic>in silico</italic> variability and two different measures of PCR product polymorphism.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Microsatellites within candidate transcripts</title><p>It has long been recognized that microsatellites derived from transcribed sequences, whether these be expressed sequence tags or transcriptome assemblies, can be powerful tools for a variety of applications including linkage and QTL mapping, comparative genomics and studies of genome evolution <xref rid="pone.0023283-Lui1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. This is largely due to the fact that genes are often highly conserved, increasing the likelihood of primers cross-amplifying and serving as &#8216;anchor points&#8217; for cross-species comparisons <xref rid="pone.0023283-Fulton1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Being type I markers (i.e. associated with genes of known function), transcript-associated microsatellites also represent ideal markers for studying the genetic basis of phenotypic trait variation <xref rid="pone.0023283-Scaglione1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. However, despite several studies having developed panels of candidate-gene targeted microsatellites from the complete genome sequences of humans and their companion species <xref rid="pone.0023283-ObexerRuff1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0023283-Hoffjan1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, cDNA has not yet been widely exploited for this purpose, particularly in non-model organisms. Our study highlights the eminent feasibility of such an approach, although the numbers of markers obtainable will clearly depend on the relative abundance of various classes of transcript. In this particular case, immune-related transcripts were relatively rare (total <italic>n</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;316), perhaps unsurprisingly given that the transcriptome was developed from fur seal skin plugs <xref rid="pone.0023283-Hoffman1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Moreover, only 26 of these transcripts contained microsatellites, of which seven were discarded due to there not being enough flanking sequence to design primers and one because it did not map to the dog genome. Thus, the 13 primer pairs that we evaluated comprised the majority (72.2%) of available immune-related loci. In contrast, we only evaluated around a quarter of the 106 microsatellite-containing growth-related transcripts available to us. It should be possible to overcome the paucity of immune-related transcripts in this species through additional 454 sequencing directed towards other tissues such as the spleen. Alternatively, short read sequencing could be employed to increase the depth of coverage of singletons so far excluded from the assembly, a fraction of which would be expected to be related to immunity.</p><p>Notably, our rates of success in developing polymorphic loci were roughly equal for microsatellites located within immune and growth-related transcripts but higher for markers selected on the basis of <italic>in silico</italic> variability. This trend was also reflected in the allelic diversity of loci that successfully amplified. This is almost certainly due to our having been unbiased in our selection of immune and growth-related microsatellites, attempting to PCR amplify loci irrespective of the number of repeat units or apparent levels of variability. However, with a success rate of 80% for loci selected on the basis of high i<italic>n silico</italic> variability, our study suggests that <italic>in silico</italic> screening could significantly improve the efficiency of future attempts to develop candidate-gene targeted microsatellites (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Null alleles</title><p>An important drawback of microsatellites is the occurrence of non-amplifying alleles, which can arise when a mutation within one or both of the primer binding sites prevents primer annealing <xref rid="pone.0023283-Callen1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Null alleles are found in up to 30% of loci <xref rid="pone.0023283-Callen1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023283-Paetkau1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> and can significantly impact paternity analyses, leading if unrecognized to the false exclusion of true parents and downstream to errors in pedigree reconstruction <xref rid="pone.0023283-Dakin1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Consequently, we inspected the primer binding sites of both of the loci that significantly deviated from HWE in the direction of homozygosity excess. We found evidence of a SNP within the binding site of the reverse primer for Agt5, the locus carrying the highest null allele frequency. By implication, 454 sequence alignments might not only be useful for targeting polymorphic microsatellites, but also for designing primers that minimize the risk of null alleles being amplified. The latter could potentially be achieved by selecting only loci with a reasonably high depth of coverage at both of the primer annealing sites and which show no evidence of SNPs within these regions.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Relationship between <italic>in silico</italic> variability and PCR product polymorphism</title><p>Although the advent of 454 sequencing has allowed much of the microsatellite isolation process to be streamlined, the primer evaluation step has seen few improvements other than the introduction of the M13 tailed system <xref rid="pone.0023283-Schuelke1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Unfortunately, very little can be done beyond careful PCR optimization to minimize the wastage of time and materials on loci that fail to amplify. However, we believe that pre-selecting markers for variability <italic>in silico</italic> may help to minimize the number of primer pairs that yield monomorphic PCR products, especially in species with low levels of genetic variability (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0023283-Schultz1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023283-Leclerc1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023283-Habel1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>). Furthermore, even in &#8216;normal&#8217; species, a small improvement in efficiency might bring about significant time and cost savings when attempting to develop large panels of markers for applications such as genetic mapping.</p><p>The concept of sourcing polymorphic genetic markers within sequence assemblies is by no means new, with several studies having previously mined 454 datasets for SNPs <xref rid="pone.0023283-Vera1" ref-type="bibr">[e.g. 48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023283-Weber2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. However, we are not aware of any studies that have extended the same approach to microsatellites. If anything, the opposite appears to be the case, with most studies having sequenced a single specimen, while others have deliberately filtered out identical reads in order to reduce the risk of developing the same locus more than once <xref rid="pone.0023283-Castoe1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0023283-Csesnics1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023283-Hoffjan1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Although these strategies make some sense when genetic variability is high, under normal circumstances including more than one individual in a 454 run is unlikely to be detrimental. On the contrary, the inclusion of multiple individuals should not only capture more of the standing genetic variation within a given population, but may also help to average out any effects arising from differences in template quality among individuals.</p><p>On a related point, some authors have speculated that it should be possible to enrich for polymorphic microsatellites by selectively testing only loci with large numbers of repeat units <xref rid="pone.0023283-Abdelkrim1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023283-Castoe1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. This is because longer microsatellites tend to be more mutable due to an increased probability of slippage <xref rid="pone.0023283-Ellegren1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023283-Kelkar1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. However, current Sanger and 454 read length limitations mean that the longer the microsatellite, the less flanking sequence will be available for designing primers <xref rid="pone.0023283-Abdelkrim1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Moreover, microsatellites also appear to have an upper size limit, rarely attaining lengths in excess of a few tens of repeat units <xref rid="pone.0023283-Ellegren2" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Consequently, longer microsatellites may be relatively hard to come by, depending on genome size and the scale of the sequencing effort <xref rid="pone.0023283-Temnykh1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023283-Grover1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Our approach may help to mitigate both of these problems. First, assembling multiple 454 reads allows longer tracts of contiguous sequence to be obtained, thereby maximizing the amount of flanking sequence available for primer design. In the case of the fur seal 454 assembly <xref rid="pone.0023283-Hoffman1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, average isotig length was three times greater than average read length (854 bp versus 286 bp). Second, we were also able to demonstrate a highly significant positive relationship between <italic>in silico</italic> variability and PCR product polymorphism, even after controlling for the number of repeat units. This suggest that pre-screening for microsatellites appearing variable <italic>in silico</italic> could help to increase the yield of informative markers regardless of whether or not these are additionally selected on the basis of length.</p><p>An important caveat to the above is that our approach was only around 75% accurate at predicting whether or not PCR products were polymorphic. However, most of the observed discrepancies appear to be explicable. For example, the locus that did not appear to be variable <italic>in silico</italic> but which generated polymorphic PCR products had a depth of coverage of only 4 reads. With so few reads in total, it is possible that stochastic variation during clonal amplification and sequencing could have resulted in a single allele being preferentially sequenced. Similarly, almost all of the eight loci that were monomorphic despite appearing variable <italic>in silico</italic> were characterized by the &#8216;minor allele&#8217; being of very low frequency (typically only 1&#8211;3 copies). These minority reads could potentially have resulted from sequencing error, consistent with the fact that 454 error rates are somewhat higher than those typically experienced with Sanger sequencing <xref rid="pone.0023283-Margulies1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Alternatively, they could represent genuine low-frequency alleles that were by chance present among those individuals comprising the discovery panel but absent from those comprising the genotyping panel. This possibility cannot be dismissed, although all of the individuals originated from the same population and the latter comprised twice as many individuals as the former. Regardless of the exact mechanism, it would seem prudent to focus future efforts primarily upon microsatellites with high coverage and for which several reads differ from the consensus genotype.</p><p>We also extended our approach beyond simply testing whether or not a locus was polymorphic by correlating the number of alleles observed <italic>in silico</italic> with those obtained through PCR. A significant positive relationship was obtained, which was again robust to controlling statistically for microsatellite length. This could be partly due to ascertainment bias, the use of fewer individuals for microsatellite discovery than genotyping potentially having favoured the preferential discovery of common alleles. Nevertheless, selecting for microsatellite loci carrying multiple alleles <italic>in silico</italic> would appear to provide a means of maximizing the average variability of a panel of markers for a given development effort.</p><p>One potential issue relating to the selection of maximally polymorphic markers is that these may derive preferentially from regions of the genome experiencing balancing selection <xref rid="pone.0023283-Santucci1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023283-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref> and could therefore generate misleading results in population genetic analyses. However, the ten markers we selected on the basis of high <italic>in silico</italic> variability showed no obvious pattern either in terms of genomic distribution or functional annotation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0023283.s001">Table S1</xref>). For example, these loci map to 8 different chromosomes in the dog, and none locate to chromosome 12 which carries an obvious candidate for balancing selection, the MHC <xref rid="pone.0023283-Wagner1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Clearly, in order to better understand the distribution of microsatellite variability across the genome, it would be desirable to evaluate many more markers.
