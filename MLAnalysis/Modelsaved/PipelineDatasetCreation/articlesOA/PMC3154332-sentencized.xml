<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, few studies have developed microsatellites from cDNA despite the added potential for targeting candidate genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, to develop microsatellites usually requires the evaluation of numerous primer pairs for polymorphism in the focal species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This can be time-consuming and wasteful, particularly for taxa with low genetic diversity where the majority of primers often yield monomorphic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transcriptome assemblies provide a convenient solution, functional annotation of transcripts allowing markers to be targeted towards candidate genes, while high sequence coverage in principle permits the assessment of variability in silico. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Consequently, we evaluated fifty primer pairs designed to amplify microsatellites, primarily residing within transcripts related to immunity and growth, identified from an Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) transcriptome assembly. In silico visualization was used to classify each microsatellite as being either polymorphic or monomorphic and to quantify the number of distinct length variants, each taken to represent a different allele. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The majority of loci (n = 36, 76.0%) yielded interpretable PCR products, 23 of which were polymorphic in a sample of 24 fur seal individuals. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Microsatellites, also known as Short Tandem Repeats (STRs), Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) or Variable Number Tandem Repeats (VNTRs) are DNA segments comprising tandemly repeated motifs of 1–6 nucleotides. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>They are ubiquitous in eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes, present in both coding and non-coding regions, and also have a high enough mutation rate (between 10−3 and 10−4 mutations per gamete per generation) to generate and maintain extensive length polymorphism [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This makes them powerful genetic markers for a variety of applications ranging from the determination of parentage and other genetic relationships to genetic mapping [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>However, a major drawback of microsatellites is that for most species they need to be developed de novo, a process that is often costly and protracted [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The most commonly used approach for developing microsatellites requires the construction of a partial genomic library enriched for repetitive motifs, cloning, hybridization to detect positive clones, plasmid isolation and Sanger sequencing followed by primer design and evaluation [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Although most of these steps involve relatively straightforward protocols, they can be time-consuming due to the frequent need for troubleshooting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Moreover, established protocols for enrichment and cloning can be highly inefficient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>For example, the yield of positive clones typically averages only around 2–3% but can fall to as little as 0.03% [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>This can be particularly problematic when attempting to isolate markers from species with genomes that are relatively depauperate in microsatellites such as many birds [6] and fungi [7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Fortunately, recently developed next-generation sequencing platforms such as Roche's GS-FLX (454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT, USA) provide novel avenues for isolating microsatellites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>A single 454 run is capable of generating around 400 Mb of sequence data, with individual reads long enough (up to 500 bp) to capture individual microsatellites along with enough flanking sequence to design PCR primers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Sequence generation on such a scale bypasses the need for enrichment because even a fraction of a 454 run can yield a sufficiently large number of random sequence reads to contain many thousands of microsatellites by chance [8]–[12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Moreover, by directing 454 sequencing towards expressed genes (i.e. transcriptome sequencing), the possibility now exists to develop panels of microsatellites that are ideal markers for genes underlying phenotypic variation [13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Given the clear advantages afforded by 454 sequencing, approaches based on this or other emerging hi-throughput technologies will inevitably supercede conventional microsatellite isolation protocols. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>However, it will continue to be necessary to design primers, optimize each primer pair for PCR and then test these for polymorphism in a sample of individuals of the study species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>This is because not all primer pairs generate interpretable PCR products and a proportion of loci that amplify successfully are invariably monomorphic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The latter represent wasted effort, an issue that can be particularly acute in species with low genetic diversity where large numbers of loci often need to be evaluated in order to obtain just a handful of informative markers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>An example comes from the endangered Hawaiian monk seal, in which Shultz et al. [14] developed 163 microsatellite loci in order to obtain just 17 that were polymorphic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>For systems such as this, but also to bring about more general improvements in efficiency, it would therefore be desirable to develop and evaluate potential approaches for pre-screening microsatellites for polymorphism in silico. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Just such an opportunity is provided by a large body of 454 sequence data recently generated for the Antarctic fur seal, Arctocephalus gazella [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>A long-term genetic study of this colonially breeding polygynous pinniped species at Bird Island, South Georgia [16] has identified remarkably consistent relationships between heterozygosity measured at 9–76 microsatellite loci and a variety of important fitness traits, from male reproductive success through body size to attractiveness [17]–[20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>However, despite several candidate genomic regions being identified through the mapping of individual microsatellites to the dog (Canis lupis familiaris) genome (seals and dogs diverged approximately 44 million years ago [21] and the canine genome is relatively well annotated), the underlying genes remain elusive [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Plausibly, most if not all of these could be immune-related, with reduced parasite loads and disease leading to greater longevity, enhanced growth, behavioural dominance and attractiveness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>However, an alternative possibility is that heterozygosity might directly impact an individual's metabolism [22], allowing it to grow more quickly and to attain greater body size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Consequently, we 454 sequenced the skin transcriptome of this species [15], both to generate a preliminary genomic resource for pinnipeds in general and with a view towards identifying markers within suitable candidate genes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Our experimental approach comprised two main stages (see Materials and Methods for further details). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>First, 454 sequencing was conducted on pooled cDNA from twelve Antarctic fur seal individuals (six adult males, two adult females and four pups) selected to capture much of the allelic diversity present within the population [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The resulting reads were then assembled de novo into isotigs, each representing a collection of transcripts of a given gene, which were in turn functionally annotated by reference to the dog genome using Gene Ontology (GO) codes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>We then used freeware to interrogate all of the isotig sequences for microsatellite repeat motifs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Finally, candidate markers were selected by filtering for a subset of isotigs containing microsatellites and with GO annotation terms related to immunity and growth. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>In the second stage, we attempted to quantify the variability of each locus in silico and relate this to observed polymorphism when the locus was PCR amplified in a panel of 24 unrelated fur seals (note that these individuals were different from those used to generate the initial transcriptome assembly). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>To estimate levels of in silico variability, microsatellite-containing isotigs were visualized within the program Tablet [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>This provides a graphical representation of each isotig in which the individual reads comprising it are shown aligned against the consensus sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Upon visual inspection, certain microsatellites appeared identical across multiple reads whereas others showed evidence of variation in the numbers of repeat units. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>We therefore quantified for a subset of loci the number of repeat units within each of the reads, allowing derivation of estimates of variability including the number of distinct motif length variants (each of which was taken to represent a different allele) and the number of reads differing from the consensus genotype. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>In this manuscript, we evaluated a total of fifty primer pairs designed to PCR amplify putative microsatellites identified from the Antarctic fur seal transcriptome assembly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Our aims were twofold: (i) to generate a panel of microsatellites functionally linked to either immunity or growth; and (ii) to explore the relationship between in silico variability and PCR product polymorphism. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Consequently, we used an Antarctic fur seal transcriptome assembly to develop PCR primers to amplify microsatellites residing within transcripts related to immunity and growth, while at the same time looking for a potential relationship between in silico variability and PCR product polymorphism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>We were successful on both counts, identifying 13 polymorphic microsatellites associated with these two primary classes of candidate gene and also demonstrating a clear link between in silico variability and two different measures of PCR product polymorphism. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="s4a"><title><text><SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Microsatellites within candidate transcripts </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>It has long been recognized that microsatellites derived from transcribed sequences, whether these be expressed sequence tags or transcriptome assemblies, can be powerful tools for a variety of applications including linkage and QTL mapping, comparative genomics and studies of genome evolution [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>This is largely due to the fact that genes are often highly conserved, increasing the likelihood of primers cross-amplifying and serving as ‘anchor points’ for cross-species comparisons [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Being type I markers (i.e. associated with genes of known function), transcript-associated microsatellites also represent ideal markers for studying the genetic basis of phenotypic trait variation [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>However, despite several studies having developed panels of candidate-gene targeted microsatellites from the complete genome sequences of humans and their companion species [41]–[43], cDNA has not yet been widely exploited for this purpose, particularly in non-model organisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Our study highlights the eminent feasibility of such an approach, although the numbers of markers obtainable will clearly depend on the relative abundance of various classes of transcript. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>In this particular case, immune-related transcripts were relatively rare (total n = 316), perhaps unsurprisingly given that the transcriptome was developed from fur seal skin plugs [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Moreover, only 26 of these transcripts contained microsatellites, of which seven were discarded due to there not being enough flanking sequence to design primers and one because it did not map to the dog genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Thus, the 13 primer pairs that we evaluated comprised the majority (72.2%) of available immune-related loci. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>In contrast, we only evaluated around a quarter of the 106 microsatellite-containing growth-related transcripts available to us. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>It should be possible to overcome the paucity of immune-related transcripts in this species through additional 454 sequencing directed towards other tissues such as the spleen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, short read sequencing could be employed to increase the depth of coverage of singletons so far excluded from the assembly, a fraction of which would be expected to be related to immunity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Notably, our rates of success in developing polymorphic loci were roughly equal for microsatellites located within immune and growth-related transcripts but higher for markers selected on the basis of in silico variability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>This trend was also reflected in the allelic diversity of loci that successfully amplified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>This is almost certainly due to our having been unbiased in our selection of immune and growth-related microsatellites, attempting to PCR amplify loci irrespective of the number of repeat units or apparent levels of variability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>However, with a success rate of 80% for loci selected on the basis of high in silico variability, our study suggests that in silico screening could significantly improve the efficiency of future attempts to develop candidate-gene targeted microsatellites (see below). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>An important drawback of microsatellites is the occurrence of non-amplifying alleles, which can arise when a mutation within one or both of the primer binding sites prevents primer annealing [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Null alleles are found in up to 30% of loci [36], [44] and can significantly impact paternity analyses, leading if unrecognized to the false exclusion of true parents and downstream to errors in pedigree reconstruction [38]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Although the advent of 454 sequencing has allowed much of the microsatellite isolation process to be streamlined, the primer evaluation step has seen few improvements other than the introduction of the M13 tailed system [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, very little can be done beyond careful PCR optimization to minimize the wastage of time and materials on loci that fail to amplify. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>However, we believe that pre-selecting markers for variability in silico may help to minimize the number of primer pairs that yield monomorphic PCR products, especially in species with low levels of genetic variability (e.g. [14], [46], [47]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, even in ‘normal’ species, a small improvement in efficiency might bring about significant time and cost savings when attempting to develop large panels of markers for applications such as genetic mapping. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>The concept of sourcing polymorphic genetic markers within sequence assemblies is by no means new, with several studies having previously mined 454 datasets for SNPs [e.g. 48], [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>However, we are not aware of any studies that have extended the same approach to microsatellites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>If anything, the opposite appears to be the case, with most studies having sequenced a single specimen, while others have deliberately filtered out identical reads in order to reduce the risk of developing the same locus more than once [10]–[12], [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Although these strategies make some sense when genetic variability is high, under normal circumstances including more than one individual in a 454 run is unlikely to be detrimental. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, the inclusion of multiple individuals should not only capture more of the standing genetic variation within a given population, but may also help to average out any effects arising from differences in template quality among individuals. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>On a related point, some authors have speculated that it should be possible to enrich for polymorphic microsatellites by selectively testing only loci with large numbers of repeat units [8], [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>This is because longer microsatellites tend to be more mutable due to an increased probability of slippage [50], [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>However, current Sanger and 454 read length limitations mean that the longer the microsatellite, the less flanking sequence will be available for designing primers [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Moreover, microsatellites also appear to have an upper size limit, rarely attaining lengths in excess of a few tens of repeat units [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Consequently, longer microsatellites may be relatively hard to come by, depending on genome size and the scale of the sequencing effort [24], [53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Our approach may help to mitigate both of these problems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>First, assembling multiple 454 reads allows longer tracts of contiguous sequence to be obtained, thereby maximizing the amount of flanking sequence available for primer design. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>In the case of the fur seal 454 assembly [15], average isotig length was three times greater than average read length (854 bp versus 286 bp). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Second, we were also able to demonstrate a highly significant positive relationship between in silico variability and PCR product polymorphism, even after controlling for the number of repeat units. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>This suggest that pre-screening for microsatellites appearing variable in silico could help to increase the yield of informative markers regardless of whether or not these are additionally selected on the basis of length. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>An important caveat to the above is that our approach was only around 75% accurate at predicting whether or not PCR products were polymorphic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>However, most of the observed discrepancies appear to be explicable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>For example, the locus that did not appear to be variable in silico but which generated polymorphic PCR products had a depth of coverage of only 4 reads. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>With so few reads in total, it is possible that stochastic variation during clonal amplification and sequencing could have resulted in a single allele being preferentially sequenced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Similarly, almost all of the eight loci that were monomorphic despite appearing variable in silico were characterized by the ‘minor allele’ being of very low frequency (typically only 1–3 copies). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>These minority reads could potentially have resulted from sequencing error, consistent with the fact that 454 error rates are somewhat higher than those typically experienced with Sanger sequencing [54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, they could represent genuine low-frequency alleles that were by chance present among those individuals comprising the discovery panel but absent from those comprising the genotyping panel. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>This possibility cannot be dismissed, although all of the individuals originated from the same population and the latter comprised twice as many individuals as the former. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Regardless of the exact mechanism, it would seem prudent to focus future efforts primarily upon microsatellites with high coverage and for which several reads differ from the consensus genotype. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>We also extended our approach beyond simply testing whether or not a locus was polymorphic by correlating the number of alleles observed in silico with those obtained through PCR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>A significant positive relationship was obtained, which was again robust to controlling statistically for microsatellite length. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>This could be partly due to ascertainment bias, the use of fewer individuals for microsatellite discovery than genotyping potentially having favoured the preferential discovery of common alleles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, selecting for microsatellite loci carrying multiple alleles in silico would appear to provide a means of maximizing the average variability of a panel of markers for a given development effort. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>One potential issue relating to the selection of maximally polymorphic markers is that these may derive preferentially from regions of the genome experiencing balancing selection [55], [56] and could therefore generate misleading results in population genetic analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>However, the ten markers we selected on the basis of high in silico variability showed no obvious pattern either in terms of genomic distribution or functional annotation (Table S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>For example, these loci map to 8 different chromosomes in the dog, and none locate to chromosome 12 which carries an obvious candidate for balancing selection, the MHC [57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Clearly, in order to better understand the distribution of microsatellite variability across the genome, it would be desirable to evaluate many more markers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>One option in the fur seal would be to screen these across multiple populations to identify F st outliers as potential candidates for loci behaving non-neutrally [58]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>To take full advantage of the high-throughput nature of next-generation sequencing requires fully automated data processing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Automating the in silico screening of isotigs for variable microsatellites would be a logical extension to the proof of principle that we present here, and might potentially be achieved by modifying a pre-existing microsatellite search tool, of which there are many [59], [60]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Several of these programs are also capable of designing primers or can link up with external primer selection tools such as Primer 3 [25] to further streamline marker development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Given a large enough pool of candidate microsatellites, automation might also help to minimize the amount of time spent on manual PCR optimization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>For example, loci that fail to amplify under standard conditions could be discarded and other markers drawn from the pool to replace them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>This could greatly facilitate the rapid development of polymorphic microsatellites for candidate gene studies or the construction of high-density genetic maps [59]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Although we have developed in silico screening using a transcriptome assembly, it might also be possible to extend the same approach to other situations in which homologous sequence reads are available from more than one individual. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>This may not apply to whole-genome 454 shotgun sequencing-based approaches due to the probability of sequencing 100 bp of the same genomic sequence almost certainly being too low [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>However, it may prove possible to align multiple homologous sequences from reduced representation libraries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 454 technology will continue to improve, with a single GS FLX+ run already being capable of generating 700 Mb of sequence data with an average read length of 700 bp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>The potential also exists in the future to exploit increasing numbers of large-scale genomic databases [59], some of which (e.g. the 1000 Genomes project; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.1000genomes.org">http://www.1000genomes.org</ext-link>) already incorporate sequence data from multiple individuals. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Finally, financial and time factors also need to be taken into account. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>A clear consensus is already emerging that 454 sequencing is more cost-effective, requires less time to be spent in the wet lab and generates many more markers than traditional approaches based on the Sanger sequencing of enriched genomic libraries [8], [10], [12], [61]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Our study employed a full 454 run costing around £8000, which lies squarely within the range of commercial fees reported for developing around ten polymorphic loci [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>However, using in silico mining, we were able to identify over 2000 microsatellites, many of which were associated with annotated transcripts, at no additional cost and with a negligible time investment [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>This compares favourably with two previous development efforts in this species, which together generated a total of 53 clone sequences from which primers could be designed [62], [63] at the cost of several months of laboratory work. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Finally, the rate of conversion into polymorphic microsatellites averaged over the two previous studies was 35.8%, significantly lower than the 80% rate obtained here for loci selected on the basis of high in silico variability (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Consequently, targeting loci that are more likely to successfully convert should bring significant time savings as well as reducing expenditure on oligonucleotides. </plain></SENT>
