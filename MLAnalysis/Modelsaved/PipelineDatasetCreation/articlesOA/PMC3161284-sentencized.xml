</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>During a 2-week run-in, CGM was used with only predictive, rate-of-change, high and low alerts active (LGS-OFF). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that LGS has the potential to reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes at the highest risk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>This is similar to results with insulin pump therapy providing the greatest reduction in hypoglycemia in those with the most hypoglycemia at baseline (7). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The risk of ketosis and hyperglycemia after the 2-h suspension of insulin delivery is low (8,9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>In our study, median sensor glucose after 2 h of LGS was 3.9 (2.4–14.2) mmol/L. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>We could not determine if carbohydrate had been consumed during the LGS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of deterioration of overall glucose control with LGS activated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Patients took longer to respond to the LGS alarm at night, and 75% of completed 2-h LGS events occurred overnight. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>This may relate to the combined effects of sleep and hypoglycemia on alertness/arousability, and reduced counter-regulatory responses during sleep (10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Most daytime LGS episodes were terminated by users within 10 min. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The sensor may under-report glucose, particularly during nocturnal hypoglycemia and in view of the lag between interstitial and capillary glucose (11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Although the lowest displayed sensor value is 2.2 mmol/L, the Veo algorithm has improved hypoglycemia detection compared with previous algorithms, with a mean absolute relative difference between 2.2 and 4.4 mmol/L reduced from 24.8 to19.5% (12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>We set the LGS threshold low (mean, 2.4 mmol/L), and a higher threshold may have led to greater reduction in hypoglycemia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Our study could not determine rates of false-positive LGS: 4 of 43 LGS had a capillary glucose reading within 15 min &gt;10 mmol/L, and 2 of these were preceded by sensor error alerts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>However, these capillary readings may be biased toward episodes when the patient thought the LGS was erroneous. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>LGS reduces anxiety about nocturnal hypoglycemia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Randomized controlled trials that evaluate hypoglycemia and quality-of-life in type 1 diabetes using LGS pumps compared with insulin pump therapy alone, with or without CGM, are now needed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>This is the first system that modulates insulin delivery in response to glucose levels without human intervention and is an important step toward clinically available closed-loop systems. </plain></SENT>
