<italic>ACACB</italic> is a key rate limiting enzyme in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. In this study, we found that the <italic>ACACB</italic> transcribed SNP rs2075260 was associated with adipose tissue <italic>ACACB</italic> gene expression in EAs and AAs and with insulin sensitivity in EAs; the allele associated with lower gene expression was also associated with higher insulin sensitivity. This is consistent with the mouse model, which demonstrated that inhibition of <italic>Acacb</italic> improved insulin sensitivity <xref rid="pone.0023860-AbuElheiga2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. These data suggest that <italic>ACACB cis</italic>-acting SNPs may regulate gene expression in humans, potentially altering insulin sensitivity independent of BMI. Although the association of rs2075260 with insulin sensitivity was not statistically significant in the AA sample, the effect of this allele was similar in magnitude and in the same direction as that observed in EAs. This result is similar to that seen in an independent German Sorb population sample whose LD pattern was similar to HapMap CEU with the association between rs2075263 (C/T) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; p&#8202;=&#8202;0.22, beta&#8202;=&#8202;0.06, n&#8202;=&#8202;793) (personal communication: Stumvoll M, 2011) <xref rid="pone.0023860-Tnjes1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, as well as in Diabetes Genetics Initiative (DGI) for HOMA-IR (p&#8202;=&#8202;0.03, beta&#8202;=&#8202;0.11, n&#8202;=&#8202;1393), where the meta-p value of these two cohorts reached 0.01 and 0.02 for Stouffer and Fisher's methods respectively with minor allele C indicating lower insulin sensitivity, consistent with rs2075260 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0023860-t003">Table 3</xref> where minor allele G represented lower insulin sensitivity in the AR and UT Caucasian metabolic sample . Our inability to detect association at this locus in AAs may reflect low statistical power in this small sample. Concerns about multiple testing are relevant in genetic studies. The number of SNPs to account for in this study is impacted by the fact that rs2075259, rs2075260, and rs2075263 are in high genotypic concordance in Caucasians. Given this, we presented the raw p values without adjustment for multiple comparisons.</p><p>The non-synonymous SNP rs2075260 (G/A) encodes an amino acid substitution Val2141Ile [NM_001093]. We are unable to predict ACACB protein structural changes caused by this amino acid substitution (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://snpeffect.vib.be/">http://snpeffect.vib.be/</ext-link>). We scanned this SNP using MatInspector (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genomatix.de">http://www.genomatix.de</ext-link> ) and TFSEARCH (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbrc.jp/research/db/TFSEARCH.html">http://www.cbrc.jp/ research/db/TFSEARCH.html</ext-link>) and have not identified potential anchoring loci for a transcription factor binding site at rs2075260. Therefore, we are unable to determine whether this SNP is a functional variant. However, rs2075259 (G/A), in high genotypic concordance with rs2075260, forms activating protein (AP1)/ v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog (MAF) anchoring sites for allele G (matrix similarity&#8202;=&#8202;0.96-0.98), while allele A abolished these potential binding sites. As we demonstrated, the G allele of rs2075259 is associated with lower <italic>ACACB</italic> gene expression in adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0023860-t002">Table 2</xref>). AP1/MAF may act as a suppressor, or impact other repressors, of gene expression <xref rid="pone.0023860-Balasubramanian1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023860-Hansen1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. This is supported by the strong negative correlation between messenger level of <italic>ACACB</italic> and <italic>MAF/AP1S2</italic> (AP1 subunit 2) in our adipose gene global expression study in non-diabetic subjects (unpublished data).</p><p>No SNP was associated with BMI in the metabolic sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0023860.s003">Table S1</xref>). However, adipose <italic>ACACB</italic> expression was negatively associated with age and sex-adjusted BMI in EAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023860-g005">Figure 5a</xref>). This correlation cannot be explained by the known regulatory function of <italic>ACACB</italic> on body weight and insulin sensitivity in the mouse model <xref rid="pone.0023860-AbuElheiga1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023860-AbuElheiga2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023860-Oh1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. We suspect that BMI may regulate adipose <italic>ACACB</italic> expression in EAs. Although this cross-sectional study cannot provide direct evidence, this hypothesis is supported by our observation that HepG2 cell <italic>ACACB</italic> expression was down-regulated after treatment with 1 mM palmitate <xref rid="pone.0023860-Das1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. It is conceivable that nutritional stress (e.g. diet-indued obesity and free fatty acid exposure) regulates <italic>ACACB</italic> expression. Down regulation of <italic>Acacb</italic> was observed in visceral fat tissue in rats fed a high-fat diet, while <italic>Juniperus chinensis</italic> extract significantly reduced this effect (14). AMPK (AMP activated protein kinase) may be the link between <italic>ACACB</italic> gene expression and nutritional status <xref rid="pone.0023860-Huypens1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. ACACB activity <xref rid="pone.0023860-Cho1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> can be directly inhibited by AMPK. This may constitute a physiologic link between higher BMI and lower <italic>ACACB</italic> gene expression and supports the metabolic adaptation model proposed by Weyer et al based on energy expenditure, fat oxidation, and body weight regulation in Pima Indians <xref rid="pone.0023860-Weyer1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The lack of association between adipose <italic>ACACB</italic> gene expression and BMI in AAs may be due to the smaller sample size or imprecision of BMI as a measure of adiposity. Alternatively, AAs may be less sensitive to nutritional stress in terms of regulating adipose <italic>ACACB</italic> expression. Adipose <italic>ACACB</italic> expression levels are significantly higher in AAs than EAs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0023860-t004">Table 4</xref>). However, BMI and insulin sensitivity were nearly equivalent in EAs and AAs in the biopsy study sample (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0023860-t004">Table 4</xref>). This finding may reflect racial differences in <italic>ACACB</italic> expression in response to similar body fat. Different genetic or environmental factors may affect <italic>ACACB</italic> expression between EAs and AAs.</p><p>
<italic>ACACB</italic> variants have not been shown to be associated with BMI or diabetes using GWAS. However, functional variants (e.g. transcribed SNPs) may still regulate gene expression and impact insulin sensitivity. Our biopsy sample was modest and generated approximately 86% power in EAs and 30% power in AAs to detect 20% of the variation in gene expression levels (assuming a type 1 error rate&#8202;=&#8202;0.0005). Larger populations will be necessary to replicate these results. The lack of association of <italic>ACACB</italic> variants with BMI/diabetes may also reflect the masking effect of gene*gene and gene*environment interactions. A recent gene*environment interaction study of <italic>ACACB</italic> variants and metabolism suggested that uncovered causative variants may have been overlooked in published GWAS <xref rid="pone.0023860-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. <italic>Acacb</italic> knock-out mice were only protected from obesity and diabetes when fed high fat/high-carbohydrate diets; when fed normal chow, significant differences in body weight were not observed <xref rid="pone.0023860-AbuElheiga2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Two independent groups reported that <italic>Acacb</italic> knock-out mice have similar body weights as wild type mice <xref rid="pone.0023860-Olson1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023860-Hoehn1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Molecular explanations for the phenotypic differences observed between Olson's model of <italic>Acacb</italic> deletion and the original model (prone to resistant to obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance) published by Abu-Elheiga et al. <xref rid="pone.0023860-AbuElheiga1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> are not clear. Although the <italic>Acacb</italic> biotin-binding site was deleted in both models, different targeting strategies were employed. The targeting strategy employed in the original study replaced only the exon containing the biotin binding motif <xref rid="pone.0023860-AbuElheiga1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. RNA splicing across the targeting cassette might leave the mRNA in frame, resulting in a mutated but otherwise intact protein lacking a catalytic domain. If produced, such a protein might potentially have &#8220;dominant negative&#8221; activity toward ACACA <xref rid="pone.0023860-Olson1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. This may be supported by the effects of soraphen, an inhibitor of both ACACA and ACACB, improving peripheral insulin sensitivity in mice fed high-fat diets <xref rid="pone.0023860-Schreurs1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. It suggests that lower <italic>ACACB</italic> expression alone may be insufficient to improve insulin sensitivity. As in the present study, association between rs2075260 and S<sub>I</sub> was weaker compared to the association with gene expression. It is noteworthy that this result was based on transcript messenger level only, as protein level and enzyme activity data are not available yet. Limitations of this study included the small sample of AA subjects, lack of longitudinal follow-up data and lack of dietary intervention. These factors limit interpretation of gene expression effects. We also lack quantifiable life-style data to use as covariates in our database. Free fatty acid (FFA) levels fluctuate even with fasting. Healthy non-diabetic, non-drug or tobacco using subjects should be recruited on balanced diets for three days, with blood samples drawn after an overnight fast. We are not confident that our blood samples meet these criteria. Therefore, we elected not to measure FFAs in our sample. We were unable to test the effects of specific ACACB inhibitors on human insulin sensitivity. Finally, due to the large size of the <italic>ACACB</italic> gene (Ensembl transcript ID ENST00000338432: 55 exons spanning 150 kb), where 142 SNPs were available in HapMap database (NCBI builder 36), we prioritized the effect of transcribed SNPs on gene expression. The most significant SNP for adipose <italic>ACACB</italic> expression in the biopsy sample (rs2075260) was in high genotypic concordance with rs2075259 and rs2075263, which rank among the top SNPs in skeletal muscle eQTL mapping <xref rid="pone.0023860-Cox1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. However, rs2075260 was not associated with skeletal muscle <italic>ACACB</italic> expression in the biopsy sample. This observation is not uncommon in terms of eQTLs in different cell types <xref rid="pone.0023860-Dimas1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. This could also result from different transcript forms presented across different cell types or variation in participant characteristics in the two study samples. In addition, the <italic>ACACB</italic> probe (Agilent expression array) applied in the eQTL mapping <xref rid="pone.0023860-Cox1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> was located at the 3&#8242; UTR of the <italic>ACACB</italic> gene, while the expression primer set (for RT-PCR) used in the current study was designed across exon 13 and 14, in an attempt to cover all of the reported transcripts. Transcribed SNPs are a logical source for testing AEI as a complementary prioritization method for gene expression based on genotype. We chose lymphoblast cell lines for AEI studies instead of adipose tissue due to mixed sources of adipose RNA, as well as the restricted amount of tissue RNA available. It can be argued that lymphoblast cell lines are not the most relevant cell types to evaluate insulin action. However, our prior study revealed that lymphoblast cell lines provided confirmatory evidence for eQTLs in insulin-response tissues <xref rid="pone.0023860-Sharma1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>Our data suggest that the common transcribed SNP rs2075260 (A/G) in the coding region of the <italic>ACACB</italic> gene is associated with adipose tissue <italic>ACACB</italic> messenger RNA expression in EAs and AAs. The G allele, representing higher levels of gene expression, is also associated with lower insulin sensitivity in EAs. Body fat, represented by BMI, may serve as a &#8220;negative feed-back&#8221; signal down-regulating <italic>ACACB</italic> expression in adipose tissue, possibly as a mechanism of metabolic adaptation. Longitudinal intervention studies will assist in interpreting whether high <italic>ACACB</italic> expression is a risk factor for obesity and type 2 diabetes. Gene*gene interaction studies in larger cohorts will be helpful to identify any undetected diabetes or obesity genes that interact with <italic>ACACB</italic>. Analysis of alternative splicing of <italic>ACACB</italic> in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle may be helpful to address tissue-specific transcripts and regulatory SNPs involved in gene expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Subjects and phenotypes</title><p>The &#8220;biopsy sample&#8221; consisted of 105 EAs and 46 AAs from Little Rock, Arkansas who lacked diabetes based on ADA diagnostic criteria 2010 <xref rid="pone.0023860-American1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.
