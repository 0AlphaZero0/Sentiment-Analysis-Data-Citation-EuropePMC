</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Acetyl-CoA carboxylase α and β (ACC1/ACACA and ACC2/ACACB) catalyze the synthesis of malonyl-CoA, the substrate for fatty acid synthesis and a regulator of fatty acid oxidation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Increased malonyl-CoA concentrations inhibit carnitine palmitoyaltransferase-1 (CPT1) activity, decreasing the rate of fatty acid entry into mitochondria and subsequent fatty acid oxidation [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>ACACB is the key regulator of the fatty acid oxidation pathway [2] and Acacb knock-out mice are reportedly protected against obesity and diabetes induced by high fat/high carbohydrate diets [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Continuous fatty acid oxidation in adipocytes of Acacb knock-out mice is one factor contributing to their high insulin sensitivity [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Human gene expression studies suggest that ACACB is abundantly expressed in both oxidative and lipogenic tissues [5], [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>When dietary intake exceeds the storage capacity of adipose tissue, excess lipid is delivered as ectopic fat to skeletal muscle, liver, pancreatic β-cells, and cardiac muscle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The resulting organ dysfunction, known as “lipotoxicity”, results in impaired insulin action and glucose homeostasis, and ultimately type 2 diabetes; however, the cellular mechanisms and intermediates are not fully understood [7]–[11]. Acacb knock-out mice [2], [3], [4] and rats treated with Acaca or Acacb anti-sense nucleotide inhibitors [12] suggested a potential therapeutic target for ACACB in insulin resistance, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Alternations in nutritional status may also regulate ACACA and ACACB expression [13], [14]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>ACACB single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4766587 [15], [16] is associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a common SNP rs2268388 within ACACB is reproducibly associated with type 2 diabetes-related proteinuria and end-stage renal disease in non-African American (AA) populations [6], [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Animal studies [3] suggest that the lack of strong association between ACACB variants and obesity/diabetes may be masked by the cross-regulation of ACACB expression and hormonal/nutritional status in insulin-sensitive tissues [18], [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Gene-nutrient interactions may further influence the expression of functional variants in ACACB and their relationships with insulin sensitivity [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The ACACB cis regulatory SNPs rs2075259 and rs2075263 were significantly associated with ACACB messenger RNA levels in skeletal muscle (p = 3.0×10−8 and p = 5.2×10−7, respectively) [20]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that: (a) cis SNPs may regulate ACACB expression in insulin sensitive tissues and by consequence affect insulin sensitivity, and (b) body fat, represented by body mass index (BMI), may regulate ACACB expression in insulin responsive tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the association between transcribed SNPs in ACACB and subcutaneous adipose tissue and skeletal muscle ACACB gene expression, as well as insulin sensitivity in European Americans (EAs) and AAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>We also tested for relationships between BMI and ACACB messenger RNA expression in adipose and skeletal muscle tissues. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>In this study, we found that the ACACB transcribed SNP rs2075260 was associated with adipose tissue ACACB gene expression in EAs and AAs and with insulin sensitivity in EAs; the allele associated with lower gene expression was also associated with higher insulin sensitivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the mouse model, which demonstrated that inhibition of Acacb improved insulin sensitivity [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that ACACB cis-acting SNPs may regulate gene expression in humans, potentially altering insulin sensitivity independent of BMI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Although the association of rs2075260 with insulin sensitivity was not statistically significant in the AA sample, the effect of this allele was similar in magnitude and in the same direction as that observed in EAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>This result is similar to that seen in an independent German Sorb population sample whose LD pattern was similar to HapMap CEU with the association between rs2075263 (C/T) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; p = 0.22, beta = 0.06, n = 793) (personal communication: Stumvoll M, 2011) [21], as well as in Diabetes Genetics Initiative (DGI) for HOMA-IR (p = 0.03, beta = 0.11, n = 1393), where the meta-p value of these two cohorts reached 0.01 and 0.02 for Stouffer and Fisher's methods respectively with minor allele C indicating lower insulin sensitivity, consistent with rs2075260 in Table 3 where minor allele G represented lower insulin sensitivity in the AR and UT Caucasian metabolic sample . </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Our inability to detect association at this locus in AAs may reflect low statistical power in this small sample. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Concerns about multiple testing are relevant in genetic studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>The number of SNPs to account for in this study is impacted by the fact that rs2075259, rs2075260, and rs2075263 are in high genotypic concordance in Caucasians. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>However, rs2075259 (G/A), in high genotypic concordance with rs2075260, forms activating protein (AP1)/ v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog (MAF) anchoring sites for allele G (matrix similarity = 0.96-0.98), while allele A abolished these potential binding sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>As we demonstrated, the G allele of rs2075259 is associated with lower ACACB gene expression in adipose tissue (Table 2). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>This is supported by the strong negative correlation between messenger level of ACACB and MAF/AP1S2 (AP1 subunit 2) in our adipose gene global expression study in non-diabetic subjects (unpublished data). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>No SNP was associated with BMI in the metabolic sample (Table S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>However, adipose ACACB expression was negatively associated with age and sex-adjusted BMI in EAs (Figure 5a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>This correlation cannot be explained by the known regulatory function of ACACB on body weight and insulin sensitivity in the mouse model [2], [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>We suspect that BMI may regulate adipose ACACB expression in EAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Although this cross-sectional study cannot provide direct evidence, this hypothesis is supported by our observation that HepG2 cell ACACB expression was down-regulated after treatment with 1 mM palmitate [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>It is conceivable that nutritional stress (e.g. diet-indued obesity and free fatty acid exposure) regulates ACACB expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>Down regulation of Acacb was observed in visceral fat tissue in rats fed a high-fat diet, while Juniperus chinensis extract significantly reduced this effect (14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>AMPK (AMP activated protein kinase) may be the link between ACACB gene expression and nutritional status [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>ACACB activity [25] can be directly inhibited by AMPK. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>This may constitute a physiologic link between higher BMI and lower ACACB gene expression and supports the metabolic adaptation model proposed by Weyer et al based on energy expenditure, fat oxidation, and body weight regulation in Pima Indians [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>The lack of association between adipose ACACB gene expression and BMI in AAs may be due to the smaller sample size or imprecision of BMI as a measure of adiposity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, AAs may be less sensitive to nutritional stress in terms of regulating adipose ACACB expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Adipose ACACB expression levels are significantly higher in AAs than EAs (Table 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>However, BMI and insulin sensitivity were nearly equivalent in EAs and AAs in the biopsy study sample (Table 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>This finding may reflect racial differences in ACACB expression in response to similar body fat. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Different genetic or environmental factors may affect ACACB expression between EAs and AAs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>ACACB variants have not been shown to be associated with BMI or diabetes using GWAS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>However, functional variants (e.g. transcribed SNPs) may still regulate gene expression and impact insulin sensitivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Our biopsy sample was modest and generated approximately 86% power in EAs and 30% power in AAs to detect 20% of the variation in gene expression levels (assuming a type 1 error rate = 0.0005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Larger populations will be necessary to replicate these results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>The lack of association of ACACB variants with BMI/diabetes may also reflect the masking effect of gene*gene and gene*environment interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>A recent gene*environment interaction study of ACACB variants and metabolism suggested that uncovered causative variants may have been overlooked in published GWAS [16]. Acacb knock-out mice were only protected from obesity and diabetes when fed high fat/high-carbohydrate diets; when fed normal chow, significant differences in body weight were not observed [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Two independent groups reported that Acacb knock-out mice have similar body weights as wild type mice [27], [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Molecular explanations for the phenotypic differences observed between Olson's model of Acacb deletion and the original model (prone to resistant to obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance) published by Abu-Elheiga et al. [2] are not clear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Although the Acacb biotin-binding site was deleted in both models, different targeting strategies were employed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>The targeting strategy employed in the original study replaced only the exon containing the biotin binding motif [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>RNA splicing across the targeting cassette might leave the mRNA in frame, resulting in a mutated but otherwise intact protein lacking a catalytic domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>If produced, such a protein might potentially have “dominant negative” activity toward ACACA [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>This may be supported by the effects of soraphen, an inhibitor of both ACACA and ACACB, improving peripheral insulin sensitivity in mice fed high-fat diets [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>It suggests that lower ACACB expression alone may be insufficient to improve insulin sensitivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>As in the present study, association between rs2075260 and SI was weaker compared to the association with gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>It is noteworthy that this result was based on transcript messenger level only, as protein level and enzyme activity data are not available yet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Limitations of this study included the small sample of AA subjects, lack of longitudinal follow-up data and lack of dietary intervention. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>These factors limit interpretation of gene expression effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>We also lack quantifiable life-style data to use as covariates in our database. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Free fatty acid (FFA) levels fluctuate even with fasting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Healthy non-diabetic, non-drug or tobacco using subjects should be recruited on balanced diets for three days, with blood samples drawn after an overnight fast. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>We are not confident that our blood samples meet these criteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we elected not to measure FFAs in our sample. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>We were unable to test the effects of specific ACACB inhibitors on human insulin sensitivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Finally, due to the large size of the ACACB gene (Ensembl transcript ID ENST00000338432: 55 exons spanning 150 kb), where 142 SNPs were available in HapMap database (NCBI builder 36), we prioritized the effect of transcribed SNPs on gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>The most significant SNP for adipose ACACB expression in the biopsy sample (rs2075260) was in high genotypic concordance with rs2075259 and rs2075263, which rank among the top SNPs in skeletal muscle eQTL mapping [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>However, rs2075260 was not associated with skeletal muscle ACACB expression in the biopsy sample. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>This observation is not uncommon in terms of eQTLs in different cell types [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>This could also result from different transcript forms presented across different cell types or variation in participant characteristics in the two study samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>In addition, the ACACB probe (Agilent expression array) applied in the eQTL mapping [20] was located at the 3′ UTR of the ACACB gene, while the expression primer set (for RT-PCR) used in the current study was designed across exon 13 and 14, in an attempt to cover all of the reported transcripts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Transcribed SNPs are a logical source for testing AEI as a complementary prioritization method for gene expression based on genotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>We chose lymphoblast cell lines for AEI studies instead of adipose tissue due to mixed sources of adipose RNA, as well as the restricted amount of tissue RNA available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>It can be argued that lymphoblast cell lines are not the most relevant cell types to evaluate insulin action. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>However, our prior study revealed that lymphoblast cell lines provided confirmatory evidence for eQTLs in insulin-response tissues [31]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the common transcribed SNP rs2075260 (A/G) in the coding region of the ACACB gene is associated with adipose tissue ACACB messenger RNA expression in EAs and AAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>The G allele, representing higher levels of gene expression, is also associated with lower insulin sensitivity in EAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Body fat, represented by BMI, may serve as a “negative feed-back” signal down-regulating ACACB expression in adipose tissue, possibly as a mechanism of metabolic adaptation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal intervention studies will assist in interpreting whether high ACACB expression is a risk factor for obesity and type 2 diabetes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Gene*gene interaction studies in larger cohorts will be helpful to identify any undetected diabetes or obesity genes that interact with ACACB. </plain></SENT>
