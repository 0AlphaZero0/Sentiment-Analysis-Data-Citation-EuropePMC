<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA), which is defined as two or more consecutive pregnancy losses before the 20th week of gestation from the last menstrual period, occurs in approximately 1% to 5% of women at reproductive age [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although many known causes of RSA including anatomic (15%), infectious (1%–2%), hormonal (20%), immunological (20%), and genetic (2%–5%) have been identified, a significant number of cases (approximately 40%–50%) do not have known causes, and these cases are called unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion (URSA) [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that URSA belongs to an alloimmune disease associated with the failure of fetal-maternal immunologic tolerance [4, 5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Treg cells play a critical role in the induction of a privileged tolerant microenvironment at the fetal-maternal interface [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Growing evidence [7–9] suggests that women with URSA had remarkably reduced frequencies of CD4+CD25+Treg cells in peripheral blood as well as in deciduas. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The reduction of Treg cell in URSA patients is closely related to the decreased expression of Foxp3 [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a reduced suppressive capacity of Treg cells has also been implicated in URSA patients [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>It is the reduced numbers and/or functional deficiency of CD4+CD25+Treg cells that cause the predisposition to miscarriage. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Foxp3 is a master regulator gene for the development and function of Treg cells [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Deficiency of the Foxp3 gene impairs the suppressive function of Treg cells [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that there are associations between Foxp3 gene polymorphisms and autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [13], autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITDs) [14], type I diabetes (TID) [15], and allergic rhinitis [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>However, the association between Foxp3 polymorphisms and URSA has not been defined so far. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine if functional polymorphisms at the Foxp3 loci were associated with URSA in humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>We will focus on the following four loci of Foxp3 gene: rs2232365A/G, rs5902434del/ATT, rs3761548A/C, and rs2294021T/C. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Treg cells play a central role in the induction and maintenance of fetal-maternal immunologic tolerance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Development of Treg cells requires continued expression of Foxp3 [17], while attenuated Foxp3 expression results in its functional deficiency [18], We hypothesized that functional polymorphisms of the Foxp3 gene may contribute to the pathogenesis of URSA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>In the cases of the rs3761548A/C polymorphism, the A allele was a risk factor for SLE [13], AITDs [14], allergic rhinitis [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we found that genotypic frequency of rs3761548AA was significantly different between the URSA group and control group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that individuals with a genotype of rs3761548AA have the lowest production of Foxp3 among the three genotypes of this polymorphism [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Therefore, URSA patients with the AA genotype may have fewer Treg cells and/or weaker suppressive function and are difficult to achieve fetal tolerance, these results are consistent with previous reports, showing a decrease in the proportion of Foxp3+ Treg cells in URSA patients [8, 9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results suggested that the rs3761548AA genotype may contribute to the occurrence of URSA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>For the polymorphism of rs2232365A/G, the distribution of alleles and genotypes differ significantly between the URSA group and control group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>The risk of URSA in the women with G allele was higher than that in the women carrying an A allele (OR = 1.61, 95% CI = (1.11, 2.32)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>These results are also consistent with the previous work [15], showing that Type I diabetes (TID) carrying a G allele has a higher occurrence of beta-cell failure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>Because the functional differences between different genotypes are still unclear, we performed an extensive search for transcriptional factor-binding sites using TF-Search online tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbrc.jp/research/db/TFSEARCH.html">http://www.cbrc.jp/research/db/TFSEARCH.html</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, SNP variant of rs2232365A/G is located in a putative binding site for the transcription factor GATA-3, known to be essential for the Th2 immune response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>More importantly, only when the A allele exists, can GATA-3 bind the promoter region of Foxp3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Th1/Th2 cytokine balance with Th2 predominance is a very important mechanism for the survival of the fetus in the maternal uterus [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>It is also shown that Treg cells modulate the Th1/Th2 cell balance toward Th2 cell, and thus upregulate Th2 immune response [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Every recently, an intrinsic mechanism predisposing Foxp3-expressing regulatory T cells to Th2 conversion through GATA-3 in vivo has been identified [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Hence, we inferred that high frequencies of G allele and G/G genotype in URSA patients might decrease Th2 immune response and disrupt the balance of Th1/Th2, leading to a detrimental effect on the fetus during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>The human Foxp3 gene is located in the small arm of the X-chromosome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Random inactivation of X-chromosome results in the presence of only two phenotypes for each polymorphism [23], because the phenotype of the heterozygous genotype is identical to that of a homozygous genotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we performed stratification analysis based on the possible phenotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Stratification of the URSA patients and controls by heterozygotes and homozygotes failed to detect any evidence that the heterozygotes were more frequent in URSA group, which was in contrast to the results from the previous studies [14, 16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Among the 4 SNPs, however, the combinational genotypes del/del + del/ATT, A/G + G/G, C/C + A/C, and A/G + G/G appeared significantly different between the URSA and control groups, whereas only A/G + G/G and C/C + A/C were still significant after the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing of three tests(P≦0.017).These data, combined with the results from the haplotype analysis further provided evidence for the association between Foxp3 gene and URSA and supported that immune dysregulation is secondary to promoter heterogeneity in the Foxp3 gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>While some correlation has been found in the study, it is still very important to examine a larger number of samples from different populations and to investigate the proportions of Treg cells and Foxp3 expression or even their suppressive capacity in peripheral or decidua among different genotypes in URSA patients to obtain more reliable conclusions. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Two functional polymorphisms in Foxp3 gene (rs2232365A/G and rs3761548A/C) are related to the occurrence of URSA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>These results highlight the important role of Foxp3 in successful pregnancy. </plain></SENT>
