<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relative to the Brachypodieae and Triticeae common ancestor, the gene number was reduced in B. distachyon by 3,026 genes and increased in Ae. tauschii by 7,813 genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sum of gene deletion and gene duplication rates, which reflects the rate of gene synteny loss, was correlated with the rate of structural chromosome rearrangements and was highest in the Ae. tauschii lineage and lowest in the rice lineage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The high rate of gene space evolution in the Ae. tauschii lineage accounts for the fact that, contrary to the expectations, the level of synteny between the phylogenetically more related Ae. tauschii and B. distachyon genomes is similar to the level of synteny between the Ae. tauschii genome and the genomes of the less related rice and sorghum. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of the Oryza sativa (rice), Sorghum bicolor (sorghum), Zea mays (maize), and Brachypodium distachyon genomes has generated a wealth of information about the structure and evolution of genomes in the grass family (International Rice Genome Sequencing Project 2005; Paterson et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>2009; Schnable et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>2009; Vogel et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, because the current technologies do not allow the assembly of large and complex plant genomes sequenced with a shotgun approach, our knowledge of grass genome structure and evolution is based on relatively small genomes of similar sizes; the B. distachyon genome is 272 Mb (Luo et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>2009; Vogel et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>2010), the rice genome is 389 Mb (International Rice Genome Sequencing Project 2005), and the sorghum genome is 730 Mb (Paterson et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The maize genome, although 2.3 Gb (Schnable et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>2009), is paleotetraploid (Gaut and Doebley 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Maize polyploidization is estimated to have occurred more than 4.8 Ma (Swigonova et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In the past 3 My, the maize genome expanded by the addition of large quantities of long terminal repeat retroelements (SanMiguel and Bennetzen 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The size of the diploid genome ancestral to that of modern paleotetraploid maize was therefore probably similar to that of sorghum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Numerous lineages in the Poaceae family have genome sizes that are much larger than those currently sequenced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>For example, the genomes of diploid species in the tribe Triticeae, which includes economically important cereals such as wheat, barley, and rye, range from 3.4 to 8.8 Gb (1C) (Vogel et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>1999; Jakob et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>No genome in this size range has been sequenced, and little is therefore known about the structure and evolution of these genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Because biological phenomena often become apparent in comparisons of extremes, comparative analyses of the structure and evolution of the currently sequenced genomes with those of large genomes, such as those in the tribe Triticeae, may provide new insights into grass and plant genome biology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>One of the unresolved biological dilemmas is the significance of genome size variation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In grasses, for instance, genome sizes vary by more than one order of magnitude. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>It is generally accepted that the principal cause of this variation is the accumulation of transposable elements (TEs) of which the most abundant are long terminal repeat retroelements (Bennetzen and Kellogg 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>An increase in TE numbers results in genome expansion, whereas their deletion by illegitimate recombination (recombination requiring little or no homology for genetic exchange) or unequal homologous recombination leads to genome contraction (Bennetzen and Kellogg 1997; Bennetzen 2005). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Genes in the larger grass genomes are often interspersed with TEs inserted into each other (SanMiguel et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>1996; Dubcovsky et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>2001; Wicker et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Insertions and deletions of TEs take place at an extraordinary rate in some grass genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The DNA in the immediate vicinity of genes thus can be in a highly dynamic state. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>In Triticeae genomes, for instance, virtually the entire intergenic space is replaced in 3â4 My (Dubcovsky and Dvorak 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>It seems unavoidable that a precipitous rate of sequence turnover in the immediate vicinity of genes would impact gene stability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>It was therefore hypothesized that large grass genomes are less stable than related small genomes and that the gene space (the totality of genes and gene-related DNA) of large and complex plant genomes is evolving faster than in the related small genomes (Luo et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The rate with which subchromosomal structural changes, which involve groups of genes, accumulate was shown to be nearly an order of magnitude faster in the Triticeae lineage than in the rice, sorghum, and B. distachyon lineages, including the internal branch of the grass phylogenetic tree immediately preceding the divergence of the Brachypodieae and Triticeae (Luo et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>2009; Vogel et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>One might therefore expect that the evolution of individual genes by deletions and duplications would also be accelerated in the Triticeae genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Regional sequence comparisons along wheat chromosome 3B with orthologous regions in other grass genomes have suggested that this may be the case (Choulet et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Numerous gene deletions and duplications and an overall increase in gene number were reported in chromosome 3B compared with orthologous regions in other grass genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Observations made on a single hexaploid wheat chromosome could potentially be confounded by factors, such as polyploidy, and genome- and chromosome-specific events (Akhunov, Akhunova, et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>2003; Dvorak and Akhunov 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Extending the comparative analyses to wheat diploid relatives is therefore needed to advance the understanding of the dynamics of gene space evolution in diploid grass genomes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we compared the patterns and rates of evolutionary events in the diploid Aegilops tauschii genome with those in the small rice, sorghum, and B. distachyon genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The genome size of Ae. tauschii was estimated to be 4,020 Mb (Arumuganathan and Earle 1991), which places it at the lower end of the genome-size spectrum in Triticeae. Aegilops tauschii was used previously in the study of the rates of structural changes in grasses (Luo et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>2009; Vogel et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>It is also the diploid source of the wheat D genome (Kihara 1944; McFadden and Sears 1946) and understanding its biology is important for advancing the biology of polyploid wheat. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Of the three small genomes, B. distachyon is phylogenetically most closely related to the tribe Triticeae, and its genome sequence has been anticipated to facilitate wheat structural and functional genomics (Vogel et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The comparison of the sequenced regions of hexaploid wheat chromosome 3B with orthologous regions in B. distachyon chromosome Bd2 and rice chromosome Os1 led to the conclusion that the synteny level between wheat and B. distachyon is about the same as between wheat and rice (Choulet et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>This observation is also reinvestigated here by employing genomic comparisons involving the diploid Ae. tauschii. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Synteny of nearly 10 Mb of Ae. tauschii genomic sequence, generated from nine contiguous and randomly selected regions across the genome, with orthologous regions in B. distachyon, rice, and sorghum was used here to reconstruct the gene content in these regions in the common ancestor of the BEP and PACCAD clades. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>The BEP clade includes the subfamilies Bambusoideae, Ehrhartoideae, and Pooideae (Barker et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>2001). Aegilops tauschii and B. distachyon belong to the subfamily Pooideae (Triticeae and Brachypodieae tribes, respectively), and rice belongs to the subfamily Ehrhartoideae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>The PACCAD clade is formed by the subfamilies Panicoideae, which includes sorghum and maize, Aristidoideae, Centhothecoideae, Chloridoideae, Arundinoideae, and Danthoideae (Barker et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>The estimated divergence ages for the Triticeae and Brachypodiaeae are 32â39 Ma (Bossolini et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>2007; Vogel et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>2010), for the Pooideae and Ehrhartoideae 40â54 Ma (Vogel et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>2010), and for the BEP and PACCAD clades 45â60 Ma (Vogel et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>The inferred ancestral gene content in the nine investigated genomic regions and the time in million years along the branches of the phylogenetic tree are used to estimate the rates of gene deletions and gene duplications in the Ae. tauschii, rice, sorghum, and B. distachyon lineages, in the branch that represents the common ancestor to the B. distachyon and Ae. tauschii lineages immediately before their divergence (referred to as internode 2), and in the branch that represents the ancestor to the Ehrhartoideae and Pooideae immediately before the split of those two lineages (referred to as internode 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>The rate estimates, in turn, are used to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the four genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>These numerical analyses show, for the first time, that gene duplication rates, the gene number in the genome, and overall genome size are intimately related in the grass family. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>The small rice genome, for example, often had a gene content that most closely resembled that of the grass ancestor, whereas the 2,500 Mb maize genome had more gene rearrangements (Bennetzen and Ma 2003; Ilic et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Genome studies in maize are complicated by the paleotetraploid origin of the maize genome, and the effects of genome size and relaxed purifying selection constraints on duplicated gene pairs are intertwined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Similar concerns may be raised about comparative studies using polyploid wheat, although wheat chromosomes have spent much shorter time at the polyploid level than maize chromosomes, and inferences on genome evolution made in wheat will be less affected by these confounding factors than those made in maize. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Our study is the first comparative analysis that includes comprehensive data on gene-space evolution in a large (4,020 Mb) diploid plant genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Of the 90 genes annotated in the 9.7 Mb of Ae. tauschii genomic sequence originating from nine different regions in four chromosomes, approximately two-thirds of the genes were present in their ancestral locations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>In the smaller genomes, the percentage of annotated genes with conserved ancestral positions varied from 88% in sorghum to 90% in B. distachyon and rice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>In Ae. tauschii, at least 27% of the annotated genes had been inserted into the studied genomic regions during the past 35.8 My. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>The number of insertions that occurred into the syntenic B. distachyon, rice, and sorghum regions during similar or longer time frames was significantly lower (5%, 3%, and 12.5%, respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>These superficial observations leave little doubt that gene space in smaller grass genomes is more stable than that in the large Ae. tauschii genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>This has already been shown for the rates of accumulation of structural chromosome changes (Luo et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>2009; Vogel et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>2010), which were shown here to correlate highly with the level of gene synteny erosion (determined by the k + m values). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>This correlation suggests that structural chromosome evolution by chromosome inversions and translocations, and gene space evolution by single gene duplications and deletions is coupled and may have common causes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>The quantification of gene duplication and gene deletion rates in the four terminal lineages and two internodes (fig. 2) provided insights into the mechanisms of grass genome evolution going far beyond these observations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Similar to the processes determining the size of an entire genome (Devos et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>2002; Ma and Bennetzen 2004), the size of a gene space results from two opposing processes, one removing genes from the genome and the other inserting them into the genome, principally by gene duplication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>The assumption that gene duplication is the driving force behind the insertions is supported by the fact that 70% of the insertions in rice, sorghum, and B. distachyon in our study were the result of either tandem duplications of ancestral genes already present in the region or of dispersed duplications of genes elsewhere in the genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>The computation of the gene deletion and gene duplication rates was based on the number of genes located in a 9.7 Mb sample of the Ae. tauschii genome, which is about 0.25% of the genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Similar percentages of the rice, B. distachyon, and sorghum genomes were used to estimate gene deletion and gene duplication rates for those genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>The rate estimates were then used to compute the total number of genes G(0)total that were present in the ancestral genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>For each node on the phylogenetic tree, two independent estimates were obtained (fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>In all cases, the independent estimates were within a narrow range, showing that our sampling and computations based on it were representative for the evolutionary lineages. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>The estimates of gene deletion rates among the four lineages over 52.5 My of evolution were similar, ranging from 1.7 Ã 10â3 to 3.9 Ã 10â3 per gene per My, although the absence of statistical differences should not be taken as meaning that there are no real differences among the lineages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>The deletion rate in the B. distachyon and Ae. tauschii lineages in the period following their divergence from a common ancestor is 4.8 Ã 10â3 and 2.1 Ã 10â3 per gene per My, respectively (table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>A deletion rate of 3.2 Ã 10â3 per gene per My for the Ae. tauschii and Triticum urartu lineages following their divergence 2.7 Ma estimated on the basis of analysis of 3,195 genes is also within this range (Dvorak and Akhunov 2005). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>A different situation was encountered for gene duplication rates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>The Ae. tauschii gene duplication rate of 6.8 Ã 10â3 per gene per My over the entire 52.5 My was significantly greater than gene duplication rates in the remaining three lineages (0.57â2.5 Ã 10â3 per gene per My) over the same time period. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>If we consider only the duplications that occurred in the Ae. tauschii and B. distachyon genomes after their divergence from a common ancestor, the difference in duplication rates becomes even more pronounced with k values in Ae. tauschii and B. distachyon being 9.1 Ã 10â3 and 1.4 Ã 10â3 per gene per My, respectively (table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>It should be noted that the gene duplication rate in Ae. tauschii is almost certainly higher than 9.1 Ã 10â3 because the region also contained 40 pseudogenes (ratio of pseudogenes/genes = 1/2.2), which originated through gene duplications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Smaller grass genomes, on the other hand, appear to contain fewer pseudogenes (pseudogene/gene ratio is â¤1/20) (Paterson et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>2009; Thibaud-Nissen et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>2009; Vogel et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>2010), which is consistent with a lower duplication rate in those genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>We did not include pseudogenes in our analysis because they had not been systematically annotated in the B. distachyon, rice, and sorghum genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the expansion of genome size in the Ae. tauschii lineage over the past 32â39 My was accompanied by an expansion of gene space. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>The overall genome size expansion in the Ae. tauschii lineage almost certainly reached the size characteristic of modern Triticeae genomes before the Triticeae radiation about 10 Ma because all Triticeae species have genomes larger than 3.3 Gb (Dvorak 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Genome size expansion during the radiation of the Triticeae was relatively minor, being equivalent to a factor of 2 at most (Dvorak 2009) rather than an order of magnitude that characterized the initial stages of evolution in the Triticeae lineage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Slowing down of the overall genome expansion in the recent past of the Triticeae lineage may have been paralleled by a leveling off of the gene duplication rate, which was estimated for interchromosomal gene duplications to be 2.9 Ã 10â3 per locus per My during the past 2.7 My (Dvorak and Akhunov 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Of the 25 duplicated genes in Ae. tauschii, 4 (16%) were tandem duplications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Even if the rate reported by Dvorak and Akhunov is increased by 16%, the duplication rate of 9.1 Ã 10â3 per gene per My observed here is still higher. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>An independent line of evidence suggesting an increase in gene number in the Triticeae evolutionary lineage comes from the wheat chromosome 3B study (Choulet et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Although no rate quantification was attempted in that study, the estimate of 41,000 genes for the B genome is indicative of genome size expansion given that the initial number of genes G(0)total in the gene space of the genome ancestral to the Triticeae and Brachypodieae, inferred from our analysis, was in the range 28,289â28,826. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>The larger number of genes estimated for the B genome might be due to the larger size of the B genome relative to the D genome. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>The estimates of G(0)total for B. distachyon and Ae. tauschii suggest that gene numbers remained more or less constant in the lineage until the divergence of the B. distachyon and Ae. tauschii lineages 35.8 Ma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>The common ancestor of the two lineages had about 28,558 genes (fig. 2 and table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>The gene number then increased by 7,813 genes (about 27%) to 36,371 genes in the Ae. tauschii lineage but contracted by 3,026 genes (about 11%) to 25,532 genes in the B. distachyon lineage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>The measure that appears to reflect gene space evolution most faithfully is the k/m ratio, which differs by an order of magnitude between these two Pooideae lineages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>The value of the k/m ratio in the four species analyzed is correlated to both gene space size and overall genome size. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="290" pm="?"><plain>What may cause these dramatic shifts in gene duplication and gene deletion rates that are seen during grass evolution? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>The logical culprits are TEs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>Variation in genome size among related diploid species is believed to be principally caused by the accumulation or loss of TEs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>Some TEs have been shown to propagate gene fragments during transposition (Kapitonov and Jurka 2001; Jiang et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>2004; Lai et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>2005), which may facilitate the evolution of new genes (Morgante et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>2005; Morgante 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>A closer look at the duplicated sequences propagated by MULEs or Helitrons, however, showed that most of them were pseudogenes (Juretic et al. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>2005; Morgante et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, there are examples of complete genes being transposed by TEs in Triticeae genomes and acquisition of novel exons and novel transcriptional regulation (Akhunov et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>Because the number of pseudogenes in an Ae. tauschii contig is correlated with the number of inserted genes into that contig, both gene categories likely result from the same duplication/insertion mechanism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>Repair of double-stranded DNA breaks introduced into DNA by the presence of some TEs (Wicker et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>2010) may be the actual common mechanism that accounts for the positive relationship between the number of duplicated genes and the overall genome size observed here. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>The fact that the magnitude of gene duplication rate and magnitude of gene deletion rate in individual grass lineages are not correlated suggests that different mechanisms govern the two processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>Studies in Arabidopsis, rice, and wheat have shown that DNA can be removed through both illegitimate recombination and unequal homologous recombination (Devos et al. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>Although those studies were carried out on the repeated DNA fraction, these mechanisms, in particular illegitimate recombination, can also lead to the removal of genes (Devos et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>Gene removal through illegitimate recombination is largely independent of the repeat content of a genome, and hence of genome size. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>2009), brings into question whether or not B. distachyon would be a better genomic model for Triticeae than rice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>In our study, nine genes were shared by Ae. tauschii and rice and were absent in B. distachyon, and five genes were shared by Ae. tauschii and B. distachyon and were absent in rice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>Overall, 60%, 64%, and 63% of the Ae. tauschii genes were in colinear positions in B. distachyon, rice, and sorghum, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>This level of colinearity is similar to that uncovered in a comparison of the Ae. tauschii linkage map with the sorghum, B. distachyon, and rice genome sequences in which approximately 64%, 65%, and 66% of the loci on the Ae. tauschii genetic map were colinear with genes along the sorghum, B. distachyon, and rice pseudomolecules, respectively (Luo et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>2009; Vogel et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>Hence, for comparative genomic applications in the Triticeae, B. distachyon and rice are about equally useful as models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>Our confirmation of the equivalent synteny involving four chromosomes of diploid Ae. tauschii with B. distachyon, rice, and sorghum of a similar observation made in wheat chromosome 3B (Choulet et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>2010) shows that this surprising fact is not caused by polyploidy or restricted to a single chromosome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>Because synteny is a function of gene deletion and gene duplication rates and because those rates are not constant but differ among and along lineages, the rate of synteny erosion is lineage dependent and corresponds poorly to phylogenetic distance. </plain></SENT>
