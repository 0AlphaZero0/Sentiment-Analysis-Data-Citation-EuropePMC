In this work we identify sRNAs in the Gram positive opportunistic pathogen <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>. We characterized 11 sRNAs by tiling microarray analysis, 5&#8242; and 3&#8242; RACE-PCR, and Northern blot analysis. Six sRNAs were specifically expressed at exponential phase, two sRNAs were observed at stationary phase, and three were detected during both phases. Searches of putative functions revealed that three of them (EFA0080_EFA0081 and EFB0062_EFB0063 on pTF1 and pTF2 plasmids, respectively, and EF0408_EF04092 located on the chromosome) are similar to antisense RNA involved in plasmid addiction modules. Moreover, EF1097_EF1098 shares strong homologies with tmRNA (bi-functional RNA acting as both a tRNA and an mRNA) and EF2205_EF2206 appears homologous to 4.5S RNA member of the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) ribonucleoprotein complex. In addition, proteomic analysis of the &#916;EF3314_EF3315 sRNA mutant suggests that it may be involved in the turnover of some abundant proteins. The expression patterns of these transcripts were evaluated by tiling array hybridizations performed with samples from cells grown under eleven different conditions some of which may be encountered during infection. Finally, distribution of these sRNAs among genome sequences of 54 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> strains was assessed. This is the first experimental genome-wide identification of sRNAs in <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and provides impetus to the understanding of gene regulation in this important human pathogen.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Some RNA molecules such as riboswitches, transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) and small non-cording RNAs (sRNAs) act usually as post-transcriptional regulators in bacteria <xref rid="pone.0023948-Waters1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. sRNAs have become increasingly recognized as an emerging class of gene expression regulators for cellular processes, stress response and virulence genes and their transcription is tightly regulated and induced by distinct environmental conditions <xref rid="pone.0023948-Repoila1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.

Using a threshold of intensity of ten fold the background level led to the identification of 12 putative sRNAs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0023948-t001">Table 1</xref>). No experimental evidence (neither sequence from RACE-PCR nor signal on Northern blot) was obtained for one of them (EF0940_EF0941). Since the IGR between EF0940 and EF0941 is only 51 bp in length, the corresponding probe putatively hybridized with the transcription product of EF0941. Thus, the candidate has been excluded from our study.
