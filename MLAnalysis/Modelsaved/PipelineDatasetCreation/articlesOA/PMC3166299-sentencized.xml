</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Some RNA molecules such as riboswitches, transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) and small non-cording RNAs (sRNAs) act usually as post-transcriptional regulators in bacteria [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>sRNAs have become increasingly recognized as an emerging class of gene expression regulators for cellular processes, stress response and virulence genes and their transcription is tightly regulated and induced by distinct environmental conditions [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Bacterial sRNAs found on chromosomes are typically 50–400 nucleotides in length and frequently encoded in intergenic regions (IGRs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>They may bind to the imperfect complementary sequence of the ribosome binding region of the target mRNA, which is often encoded at separate loci, thus inhibiting 30S ribosomal subunit association and translational initiation [1], [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In some Gram positive and Gram negative species such as Escherichia coli [4] and Listeria monocytogenes [5], the formation of sRNA-mRNA duplex requires the RNA chaperon protein Hfq [6], [7] leading to an increase of mRNA degradation by ribonucleases such as RNase E and RNase III [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Some sRNAs located in plasmids and phages act as antisense RNAs on cis-encoded mRNAs and mainly control replication initiation, conjugation efficiency and transposition [8], [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In addition, plasmid-encoded sRNAs, called hak/sok system of E. coli plasmid R1 [10] and par system of Enterococcus faecalis pAD1 [11], stabilize their host plasmids by programming for death any cell that loses the plasmid [9], [12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In recent years, several bioinformatic approaches have been performed to identify putative sRNAs in bacterial genomes including E. coli, L. monocytogenes, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and identified more than 200 sRNAs [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Recently, Livny et al. predicted in silico over 45,000 sRNA candidates from 932 bacterial genomes [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In parallel, different experimental strategies including cDNA sequencing, shotgun cloning and isolation from RNA-protein complex have been performed and sometimes lead to the discovery of new transcripts [15], [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Tiling microarrays are powerful approaches to identify sRNAs on a genome-wide scale. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Thus large numbers of sRNA candidates have been found in Caulobacter crescentus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, and L. monocytogenes genomes [17], [18], [19], [20]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>E. faecalis is a human commensal Gram-positive bacteria as well as one of the leading causes of hospital acquired infections in United States and Europe [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The first whole genome sequence of E. faecalis V583 strain (the first vancomycin resistant enterococci identified in U.S.A.) was determined in 2003 and 53 more sequences are now publically available [22]. In silico study performed by Livny et al. led to the prediction and annotation of 17 putative sRNA-encoding loci in E. faecalis [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, in comparison with E. coli and B. subtilis, the number of predicted sRNAs in V583 is roughly 10-fold lower, suggesting that this number is likely under-estimated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Recently, 45 sRNAs and 10 putative mRNAs have been identified in E. faecalis using in silico prediction combined with “5′tag-RACE” [23]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In this work, we developed custom-made tiling microarrays containing only IGRs of E. faecalis V583 chromosome and plasmids, and first performed hybridization with RNA extracted from exponential and stationary-phase cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three statistically significant positive signals were detected and the 12 putative sRNAs most highly expressed were selected for further characterization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Transcription of these candidates under several stress conditions was then analyzed. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Such systems play a crucial role in plasmid stability by killing any daughter cells that fail to inherit a copy of the plasmid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Three putative sRNAs identified in our study (EFA0080_EFA0081 in pTEF1, EFB0062_EFB0063 in pTEF2, and EF0408_EF0409 in the chromosome) corresponded to the RNAI components of the TA systems already identified in E. faecalis V583 by Weaver and coworkers [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>As shown in Figure 1 (C, E, J), RNA I (including fst toxin gene) and RNA II homologues had two direct repeat sequences and shared the same bidirectional terminator. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Several studies revealed various roles such as in mobile element stability or stress response [12], [33], [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>As pointed out, in the case of par EF0409 (including EF0408_EF0409 sRNA), its association with genes encoding phosphotransferase components homologous to a mannitol transport system suggests a potential function in nutritional uptake [11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Northern blot and tiling microarray showed that EF1097_EF1098 was expressed in both growth and stationary phases and we were able to determine the exact sequence of this sRNA (Figure 1G). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>EF1097_EF1098 corresponds to E. faecalis tmRNA (ssrA) that is a unique bi-functional RNA acting as both a tRNA and an mRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>It functions as the rescue system of ribosomes stalled on aberrant mRNAs and adds a peptide tag to nascent polypeptides for directed proteolysis (named trans-translation) [35], [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>tmRNA is universally conserved and is one of the most abundant RNA in the cells [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>It has not only an important role in mRNA turnover but also likely in monitoring protein folding (for review see [35]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Mutations that inactivate tmRNA are lethal for some species (ie, Neisseria gonnorhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, Shigella flexneri) or, for others, affect bacterial physiology such as virulence (ie, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis) or stress response (ie, E. coli, B. subtilis) [35], [37]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>We found that EF2205_EF2206 sRNA matched with the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) functional category. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>SRP is a ribonucleoprotein complex that targets proteins for secretion through co-translational process and is composed of protein Ffh and 4.5S RNA in prokaryotes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Our analysis revealed that EF_1700 gene (ffh) product and EF2205_EF2206 correspond to the two components of the SRP in E. faecalis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that mutation of the gene encoding 4.5S RNA in S. pyogenes (phylogenetically related to E. faecalis) results in reduction of virulence [38]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>In order to predict target genes of the other sRNAs identified in this study, we performed in silico analysis (Table 2, Table S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Two different softwares were used for a more precise identification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>sRNATarget server is based on the Naive Bayes probabilistic method and take RNA secondary structure profile as the feature [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>The second, IntaRNA, predicts interactions between two RNA molecules, and the scoring is based on hybridization free energy and accessibility of the interaction sites in both molecules [29]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Dps is a protein involved in the protection of DNA against oxidative stress and Gls24 corresponds to a general stress protein that is a virulence factor in E. faecalis [42], [43], [44]. </plain></SENT>
