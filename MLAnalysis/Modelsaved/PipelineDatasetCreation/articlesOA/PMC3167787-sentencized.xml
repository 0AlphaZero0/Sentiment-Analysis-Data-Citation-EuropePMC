</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease with a complex ecology and epidemiology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>It has three main clinical forms of which visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is the most severe, as it is fatal if untreated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>It is caused by a protist parasite, Leishmania spp., and is transmitted to humans by phlebotomine sandflies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The best method to interrupt any vector-borne disease is to reduce man-vector contact. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Vector-targeted strategies are particularly attractive because the vectorial capacity to transmit infectious diseases to humans is proportional to vector density and, in an exponential way, to vector survival. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Biological control is an effective means of reducing or mitigating pests through the use of natural enemies and is more environmentally friendly than traditional insecticide treatments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, there is very scanty information on the biological control of sandflies and their potential control agents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In this context, a detailed knowledge of the microorganisms that are associated with these vectors would aid in the development of novel strategies for controlling them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>This is the first study to survey the taxa associated with leishmaniasis vectors and, more importantly, with any infectious disease vector, using an unbiased and high-throughput approach. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne neglected infectious disease of worldwide incidence and its most severe clinical form is visceral leishmaniasis (VL). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Each year VL causes an estimated 500,000 new cases and more than 59,000 deaths [1], a death toll that is only surpassed by malaria among the parasitic diseases [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, both figures are approximations since VL is frequently not recognized or not reported [3]–[4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Leishmaniasis is transmitted through the bite of two phlebotomine sandfly genera, Phlebotomus in the Old World and Lutzomyia in the New World. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In Latin America VL is caused by Leishmania infantum chagasi and transmitted by Lutzomyia longipalpis [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>This phlebotomine sandfly is only found in the New World, with a wide distribution from Mexico to Argentina [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The geographical distribution of leishmaniasis has undoubtedly expanded and is now being reported in areas that were previously non-endemic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The worldwide phenomenon of urbanisation, closely related to the sharp increase in migration, is one of the major risk factors that is making leishmaniasis a growing public health concern for many countries around the world [7] and Argentina is not an exception. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Between 1925 and 1989 only 14 leishmaniasis human cases were reported in Argentina and none was attributed to Le. chagasi. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there were only two isolated reports of Lu. longipalpis (in 1953 and 2000) which were not associated with VL [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, this situation has changed dramatically, mostly due to an indiscriminate advance of urbanisation, and the first Argentine VL outbreak was recently reported [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>From 2006 to date the morbidity and mortality toll of this disease have amounted to 83 human cases (35% corresponding to children under ten years of age), 7 deaths and more than 7,000 infected dogs (National Health Surveillance System, Epidemiology Bureau, National Ministry of Health, Argentina). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>In the natural environment, phlebotomine larvae feed on organic matter from soil [10], while adults from both sexes feed on sugars from plant sources [11]–[12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Only female adults need blood to obtain necessary proteins for the development of their eggs [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>It is widely accepted that many insects derive their microbiota from the surrounding environment, such as the phylloplane of food plants or the skin of the animal host, and although the degree of persistence of strains of the ingested species is unknown, these microorganisms can influence the insect life cycle [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>To comprehensively understand the biology of insects, microorganisms must be considered as a very important component of the ecological system [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Moreover, an inventory of the associated microbiota of phlebotomine sandflies, especially of wild specimens, would aid in understanding the annual and regional variations recorded for this disease [15] and in the development of novel strategies for controlling these vectors, among others [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>One serious obstacle for the biological control of VL sandfly vectors is that their precise breeding sites are poorly known. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, its practical application seems to be limited to the adult VL vector stage [16] because, as Lu. longipalpis larvae appear to be thinly dispersed [17], this complicates the employment of biolarvicides in the field. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>There is scanty information on the microbial colonisation of Lu. longipalpis and it is not yet clear if they possess an indigenous community. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Previously, midgut bacteria were examined from wild and laboratory reared Lu. longipalpis populations [18]–[20] which showed a predominance of Gram negative bacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Various genera found ubiquitously in the environment (water, soil and debris) were identified in these studies, including Acinetobacter, Serratia, Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Flavimonas and Enterobacter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>These bacteria have also been found associated with the gut of several other insects [21]–[24], suggesting they are a part of the natural or transient microbiota. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Prior studies on guts and malpighian tubes from wild P. papatasi and P. tobbi showed a high incidence of mycoses which were similar to Aspergillus sclerotiorum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Various types of virus have also been found infecting phlebotomine sandflies [26], including Vesiculovirus [27]–[28] and Cytoplasmic Polyhedrosis Virus [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in addition to Leishmania, Trypanosoma, Endotrypanum and possibly other trypanosomatids [30], neotropical sandflies may harbour other parasites including microsporidians [31]–[32], gregarines [33]–[36], some Plasmodium spp. that parasitise lizards [37] and nematodes [38]–[41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, there is little information on the pathological effects these parasites may produce in their sandfly hosts. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Metagenomics facilitates the culture-independent analysis of microbial communities [42], an approach which does not require prior assumptions about the composition of the target community. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Metagenomic sequencing of communities containing eukaryotes, in particular protists, is mostly cost-prohibitive because of their enormous genome sizes and low gene coding densities [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, from an ecological perspective, excluding eukaryotes from a metagenomic analysis compromises the ability to assess the microbial community in its entirety. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>A possible approach to bypass the problem of large amounts of non-coding eukaryotic sequence data consists in obtaining molecular data at the RNA level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Given the recent VL outbreak in Argentina and with the ultimate goal of identifying possible biological control agents, this study used unbiased high-throughput pyrosequencing technology [44] to compare the diversity of the taxonomic groups associated with wild male and female adult Lu. longipalpis from endemic (Posadas, Misiones) and non-endemic (Lapinha Cave, Minas Gerais) VL locations in Argentina and Brazil, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>As in this study phlebotomine sandflies were considered environmental samples, the term “associated with” was used here in its broadest sense, referring to a wide variety of possible interactions ranging from casual associations due to random environmental contact (e.g., plant pathogenic fungi spores adhering to the hairy surface of the sandflies when sugar-feeding on plants) to closer pathogenic or symbiotic interactions (e.g., protists that parasitise phlebotomines or permanent gut microbiota, respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>This analysis revealed the presence of sequences from bacteria, fungi, protists, plants and metazoans. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>This is the first study to survey taxa associated with an infectious disease vector applying an unbiased and comprehensive metagenomic approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>To ensure an unbiased description of the microbial community, the rationale chosen for this study included the extraction of total RNA and sequence-independent amplification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Total RNA was extracted from wild adult male and female Lu. longipalpis from an endemic (Posadas, Misiones) and a non-endemic (Lapinha Cave, Minas Gerais) VL location in Argentina and Brazil, respectively, and submitted to high-throughput pyrosequencing [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Given the high background level of vector sequences (∼85%), this approach proved to be very sensitive since it enabled the identification of taxa present in percentages up to 0.00036%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Moreover, as the different taxa were identified by homology to both rRNA and mRNA, the chosen approach was adequate for the objectives of this study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>The bacterial community identified in females from both locations and in NEVL males was distinct in every case. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>The only results in common with previous studies of gut microbiota from wild and laboratory reared female Lu. longipalpis and laboratory reared female P. duboscqi [18]–[20], [55], included the prevalence of Gram negative bacteria and the identification of A. baumanni, which in this study was found in NEVL males. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Although previous reports established an essential basis for phlebotomine gut microbiota current knowledge, in these studies bacteria were identified using standard bacteriological methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Consequently, those descriptions did not consider the remaining 99% of unculturable environmental microbes [56]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Hence the differences with this study, which applied a culture independent unbiased high-throughput approach that bypassed cloning of environmental DNA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Interestingly and in accordance with results from this study, in previous reports the proportion of bacteria isolated from wild dipterans has been low. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Studies on the midgut microbiota of wild mosquitoes, isolated bacteria from less than 50% of the specimens and the numbers of bacteria varied between individuals [57]–[58]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>In a more recent study which used culture dependent and independent screening of field-collected Anopheles, bacteria were found in 15% of the mosquitoes, few of the mosquitoes harboured more than one bacterial species and only one species was found in more than one mosquito [23]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Only one bacterial type was found in EVL females (SS1), which corresponded to an unculturable bacterium originally isolated from cow faeces (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a sequence match against RDP [52] indicated high similarity with Alistipes sp., a Gram negative anaerobic bacteria found in human faeces (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Five bacterial species were found in NEVL females (PP1), four of which were Gram positive (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Of these species, R. pickettii, A. flavithermus, G. kaustophilus and S. coelicolor, were originally isolated from contaminated lake sediment, waste water [59], deep-sea sediment [60] and soil [61], respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, A. flavithermus and G. kaustophilus are thermophilic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Even though R. pickettii 12D was originally isolated from contaminated lake sediment, it is a ubiquitous microorganism found in water and soil [62] and is emerging as an opportunistic pathogen found in a wide variety of clinical samples [63]. P. acnes [64] is a universal inhabitant of human skin and is found at high population densities on the fat-rich areas of the face, scalp and upper trunk [65]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Four bacterial types were found in NEVL males (PP2), 50% of which were Gram negative (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>One of these bacterial types was the multidrug-resistant A. baumannii [66], which is recovered from natural environments and has emerged as an important opportunistic pathogen worldwide [67]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Another of the bacterial types corresponded to uncultured Veillonella sp. isolated from human skin [68]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>The other two bacteria were uncultured bacterial types originally recovered from environmental samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>In one case, BLASTN analysis indicated homology both to an uncultured bacterium from a water sample (Atlantic Ocean) and to Leifsonia xyli, a sugar-cane pathogen [69]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>The other bacterial sequence corresponded to a proteobacterium clone isolated from wetland soil [70]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>In summary, bacteria identified in this study are ubiquitous in the diverse environments these sandflies frequent (faeces, soil, water, sediment, plants, human skin) and which were present in both sampling sites (Figure 1, Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Hence, possibly they were indicative of the behavioural patterns and feeding habits of these sandflies and are probably part of their transient microbiota. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>However, more in depth research is required to determine these interactions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Four different species of fungi were found in NEVL Lu. longipalpis (PP2 and PP1), which differed between males and females (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>In previous reports for P. papatasi and P. tobbi, mycoses with a high incidence rate were found in the guts and malpighian tubes of wild specimens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Similar fungi cultured from guts of laboratory reared P. papatasi were identified as A. sclerotiorum and S. cerevisiae [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Microsporidians, which are highly pathogenic for some insects [71], have also been found parasitising neotropical sandflies [32], [72]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>The two species identified in this study in NEVL females were P. conglomerata [73], a plant pathogen (mildew), and C. bertholletiae [74], a common soil fungus and a rare cause of zygomycosis in humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the species found in NEVL males were M. verticillata [75], a genus commonly found in soil and a zygomycete which also causes zygomycosis in animals, and T. irritans [76], which belongs to a genus of foliar pathogens [77]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Given the very high vegetation density in the Lapinha Cave area (Figure 1, Table 1), a possible scenario is that plant pathogenic spores adhered to the sandflies' hairy surface during sugar-feeding on infected plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>This suggested Lu. longipalpis has a putative capacity of casual dispersal of plant pathogens, among others (see below). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, fungi identified in this study are found ubiquitously in the environments frequented by sandflies (plants and soil), which were abundant in the sampling site (Lapinha Cave), and so were probably indicative of their sugar-feeding habits and behavioural patterns. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Protist sequences were only found in EVL male and female specimens, of which the vast majority were found in males (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Nearly 90% of the identified apicomplexans corresponded to coccidians (genera Cryptosporidium, Eimeria, Sarcocystis and Besnoitia, 88.7%) and the rest to gregarines (genera Ascogregarina and Psychodiella, 7%) and haemosporidians (Plasmodium spp., 4.3%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>The absence of leishmanial sequences was not unexpected considering the rate of infection of sandflies with Leishmania is generally very low (0.01–1%) [78], even in endemic areas [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Gregarines have been reported in over 20 species of sandflies and Ascogregarina spp. have only been described in mosquitoes [79]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Given A. taiwanensis sequences were found in EVL males in this study, this could indicate that the parasite also infects Lu. longipalpis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Genus Psychodiella comprises 3 species with host specificity to phlebotomine sandflies: P. chagasi, P. saraviae and P. mackiei [35], [79]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>In the New World, only P. chagasi and P. saraviae have been found parasitising Lutzomyia spp. and P. chagasi seems to infect a large range of neotropical species [33]–[36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>In this study, P. chagasi sequences were found in EVL males. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>The exact pathology caused by gregarines is unknown, but in Lu. longipalpis the parasite can reduce longevity and egg production and the level of parasitaemia can reach over 80% in laboratory colonies [80]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Notwithstanding, the use of P. chagasi as a control method in the field has not been considered efficient because the parasite seems to have a limited range and a minimal effect on sandfly biology under natural conditions [81]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>The fact that in this study P. chagasi was found in randomly caught wild specimens, suggested it could be a more efficient control method under natural conditions than what was previously reported. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>The free-living oocyst stage of coccidians is discharged by infected animals through their faeces. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Sandflies are found around human habitations and breed in specific organic wastes, exploiting the accumulation of organic matter produced by domestic animals and poor sanitary conditions such as faeces, manure, rodent burrows and leaf litter [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Since the EVL sampling site (Posadas) was a worst case-scenario homestead which included dense vegetation, various domestic animals and abundant organic matter (Figure 1, Table 1), this could account for the presence of these parasites in EVL males and females. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, female sandflies suck blood from different animal species including humans, bovines, pigs, equines, dogs, opossums, birds, various rodents and reptiles [5], [82] and, additionally, some Plasmodium spp. that parasitise lizards have been found in sandflies [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>In the field it is common to see lek-like aggregations of males and females assembled on or near hosts where blood feeding and mating occur [83]–[84]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>This behaviour could account for the presence of haemosporidian sequences (blood borne parasites) in EVL males. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, as these sequences were found only in males, this suggested males, and not females, would be the primary source of Plasmodium spp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, P. falciparum was recently identified by PCR in faecal samples from gorillas [85] and considering the EVL sampling site had a significant amount of organic matter (Figure 1, Table 1), it is highly feasible that males acquired these microorganisms from human faeces. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, EVL males could have acquired these microorganisms by contact with other vectors bearing P. falciparum (i.e., Anopheles spp.) during transportation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>In any case, these results suggest that, due to their behavioural patterns, Lu. longipalpis could be implicated in the casual dispersal of parasites of medical and veterinary importance. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Human sequences were found in males and females from both locations, whereas chicken sequences were found in NEVL females and EVL males and lizard sequences were only found in NEVL females (Figures 1 and 2). Lu. longipalpis is ubiquitous in dwellings where sanitary conditions are poor and domestic animals, such as dogs, chickens and pigs, are kept in and around the houses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>In this kind of environment, the sandfly tends to congregate at outdoor sites, including animal sheds, where leks easily form on abundant, stationary hosts [7], [84]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>In this context, as previously mentioned, the EVL location (Posadas) was a worst case-scenario homestead that kept dogs, chickens and a cat, had dense vegetation and a nearby spring (Figure 1, Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>In the NEVL location (Lapinha Cave), a chicken was kept to attract sandflies and as a source of food (Figure 1, Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 35 species of lizards can be found in the Minas Gerais region [86]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>As female sandflies blood feed on different animal species such as birds, reptiles and humans [5], [82], the presence of these sequences in females was not unexpected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Contrariwise, it was unexpected to find human and chicken sequences associated with males. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, this could be due to their previously mentioned behavioural patterns of aggregation and courtship, where male sandflies are often seen over the host where they form leks, attracting females for a blood meal and increasing their chance for mating [83]–[84]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, the trap itself was another area of close contact between male and female sandflies and with other potential vectors of medical importance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Consequently, males could have acquired these sequences by contact during transportation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>A total of ten different plant species were identified in males and females from both locations. Capsicum annuum (bell pepper), Elaeis guineensis (African oil palm) and Solanum tuberosum (potato) were identified in three of the four Lu. longipalpis samples. Juglans hindsii (Northern California walnut) was found in both EVL samples and Artemisia annua (sweet wormwood) was found in both male samples. Rhapidophyllum hystrix (needle palm) and Brassica napus (rapeseed) were only found in EVL females and Vitis vinifera (grapevine) was only found in EVL males. Oryza sativa (rice) and Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) were only found in NEVL females and males, respectively (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>As adults from both sexes feed on sugars from different plant sources [12], this diversity could be indicative of the different feeding preferences and/or food source availability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Moreover, as sugar meals are not composed primarily by cells, plant RNA could also have originated from other sources. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Namely, pollen dispersed by wind could have adhered to the sandflies' hairy surface or, alternatively, these vectors could be casual pollinators during sugar-feeding. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>For a more comprehensive understanding of these results, a few limitations of the chosen approach should be considered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>In the first place, homology searches are circumscribed to the number and quality of sequences in the databases at the time of analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>The relatively high number of sequences which showed no significant hits (∼14%) was a clear indication of this. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>Moreover, if the query corresponds to a given organism that has not yet been sequenced, the hit will probably coincide with the most related organism found in the database. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Notwithstanding and given this situation, the results from the homology search will provide a close approximation to the real case-scenario. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>Another aspect is that, similarly to a previous study [48] and in order to obtain as much environmental data as possible, specimens were neither surface cleaned nor dissected to extract their guts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>As they were not surface cleaned, some (or all) of the identified taxa could have been surface contaminants, acquired during transportation by contact with other captured species, i.e. hymenopterans, lepidopterans and mosquitoes, or during manipulation in the lab. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>In the latter case, even though samples were manipulated with extreme care, this was still a potential source of contamination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, if contamination occurred during manipulation, it was plausible to expect the same contaminating species in males and females from the same location (when specimens were identified and separated according to sex) or from both locations (when total RNA was extracted). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>The only species present in all four samples was Homo sapiens and, consequently, contamination during manipulation was a possibility for these reads. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Notwithstanding, as some biological control agents act by surface contact, such as Beauveria bassiana [39], [87], and since the ultimate goal of this study was to identify possible biological control agents for this neglected infectious disease vector, had the specimens been surface cleaned, this information could have been lost together with other valuable environmental data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, as the gut was not separated from the rest of the specimen and, consequently, they were not analysed independently, it was not possible to classify the observed taxa in putative surface contaminants and gut inhabitants, among others. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the possible role of putative permanent gut residents could not be inferred, such as influence on the insect development cycle or on the parasite transmission ability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, even a careful extraction process would not preclude the possibility of cross-contamination between the gut and the rest of the specimen and/or loss of information. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>In this sense, the chosen approach ensured that no data was lost and, notwithstanding the aforementioned limitations, enabled the identification of taxa that could putatively influence sandfly development and which have become the target of ongoing studies to determine their significance and location in the sandfly. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Finally, the diversity of bacterial, fungal, protist, plant and metazoan sequences found in this study in wild adult Lu. longipalpis from endemic and non-endemic locations, mostly confirmed their feeding habits and behavioural patterns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, it also suggested that these vectors could possibly be a chance source of dispersal of various animal and plant diseases, such as coccidiosis and malaria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>This is particularly significant since the geographical distribution of this vector is undoubtedly expanding [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>The fact that RNA was obtained from these animal and plant pathogens would indicate that they were biologically active, but this cannot be determined with the present results and further studies must be performed to establish the significance of these findings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>The identification of gregarines in wild Lu. longipalpis specimens could indicate that these parasites are a more efficient control method under natural conditions than what was previously suggested [81]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>This is specially meaningful as studies on biological control of phlebotomines are still scarce and its practical application seems to be limited to the adult VL vector stage [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>The employment of biolarvicides in the field is difficult due to the diversity of habitats in which this vector can reproduce and evidence that Lu. longipalpis larvae appear to be thinly dispersed and not concentrated in any particular microhabitat [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, as the number of samples analysed in this study was limited, a greater number of specimens must be studied to establish the significance of these results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Current studies are underway to analyse the presence and establish the significance of the taxa found in this study in a greater number of adult male and female Lu. longipalpis samples from endemic and non-endemic locations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>A particular emphasis is being given to those taxa implicated in the biological control of this vector and to the etiologic agents of animal and plant diseases. </plain></SENT>
