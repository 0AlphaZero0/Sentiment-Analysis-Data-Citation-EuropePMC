<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Several types of H1N1 vaccines have been tested including various dosages and adjuvants, and meta-analysis is needed to identify the best formulation. </plain></SENT>
</text></SecTag></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and nine clinical trial registries to April 2011, in any language for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on healthy children, adolescents, adults and the elderly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome was the seroconversion rate according to hemagglutinination-inhibition (HI); secondary outcomes were adverse events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For the primary outcome, we used head-to-head meta-analysis and multiple-treatments meta-analysis. </plain></SENT>
</text></SecTag></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Eighteen RCTs could be included in all primary analyses, for a total of 76 arms (16,725 subjects). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>After 2 doses, all 2009 H1N1 split/subunit inactivated vaccines were highly immunogenic and overcome CPMP seroconversion criteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>After 1 dose only, all split/subunit vaccines induced a satisfactory immunogenicity (&gt; = 70%) in adults and adolescents, while only some formulations showed acceptable results for children and elderly (non-adjuvanted at high-doses and oil-in-water adjuvanted vaccines). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Vaccines with oil-in-water adjuvants were more immunogenic than both nonadjuvanted and aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines at equal doses and their immunogenicity at doses &lt; = 6 µg (even with as little as 1.875 µg of hemagglutinin antigen) was not significantly lower than that achieved after higher doses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Finally, the rate of serious vaccine-related adverse events was low for all 2009 H1N1 vaccines (3 cases, resolved in 10 days, out of 22826 vaccinated subjects). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>According to WHO statistics, from April 2009 to August 2010 more than 214 countries reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza 2009 H1N1, with over 18,449 deaths [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Vaccination typically represents the major tool to reduce the morbidity, mortality and economic effects of influenza pandemics [2], [3], and extraordinary efforts were devoted to the development and administration of 2009 H1N1 vaccines worldwide [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Although the pandemic officially ended in August 2010 [5], the virus was detected in 13.4% of the specimens tested in USA during 2010–11 season [6], and WHO accordingly recommended that an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like virus be used for influenza vaccines in the 2010–11 season [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In fact, it is likely that the same virus will continue to cause epidemics and pandemics in future years. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Several studies have assessed the immunogenicity and safety of various formulations of 2009 H1N1 vaccine, comparing a wide variety of doses with or without different adjuvants [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Although no major harms were noted for any of the vaccine formulations, the immunogenicity varied and several issues remain about the relative merits of each formulation that are very difficult to address examining single trials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="?"><plain>Specifically, there are several outstanding questions: how do the seroconversion rates, at various ages, compare for diverse vaccine formulations? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="?"><plain>Which is the lowest dose inducing a satisfactory immunogenicity for adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted formulations? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="?"><plain>Does the second dose relevantly increase the immunogenicity of the various vaccine formulations (and in what ages)? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="?"><plain>Are adjuvanted 2009 H1N1 vaccines more immunogenic than non-adjuvanted vaccines at equal doses of hemagglutinin antigen (HA)? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="?"><plain>Among the adjuvants, is aluminum more/less immunogenic than other oil-in-water adjuvants (i.e. MF-59, AS03) at equal dosages? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>To help answer these questions, we performed a meta-analysis of all clinical trials on H1N1 vaccines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>We used both traditional meta-analysis and multiple treatment meta-analysis (MTM) [40], [41] to combine data across a large number of diverse comparisons of different formulations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>We also systematically reviewed the available evidence on the relative safety and harms of different vaccine formulations. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><sec id="s2a"><title><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Research in Context: Search Strategy and Quality Assessment </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Trials evaluating influenza 2009 H1N1 vaccine safety and immunogenicity in healthy humans that were not previously vaccinated with 2009 H1N1 vaccines were retrieved through a search in MEDLINE (limited to publications after the year 2008); EMBASE; and several clinical trial registries (Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trial Register, ISRCTN, US ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, GSK Clinical Study Register, and Indian, Australian New Zealand and Chinese Clinical Trial Registries), with no language restriction (last update April 1, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Search terms were “influenza”, “vaccine OR vaccines OR vaccination”, and “H1N1 or pandemic” in all fields. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The bibliographies of all relevant articles including reviews were reviewed for further references. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>We aimed to identify both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as well as studies where a single vaccine formulation was tested or individuals were non-randomly allocated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Only the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were used in the primary analyses (see below). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>When it was not possible to extract some outcomes from a study, the corresponding author was contacted. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Data extraction and quality assessment were made independently by two reviewers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>We assessed aspects of the reported methodological quality of each RCT pertaining to randomization (generation of allocation sequences and concealment of allocation), blinding, and adequacy of analyses (including dropouts/withdrawals) [42]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title><text><SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Primary Outcome: Immunogenicity </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Typical outcomes for the evaluation of influenza vaccine immunogenicity are seroconversion (the proportion of subjects with a pre-vaccination hemagglutinination-inhibition – HI – antibody titer &lt; = 1∶10 and a 3–4 week post-vaccination titer &gt; = 1∶40, or a pre-vaccination titer &gt; = 1∶10 and an increase in the titer by a factor of four or more after vaccination), and seroresponse/seroprotection (the proportion of subjects with post-vaccination HI titers &gt; =  1∶40) [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>When both seroconversion and seroresponse data were available in a study, only seroconversion data were used, as they may be less sensitive to baseline status (seroresponse rates also include subjects with pre-vaccination immunity to H1N1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Importantly, immunogenicity is considered a good surrogate of the truly important clinical outcome of clinical protection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>It is has been observed that seroconversion with a title of 1∶40 corresponds to 50% clinical protection and a meta-analysis shows that there is a relationship between the exact titre and the proportion of clinical protection [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>However, we did not have sufficient data to examine separate titre thresholds in this meta-analysis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title><text><SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Secondary Outcomes: Harms </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>We considered the main adverse events (AEs) recorded in the setting of influenza immunization: fever, any systemic reaction, injection-site pain and any local reaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>AEs are usually self-reported during the first 7–10 days after vaccination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>When a study reported data on harms at further time intervals, only the data regarding the first 7–10 days were used to ensure comparability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>AEs definition was not always fully standardized and similar across trials: in case of multiple definitions, we used the one closer to the guidelines proposed by the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>We separately recorded serious events (life-threatening events, or events resulting in persistent disability, hospitalization or death). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Since many studies reported mild and moderate adverse events together, these were analyzed as a single group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>We extracted separately the adverse event rates after the first and second dose. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>For the computation of the AE rate after both doses, if a study only provided data separately by dose, we extracted the highest event rate [43]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title><text><SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Data Analysis </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The main analyses for the primary outcome used only data from the RCTs and combination of the data respected the randomization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>First, we performed random-effect meta-analyses comparing the various formulations in head-to-head comparisons [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The following meta-analyses were made: higher versus immediately lower dose (overall and separately for 30 µg vs 15 µg, and 15 µg vs 7.5 µg) for non-adjuvanted vaccines; higher versus immediately lower dose (overall and separately for 15 µg vs 7.5 µg, and 7.5 µg vs 1.88–5.25 µg) for adjuvanted vaccines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Moreover, for 7.5 µg and 15 µg doses, we performed a comparative evaluation between non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted vaccines (overall, by age and by adjuvant type). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>The results were expressed with risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>The Mantel-Haenszel method (fixed-effects model) [47] was also for comparison with random effect calculations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Statistical heterogeneity was quantified using the I2 metric [48]; in case of limited data I2 metric 95% confidence intervals are typically large [49] and thus inferences on the magnitude of the statistical heterogeneity should be cautious. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Second, we synthesized the evidence from the entire network of comparisons of all treatments (including placebo) using Multiple-Treatments Meta-analysis [40], [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>The methodology combines direct and indirect estimates and fitted within a Bayesian framework estimates all relative effect sizes, their credibility intervals that can be used to rank the treatments [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>MTM has the advantage that it can incorporate the evidence from all comparisons of different treatments within a single analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>This allows a better appreciation of the relative merits of each treatment within a common analytical framework. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Moreover, for each comparison of two specific treatments, the available evidence is more than what is used in the simple head-to-head direct comparison meta-analysis, because we also gain information from how each treatment has performed against other treatments outside the pair of interest through indirect comparisons [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>An important assumption underlying the model is that evidence is consistent, i.e. direct and indirect evidence are in agreement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>The assumption of consistency can be tested by comparing the consistency and inconsistency models with respect to the trade-off between model fit and parsimony [53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>We used the odds ratio (OR) as the metric of choice for running the MTM calculations, since it is a symmetric measure and may tend to minimize heterogeneity when data are combined across diverse dosing regimens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>The posterior ORs have been translated also to risk differences (RDs) against a baseline dosing regimen (1.88–5.25 µg with non-aluminum adjuvants) so as to allow a more direct clinical interpretation of the data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>In the MTM framework, according to the available data we considered the following formulations as separate nodes in the network: placebo; doses 1.88–5.25 µg; 1.88–5.25 µg +Aluminum; 1.88–5.25 µg + other adjuvants; 7.5 µg, 7.5 µg + Aluminum; 7.5 µg + other adjuvants; 15 µg; 15 µg + Aluminum; 15 µg + other adjuvants (for dose one only); 21–30 µg; therefore having eleven different interventions to evaluate after one or single dose; ten after two doses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>For each of the harms outcomes, given the suboptimal standardization of definitions and missingness of data, inconsistency would be likely to occur, thus we did not perform any MTM calculations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>We only used meta-analysis of direct randomized comparisons. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>As sensitivity analysis, we also performed meta-analysis of proportions combining the data on single arms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>This sensitivity analysis has the advantage that it allowed also the inclusion of data from non-randomized studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Given that these analyses do not respect the randomization, even for data coming from RCTs, they should be seen with extra caution. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate the additional immunogenicity provided by two doses of vaccine as opposed to a single dose, all analyses were made twice: the first time including the results after one dose only; the second time containing the results after both doses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>To probe onto the benefits of two administrations vs one, we also performed additional proportion meta-analyses in which we summarized, for each formulation, the absolute percentages of subjects who achieved seroconversion/seroresponse only after the second dose. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>As an example, if a trial reported 70% of seroconversions after the first dose, and 80% after the second dose, the absolute percentage of subjects who benefited from the second dose was 10%. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>To try to investigate the potential role of methodological quality on summary estimates, we stratified studies into two classes: higher and lower risk of bias. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>A RCT was considered at lower risk of bias if the procedures of allocation concealment were appropriately reported, and at least one of the following processes was adequately described (and correctly made): random sequence generation and handling of dropouts/withdrawals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Blinding as well as other classifications were also considered but they were almost overlapping (most non blinded studies were also at higher risk of bias) and did not result in any substantial change in the analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>A non randomized trial was considered at lower risk of bias if the procedures to handle withdrawals and dropouts (and their numbers and reasons for) were correctly described. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>We only stratified proportion meta-analyses by quality because, due to the unavoidable age-stratification, especially in the most interesting comparison (adjuvanted versus non-adjuvanted vaccines), very few or even no lower risk of bias study could be found in each cell of the various head-to-head meta-analyses and into the multiple-treatment meta-analyses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Finally, direct comparison meta-analyses were stratified by age-class (children: from 6 months to 9 years; adolescents: from 10 to 17 years; adults: from 18 to 64 years; elderly: from 65 years). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>We performed the MTM computations considering data from all age-classes to avoid overfragmentation of the data in a complex network that has many nodes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>We used StatsDirect 2.7.8 (StatsDirect Ltd, Altrincham, UK, 2010), RevMan 5.0 (Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2008), and WinBUGS (WinBUGS User Manual Version 1.4.3. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Fourteen studies were single-arm (with respect to pandemic vaccines) or non-randomized trials and were thus included in proportion meta-analyses only [9], [13], [14], [16], [21], [22], [27], [31], [32], [34], [55], [57], [58]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>One of the above papers also reported data on a randomized clinical trial (RCT) [55], as did the remaining 19 papers, which reported the results of another 21 RCTs [8], [11], [12], [15], [17], [18], [19], [23], [24], [25], [26], [28], [29], [30], [33], [35], [37], [39], [54], [59], for a total of 22 RCTs. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Our analysis summarizes what we have learnt from trials on the immunogenicity and harms of 2009 H1N1 vaccines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>First, after two doses, all 2009 H1N1 split or subunit inactivated vaccines were highly immunogenic and overcome the seroconversion criteria set by both CPMP [45] and US FDA [60], with seroconversion rates below 70% in only three out of 69 evaluated trial arms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Second, after one dose only, all split or subunit inactivated vaccines were able to induce a satisfactory immunogenicity (&gt; = 70%) in adults and adolescents, while only some formulations showed acceptable results for children and elderly (non-adjuvanted at high-doses and oil-in-water adjuvanted vaccines). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Indeed, a second dose of vaccine did not seem to substantially increase the immunogenicity among adults and adolescents, but it may definitively be needed for children (especially if a low-dose non-adjuvanted vaccine is administered), and results remain controversial for the elderly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Third, vaccines with oil-in-water adjuvants were more immunogenic than both non-adjuvanted and aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines at equal doses (even at higher doses in many cases). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>In agreement with H5N1 Avian vaccines [43], 2009 H1N1 vaccines did not seem to obtain any benefit from the inclusion of aluminum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Fourth, higher doses were slightly more immunogenic in non-adjuvanted formulations, especially for the children and the elderly, for whom the lowest possible dose inducing a satisfactory immunogenicity after a single dose of vaccine was 15 µg. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>In contrast, for adjuvanted vaccines the seroresponse rate of doses lower than 6 µg (even with as little as 1.875 µg of HA) was not significantly lower than that achieved after higher doses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Finally, in agreement with large observational surveillance studies [61], [62], the rate of serious vaccine-related adverse events was low for all 2009 H1N1 vaccines (0.013% overall). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Theoretically, however, if we consider that over 1 billion subjects are to be vaccinated with 2009 H1N1 vaccines, such a rate would translate into 130,000 serious adverse events, which would need to be compared against the potential major benefits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, we recognize that only 22,826 subjects were included and that the length of follow up was typically short, thus this meta-analysis does not have enough power to draw a conclusion for vaccine safety at the population level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Such an issue requires further investigation from future cost-benefit analyses based upon the emerging large observational studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>As regards mild to moderate adverse reaction, these were clearly more (and very) frequent for oil-in-water adjuvanted vaccines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>It is worth noting, however, that the reporting of mild or moderate adverse events was lacking or suboptimal in many trials, and the results of such analyses must be interpreted with caution. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>The practical implications of all the above findings depend on what type of vaccine is required in a particular moment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Clearly, during the 2009 pandemic, dose-sparing strategies were crucial, as vaccine provision had to be as large and quick as possible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>In such a situation, vaccine including oil-in-water adjuvants may represent the best option, as they were able to induce the highest protection after a single, low dose of HA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>If vaccination is considered a life-saving intervention, their higher rate of mild or moderate local reactions could be regarded as a clinically acceptable decrease in tolerability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>In the current situation, however, in which 2009 H1N1 formulations have been added to trivalent seasonal vaccines [7], the need for the lowest possible dose may be lower, as opposed to tolerability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Therefore, also non-adjuvanted vaccines may represent a possible option, although a dose of over 20 µg would be preferable, even more for elderly and children. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Close to the end of this work, Yin et al. published a meta-analysis on the same topic [63]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>It is difficult to compare the results of the two meta-analyses because of several important differences: Yin et al. ended the search in October 2010 and could not include 9 RCTs [11], [23], [25], [28], [33], [37], [39], [54], [55] and 9 non-randomized trials [13], [14], [16], [20], [22], [32], [55], [57], [58] that were included in the present analysis; only proportion meta-analyses were carried out, excepted some head-to-head comparisons on adjuvanted vs non-adjuvanted vaccines (which, however, almost totally depended on two large trials with some overlapped data [19], [36]); no quantitative analyses were made on adverse events; finally and most importantly, data from randomized and non-randomized trials at different hemagglutinin dosages were grouped together, thus no indications on the dose to use were given. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Despite these differences, the authors reached similar conclusions regarding the effectiveness of different adjuvants. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>So far, we have considered subunit or split inactivated vaccines, which compose almost all of the formulations that have been approved by both FDA and EMA and distributed during the past seasons [64], [65]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>However, alternative formulations were also tested. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Two RCTs evaluated the immunogenicity of an adjuvanted, whole-virus, live-attenuated vaccine [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>The seroconversion rates, however, were not encouraging for both children and adults (&lt;30% after two doses). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Four RCTs compared whole-virus versus split-virion inactivated vaccines [19], [25], [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>In a meta-analysis, whole-virus vaccines showed no differences in immunogenicity after the first dose, while after the second dose they showed significantly lower rates of seroconversion (summary RR 1.39; 95% CI: 1.11–1.73 – data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>The comparison, however, was problematic, because the doses of the whole- and split-virus vaccines being compared were different in all trials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Also, non-adjuvanted whole-virus preparations were compared to adjuvanted split-virus vaccines, and vice versa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we cannot conclude on an inferior immunogenicity of whole-virus as compared to split-virus vaccines. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Some authors suggested that, at least for the children, previous (or simultaneous) vaccination with the seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine might decrease the antibody response to the 2009 H1N1 vaccines [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>This issue was evaluated in five other trials, but we could not perform a meta-analysis because of large differences in vaccine formulation (and study design) [14], [20], [25], [34], [55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>However, none of these trials found evidence that receipt of the seasonal vaccine decreases the likelihood of achieving immunogenic protection after H1N1 vaccination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Given that four of the above trials included adults only [20], [25], [34], [55], the impact of previous seasonal vaccination on H1N1 vaccine response is likely to be unsubstantial for subjects over 18 years of age, but uncertainty remains for the children. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Indeed, this is not a secondary issue and requires further consideration. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>As previously mentioned, we could not formally test the influence of quality on summary estimates using head-to-head meta-analyses, because of the few RCTs that were classified at higher risk of bias, and the already high number of required stratifications of the analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>However, we carried out proportion meta-analyses, which included also non-randomized trials, stratifying by quality (Table S12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Overall, it was not possible to note a clear trend, with studies at higher risk of bias showing sometimes higher sometimes lower summary estimates than trials at lower risk of bias (and most confidence intervals overlapping). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>However, we should caution that reported quality is only a surrogate of the true quality of a trial [66], and it is possible that some trials may thus have been misclassified in terms of their quality scores. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>In any case, also taking into account the pressure due to the pandemic, a higher quality of the reporting should be requested in the future. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Publication bias is a potential threat to the validity of all meta-analyses, especially when data are fragmented as in the present case, and no funnel plots or formal tests are meaningful [67], [68]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>We made any effort to locate all published trials, and we searched 9 clinical trial registries to locate all launched RCTs from the pandemic start to April, 2010 (a year before the end of the search of published trials). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>We found that only 21 out of 68 (30.8%) registered RCTs on H1N1 vaccines had been published in peer-reviewed journals, representing 48.1% of the randomized sample size (19875 of 41329) [Ioannidis et al., submitted]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the potential for publication bias does exist and should be taken into account when interpreting the results of the study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Our study has some other potential limitations that must be mentioned. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>First, most of the published trials were conducted under sponsorship by the companies developing the vaccines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Thus it is very difficult to draw any firm conclusions about the potential impact of any sponsorship bias, even if the limited data showed no clear patterns (Tables S2 and S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>In any case, the conduct of large trials by non-industry agencies would help curtail the possibility that sponsorship bias may result in inflated estimates of immunogenicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Second, all direct comparisons between adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccines were based upon three RCTs only, and in particular the conclusion of a superior immunogenicity of non-aluminum as compared to aluminum formulations was based only upon indirect comparisons, as no published study has directly compared two different types of adjuvants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>In any case, searching in clinical trial registries, we found only one Brazilian RCT that compared various adjuvants (NCT01111968). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>This study was completed in March 2011 and the results may be published in the near future. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>Third, no study compared oil-in-water adjuvants by different companies, and further randomized trials are thus needed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Finally, the degree to which immunological measures can be considered markers of vaccines effectiveness is not precisely known, and whether the observed differences in immunogenicity ultimately led to better protection for H1N1 vaccines is unclear [69]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>In particular, some authors suggested that HI titers could not be well correlated with protection against influenza-like illnesses for live-attenuated vaccines, as vaccine efficacy was reported in the absence of high seroprotection rates [70], [71]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Therefore, although HI responses were modest compared to levels achieved by inactivated vaccines [23], we cannot discard the use of live-attenuated vaccines, and further studies are needed on the topic. </plain></SENT>
