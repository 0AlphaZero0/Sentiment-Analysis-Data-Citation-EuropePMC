</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Root nodules of leguminous plants are unique organs that fix atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nitrogenase is a key enzyme responsible for nitrogen fixation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This enzyme, very sensitive to oxygen, is located in bacteroids which represent special kind of rhizobia cells (Hunt and Layzell 1993). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Bacteroids occupy so called infected cells in the nodule interior. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>An appropriate modification of the respiratory chain of the bacteroids allows them respire efficiently at a very low free oxygen concentration protecting their nitrogenase from inactivation (e.g. Bergersen and Turner 1993). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Two factors are considered to be responsible for the maintenance of low oxygen concentration around bacteroids: (1) oxygen diffusion barrier operating in the nodule cortex (Tjepkema and Yocum 1974) and (2) leghemoglobin protein with high affinity to oxygen located in the cytosol of infected cells (Appleby 1984). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Some authors postulate that respiratory consumption of oxygen by cells at nodule periphery must be considered as the third factor in the control of oxygen concentration within nodule interior (Dalton et al. 1998). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Oxygen diffusion to the root nodule interior is promoted by air filled intercellular spaces between cells of the peripheral tissues because water or protein occluded spaces give high resistance to gas diffusion (Minchin 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Thus, regulation of the volume of air filled intercellular spaces appears to be a key factor in nodule functioning. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, large leghemoglobin content in the root nodule facilitates high rate of O2-flux at low free oxygen to bacteroids (Wittenberg et al. 1974). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>But it must be underlined that in spite of high leghemoglobin concentration, oxygen pool fixed by this protein can support the respiration of bacteroids only by seconds so steady state delivery of oxygen to the nodule interior is necessary to support the respiratory activity of bacteroids (Walsh 1995). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Ott et al. (2005) underline that leghemoglobins (1) increase the flux of oxygen to sites of respiration and (2) help to establish very low free-oxygen concentrations within nodules. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Different treatments can change nodule permeability to oxygen diffusion thus affect nodule metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Example treatments include (1) nodule exposition to non-ambient O2 concentration or (2) argon:oxygen atmosphere, and (3) stem girdling, detopping or application of fertilizer (for detailes see Wei and Layzell 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>There are several concepts on mechanism(s) regulating the nodule’s permeability to oxygen diffusion in response to the treatments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Most concepts involve changes in the volume of gaseous intercellular spaces in the nodule parenchyma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>One concept postulates that the degree of the occlusion of intercellular spaces with glycoproteins (James et al. 1991) or water (Streeter 1992; Purcell and Sinclair 1994) may influence oxygen diffusion across nodule cortex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Another hypothesis for the regulation of nodule permeability is that oxygen consumption by respiratory activity in the endodermis or nodule parenchyma is a key component of the diffusion barrier (Dalton et al. 1998). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to characterize the development of cortical tissues of pea root nodules with special focus on the nodule parenchyma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Most observations, which touched the problem of nodule resistance to oxygen diffusion, were curried out on soybean root nodules, which are of determinate type. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Our investigations were done on pea root nodules representing indeterminate type of nodule with its persistent meristem and characteristic zonation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Cytological and cytochemical observations showed that nodule parenchyma of pea nodules is composed of two different cell types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>One adjacent to the infected cells (inner parenchyma) shares common properties to the uninfected cells of the bacteroidal tissue but the other one (outer parenchyma) posses shrinking vacuoles, diluted cytoplasm and infolded radial cell walls as a result of turgor collapse. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The importance of cell vacuolation to the functioning of the outer parenchyma cells and probably the whole nodule is underlined by shrinkage of vacuoles within inner parenchyma and uninfected cells observed after shoot removal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that the fate of cell vacuolation within the outer parenchyma of pea nodules is important for regulation of oxygen diffusion to the nodule interior. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>It is also postulated that cell wall infoldings together with a material of RER origin between them may be involved in the functioning of gas diffusion barrier by regulation of the volume of the intercellular spaces. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>Proteins alone or together with flavonoids are recognized as a major factor regulating nodule resistance to oxygen diffusion (Minchin 1997). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Completely occluded intercellular spaces were observed within nodule parenchyma located opposite to the early symbiotic zone of pea nodules (Fig. 1c and d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>This finding is in good accordance with earlier studies which demonstrated strong correlation between low level of free oxygen and the oneset of nitrogenase synthesis (James et al. 1997; Sheehy and Thornley 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>It cannot be excluded that differentiation of rhizobia cells into bacteroids demands lowering of oxygen concentration within early symbiotic zone which is achieved by occlusion of intercellular spaces within nodule parenchyma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>In case of nodule parenchyma located opposite to the late symbiotic zone, occluded or partially occluded intercellular spaces were visible within the outer nodule parenchyma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>In opposition to the outer parenchyma, the inner parenchyma located opposite to the late symbiotic zone, possessed large intercellular spaces without any visible material. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>So, the distribution of the material depends on the maturity of the symbiotic tissue suggesting its importance to the functioning of the nodule parenchyma and the whole nodule as well. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>Unstressed, functioning pea root nodules (Figs. 1 and 2) developed the outer parenchyma cells with characteristic vacuolar shrinkage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>But, it should be underlined that observed vacuolar shrinkage is to a certain extend compensated by cytoplasm expansion so it has no profound effect on the cell volume as in case of stomata cells (Raven 1987). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>Turgor loss manifested by vacuolar shrinkage of the cells resulted in formation of the radial wall infoldings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>Such cells are probably very sensitive to even fine changes of the osmotic pressure in symplast and apoplast and can take up or release water, thus regulate the permeability of the diffusion barrier to oxygen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>This finding is in good agreement with a hypothesis which involves an osmotic regulation of nodule cortex resistance to oxygen diffusion (Purcell and Sinclair 1994). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Such regulation may involve rapid water fluxes across plasma membrane and tonoplast promoted by high expression of plasma membrane and tonoplast aquaporins found within inner cortex of soybean nodules (Fleurat-Lessard et al. 2005). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>An appearance of new cells with shrinking vacuoles in the inner parenchyma and uninfected cells of the symbiotic tissue (Fig. 3) as a response to shoot removal, suggests that (1) shrinkage of vacuoles is an important factor in regulation of nodule conductance to oxygen diffusion and (2) an enhancement in the resistance to oxygen diffusion to prevent nitrogenase from inactivation is realized by cell turgor collapse. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>Radial wall infoldings, together with an electron-opaque material between the infoldings, are major structural features of the outer parenchyma cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, an association of the material with RER cysternae, mitochondria and Golgi bodies suggests an activity of the infoldings in regulation of O2 entry into nodules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>This suggestion is supported by the fact that an electron-opaque material seems to keep the structure of infoldings making them steeper. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>So, it is probable that cell wall infoldings and material accumulated between them, together with associated organella form a special apparatus important for the functioning of the outer parenchyma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>Unusual properties of the infoldings are also underlined by cell wall discontinuities often observed within or close to them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>The discontinuities may result from mechanical tensions and/or digestive processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>This observation also suggests a complexity of both, the outer parenchyma structure and functioning. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>An importance of cell vacuolation within nodule symbiotic tissue and cortical cell layers was proved by vacuolar staining with neutral red, a vital pH indicator, and epifluorescence observations (Fig. 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>The specificity of the NR technique for acidotropic staining of vacuoles has been proved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>Unprotonated form of neutral red easily crosses the plasma membrane and tonoplast. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>The dye in its protonated form does not penetrate membranes and is trapped in acidic compartments like plant vacuoles (e.g. Oparka 1991). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>Thus, the lack of fluorescence over the vacuoles in mature infected cells indicates that the vacuoles do not represent acidic compartments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>But Fedorova and Brown (2007) observed under bright field technique slightly pink vacuoles in mature infected cells after neutral red staining. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>The discrepancies between both findings may result from the use of different neutral red staining procedures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>In particular, in this study attached nodules were stained instead of nodule sections used by Fedorova and Brown (2007). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>Red fluorescence over vacuoles in uninfected cells as well as inner parenchyma cells neighboring infected cells observed in pea nodules suggests common acidic properties of the vacuolar content of the cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>On the base of this finding functional similarity between both cell types can be expected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>Newcomb et al. (1989) also proved functional similarity between the uninfected cells of the bacteroidal tissue and the cells of the inner cortex (nodule parenchyma) with respect to ureide production in determinate nodules. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, neutral red staining revealed distinct differences in the level of vacuolation as well as vacuolar acidity and/or vacuolar content within pea nodule periphery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>The diversity in composition of vacuolar content may reflect different metabolic properties and functions of particular cell layers which form nodule cortex. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>Neutral red staining also supported observations done under electron microscopy which showed shrinkage of vacuoles in the outer parenchyma as well as in inner parenchyma and uninfected cells after shoot removal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>It emphasized an importance of cell vacuolation to the nodule functioning under stress conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>So, the level of cell vacuolation and properties of vacuoles may be a very important factors involved in an adjustment of nodule conductance to oxygen. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>Mathematical modeling revealed that oxygen regulation could occur within infected cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>For instance, model proposed by Bergersen (1994) allows high respiratory activity of mitochondria within infected cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>Our observations indicate that respiratory activity (showed as SDH activity) was much higher in late symbiotic zone than in adjacent nodule periphery (Fig. 5), so it is possible that respiratory O2 consumption by mitochondria and bacteroids of the tissue is important in protection of dinitrogenase activity against oxidative damage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>This suggestion is in accordance with the findings of Gardiol et al. (1987) who demonstrated that SDH activity is essential for proper bacteroid differentiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>Also, they showed that a mutant lacking SDH activity had much lower rate of oxygen consumption in free-living cultures than did the wild type. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>Because some nodule parenchyma cells exhibited high level of SDH activity (Fig. 5), it cannot be excluded that respiratory activity of nodule parenchyma has also an effect onto lowering of oxygen concentration within symbiotic tissue, as well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>The observations presented here regarding SDH activity support earlier suggestions (Minchin et al. 1992; Dalton et al. 1998) that oxygen diffusion barrier contains a respiratory component located in the nodule periphery. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>Additional resistance to the oxygen diffusion across the nodule cortex can be given by the nodule endodermis (Witty et al. 1987, Hartmann et al. 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>In case of pea, nodule endodermal cells, localized opposite to the late symbiotic zone, were surrounded by suberin lamellae (Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>Apart from suberin, nodule endodermal cell walls of pea contained lignins (Fig. 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>But according to some authors, suberized barriers seem to be more effective in restriction of oxygen diffusion than lignified (De Simone et al. 2003). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>Nodule endodermis is also a good physical barrier for diffusion of carboxyfluorescein, the apoplastic dye (Fig. 6e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>Because only small amounts of the dye were detected in the outer parenchyma and never reached symbiotic tissue it is suggested that endodermal cells are rather tightly packed with only minorous free space for diffusion of small molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>Such properties of the endodermal cell layer indicate that endodermis is predestined to give some resistance toward diffusion of oxygen across cortex of pea nodules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>Experiments with the use of a membrane impermeant dye (lucifer yellow) supplied under a mild vacuum, showed that the dye infiltrated through nodule endodermis into the inner cortex (Brown and Walsh, 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>The authors concluded that the nodule endodermis is unlikely to be a significant barrier to oxygen diffusion. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>Finally, EGases were localized immunocytochemically in pea root nodules (Fig. 8) to determine their influence on the development of nodule cortex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>The antibody (anti-EGL1 IgG) used in this study was monospecific as it recognized single band in western blots of wall associated proteins from the host extracts of pea epicotyls or nodules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>What is more, the pre-immune serum used in identical western-blot labelling experiments did not produce any cross-reacting signal (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>Higher expression of glucanases was found in expanding cells and their role in cell wall polysaccharide assembly or rearrangement was suggested (Brummell et al. 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>Experiments conducted on pea by Wu et al. (1996) showed expression of EGL1 gene at the highest level in etiolated epicotyls, but also in stems, leaves, flowers, pods and roots. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>The continuous and high expression of EGases found in the outer cortex cells (Fig. 8c), which undergo a substantial enlargement, is conspicuous. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>It suggests an involvement of these enzymes in cell enlargement which may have an impact on the functioning of pea nodules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>It was postulated that cell expansion can decrease nodule conductance to oxygen (De Lorenzo et al. 1993; Serraj et al. 1995). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="343" pm="."><plain>So the outer cortex cells of pea nodules are predestined to take part in regulation of nodule conductance to oxygen as the cells substantially enlarge during development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>Additionally, endoglucanases could keep cell walls extensible and enable outer cortex cells to change their shape in response to soil conditions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>To conclude, the findings in this study indicate that the fate of vacuolation is important for the functioning of the outer parenchyma of pea root nodules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>Outer parenchyma cells undergo unusual differentiation processes including the shrinkage of their vacuoles with simultaneous cytoplasm expansion and formation of radial wall infoldings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>Such cells might be very sensitive to the external osmotic pressure and release or uptake water thus regulating permeability of intercellular spaces to oxygen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>The importance of these cells in nodule functioning is emphasized by the fact that shrinkage of vacuoles was also observed in the inner parenchyma cells as well as uninfected cells of the symbiotic tissue after shoot removal. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>Radial wall infoldings, together with densely packed material of RER origin around them, form an apparatus which may be involved in regulation of the volume of intercellular spaces within nodule parenchyma. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>To the authors knowledge this is the first report which shows different properties of the vacuoles across nodule cortex of pea nodules after neutral red staining and subsequent epifluorescence observations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>So different functions of particular cortical cell layers can be expected. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="352" pm="."><plain>It was also proved that in case of indeterminate nodules, inner parenchyma cells and uninfected cells of the symbiotic tissue share common properties in terms of vacuolar acidity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="353" pm="."><plain>In addition, the current study demonstrates that endoglucanases are important for a substantial cell enlargement during differentiation of the outer cortex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="354" pm="."><plain>Cell enlargement within outer cortex may be responsible for regulation of nodule conductance to oxygen. </plain></SENT>
