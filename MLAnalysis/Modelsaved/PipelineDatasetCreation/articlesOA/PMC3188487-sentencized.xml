</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Allosteric regulation orchestrates functional behaviors in biological networks through appropriate switches. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>From a biochemical perspective, allostery can be described as a perturbation at one place in a protein structure, such as the binding of a ligand that alters the binding affinity of a distant site or enzymatic activity [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Several models have been suggested for explaining the ‘allosteric mechanism’. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Models of conformational transition between co-existing states such as the MWC model of Monod [2], and the ‘induced fit’ KNF model of Koshland [3] were the first views among them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>They described allostery as a binding event that causes conformational change via a single propagation pathway [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>A new view of allosteric transitions supported from NMR studies, referred to as the ‘population shift’ model, has replaced the MWC and KNF models [5]–[8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The population shift models claim that a protein in the unliganded form exhibits an ensemble of conformational states and ligand binding leads to a redistribution of the population of these states. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In this view, it is important to explore how protein dynamics might contribute to allostery and make communication possible within a protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Unlike the classical allostery models, the population shift-models also suggest that allostery can be mediated without any significant conformational change [9]–[15] but rather from changes in dynamics. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Moreover, recent experimental and theoretical evidences indicate that allostery is not limited to multi-domain proteins or complexes [5] and it may even be a fundamental property of all proteins, even single domain proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In single domain proteins, it is evident that residues that are energetically connected through structural rearrangements and dynamics lead to allosteric regulation [6], [11], [15]–[17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>More importantly, studies on single domain protein PDZ (post-synaptic density-95/discs large/zonula occludens-1) have indicated that allostery can arise not only from large conformational changes, but also from changes in dynamics [12], [14]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Indeed, PDZ domain proteins (PDZs) are the most studied system for understanding single domain allostery [11], [16], [18]–[25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>PDZs are small protein-protein interaction modules and typically recognize specific amino acids in the C-terminal end of peptide motifs or proteins [26]–[28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Various studies on several PDZs, including statistical coupling analysis (i.e. sites that have correlated mutation based on evolutionary information) [16], [29], [30], molecular dynamics [11], [22], [31]–[33], normal mode analysis [34], [35], NMR relaxation methods and site directed mutational analysis [12], [18]–[20], [25], [36] have shown that several PDZs exhibit allosteric behavior that appears to connect incoming signals, notably binding to recognition motifs present on an upstream partner, to downstream partners [11], [16], [18]–[25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>In many different cellular contexts, PDZs function to transduce these binding events into favorable domain-domain assembly of complexes [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is critical to understand the residues involved in these allosteric pathways in order to modulate the PDZ mediated interaction in cell regulation especially those in disease pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a recent experimental study by Petit et al. [12], has confirmed yet another strong allosteric power of one of the PDZs: the hidden dynamic allostery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The removal of the non-canonical third helix (α3) in PSD-95 (PDZ3), which lies outside of the binding pocket, reduces the binding affinity drastically due to a change in side chain dynamics upon truncation, indicating the role of entropy and dynamics in allosteric regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>More interestingly, further investigation has shown that the removal of this distal α3 disrupts the communication between PDZ3 and SH3-GK, which modulates the binding of Disc large protein (Dlg) to the localization protein GukHolder [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the hidden dynamic allostery related with α3 is indeed a regulatory module within the context of larger interdomain interactions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>In summary, PDZs do not solely act as simple scaffold proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>On the contrary through dynamics, they propagate signals to functionally important distant sites for intramolecular and intermolecular interactions [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>They all have the same conserved structure and similar sequences [16], yet different PDZs have evolved different dynamics properties tailored to mediate different functions in the cell [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Thus, it would be very important to understand how signals are passed from one residue to another within the network of PDZs and how the sequential and structural variations alter the allosteric pathways for those allosteric PDZs [11], [18], [20]–[24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Here we would like to tackle this problem with our new method called perturbation response scanning (PRS) [38], [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>PRS treats the protein as an elastic network and uses linear response theory (LRT) to obtain residue fluctuations upon external perturbation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>By sequentially exerting directed random forces on single residues along the chain of the unbound form and recording the resulting relative changes in the residue coordinates using LRT, we can successfully reproduce the residue displacements from the experimental structures of bound and unbound forms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The method is well established and tested for 25 proteins that display a variety of conformational motions upon ligand binding, including shear, hinge, allosteric, and partial refolding as well as more complex protein motions [39]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigate the allosteric transitions by analyzing response fluctuation profiles upon perturbation on binding site residues by PRS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>We focus on two widely studied PDZs: the third PDZ from the post-synaptic-density-95 (PSD-95 PDZ3) and the second PDZ from the human tyrosine phosphates 1E (hPTP1E PDZ2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>The results from our computationally inexpensive and effective approach successfully identify the dynamically linked allosteric residues obtained from experiments (NMR or mutagenesis techniques) [12], [18]–[20], [25], [36] as well as evolutionarily coupled residues from sequence-based statistical approaches [16],[29],[30] and key residues predicted from molecular dynamics, normal mode analysis and protein energy-based networks [11], [22], [31]–[35], [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>As a further test, we construct the communication pathway between these residues that might be responsible in transmitting allosteric signals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>We achieve this through linking residues that show similar directionality of motion upon perturbation of binding sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the constructed allosteric pathway indicates a strong structural residue coupling network. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we observe that the two PDZs, PSD-95 and hPTP1E, have distinct allosteric pathways despite their structural similarity, indicating the role of dynamic coupling in these domains [14], [35], [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The residues in the allosteric pathway of PSD-95 are homogenously distributed along the secondary structural motifs while the allosteric pathway of hPTP1E shows more localization around in regions of β1–β2 loop, β2 and β3 strands and the region of β5 strand and the α2 helix, missing the region of the α1 helix. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The differences in the allosteric pathways of these two PDZs indicate the critical of role of dynamic coupling in PDZ domains and that differences in residue sequences within the same fold can lead to different dynamic coupling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Indeed, PDZs master this to mediate different cellular functions in different parts of the cell [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>In addition to that, our PRS analysis indicates that the allosteric pathway of PSD-95 significantly alters upon removal of the distal third helix (α3 helix). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>This indicates that local changes in the network alter the directionalities of correlated motion, which may lead to a change in binding affinity [35], [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, when we incorporate the change in backbone dynamics into the docking computation through generating multiple conformations by PRS, we also observe an increase in binding energies upon removal of the third helix. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Our objective is to apply a computational approach, perturbation response scanning (PRS), to identify the network of dynamically important residues and propose a possible pathway responsible for intramolecular signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>As we mentioned earlier, PRS combines the elastic network model with linear response theory to compute the residue fluctuation profile of an unbound conformation upon exerting a random external force on a residue, and it is shown to be very successful in capturing binding-induced conformational changes [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>When a ligand approaches a receptor, it exerts forces around binding pockets, inducing certain dynamical changes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Here, we utilize PRS to mimic the nature of a binding event by exerting forces on the binding sites of an unbound conformation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Thus, we analyze the residue response fluctuation profile upon exerting random forces on binding sites of unbound conformations and identify the residues showing distinctive responses (i.e. higher fluctuation than the average fluctuation response) upon perturbing the residues at the binding sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>(See Materials and Methods for details.) </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Elastic network models (ENMs) are utilized to explore allosteric behaviors in proteins [43]–[51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>ENMs are based on a purely mechanical approach, viewing a protein structure as an interconnected series of springs between interacting residue pairs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>They provide information on equilibrium fluctuations and the various contributions to those fluctuations from different modes of motion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Moreover, by introducing a specific perturbation to the system and measuring its dynamic response, ENMs can provide detailed information about the energy landscapes, beyond the correlations between equilibrium fluctuations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>To this aim, there are new modified ENMs developed whereby perturbations are introduced through modifying effective force constants [49], [50], distances between contacting pairs [52], or both [45]–[46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Most of these analyses are focused on changes in the most functionally related mode (i.e. usually the slowest modes) upon perturbations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Although an ENM approach itself, our PRS model differs in two aspects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>First, we introduce perturbations by inserting random external forces on the nodes of unbound conformations, (i.e. α-carbons) instead of modifying the distances between pairs of nodes or spring constants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>This enables us to exert external forces on the binding sites (i.e., random Brownian kicks) and analyze the residues affected by the perturbation on the binding sites similar to the natural allosteric regulations where an approaching ligand induces certain dynamical changes in distal parts of the protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Second, PRS uses the entire Hessian matrix to compute the residue displacement response upon exerting random forces on the selected residues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>The allosteric regulation in small domain proteins like PDZs can arise through changes in dynamics [11], [14], unlike large conformational changes observed in large systems such as GroEL [47], [50] and myosin [53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Therefore, more than one normal mode can contribute to allosteric regulations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>In that respect, the advantage of using the full Hessian matrix in PRS can induce several related modes upon perturbation at the binding site. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="s2a"><title><text><SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Identification of critical residues in allosteric regulation of PDZ interactions </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Mutagenesis and NMR relaxation methods demonstrated that a network of residues exists that has a dynamic response upon ligand binding in both hPTP1E PDZ2 and PSD-95 PDZ3 [12], [19], [20], [25], [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Thus, we applied our approach to the unbound structures of two PDZ domain proteins: hPTP1E (PDB entry: 3LNX) and PSD-95 (PDB entry: 1BFE) and computed the allosteric response ratio χj for each residue, which is the normalized average mean square fluctuation response of residue j upon perturbing only the binding site residues over the mean square average response of the same residue j obtained by perturbations on all residues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Thus, the index of allosteric response ratio χ enables us to identify residues that are more sensitive to perturbation around the binding pocket.  Figure 1  presents the allosteric response ratio profiles of (A) hPTP1E and (C) PSD-95 and the corresponding color-coded ribbon diagrams of these two proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Experimentally identified residues are marked with red dots. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>The ribbon diagrams of (B) hPTP1E and (D) PSD-95 are colored based on the allosteric response ratio, χj, using a spectrum of red (the highest mean square fluctuation response) to orange, yellow, green, cyan and blue (the lowest response). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Particularly, those in agreement with the experimental analysis are labeled. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Overall, there is a good agreement with experimentally identified allosteric residues and those predicted by our approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Using χj&gt;1.00 as a threshold value for the allosteric response ratio, we predicted 6 out of 10 experimentally identified allosteric residues for hPTP1E [25] and similarly 8 out of 11 for PSD-95 [19] (i.e. the predicted residues correspond to the peaks in the allosteric response ratio profiles). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>We would like to note that we also tested our approach in another allosteric PDZ domain, SAP97 (PDB entry: 2AWX) which shows slight conformational change upon binding [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Using the same threshold value for χj&gt;1.00, we were able to distinguish not only the residues near canonical binding sites but also those distant from the binding site (Table S1), indicating the predictive power of PRS in identifying allosteric residues. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>In this study, first we apply a force as a unit vector on residue i along 7 directions (i.e. in x-, y-, z-, both x- and y-, both x- and z-, both y- and z-, all x, y, z directions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Then, we build a perturbation response matrix that includes average displacement ΔR for each residue j due to a force applied on residue i, (8)where the magnitude of positional displacements for residue j in response to a perturbation at residue i is defined as,(9) </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>In order to predict which residues are critical in allosteric pathways, we distinguish the residues exhibiting significant fluctuation upon perturbation on binding site residues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we define an index called the allosteric response ratio, χj for each residue, which is the ratio of average fluctuation response of the residue j upon perturbations placed on binding site residues to average response of residue j upon perturbations on all residues, shown as:(10)where Aij is the response fluctuation profile of residue j upon perturbation of residue i. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>The numerator is the average mean square fluctuation response obtained over the perturbation of the binding pocket (BP) residues, whereas denominator is the average mean square fluctuation response over all residue perturbation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Thus, NBP is the number of residues in the binding pocket and NBP1 and NBPm correspond to residue indexes in the binding pocket (residues 320-328 and 371-380 for PSD-95 and residues 16-23 and 70-79 for hPTP1E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>To identify the critical residues in the allosteric pathway, for each residues we compute χj in each perturbed direction and take into account of the maximum value of χj. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Then, we sort out all χj and select the residue positions by setting a threshold of 1.0 or better. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>To understand how the sensitivity and specificity change, we predict the allosteric residues by varying the threshold of response ratio lower or higher than 1.00. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>We found that taking a threshold value lower than 1.0 gives same experimentally identified allosteric residues to ones obtained by using χj&gt;1.00 as a threshold value (Table S5). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>This enables us to construct an allosteric pathway through linking those residues showing similar response upon perturbations of the binding site. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>To understand the nature of the response, the submatrix of residue k in response to perturbations in i from the inverse of the Hessian (See Equation 7) matrix can be decomposed into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors:(11) </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>If the residues collectively move in line they have a single dominant eigenvalue and their corresponding eigenvectors should be parallel, indicating that they move cooperatively in the same direction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>Therefore, to compare if the responses of two residues are same, we check the dot product of their corresponding eigenvectors,(12)where θ is the angle between the two eigenvectors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>After obtaining the directionality of different pairs of residues upon perturbations on the binding site, we carry out a systematic network analysis using only the residues that give the highest fluctuation response upon perturbation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>For these identified residues, we use a window size of 3 (i.e. if the residue 320 shows the highest mean square fluctuation response, the residues 319, 320, and 321 are taken into account), and search extensively to find residue pairs in sequence that move collectively upon perturbation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>To this aim, we first calculate the overlap coefficients of the residue pairs by using the dot product of response vectors (Eq. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>Using a cut off value of 0.98, we find the residue pairs that move in the same direction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>Importantly, this means we identify the residue pairs showing also a high allosteric response ratio. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>We then perform an extensive search by generating all possible pathways through connecting these identified residue pairs and weight each pathway with the product of overlap coefficients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>As an example, the predicted allosteric residue containing 314 in PSD-95 has the highest overlap coefficient with residue 327 with a value of 0.99. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>We then construct a pathway Ile314→Ile327→Ile338 which gives a total weight of 0.99x0.98 = 0.97. </plain></SENT>
