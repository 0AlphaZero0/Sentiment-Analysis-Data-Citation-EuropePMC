</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Acute appendicitis is one of the most common urgent conditions seen in general surgery practice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Complications can be severe and include perforation and generalised peritonitis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Traditionally, surgical appendectomy has been the primary treatment, even in cases of unconfirmed diagnosis, given the low incidence of major complications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>However, in 15–30% of cases the appendix is found to be free of disease upon resection.1 2 As appendectomy is associated with surgical wound infection, intestinal obstruction due to adhesions, pneumonia, and tubal infertility in females, the possibility of using conservative treatment merits investigation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Non-operative treatment of a suspected appendicitis has safety implications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Delaying surgery may increase the risk of perforated appendicitis, intra-abdominal abscesses, and localised or diffuse peritonitis before surgery and wound infection, increased risk of adhesions and subsequent adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) and infertility after surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Anaesthesia carries its own risks, and there can also be intraoperative (vascular lesions, enterotomies, urinary tract lesions, etc), early surgical postoperative (haematoma/bleeding, colonic fistula, surgical site infection (SSI), intra-abdominal abscess, adhesions and ileus/obstruction) with subsequent re-operation, late surgical postoperative (adhesions and subsequent ASBO and tubal infertility, incisional hernias) and general postoperative complications. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Surgery may be associated with a longer hospital stay and higher costs compared with NOM with antibiotics, but delayed treatment and a perforated appendix may worsen morbidity, duration of sick leave and costs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>However, NOM with antibiotics may be a cost-effective alternative to surgery in a large percentage of patients without increasing the risk, and may reduce hospital stay and costs in both developed and third world countries. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>There is considerable debate regarding the utility of conservative treatment compared with surgical treatment in some cases of acute appendicitis, as few studies have addressed this issue to date.3–5 If conservative treatment is to be considered, it will be very importance to make an accurate diagnosis and assessment in every patient in order to select the most appropriate treatment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The idea that appendicitis may resolve spontaneously is not new. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>In 1908 Alfred Stengel wrote: “Treated in a purely medical or tentative manner, the great majority of patients with appendicitis recover”.6 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Restrained indications with few negative appendectomies are associated with a low incidence of diagnosed non-perforated appendicitis and a secondary high proportion of perforated appendicitis, but no increase in the incidence of perforations.7 This suggests that appendicitis in a significant number of patients may resolve undiagnosed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Resolving appendicitis may also be indicated by a history of recurrent appendicitis, which can be found in up to 6.5% of patients operated on for appendicitis.8 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>When perforation results from delayed treatment, the associated increase in morbidity and mortality must be weighed against the risks of a negative appendectomy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>The excess mortality associated with non-perforated appendicitis and with negative appendectomy with a discharge diagnosis of non-specific abdominal pain, suggests that appendectomy itself carries risks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The decrease in mortality that may be achieved by one prevented perforation is therefore negated by each negative appendectomy.9 10 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Other reports indicate that immediate appendectomy can be avoided for at least 24 h without increasing morbidity if antibiotics are administered.11 Other authors suggest that appendectomy may not be necessary for the majority of patients with acute uncomplicated appendicitis, as the condition resolves spontaneously in many patients and in others may be treatable with antibiotics alone.12 This approach has many advantages, including high success and low recurrence rates, reduced morbidity and mortality, less pain, shorter hospitalisation and sick leave, and reduced costs.13 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>In light of this, routine interval appendectomy after initial successful conservative treatment does not seem justified and should be abandoned. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>In fact, traditional interval appendectomy may prevent recurrent appendicitis in only 6.7% of patients after conservative treatment of acute appendicitis with an appendiceal mass. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Thus 93.3% would have an unnecessary appendectomy.14 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>A recent meta-analysis comparing conservative treatment with acute appendectomy for complicated appendicitis (abscess or phlegmon) and including 1572 patients (847 patients received conservative treatment and 725 had acute appendectomy) showed that conservative treatment was associated with significantly fewer overall complications, wound infections, abdominal/pelvic abscesses, ileus/bowel obstructions and re-operations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there were significantly fewer overall complications in conservative treatment groups during sensitivity analysis of studies including only paediatric patients, high-quality studies, more recent studies, and studies with larger groups of patients.15 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>In particular, a randomised clinical trial (RCT) of antibiotic therapy versus appendicectomy as primary treatment of acute appendicitis in unselected patients showed that treatment efficacy was 90.8% for antibiotic therapy and 89.2% for surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>In this trial minor complications were similar between the groups, while major complications were threefold higher in patients who had an appendicectomy (p&lt;0.050). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>In total, 2.9% of the operated patients underwent a second operation, 3% of them developed abscesses, 2.4% postoperative small bowel obstruction (SBO), 1.8% wound rupture or wound hernia, 0.6% pulmonary embolism and 0.6% postoperative cardiac complications, and 1.2% underwent subsequent ileocaecal resection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Wound infection occurred in 7.6% and 1.2% of the patients had anaesthesia-related problems.16 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>In another RCT comparing appendectomy with antibiotic treatment in acute appendicitis, the complication rate in the surgery group was 14% (17/124) and was mainly due to wound infections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>In the surgery group, time in hospital, sick leave taken and time lost from work were respectively 2.6, 6.0 and 10.1 days.5 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The cumulated risk of surgically treated SBO after appendicectomy was 0.41% after 4 weeks, 0.63% after 1 year and 1.30% after 30 years of follow-up, compared with 0.003% at 1 year and 0.21% after 30 years of follow-up among non-operated controls, with perforated appendicitis, negative appendicectomy and high age risk factors for developing subsequent SBO.17 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>A further paper reviewing 1777 patients who underwent appendectomy for acute appendicitis, showed the overall SBO rate to be 2.8% over an average 4.1-year follow-up period or 0.0069 cases per person-year.18 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>The laparoscopic approach also carries risks, including intraoperative complications ranging from 3.1% to 0.7%, surgical postoperative complications ranging from 6.1% to 1.9%, general postoperative complications ranging from 4.9% to 1.5% and rates of re-operations ranging from 3.4% to 0.7%.19 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>A comparison of 3025 open versus 14 174 laparoscopic appendectomies showed SSI occurred in 4% and 1.2%, deep incisional wound infection in 1.2% and 0.2%, wound disruption in 0.3% and 0.1%, organ space infection in 1.3% and 1.7%, pneumonia in 0.6% and 0.3%, renal failure in 0.2% and 0.3%, urinary tract infection (UTI) in 0.5% and 0.4%, deep vein thrombosis in 0.4% and 0.1%, sepsis in 1.4% and 1.0% and septic shock 0.3% and 0.1%, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Appendectomy may also be associated with mortality (0.3% for open and 0.1% for laparoscopic).20 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Another large population based appraisal including 32 683 patients reported morbidity and mortality for both open and laparoscopic appendectomy.21 Overall morbidity was 8.84% and 4.46%, respectively, serious morbidity 4.23% and 2.58%, SSI 6.65% and 3.26%, serious morbidity/mortality 4.26% and 2.60%, and mortality 0.13% and 0.07%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Superficial SSI incidence was, respectively, 3.89% and 1.26%, deep incisional SSI 0.99% and 0.24%, organ space SSI 1.72% and 1.79%, wound disruption 0.45% and 0.06%, pneumonia 0.43% and 0.24%, pulmonary embolism 0.08% in both open and lap groups, sepsis or septic shock 2.16% and 1.15%, bleeding 0.01 and 0.04% and UTIs 0.36% and 0.37%. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>The long term follow-up of a RCT of open versus laparoscopic appendicectomy showed a 42.3% incidence of overall complications in the open surgery group versus 12.8% in the laparoscopic group, with wound-related complications as high as 30.77% versus 4.2%.22 After a mean follow-up of more than 9 years, 5.7% and 6.4% of patients, respectively, had adhesions or adhesion-related symptoms and 0.2% underwent another operation for adhesions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>The risk of SBO after open appendectomy is between 0.33 and 1.51%. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Finally, it has been demonstrated that a history of perforated appendix in childhood does not seem to have long term negative consequences on female fertility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>This may have important implications for the management of young women with suspected appendicitis as the liberal attitude to surgical exploration with a subsequently high rate of removal of a normal appendix is no longer justified by a perceived increased risk of infertility after perforation.23 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>In addition, a liberal attitude to exploration among patients with suspected appendicitis does not prevent perforations.24 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Hansson et al16 conducted a RCT investigating the efficacy of conservative treatment compared to surgery for acute appendicitis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>They reported that conservative treatment with antibiotics was efficacious in 91% of cases, with a 14% relapse rate at 12-month follow-up. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>One third of relapses occurred within the first 10 days of hospital discharge, while most of the remaining two thirds occurred between 3 and 16 months following discharge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>The rates of minor complications such as diarrhoea, vomiting and nosocomial infections were similar among patients treated conservatively and those treated surgically. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>The incidence of major complications such as appendiceal abscess, paralytic ileus and pulmonary embolism, however, was significantly higher in those treated surgically (p&lt;0.05). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>A recent prospective randomised study conducted by Malik A and colleagues1 compared antibiotic therapy to appendectomy in acute appendicitis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>The authors reported that conservative treatment was not only safe and efficacious, but also caused the patients less pain than surgery, reducing the need for analgesia (p&lt;0.001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Ten per cent of conservatively treated patients relapsed within 12 months of discharge. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>A multicentre randomised trial conducted in Sweden16 yielded similar results: the rate of relapse in antibiotic treated patients was 14% at 1 year after discharge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, this was equal to the rate of post-operative complications in patients treated surgically. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Based on these reports, with the diagnostic accuracy of acute appendicitis being as high as 71%–87% with a combination of modern preoperative investigations,25 conservative treatment with antibiotics seems to valid for cases of suspected or probable/proven acute appendicitis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Relapse rate is low and complications are no higher than the rate of surgical complications. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Case control studies that randomly assign patients with suspected acute appendicitis to either surgical or non-surgical treatment show a relapse rate of approximately 14% at 1 year. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>It would, therefore, be useful to determine the relapse rate of patients treated according to the results of a thorough clinical evaluation, including physical examination and laboratory results (all characteristics used to determine the Alvarado score26) as well as radiological evaluation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Imaging such as ultrasound may be helpful but is not usually necessary in diagnosing acute appendicitis and deciding its further treatment (operative or non-operative). </plain></SENT>
