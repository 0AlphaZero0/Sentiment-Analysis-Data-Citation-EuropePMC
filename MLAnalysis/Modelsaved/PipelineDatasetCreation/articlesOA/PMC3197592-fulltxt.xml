In this study, the influences of DMP on the gametes and subsequent developmental process of abalone (<italic>Haliotis diversicolor supertexta</italic>, a representative marine benthic gastropod) were assessed. Newborn abalone eggs and sperm were exposed separately to different DMP concentrations (1, 10 or 100 ppb) for 60 min. At the end-point of exposure, the DMP-treated eggs and sperm were collected for analysis of their ultra-structures, ATPase activities and total lipid levels, and the fertilized gametes (embryos) were collected to monitor related reproductive parameters (fertilization rate, abnormal development rate and hatching success rate). Treatment with DMP did not significantly alter the structure or total lipid content of eggs at any of the doses tested. Hatching failures and morphological abnormalities were only observed with the highest dose of DMP (100 ppb). However, DMP exposure did suppress sperm ATPase activities and affect the morphological character of their mitochondria. DMP-treated sperm exhibited dose-dependent decreases in fertilization efficiency, morphogenesis and hatchability. Relatively obvious toxicological effects were observed when both sperm and eggs were exposed to DMP. Furthermore, RT-PCR results indicate that treatment of gametes with DMP changed the expression patterns of physiologically-regulated genes (cyp3a, 17&#946;-HSD-11 and 17&#946;-HSD-12) in subsequent embryogenesis. Taken together, this study proofed that pre-fertilization exposure of abalone eggs, sperm or both to DMP adversely affects the fertilization process and subsequent embryogenesis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over the past few decades the world's aquatic environments have been severely impacted by various contaminants from industry, agriculture, urban runoff and other sources. These contaminants can affect all levels of biological organization, from individuals to entire ecosystems <xref rid="pone.0025951-Fent1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025951-Schwarzenbach1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.

Among these contaminants, phthalate esters (PAEs) compose one of the most persistent and widespread groups of xenobiotics in the marine ecosystem <xref rid="pone.0025951-Mackintosh1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In addition, PAEs are typical endocrine disruptors that can interfere with the hormonal metabolism, immune responses, and reproductive functions of wildlife <xref rid="pone.0025951-Imai1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025951-Oehlmann1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The high rates of PAEs production and use have raised concerns regarding its effects on aquatic species. In the last two decades, bio-resources have reportedly declined in both number and quality, affects that could be attributed to adverse effects on the reproduction and development of aquatic animals caused by PAEs contamination <xref rid="pone.0025951-Lyche1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Xenobiotics primarily target marine organisms in their early life stages because these are usually more susceptible to the toxic effects than the adult forms <xref rid="pone.0025951-His1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025951-Hamdoun1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Thus, great concern has arisen regarding the potential adverse effects of PAEs on the early life stages of marine animals. Early embryos or larvae may be affected by two main pathways: direct exposure or indirect exposure. When directly exposed to phthalate substances, embryos or larvae have demonstrated reduced fertilization rates, impaired embryogenesis and altered larval morphologies <xref rid="pone.0025951-Shioda1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0025951-Zhou2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Indirectly exposure is another pathway by which early embryos or larvae may be damaged. Several studies in aquatic environments have demonstrated the harmful effects of phthalate on embryo survival, growth and morphology by this way in marine organisms, including clam <xref rid="pone.0025951-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, medaka <xref rid="pone.0025951-Patyna1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and sea urchin <xref rid="pone.0025951-Song1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>Direct or indirect exposure of embryos to xenobiotic contaminants (e.g., PAEs) during development clearly causes morphological malformations and developmental dysfunction. However, the question remains as to whether exposure of gametes to these pollutants before fertilization would result in similar developmental defects. Most aquatic organisms release eggs or sperm into their surroundings to fuse and develop as &#8220;orphans&#8221; in direct contact with the environment. Gametes, directly released into seawater, are unprotected and exposed to environmental contaminants during spawning, so the possibility for contaminants to disrupt the fertilization process and subsequent developmental events is high <xref rid="pone.0025951-Lewis1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Nonetheless, gamete-toxicity has received relatively little attention compared to investigations involving embryos or adults.</p><p>Among the PAEs, di-methyl phthalate (DMP) is one the most frequently detected plasticizer and is a relatively stable compound in the natural environment; the hydrolysis half-life is estimated to be about 20 years <xref rid="pone.0025951-Staples1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In the field of aquatic environments, the reported concentration of DMP ranged from 0.73 to 20 &#181;g/L (Hu et al., 2003) <xref rid="pone.0025951-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In this study, the abalone eggs and sperm were exposed separately or in combination to di-methyl phthalate (DMP), to study the effects of this xenobiotic agent on the gametes' fertilization behavior and the subsequent embryogenesis. The questions addressed in this paper are as follows: 1) are the reproductive parameters (fertilization efficiency, morphogenesis, and hatching behavior) adversely affected when gametes are exposed to typical concentrations of DMP found in the environment; and 2) what are the potential mechanisms affecting embryogenesis?</p><p>The gastropod (e.g., marine abalone) was chosen as the test species in our study due to its size advantage, environmental sensitivity, short life cycle and breeding characteristics.

In this regard, the maternal or paternal effects of xenobiotics in aquatic animals have been widely investigated. The results have demonstrated that exposure of the mother or father to contaminants at environmentally relevant levels can cause gonad growth retardation, fertilization dysfunction, embryonic development defects, and transmissible damages to the offspring <xref rid="pone.0025951-Westerlund1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0025951-Aluru1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. However, studies on gametes are relatively scarce. Because external fertilizers (e.g., broadcast spawners) release their gametes freely into the environment, these organisms should be more vulnerable to fertilization failure as a result of point-of-contact chemical exposure. Thus, it is important to understand the effects of xenobiotics on gametes and subsequent reproductive processes. The present study investigates the toxicity effects of DMP on germ cells. To our knowledge, this study is the first to expose abalone gametes to DMP in order to assess the effects on the fertilization process and subsequent embryo development.</p><p>The present study reveals no significant adverse effects on fertilization efficiency following exposure of eggs to DMP. This finding is consistent with earlier studies on other marine invertebrates, in which acute exposure of eggs to contaminants had no effect on fertilization abilities <xref rid="pone.0025951-Eyster1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025951-Hollows1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.

The slight decline in fertilization rates observed in the highest-dose group is possibly due to the accumulation of high DMP concentrations in the egg envelope surfaces and micropyle blockage affecting sperm/egg fusion <xref rid="pone.0025951-Schatten1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. However, further research is needed to evaluate the barrier actions of DMP on egg envelope micropores.</p><p>Sperm were more sensitive than eggs to DMP exposure. DMP exerted a potent concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on sperm fertilization ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0025951-g004">Figure 4</xref>). These toxicological results indicate that short-term exposure to DMP may reduce sperm function. Previous literatures have also reported the influences of xenobiotic pollutants on sperm functions and fertilization processes. The related mechanisms include reducing sperm swimming speed <xref rid="pone.0025951-Mwatibo1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, damaging sperm DNA structure <xref rid="pone.0025951-Lyche1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, disrupting flagellum Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling <xref rid="pone.0025951-Lewis1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and increasing the probability of aneuploid sperm <xref rid="pone.0025951-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In the present study, we observed the declines of ATPase activity on sperm, which indicate that DMP-treated sperm have lower energy at the time of fertilization than control sperm. As ATPase is responsible for releasing ATP (the enzymatic contents), and ATP aids sperm penetrating into the eggs <xref rid="pone.0025951-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, suppressed ATPase activity may decrease the energy for propelling the sperm to the egg, which eventually results in a diminution of the fertilization ratio.</p><p>The impaired fertilization ability of DMP-treated abalone sperm may also be explained by associated ultrastructural changes.

Taken together, these results suggest that DMP exposure influences the sperm energy status and ultrastructure, providing possible mechanisms leading to the fertilization impairment of abalone gametes during the early phase of the fertilization process.</p><p>In addition to impacting the fertilization process, acute exposure of gametes to DMP disrupted abalone embryogenesis. In T1 test groups (exposure of eggs), the development process was not significantly affected by low or medium concentrations of DMP. One possible reason for this result is that the egg envelope acts as a protective layer, resisting the intrusion of DMP. Nevertheless, a hatching-out delay appeared at the highest dose of DMP. High concentrations of xenobiotic may interfere with permeability of the outer membrane of egg cells. Under these circumstances, fertilized eggs would suffer metabolic deactivation, ultimately affecting the morphogenesis or hatching behavior <xref rid="pone.0025951-Raloff1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Significant increases in the frequencies of developmental abnormalities and hatch defects were observed in T2 compared to T1 experiments. Because they exhibit a limited capacity for DNA repair and antioxidant defense <xref rid="pone.0025951-Aitken1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, sperm are potentially more susceptible to DMP-induced damage than oocytes. In addition, we speculated that after DMP exposure, the foreign xenobiotic substance may accumulate in the sperm body, making the sperm cell act as a toxicity vector that transfers DMP into eggs, thereby forming DMP-contaminated embryos (fertilized eggs) and influenced embryonic development process. Experiments designed to detect DMP levels in sperm cells are presently underway in our laboratory to further test this hypothesis.</p><p>During the fertilization process, each gamete provides components and signals that are essential to normal embryonic development. In many invertebrates, eggs have large stores of maternal mRNA and proteins synthesized before fertilization <xref rid="pone.0025951-Davidson1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, while the sperm supplies factors that initiate the developmental program. Exposure of gametes to environmental toxicants may lead to alteration of these essential components, causing fertilization failure and/or defective development <xref rid="pone.0025951-Mwatibo1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Among these components, the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isoenzyme is particularly important. In early stages, CYP450 is responsible for the degradation of contaminants and affects cell differentiation and ontogenesis <xref rid="pone.0025951-Ioannides1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Previous studies report cyp3a over-expression in zebrafish and medaka embryos after exposure to TBT or TPT <xref rid="pone.0025951-Spitsbergen1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. However, the present results show no significant difference in cyp3a expression between experimental and control groups, perhaps due to the use of different exposure substances and durations.</p><p>In vertebrate, sex steroid hormones play an important role in early embryo development, including regulating differentiation, development and homeostasis <xref rid="pone.0025951-Lafont1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Steroid hormones are synthesized from cholesterol through the action of steroidgenic enzymes, which are regulated primarily at the transcriptional level <xref rid="pone.0025951-Hum1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. The enzymes 17&#946;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (17&#946;-HSDs) play a key role in the cascade of steroidogenesis and the activy of these enzymes used as indicator of steroid biosynthesis <xref rid="pone.0025951-Hinshelwood1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Previous studies have shown that these enzymes are sensitive to adverse environmental conditions during embryogenesis in various vertebrate animals, including rats <xref rid="pone.0025951-Pushpalatha1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, frog <xref rid="pone.0025951-Osvaldo1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, and fish <xref rid="pone.0025951-Spitsbergen1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. In this study, the abnormal expression of types 11 and 12 17&#946;-HSD mRNA was observed after abalone (an invertebrate species) gamete exposed by DMP. Despite the lack of data on steroids receptors and functional studies during embryogenesis in invertebrate, we may also hypothesize a similar role of 17&#946;-HSD during mollusks embryonic development process. We cannot totally rule out a role of 17&#946;-HSD in regulating steroid biosynthesis during abalone embryo development. In virtually, the biological function of 17&#946;-HSD-11 [submitted manuscript] and 17&#946;-HSD-12 <xref rid="pone.0025951-Zhou3" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> were verified by transiently transfecting their ORF in HEK-293 cells, which provided further support that abalone 17&#946;-HSD may participate steroid hormone metabolism. Besides, the physiological function of 17&#946;-HSD involved in steroidogenesis or the cascade process has also been demonstrated in sea urchin <xref rid="pone.0025951-Roepke1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, mussel <xref rid="pone.0025951-Janer1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, and dogwhelk <xref rid="pone.0025951-Castro1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Taken together, 17&#946;-HSD may be a biomarker, at least in part, for abalone embryo developmental impairment and hatching dysfunction. However, this cannot be extended to all mollusks as 17&#946;-HSD receptors and binding competence are not yet fully understood. Further investigations including mRNA expression and protein activity measurements are thus required to conclude on the exact physiological role(s) of these 17&#946; hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes in steroidogenesis function during mollusks embryogenesis.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Clearly acute DMP exposure of abalone eggs or sperm adversely affects fertilization efficiency and subsequent embryogenesis. Sperm were more sensitive to DMP than eggs. The results suggest that compromised sperm energy status contribute to fertilization defects in germ cells. Disruption of the physiological performance of abalone embryos is a possible mechanism leading to phenotypic changes of embryogenesis, such as developmental abnormalities and decreased hatchability. In the next step, multiple hormone-regulated genes and their interactive, simultaneous effects on morphology, physiology, and development will be examined to better understand the mechanisms of early-life-stage toxicity of plastic contaminants.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p>DMP was obtained from Shenggong, Co., Ltd.

Before spawning, the animals were washed several times with SFS. The newborn sperm were placed in a sperm/water mixture in a clean container (0.5 L). The newborn eggs were filtered through a 100 &#181;m mesh nylon net, gently washed two times with SFS and re-suspended as an eggs/water mixture in 0.5 L clean seawater.

The abalone eggs in the T1 group were exposed to DMP at three different concentrations (1, 10 or 100 ppb) for 60 min, followed by fertilization with unexposed sperm. The abalone sperm in the T2 group were exposed to DMP at the same doses for 60 minutes and then used to fertilize unexposed eggs. In the T3 group, both sperm and eggs were exposed to DMP using the same protocol and were then used to fertilize each other. In all experimental groups, the fertilized eggs (embryos) were developed in clean seawater. The same volume of acetone solvent was used as the control, and SFS was used as the blank.

Sperm were fixed with 2.5% buffered glutaraldehyde. Approximately 200&#8211;300 sperm per sample were analyzed. Basic morphology analyses focused on detecting whether the existence or absence of teratosperm (e.g., angulated sperm or sperm suffering breakage). In addition to basic morphology analyses, sperm from the control groups and the DMP-treated groups were processed utilizing transmission electron microscopic (TEM) analysis. Briefly, samples were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, then washed in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer and postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide. Subsequently, the samples were washed with buffer, dehydrated, and embedded in Epon 812. Ultrathin sections (70 to 90 nm thick) were obtained using an ultramicrotome (Lecia EM UC6, Germany) and were mounted on 150-mesh copper grids.

Therefore, prior to fertilization trials, aqueous DMP in the sperm/water (or eggs/water) mixtures required removal. Accordingly, in T1 samples, the DMP-treated eggs were filtered through a 100-&#181;m-mesh nylon net, then gently washed two times with filtered seawater before being fertilized with non-DMP-treated sperm. In T2 samples, the DMP-treated sperm were placed in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at low-speed for a few minutes, forming a pellet of sperm at the bottom of the tube. A 900 &#181;l aliquot of the supernatant was decanted and replaced with filtered seawater. The resulting sperm/water solution was then used to fertilize non-DMP-treated eggs. Centrifuging the sperm/water solution did not adversely affect sperm viability, as demonstrated by a preliminary study in which centrifuged sperm exhibited motility comparable to non-centrifuged sperm and were able to successfully fertilize eggs <xref rid="pone.0025951-Earnshow1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>.

Sperm and eggs were allowed to interact in an aerated vial for 30 min, at which time 0.5 mL of buffered glutaraldehyde was added to arrest fertilization and preserve developing fertilized eggs (embryos). Fertilization rates were determined by counting the ratio of fertilized/total eggs from a randomly selected sub-sample of at least 100 eggs (range 100&#8211;150). Fertilized eggs exhibiting characteristic polar bodies are clearly visible under 200&#215;magnification.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Development parameters in embryogenesis</title><p>Abnormality rate (%).

Embryo samples were collected randomly, fixed with formalin, and then observed under a light microscope (Nikon, Japan). Each treatment was repeated three times.
