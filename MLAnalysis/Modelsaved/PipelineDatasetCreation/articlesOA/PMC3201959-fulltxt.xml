<italic>C. burnetii</italic> is a Gram-negative intracellular Y-proteobacteria that causes the zoonotic disease Q fever. Q fever can manifest as an acute or chronic illness. Different typing methods have been previously developed to classify <italic>C. burnetii</italic> isolates to explore its pathogenicity. Here, we report a comprehensive genomotyping method based on the presence or absence of genes using microarrays. The genomotyping method was then tested in 52 isolates obtained from different geographic areas, different hosts and patients with different clinical manifestations. The analysis revealed the presence of 10 genomotypes organized into 3 groups, with a topology congruent with that obtained through multi-spacer typing. We also found that only 4 genomotypes were specifically associated with acute Q fever, whereas all of the genomotypes could be associated to chronic human infection. Serendipitously, the genomotyping results revealed that all hard tick isolates, including the Nine Mile strain, belong to the same genomotype.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>
<italic>C. burnetii</italic> is a Gram-negative intracellular Y-proteobacteria that causes Q fever, which is a zoonotic disease with a worldwide distribution <xref rid="pone.0025781-Maurin1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Q fever can manifest as an acute or chronic illness. Acute Q fever is typically a self-limiting febrile illness during which pneumonia or hepatitis can occur, whereas chronic Q fever is a severe illness in which patients can present endocarditis, vascular infection, osteomyelitis and chronic hepatitis <xref rid="pone.0025781-Maurin1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The major route of contamination with <italic>C. burnetii</italic> is aerosol. <italic>C. burnetii</italic> displays antigenic variation in its lipopolysaccharides (LPS) <xref rid="pone.0025781-Hackstadt1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Phase I is highly infectious and corresponds to the natural phase found in animals, including humans and arthropods, whereas phase II is not very infectious, presents truncated LPS and can be obtained after several passages in cell culture or from embryonated eggs <xref rid="pone.0025781-Maurin1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The <italic>C. burnetii</italic> genome was sequenced in 2003, and its size is approximately 2 Mbp, with a plasmid of approximately 38 kbp <xref rid="pone.0025781-Seshadri1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Recently, 3 new isolates of this species were sequenced <xref rid="pone.0025781-Beare1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Analysis of 16S rDNA gene sequencing data has shown that <italic>C. burnetii</italic> strains isolated from a variety of geographical areas and various hosts display considerable genetic homogeneity <xref rid="pone.0025781-Stein1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.

The most extensive survey of <italic>C. burnetii</italic> genetic diversity was reported by Glazunova et al. <xref rid="pone.0025781-Glazunova1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, who used multi-spacer typing (MST) to genotype approximately 150 <italic>C. burnetii</italic> isolates. More recently, a comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis was performed on a collection a 24 strains of <italic>C. burnetii</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0025781-Beare2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The availability of the <italic>C. burnetii</italic> genome sequence allows a rapid assessment of whole-genome sequence variation by using comparative genome hybridization (CGH) on microarrays, allowing the determination of correlations between the genome repertoire and the source of the organisms.</p><p>A long controversy related to the virulence of different isolates of <italic>C. burnetii</italic> was resolved recently <xref rid="pone.0025781-Glazunova1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025781-Stein2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0025781-RussellLodrigue2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. All types of strains can be isolated from chronic infections that are determined more by host factors than by bacterial factors. In contrast, only particular strains have been isolated from acute infections, and the prototype strain, Nine Mile, has been found to cause acute infection at a lower inoculum concentration than the strain Q212, which is found in association with chronic infection. Therefore, there is a difference of the virulence of strains in causing acute infection that is correlated with the genotype, as determined by MST, genomotyping or plasmid typing.</p><p>Q fever is currently re-emerging in different areas in Europe, with a major outbreak of Q fever observed in the Netherlands (causing both acute and chronic infections) <xref rid="pone.0025781-Enserink1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and in US military personnel in Iraq <xref rid="pone.0025781-Raoult2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. These <italic>C. burnetii</italic> outbreaks bring to the forefront the question of bacterial clonality, which could be related to distribution of highly virulent clones. Alternatively, the apparent massive increase in cases of Q fever could be related to improved detection or increased risk of exposure to animal reservoirs <xref rid="pone.0025781-Raoult2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The widespread outbreak that is presently occurring in the Netherlands has been the focus of numerous molecular biology investigations, including one that indicated that a single genotype, or at least a reduction of heterogeneity, was implicated in the outbreak <xref rid="pone.0025781-Enserink1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025781-Klaassen1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. We had the opportunity to test this genotype using MST methods <xref rid="pone.0025781-Glazunova1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and found that the putative clone responsive for the outbreak was identical to a strain isolated from an infected sheep vagina in Germany over 10 years ago and several strains isolated from humans in France.</p><p>Although these large outbreaks seem to be related to exposure to domestic and wild animals, the role of arthropods in Q fever transmission has to be considered. The role of ticks as vectors and reservoirs has been discussed since 1937. Ticks may be infected by <italic>C. burnetii</italic> during feeding; excrete it <italic>via</italic> feces, saliva and coxal fluid; and transmit it transovarially and transstadially. The reference strain Nine Mile was isolated from a <italic>Dermacentor andersoni</italic> hard tick, and Q fever was initially presumed to be a vector-borne disease <xref rid="pone.0025781-Weyer1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0025781-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. At present, ticks are rare vectors for transmission of Q fever <xref rid="pone.0025781-Mediannikov1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we compared 52 isolates from patients and animals (mammals, bird and ticks) from the <italic>C. burnetii</italic> strain collection housed in our laboratory, including 2 isolates presenting the same MST genotype as the putative epidemic clone from the Netherlands using DNA whole-genome microarrays to perform genomotyping to investigate associations of the gene repertoire, source and clinical information for <italic>C. burnetii.</italic>

Oligonucleotide calculation parameters were set as follows: oligo length from 50- to 52 mers; GC percentage from 35% to 55%; melting temperature from 82&#176;C to 86&#176;C. OligoArray 2.0 selected probes with the lowest cross-hybridization and an absence of secondary structure and balanced the set of probes in terms of melting temperature. Oligonucleotides containing five consecutive As, Cs, Gs or Ts were discarded. Following probe design, 1990 probes corresponding to 1990 distinct CDS where selected for synthesis. Probes were ordered from Sigma-Proligo (Paris, FRANCE) as 5&#8242; amino-modified oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotide stocks were aliquoted for use in microarray fabrication. Oligonucleotides were diluted to a final concentration of 35&#8211;50 &#181;M in 35% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) containing 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 8.0). <italic>Coxiella burnetii</italic> - 2 k microarrays were printed with a ChipWriterProarrayer (Bio-Rad Hercules, CA) on commercial HydroGel slides (Schott, Mainz, Germany) and processed according to the manufacturer's instructions.

A previous CGH analysis of <italic>C. burnetii</italic> was performed on 23 different isolates and two antigenic variants of NMI. Our collection included 3 strains in common with those used by Beare et <italic>al</italic>. (NMI, S217 and HzS), which were used as positive controls in this study. Although microarray used in the previous study has many more probes (covering approximately 30% of coding) compared to our home-made microarray (5% of coding sequence), we found high homologies between our results and those of Beare et al. <xref rid="pone.0025781-Beare2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0025781.s001">Figure S1</xref>). In this regard, we conclude that we obtained robust and confirmed data to perform genomotyping with our microarray results. Several typing methods have been developed for the causative agent of Q fever <xref rid="pone.0025781-Stein1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025781-Hendrix1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025781-Jager1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025781-Nguyen1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025781-Andoh1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0025781-Beare2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.

<xref rid="pone.0025781-Beare2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> showed that these different methods of typing are globally congruent. In our study, we compared whole-genome typing with MST methods. This comparison showed that the two methods produced a similar clusterization of isolates within three groups with significantly divergent gene content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0025781-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, the different isolates of <italic>C. burnetii</italic> present divergent evolution of the three groups that is independent of geographic origin and clinical context, as previously proposed by Glazunova et <italic>al.</italic>

<xref rid="pone.0025781-Beare2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>In several animal models, both the amount of inoculum used and the strain influence the presence and manifestations of acute pneumonia during Q fever <xref rid="pone.0025781-RussellLodrigue1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025781-RussellLodrigue2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025781-Stein3" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. However, there is no evidence that isolates from chronic and acute human infections differ when large collections are screened by different methods of typing <xref rid="pone.0025781-Glazunova1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. A preliminary analysis based on MST-typing showed that acute Q fever was induced by isolates belonging to MST genotypes 1, 2, 4, 16 and 18 and that the plasmid QpDV was highly associated with acute Q fever. Isolates from chronic infections were associated with all MST-genotypes and all of the observed plasmid types. In our study, we found that only genomotypes A2, A3, B4 and B5 contained isolates from acute infections. Based on these associations, we found four deleted or highly divergent ORFs with unknown functions that were significantly associated with acute Q fever. Furthermore, the previous microarray genomic analysis showed that isolates from acute infections had a comparable gene repertoire to that of genomotype B1 <xref rid="pone.0025781-Beare2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Because no genomotype was specifically associated with chronic Q fever, we confirmed that all isolates could be involved in chronic infections, as previously proposed <xref rid="pone.0025781-Glazunova1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025781-Raoult1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Previously, Beare <italic>et al.</italic> has mainly associated acute Q fever with B1 genomotype <xref rid="pone.0025781-Beare2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. We described four additional genomotypes that were associated with acute infections compared to the previous study. Based on the results obtained using previous methods of typing collected isolates and on studies of acute Q fever in animal models, we have schematically represented the putative factors involved in Q fever infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0025781-g003">Figure 3</xref>). After the primary infection, we speculate that minimal inoculum is necessary to induce acute manifestations in case of the strain present specific plasmids, MST genotypes or genomotypes. The chronic manifestation could be induced by all the strains whether the host presents favorable clinical field.</p><fig id="pone-0025781-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0025781.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Bacterial factors involved in Q fever.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0025781.g003"/></fig><p>A bias in sampling exists in this study. Whereas chronic Q fever affects 20 times fewer patients than the acute form of the disease, most of the human isolates used here were from chronic disease patients, and the isolates from acute infections were mainly obtained from France. However, our collection of isolates contained 2 isolates presenting an identical MST-genotype to the putative epidemic clones, which came from a patient suffering from chronic Q fever in Marseille (CB74) and from the placenta of a goat in Germany (Z3055). The 2 isolates revealed comparable, but different gene repertoires and were associated with different genomotypes.</p><p>Surprisingly, the comparative genomic analysis of our isolate collection revealed that animal isolates (especially from arthropods) exhibited fewer deleted genes globally than human isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0025781-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). All isolates from hard ticks presented gene content identical to the Nine Mile I strain. Beare et <italic>al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0025781-Beare2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> previously found that two isolates associated with hard ticks exhibited identical gene content to NMI (Dugway 5G61-63 and BDT 1), and <italic>C. burnetii</italic> has been identified in many species of ticks <xref rid="pone.0025781-Mediannikov1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>A major limitation of our study is that we only used the genome of the reference strain Nine Mile to design the microarray <xref rid="pone.0025781-Seshadri1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. It was the only genome available at the beginning of our study, and the addition of sequences from other strains may contribute to a better understanding of the <italic>C. burnetii</italic> cycle and Q fever pathophysiology. However, we found here, for the first time, that isolates from hard ticks exhibit the same gene content and probably the same origin. Moreover, we observed the loss of 4 putative genes associated with virulence, fuelling the hypothesis that bacterial pathogenicity is driven more by gene loss than gene gain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0025781.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
