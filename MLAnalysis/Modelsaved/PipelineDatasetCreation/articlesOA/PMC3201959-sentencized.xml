</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>C. burnetii is a Gram-negative intracellular Y-proteobacteria that causes Q fever, which is a zoonotic disease with a worldwide distribution [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Q fever can manifest as an acute or chronic illness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Acute Q fever is typically a self-limiting febrile illness during which pneumonia or hepatitis can occur, whereas chronic Q fever is a severe illness in which patients can present endocarditis, vascular infection, osteomyelitis and chronic hepatitis [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The major route of contamination with C. burnetii is aerosol. C. burnetii displays antigenic variation in its lipopolysaccharides (LPS) [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Phase I is highly infectious and corresponds to the natural phase found in animals, including humans and arthropods, whereas phase II is not very infectious, presents truncated LPS and can be obtained after several passages in cell culture or from embryonated eggs [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The C. burnetii genome was sequenced in 2003, and its size is approximately 2 Mbp, with a plasmid of approximately 38 kbp [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Recently, 3 new isolates of this species were sequenced [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Analysis of 16S rDNA gene sequencing data has shown that C. burnetii strains isolated from a variety of geographical areas and various hosts display considerable genetic homogeneity [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of genomic DNA (gDNA) [6]–[8] and sequence and/or PCR-RFLP analysis [9]–[12] of specific genes reveal genetic diversity between C. burnetii isolates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The most extensive survey of C. burnetii genetic diversity was reported by Glazunova et al. [13], who used multi-spacer typing (MST) to genotype approximately 150 C. burnetii isolates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>More recently, a comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis was performed on a collection a 24 strains of C. burnetii [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The availability of the C. burnetii genome sequence allows a rapid assessment of whole-genome sequence variation by using comparative genome hybridization (CGH) on microarrays, allowing the determination of correlations between the genome repertoire and the source of the organisms. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>A long controversy related to the virulence of different isolates of C. burnetii was resolved recently [13], [15]–[18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>All types of strains can be isolated from chronic infections that are determined more by host factors than by bacterial factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only particular strains have been isolated from acute infections, and the prototype strain, Nine Mile, has been found to cause acute infection at a lower inoculum concentration than the strain Q212, which is found in association with chronic infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Therefore, there is a difference of the virulence of strains in causing acute infection that is correlated with the genotype, as determined by MST, genomotyping or plasmid typing. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Q fever is currently re-emerging in different areas in Europe, with a major outbreak of Q fever observed in the Netherlands (causing both acute and chronic infections) [19] and in US military personnel in Iraq [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>These C. burnetii outbreaks bring to the forefront the question of bacterial clonality, which could be related to distribution of highly virulent clones. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, the apparent massive increase in cases of Q fever could be related to improved detection or increased risk of exposure to animal reservoirs [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The widespread outbreak that is presently occurring in the Netherlands has been the focus of numerous molecular biology investigations, including one that indicated that a single genotype, or at least a reduction of heterogeneity, was implicated in the outbreak [19], [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>We had the opportunity to test this genotype using MST methods [13] and found that the putative clone responsive for the outbreak was identical to a strain isolated from an infected sheep vagina in Germany over 10 years ago and several strains isolated from humans in France. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Although these large outbreaks seem to be related to exposure to domestic and wild animals, the role of arthropods in Q fever transmission has to be considered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The role of ticks as vectors and reservoirs has been discussed since 1937. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Ticks may be infected by C. burnetii during feeding; excrete it via feces, saliva and coxal fluid; and transmit it transovarially and transstadially. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The reference strain Nine Mile was isolated from a Dermacentor andersoni hard tick, and Q fever was initially presumed to be a vector-borne disease [22]–[25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>At present, ticks are rare vectors for transmission of Q fever [26]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>In this study, we compared 52 isolates from patients and animals (mammals, bird and ticks) from the C. burnetii strain collection housed in our laboratory, including 2 isolates presenting the same MST genotype as the putative epidemic clone from the Netherlands using DNA whole-genome microarrays to perform genomotyping to investigate associations of the gene repertoire, source and clinical information for C. burnetii. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the genomic content of 52 isolates of C. burnetii compared to the reference strain NMI using a global genomic approach based on comparative genomic hybridization by whole-genome microarray. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>A previous CGH analysis of C. burnetii was performed on 23 different isolates and two antigenic variants of NMI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Our collection included 3 strains in common with those used by Beare et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>(NMI, S217 and HzS), which were used as positive controls in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Although microarray used in the previous study has many more probes (covering approximately 30% of coding) compared to our home-made microarray (5% of coding sequence), we found high homologies between our results and those of Beare et al. [14] (Figure S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>In this regard, we conclude that we obtained robust and confirmed data to perform genomotyping with our microarray results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Several typing methods have been developed for the causative agent of Q fever [5], [7], [8], [10], [12]–[14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Glazunova et al. [13] and Beare et al. [14] showed that these different methods of typing are globally congruent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>In our study, we compared whole-genome typing with MST methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>This comparison showed that the two methods produced a similar clusterization of isolates within three groups with significantly divergent gene content (Figure 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Thus, the different isolates of C. burnetii present divergent evolution of the three groups that is independent of geographic origin and clinical context, as previously proposed by Glazunova et al. [13] and Beare et al. [14]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>In several animal models, both the amount of inoculum used and the strain influence the presence and manifestations of acute pneumonia during Q fever [17], [18], [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>However, there is no evidence that isolates from chronic and acute human infections differ when large collections are screened by different methods of typing [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>A preliminary analysis based on MST-typing showed that acute Q fever was induced by isolates belonging to MST genotypes 1, 2, 4, 16 and 18 and that the plasmid QpDV was highly associated with acute Q fever. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Isolates from chronic infections were associated with all MST-genotypes and all of the observed plasmid types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>In our study, we found that only genomotypes A2, A3, B4 and B5 contained isolates from acute infections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Based on these associations, we found four deleted or highly divergent ORFs with unknown functions that were significantly associated with acute Q fever. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the previous microarray genomic analysis showed that isolates from acute infections had a comparable gene repertoire to that of genomotype B1 [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Because no genomotype was specifically associated with chronic Q fever, we confirmed that all isolates could be involved in chronic infections, as previously proposed [13], [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Previously, Beare et al. has mainly associated acute Q fever with B1 genomotype [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>We described four additional genomotypes that were associated with acute infections compared to the previous study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Based on the results obtained using previous methods of typing collected isolates and on studies of acute Q fever in animal models, we have schematically represented the putative factors involved in Q fever infections (Figure 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>After the primary infection, we speculate that minimal inoculum is necessary to induce acute manifestations in case of the strain present specific plasmids, MST genotypes or genomotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>The chronic manifestation could be induced by all the strains whether the host presents favorable clinical field. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Whereas chronic Q fever affects 20 times fewer patients than the acute form of the disease, most of the human isolates used here were from chronic disease patients, and the isolates from acute infections were mainly obtained from France. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>However, our collection of isolates contained 2 isolates presenting an identical MST-genotype to the putative epidemic clones, which came from a patient suffering from chronic Q fever in Marseille (CB74) and from the placenta of a goat in Germany (Z3055). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>The 2 isolates revealed comparable, but different gene repertoires and were associated with different genomotypes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the comparative genomic analysis of our isolate collection revealed that animal isolates (especially from arthropods) exhibited fewer deleted genes globally than human isolates (Figure 2A). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Beare et al. [14] previously found that two isolates associated with hard ticks exhibited identical gene content to NMI (Dugway 5G61-63 and BDT 1), and C. burnetii has been identified in many species of ticks [26]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>A major limitation of our study is that we only used the genome of the reference strain Nine Mile to design the microarray [3]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we observed the loss of 4 putative genes associated with virulence, fuelling the hypothesis that bacterial pathogenicity is driven more by gene loss than gene gain. </plain></SENT>
