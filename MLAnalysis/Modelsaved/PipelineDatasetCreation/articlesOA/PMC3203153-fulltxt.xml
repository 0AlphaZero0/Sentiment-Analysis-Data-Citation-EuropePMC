We demonstrated that hsa-miR-96 is significantly and consistently up-regulated in all 6 NSCLCs. We validated this result in an independent set of 35 paired tumors and their adjacent normal tissues, as well as their sera that are collected before surgical resection or chemotherapy, and the results suggested that hsa-miR-96 may play an important role in NSCLC development and has great potential to be used as a noninvasive marker for diagnosing NSCLC. We predicted potential miRNA target mRNAs based on different methods (TargetScan and miRanda). Further classification of miRNA regulated genes based on their relationship with miRNAs revealed that hsa-miR-96 and certain other miRNAs tend to down-regulate their target mRNAs in NSCLC development, which have expression levels permissive to direct interaction between miRNAs and their target mRNAs. In addition, we identified a significant correlation of miRNA regulation with genes coincide with high density of CpG islands, which suggests that miRNA may represent a primary regulatory mechanism governing basic cellular functions and cell differentiations, and such mechanism may be complementary to DNA methylation in repressing or activating gene expression.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Currently, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer death in the world<xref rid="pone.0026502-Cancer1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Surgical resection is mainly performed in early-stage cases and is also effective, but its effect is limited for patients with locally advanced cancers because of the high rate of distant metastasis and recurrence. Thus, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, as well as a combination of both, are always performed in the treatment of patients with locally advanced cancers. However, the 5-year survival rate of lung cancer patients decreases dramatically with clinical stages of the disease, for instance, from an estimated 61% for patients with the stage IA disease to 38% for patients with the stage IB disease. Other stage-related 5-year survival rate of the disease are 34% for patients with IIA disease, 13% for patients with stage IIIA disease, 5% for patients with stage IIIB disease, and 1% for patients with stage IV <xref rid="pone.0026502-Martini1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026502-Hoffman1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026502-Flehinger1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026502-Mountain1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Most lung cancer patients are only diagnosed after tumors have spread beyond their primary sites, and this is an important reason for the poor outcome of lung cancer treatments. In addition, variation analysis among a variety of cancers suggested that lung cancer has larger number of mutated genes than other cancers <xref rid="pone.0026502-Kan1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Therefore, the discovery of effective diagnostic markers and interrogating mechanisms of lung cancer development, are both necessary for improving the survival rate of lung cancer patients.</p><p>miRNAs are short non-coding RNAs (&#8764;22 nt long) that bind complementary sequences in target mRNAs, resulting in their selective degradation or selective inhibition of translation. Therefore, through regulating their target genes, miRNAs are known to be involved in a wide range of biological functions, such as cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0026502-LagosQuintana1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026502-Hutvagner1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.

In NSCLC, it has been suggested that miR-31 may act as an oncogenic miRNA by repressing tumor suppressors: LATS2 and PPP2R2A <xref rid="pone.0026502-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and expression of hsa-miR-205 has been suggested to be able to distinguish squamous from nonsquamous non-small-cell lung carcinoma <xref rid="pone.0026502-Lebanony1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In addition, evidences show that high hsa-mir-155 and low hsa-let-7a-2 expression correlated with poor survival of lung cancer patients <xref rid="pone.0026502-Yanaihara1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and has-miRNA-126 may promote NSCLC cells apoptosis induced by irradiation through the PI3K-Akt pathway <xref rid="pone.0026502-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. miRNAs are now emerging as highly tissue-specific biomarkers for discriminate cancers from noncancerous tissue, and different cancer types, as well as different prognostic results <xref rid="pone.0026502-Yanaihara1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026502-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>mRNA profiling have revealed that transcriptional abnormality of many genes are responsible for the development of NSCLC <xref rid="pone.0026502-Saviozzi1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026502-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, and differential expression of miRNAs also have been detected between lung cancer tissues and the adjacent normal tissues <xref rid="pone.0026502-Yanaihara1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026502-Jeong1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.

Once in the cytoplasm, miRNAs are cleaved further by the enzyme DICER <xref rid="pone.0026502-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026502-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, and this results in 17&#8211;24 nt miRNAs that are associated with a cellular complex that is similar to the RNA-induced silencing complex that participates in RNA interference. However, miRNAs mainly regulate mRNA translation, whereas siRNAs direct RNA destruction via the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway <xref rid="pone.0026502-Hutvagner1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026502-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Therefore, the abundance of miRNAs may mainly depend on its original expression and not imported exogenously. In addition, several lines of evidence suggest that elevation of miRNA expression lead to down-regulation of the target genes, and reduction of miRNA expression lead to up-regulation of the target genes <xref rid="pone.0026502-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026502-Poy1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. We therefore hypothesize that the effect of miRNAs on their target mRNAs is expression level-dependent. We used a novel measure to evaluate miRNA regulation, termed <italic>regulation value</italic>. We first assume that a regulation value of a miRNA is positively correlated with its expression level. Since a miRNA always has more than one target genes <xref rid="pone.0026502-Doench1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, we then assume that a regulation value of a given miRNA is negatively correlated with the number of its targets. Therefore, we define a regulation value for miRNA as the deviation in expression level for a given miRNA divided by the number of expressed mRNA targets.</p><p>During cancer development, the regulation may vary from case to control for a given miRNA and, therefore, regulation value of a given miRNA equals to the variation of miRNA expression divided by the number of expressed targets. When the expression of a miRNA is down-regulated in cancers, its regulation value becomes negative if the number of its expressed targets is not changed significantly. For a target mRNA, its regulation value is the sum of all regulation values from its regulatory miRNA. Based on these definitions, we classified all differentially expressed genes in cancers into different groups based on their correlations&#8212;correlated or anti-correlated with miRNA regulation. Before doing this, we predicted the potential target genes of these consistently up- or down-regulated miRNAs.</p><p>We used three methods to predict the potential targets of miRNAs. The software TargetScan focuses more on miRNA seed (2-8nt in the 5&#8242; region of mature miRNA), as evidence suggests the importance of this region for miRNA target recognition <xref rid="pone.0026502-Lewis1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026502-Lewis2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026502-Brennecke1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026502-Krek1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In addition, the sequence conservation of target sites has been considered as an important feature to reduce false-positive rate <xref rid="pone.0026502-Lewis2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. We therefore predicted potential miRNA targets using TargetScan and conserved target sites among vertebrates or mammals using <italic>P</italic>
<sub>CT</sub> method of TargetScan <xref rid="pone.0026502-Friedman1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. However, seed sites do not always confer repression, and the software miRanda also takes into consideration of other region of miRNA in addition to seed sites <xref rid="pone.0026502-Enright1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. We then used miRanda as another alternative method to predict miRNA targets. The two software were frequently used to predict miRNA targets, and in addition, both of them can be used to predict targets of novel miRNAs as the illuminia miRNA microarray "humanMI_V2" contains many novel miRNAs that are generated from next-generation sequencing efforts worldwide. We obtained 16,160 conserved miRNA-target pairs among vertebrates or mammals using <italic>P</italic>
<sub>CT</sub> method of TargetScan (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026502.s011">Table S6</xref>), 70,320 miRNA-target pairs by using TargetScan without considering the conservation condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026502.s013">Table S8</xref>), and 77,988 miRNA-target pairs by using miRanda (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026502.s015">Table S10</xref>). We observed that 48,841 miRNA-target pairs were present in both TargetScan and miRanda results (69.46% of TargetScan results, 62.63% of miRanda results), and 12,403 miRNA-target pairs of conserved TargetScan results were common with miRanda results (76.75% of conserved TargetScan results). Therefore, there were about 70% prediction results that were common in the two different methods, and conserved prediction results of TargetScan exhibite a larger proportion of shared genes.</p><p>We firstly used the conserved prediction results to classify mRNAs based on their relationship with miRNA regulation. In particular, we defined 197 and 190 genes as anti-correlated and correlated, respectively, and 1,491 as &#8220;others&#8221;, whose miRNA regulation values are null (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026502.s012">Table S7</xref>). We further investigated the distribution of miRNA regulation value, gene expression level and the potential relationship between these two parameters. In the 197 anti-correlated genes, 171 (account for 13.18% of 1, 297 down-regulated genes) were down-regulated and 26 (account for 4.48% of 581 up-regulated genes) were up-regulated. Gene distribution based on the regulation value also suggested that the anti-correlated group were always down-regulated by miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026502-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). In the 190 correlated genes, 140 (account for 10.79% of 1, 297 down-regulated genes) were down-regulated and 50 (account for 8.61% of 581 up-regulated genes) were up-regulated. Gene distribution based on the regulation value suggested that the correlated group were always down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026502-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). For 1,491 genes in &#8220;others&#8221;, 986 (account for 76.02% of 1,297 down-regulated genes) were down-regulated and 505 (account for 86.92% of 581 up-regulated genes) were up-regulated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0026502-t003">Table 3</xref>). In conclusion, these results indicate that miRNAs tend to down-regulate gene expression, especially for those of the anti-correlated group.

In all genes expressed in NSCLC, HCG genes were not seen as dominant in highly expressed genes as compared to LCG or ICG genes. The peak expressions of HCG range from 5 to 10, whereas those of ICG or LCG genes are in a range of 2 to 7. miRNA tends to regulate more genes at the relative expression level of 5 to 10, therefore, when regulated by miRNAs, the peak of ICG or LCG gene expressions should be in this range, and we observed that there were less LCG genes in this expression range as compared to HCG or ICG genes. However, &#8220;others&#8221; (genes with no regulation value variation) also has a peak in the expression range but there was no difference in gene density among the three CpG classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026502-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). In summary, HCG genes may be enriched genes that are regulated by miRNAs due to their high expression levels, but this is obviously not the only reason.</p><p>We also performed GO analysis between the miRNA-regulated and miRNA-insensitive groups to show that their genes and functions are different from the anti-correlated and the correlated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026502-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026502.s005">Figure S5</xref>).

The down-regulated genes are found to be predominantly enriched in immune systems as well as those localized on cell membranes, which are usually correlated with cell-cell communication and participate in immune process. Inhibitions of these genes have been supposed to facilitate lung cancer development and progression, and this may to some extent due to the escape of cancer cells from detection and destruction by the host immune system <xref rid="pone.0026502-Nambu1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026502-Shimada1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026502-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p><p>In miRNA profiling comparison, we found hsa-miR-96 was significantly up-regulated in NSCLC. 48 hsa-miR-96 potential targets were predominantly enriched in the down-regulated mRNA group and are involved in a variety of biological processes according to GO annotations. Based on regulation value estimates, we showed that 42 of them belong to the anti-correlated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026502-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026502.s012">Table S7</xref>). Our validation experiments revealed that the mature form of hsa-miR-96 is highly expressed not only in cancer tissues but also in sera of cancer patients. This result suggests that hsa-miR-96 has a great potential to be used as a noninvasive biomarker for NSCLC diagnosis.</p><p>Our current knowledge about hsa-miR-96 is rather limited. It resides in the intergenic area between NRF1 and UBE2H on human chromosome 7 <xref rid="pone.0026502-Mourelatos1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> and has a very broad distribution among animals, from nematodes to mammals, and is more conserved among vertebrates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026502.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Previous studies have suggested that it functions to regulate the progression of differentiation in mammalian cochlear inner and outer hair cells <xref rid="pone.0026502-Kuhn1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, and is associated with aggressive human behaviors <xref rid="pone.0026502-Jensen1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. In the relationship with cancers, hsa-miR-96 has been reported to be highly expressed in bladder cancer <xref rid="pone.0026502-Han1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, prostate carcinoma <xref rid="pone.0026502-Schaefer1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, and chronic myeloid leukemia <xref rid="pone.0026502-Agirre1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. It can be detected in urine and is correlated with stage and grade based on urinary cytology of urothelial carcinoma <xref rid="pone.0026502-Yamada1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>.

In our assays, we found a set of potential targets that may correlate with the function of hsa-miR-96 in NSCLC development, but none of the potential targets have been validated by experiments. Therefore, further experimentation is of essence in revealing relationship between hsa-miR-96 and NSCLC. In addition, we will increase the size of the specimen to investigate possible relationship of hsa-miR-96 expression with prognosis, and other characteristics of NSCLC.</p><p>In General, miRNAs are believed to bind the 3&#8242; untranslated region of a target mRNA and down-regulate its expression at mRNA or protein levels but mostly at mRNA level <xref rid="pone.0026502-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Therefore, when the expression of a miRNA is elevated, mRNAs that are regulated by the miRNA is expected to be down-regulated; when the expression of miRNA is repressed, its target mRNAs should show up-regulations. However, according to our results, the anti-correlated mRNAs are always down-regulated and only a small fraction of genes are up-regulated. Further examination suggested that in the anti-correlated group, down-regulated mRNAs are always highly expressed, and up-regulated mRNAs are always lowly expressed. Therefore, the existence of more highly expressed genes may be an important contributor to the effect. The reason why highly-expressed mRNAs tend to be down-regulated by miRNAs and the lowly-expressed mRNAs tend to be up-regulated by miRNAs suggests an existence of a regulatory balance that functions to keep the entire transcriptome in an optimized dynamic range.</p><p>In our analysis, we failed to find any clues that are responsible for the difference between the anti-correlate and the correlated mRNAs. GO classification did not show any obvious difference either (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026502.s005">Figure S5</xref>). In addition, expression levels of the target mRNAs that have a high regulation value did not show significant variation, and vice versa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026502.s007">Table S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026502.s008">Table S3</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026502.s012">Table S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026502.s014">Table S9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026502.s016">Table S11</xref>), and genes whose expression are significantly varied are not necessarily significantly regulated. Since a mRNA is often regulated by more than one miRNAs <xref rid="pone.0026502-Doench1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, we are still unable to know how these miRNAs interact with one another, and which kind of direct interactions are most effective. Furthermore, miRNAs may repress their target genes only at the protein level <xref rid="pone.0026502-Wang3" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> and the targets may not exhibit noticeable changes at the mRNA level. There are other factors that are involved in regulating mRNAs at epigenetic levels, such as histone methylation <xref rid="pone.0026502-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026502-Vaissiere1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> and acetylation <xref rid="pone.0026502-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026502-Tani1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, and that are always capable of interfering with miRNA-centric networks <xref rid="pone.0026502-Dickstein1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026502-Roccaro1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, making deciphering such networks more difficult.</p><p>Another interesting observation is that genes in either the correlated group or the anti-correlated group have a larger proportion of HCG genes than that in &#8220;others&#8221; group. Both the correlated and the anti-correlated groups are considered most likely to be influenced or possibly regulated by miRNAs. This result suggests that miRNAs tend to regulate HCG genes. Further investigation demonstrated that HCG genes tended to express at a higher level when compared with ICG or LCG genes. Therefore, there may be a possibility that more HCG genes are influenced by miRNAs. However, comparisons based on all potential targets failed to show any difference among these groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026502-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). As the stringent standard selected targets have conserved binding sites of miRNAs among vertebrates or mammals, more HCG target genes in miRNA-influenced group may correlate with gene evolution among vertebrates.</p><p>GO comparison between the regulated and the unregulated groups demonstrated they were quite different as the former always contains more genes involved in transcription regulation, nucleic acid binding, cell communication, metabolic, and development regulation. The function of genes and their expression is always correlated with the CpG island content of promoters. It has been suggested that house-keeping functions are significantly overrepresented in the HCG class, whereas terms associated with specific functions characteristic of more differentiated or highly regulated cells are significantly overrepresented in the LCG class <xref rid="pone.0026502-Saxonov1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026502-Sharif1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. miRNA has been proposed to be a primary regulation mechanism as it is present from low to high organisms, it therefore may prefer to regulate a higher proportion of HCG genes for basic cellular functions. These are possible reasons why miRNA regulation may be more biased toward HCG genes.</p><p>DNA methylation plays a role in the repression of gene expression in animal cells, but in many cells, most genes are inactive even their CpG island-containing promoters remain unmethylated <xref rid="pone.0026502-Weber1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026502-Bird1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. This implies that there may be other regulatory mechanisms involved, such as histone modifications and miRNAs. Inactive HCG genes were more frequently unmathylated as compared with ICG or LCG genes, and it was most likely that the role of enriched demethylated H3K4 is to protect CpG islands from methylation <xref rid="pone.0026502-Weber1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In addition, a broad H3 hyperacetylation in CpG islands has been reported <xref rid="pone.0026502-Roh1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. Therefore, histone modifications are most likely to affect DNA methylation regulated gene repression, and an increasing number of evidence has confirmed this conclusion <xref rid="pone.0026502-Edwards1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026502-Okitsu1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>.

For an mRNA, it can be regulated by a variety of miRNAs, so the regulation value is calculated by the addition of regulation value variations over all variable miRNAs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0026502.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Histological images of lung tumor tissues and the adjacent normal lung tissues.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0026502.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0026502.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>GO results of the 48 down-regulated conserved targets of hsa-miR-96 (predicted using TargetScan).C</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0026502.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0026502.s003"><label>Figure S3</label><caption><p>GO results of the anti-correlated genes (predicted using TargetScan, and the conserved target sites were chosen).</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0026502.s003.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0026502.s004"><label>Figure S4</label><caption><p>Mature sequence alignment of hsa-miR-96 in different species.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0026502.s004.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0026502.s005"><label>Figure S5</label><caption><p>Different GO terms between the anti-correlated group and the correlated group.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0026502.s005.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0026502.s006"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Information for the 35 patients that were used in qRT-PCR examination and the 6 patients that were used in performing microarray.</p><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0026502.s006.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0026502.s007"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p>Up-regulated genes in NSCLC cancer tissue compared with the adjacent normal tissue.</p><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0026502.s007.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0026502.s008"><label>Table S3</label><caption><p>Down-regulated genes in NSCLC cancer tissue compared with the adjacent normal tissue.</p><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0026502.s008.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0026502.s009"><label>Table S4</label><caption><p>Up-regulated miRNAs in NSCLC cancer tissue compared with the adjacent normal tissue.</p><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0026502.s009.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0026502.s010"><label>Table S5</label><caption><p>Down-regulated miRNAs in NSCLC cancer tissue compared with the adjacent normal tissue.</p><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0026502.s010.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0026502.s011"><label>Table S6</label><caption><p>Target genes (predicted using <italic>P</italic>
