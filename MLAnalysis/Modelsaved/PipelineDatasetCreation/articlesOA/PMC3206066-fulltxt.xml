We initially looked for unbalanced genomic rearrangements in the Sox2 locus in 42 GBM samples and found that Sox2 was amplified in 11.5% and overexpressed in all the samples. These results prompted us to further investigate the mechanisms involved in Sox2 overexpression in GBM. We analyzed the methylation status of the Sox2 promoter because high CpG density promoters are associated with key developmental genes. The Sox2 promoter presented a CpG island that was hypomethylated in all the patient samples when compared to normal cell lines. Treatment of Sox2-negative glioma cell lines with 5-azacitidine resulted in the re-expression of Sox2 and in a change in the methylation status of the Sox2 promoter. We further confirmed these results by analyzing data from GBM cases generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas project. We observed Sox2 overexpression (86%; N&#8202;=&#8202;414), Sox2 gene amplification (8.5%; N&#8202;=&#8202;492), and Sox 2 promoter hypomethylation (100%; N&#8202;=&#8202;258), suggesting the relevance of this factor in the malignant phenotype of GBMs. To further explore the role of Sox2, we performed in vitro analysis with brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs) and established glioma cell lines. Downmodulation of Sox2 in BTSCs resulted in the loss of their self-renewal properties. Surprisingly, ectopic expression of Sox2 in established glioma cells was not sufficient to support self-renewal, suggesting that additional factors are required. Furthermore, we observed that ectopic Sox2 expression was sufficient to induce invasion and migration of glioma cells, and knockdown experiments demonstrated that Sox2 was essential for maintaining these properties. Altogether, our data underscore the importance of a pleiotropic role of Sox2 and suggest that it could be used as a therapeutic target in GBM.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Therapy for malignant gliomas is currently suboptimal. A better understanding of the cellular and molecular features of these tumors should propel the development of more effective therapies. In 2004, two independent groups identified brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs) as the tumor-initiating cells of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) <xref rid="pone.0026740-Galli1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026740-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. This population of cells is thought to be responsible for the invariable recurrence of GBM after treatment. BTSCs possess traits similar to those of neural stem cells, such as the property of self-renewal and the expression of several embryonic stem cell markers. Moreover, a link has been reported between aberrant expression levels of these embryonic stem cell markers and the histological grade of gliomas <xref rid="pone.0026740-BenPorath1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026740-Schmitz1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Thus, abnormalities in genes and pathways involved in the regulation of stem cell self-renewal seem to be important in the stem cell model of cancer. In agreement with this notion, Sox2, a critical transcription regulator of embryonic and neural normal stem cell function <xref rid="pone.0026740-BenPorath1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026740-Schmitz1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, has been reported to be dysregulated in several human cancers. Sox2 was found to be frequently downregulated in gastric cancers <xref rid="pone.0026740-Otsubo1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and overexpressed in small-cell lung cancers, esophageal squamous carcinomas, and basal cell-like breast carcinomas <xref rid="pone.0026740-BenPorath1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026740-Hussenet1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026740-Bass1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In addition, the Sox2 locus was shown to be amplified in small-cell lung cancer, esophageal squamous carcinomas <xref rid="pone.0026740-Hussenet1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026740-Bass1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and, to a lesser extent, in GBM <xref rid="pone.0026740-Annovazzi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Although overexpression of Sox2 mRNA has been reported in malignant gliomas when compared with nonmalignant tissue <xref rid="pone.0026740-Schmitz1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, an exhaustive molecular and mechanistic analysis of Sox2 has never been performed. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to further investigate the status of Sox2 in GBM at the molecular level and to elucidate how this transcription factor contributes to the malignant phenotype of this lethal disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>First, we investigated Sox2 expression in two independent cohorts of 30 and 10 human surgical GBM specimens, respectively. We found that Sox2 was overexpressed at the protein level in all the analyzed tumors in the first cohort (30/30), and screening revealed mRNA overexpression in 90% of the specimens in the second cohort (9/10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026740-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). Interestingly, Sox2-positive cells were frequently observed in the invasive tumoral front, but endothelial and inflammatory cells did not stain positive for Sox2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026740-g001">Figure 1A</xref>; and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026740.s001">Figure S1A</xref>; and data not shown). Since overexpression could be due to unbalanced genomic rearrangements in the Sox2 locus, we analyzed the genetic information of these tumors to determine Sox2 amplification and found that Sox2 was amplified in 3/30 (10% incidence) and 3/10 (30% incidence) of these samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026740-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0026740-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0026740.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Molecular analysis of Sox2 in GBM specimens.</title><p>

Sox2 mRNA expression was significantly higher in BTSCs than in the established glioma cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026740.s001">Figure S1B</xref>), and Sox2 protein was more frequently detected in BTSCs (6/7) than in established glioma cell lines (4/8) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026740.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). Sox2 amplification was present in both BTSCs (2/7) and established glioma cell lines (1/7) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026740.s001">Figure S1D</xref>). These results prompted us to further investigate the mechanisms involved in Sox2 overexpression in GBM. We first analyzed the methylation status of the Sox2 promoter because high-CpG-density promoters are associated with key developmental genes <xref rid="pone.0026740-Saxonov1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Our data revealed that the Sox2 promoter presented an extensive CpG island before the transcription start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026740-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) that included part of the coding region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026740.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). Analysis using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction ([PCR] MSP) of 12 GBM samples showed that the Sox2 promoter was hypomethylated in all 12 samples when compared to normal human astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026740-g002">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026740.s002">S2B</xref>). Assessment of Sox2 promoter methylation status in BTSCs and established glioma cell lines confirmed that the Sox2 promoter was hypomethylated in Sox2-expressing cell lines. In contrast, Sox2-negative cell lines exhibited a methylated promoter pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026740.s001">Figure S1B and S2B</xref>). Interestingly, this hypomethylated pattern in the Sox2 promoter mirrors the one found in neural precursor cells <xref rid="pone.0026740-Shimozaki1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026740-Blelloch1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026740-Mikkelsen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, suggesting that GBMs and BTSCs display a more undifferentiated phenotype. To rule out other possible epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, we treated two Sox2-negative cell lines (U-87 MG and T98G) with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) or with the DNA methyl-transferase inhibitor 5-azacitidine (AZA). Treatment with AZA, but not TSA, resulted in the re-expression of Sox2 at the mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026740-g002">Figure 2C and 2D</xref>), further supporting a pivotal role of aberrant DNA promoter demethylation in the regulation of Sox2 levels in GBM.</p><fig id="pone-0026740-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0026740.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Methylation analysis of the <italic>Sox2</italic> promoter gene.</title><p>

Downmodulation of Sox2 jeopardized the neurosphere-forming activity, as indicated by the results of both clonal neurosphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026740-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) and limited dilution assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026740.s003">Figure S3A</xref>), and drove the cells to display a differentiation expression profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026740-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), thus indicating impairment of the self-renewal phenotype of BTSCs. Moreover, suppression of Sox2 prompted a decrease in cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026740-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), a decrease in bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026740-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 cell cycle phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026740.s003">Figure S3B</xref>), and a decrease in proliferation markers such as E2F1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026740.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). These phenotypic modifications were evidenced by the generation of smaller neurospheres from Sox2-knockdown cells than from parental BTSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026740-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). These data indicate Sox2 is involved in the maintenance of a more undifferentiated phenotype that includes the capacity of self-renewal. We further confirmed these data in another BTSC line, NSC11 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026740.s004">Figure S4A</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026740.s004">S4D</xref>). Strikingly, when we introduced Sox2 in the Sox2-negative established cell line U-87 MG, we did not observe the acquisition of self-renewal or neurosphere-forming properties (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026740.s005">Figure S5A</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026740.s005">S5D</xref>), although we detected a modest but significant increase in cell viability and proliferation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026740.s005">Figure S5E and S5F</xref>). Similarly, established glioma cultures with endogenous Sox2 overexpression did not display neurosphere formation when cultured in enriched growth factor medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026740-g005">Figure 5G</xref>). Collectively, our data indicate that Sox2 is essential but not sufficient to sustain self-renewal and that other factors cooperate to activate stem cell-like properties in glioma cells.</p><fig id="pone-0026740-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0026740.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Role of Sox2 in self-renewal properties of GBM.</title><p>

Interestingly, restoration of Sox2 expression in a Sox2-negative glioma cell line, U-87 MG, resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of migratory and invasive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026740-g005">Figure 5C, 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026740.s006">S6C</xref>).</p><p>Here, we present the first comprehensive report, to our knowledge, of Sox2 overexpression mechanisms in GBM and reveal a previously undescribed role of this transcription factor in the invasion and migration properties of glioma BTSCs and cell lines. We identified Sox2 promoter DNA hypomethylation as the leading mechanism responsible for Sox2 aberrant expression in GBM. The fact that the percentage of Sox2 amplification in GBMs (13%) did not justify the high frequency of Sox2 overexpression in these tumors prompted us to search for other molecular mechanisms, such as epigenetic dysregulation of the Sox2 promoter or its regulators. In this regard, DNA hypomethylation and histone acetylation are two of the mechanisms direct the pluripotency/differentiation fate of neural stem cells <xref rid="pone.0026740-Blelloch1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026740-Sikorska1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Our data revealed that Sox2 presents a high CpG density throughout the promoter. These data are in accordance with other studies that found that the Sox2 locus is flanked by two bivalent CpG islands that, under certain physiological conditions, may poise the gene for repression upon differentiation <xref rid="pone.0026740-Mikkelsen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In this regard, our results suggest that the Sox2 promoter hypomethylation we observed in GBM reflects a more primitive cellular state resembling that found in neural stem cells <xref rid="pone.0026740-Mikkelsen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Even though our findings suggest that DNA promoter hypomethylation is the major contributing factor to Sox2 overexpression, others have shown that DNA methylation patterns can be better explained by histone methylation patterns than by CpG density <xref rid="pone.0026740-Mikkelsen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026740-Meissner1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Interestingly, in embryonic and neural stem cells, the Sox2 promoter is enriched with the transcription initiation mark H3k4me3, and this mark resolves to H3k27me3 (which is known to be repressive) in differentiated cells <xref rid="pone.0026740-Mikkelsen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026740-Bernstein1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Therefore, we could not rule out that in GBM, the Sox2 promoter presents an enrichment of the positive transcription mark H3k4me3; further experiments are needed to test this hypothesis.</p><p>According to data from the present study and others <xref rid="pone.0026740-Gangemi1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, Sox2 overexpression in BTSCs is essential for maintaining the self-renewal of BTSCs, as assessed by neurosphere-forming activity and expression levels of pluripotent markers. Importantly, data from our study suggest the involvement of critical factors besides Sox2 in maintaining self-renewal. This function mimics a well-described role of Sox2 in the developing central neural system, in which Sox2 plays a critical role in maintaining the self-renewal and pluripotency of the neural stem cells <xref rid="pone.0026740-Suh1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> in a coordinated fashion with other transcriptional factors, such as Oct4 and Klf4 or c-Myc <xref rid="pone.0026740-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026740-Masui1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>Sox2 has been shown to maintain neural stem cell identity in the developing brain.

In the adult brain, Sox2 expression is retained in the neural stem cell compartment <xref rid="pone.0026740-Ferri1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Interestingly, reduced expression of Sox2 in adult mice resulted in a substantial reduction in proliferating neural precursors, suggesting an important role of Sox2 in neural stem cell maintenance or proliferation in the adult brain <xref rid="pone.0026740-Ferri1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026740-Episkopou1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In addition, our data show that Sox2-driven malignant glioma cells are highly invasive and have migratory characteristics mimicking those of neural stem cells <xref rid="pone.0026740-Cayre1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. This finding supports those of other studies which showed that Sox2 is expressed in the rostral migratory stream <xref rid="pone.0026740-Ferri1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and in the migratory cells of the developing pituitary gland <xref rid="pone.0026740-Fauquier1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>In our model, Sox2 was sufficient and essential for maintaining the invasive properties of glioma cell lines and BTSCs. However, further analysis is needed to address the in vivo role of Sox2 in the migration and invasion in GBM. On the basis of our data, we propose that Sox2 acts as an oncogene in GBM and that its reactivation in glioma cells, due to its genomic amplification and promoter hypomethylation, could be responsible for the acquisition of the invasive phenotype. Elucidation of the different Sox2-related pathways that separate normal stem cells from BTSCs should guide us in designing new and safe therapies for patients with GBM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Cell Lines and Culture Conditions</title><p>The glioma cell lines LN229, U87 MG, U251 MG, U373, A172, SNB19, D54, and T98G and the cell line NTERA2 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.

<bold>A.</bold> Assessment of invasion in Sox2-silenced BTSCs (NSC11, NSC7-26) and Sox2-positive glioma (LN229) cell lines. For transwell invasion assays NSC11, NSC6-27, or LN229 cells were left untreated or transfected with a scramble siRNA (50 nM), Sox2 (I), or Sox2(II) (50 nM; Ambion). Twenty-four h later, 1&#215;10<sup>5</sup> cells were plated in the top chamber with a Matrigel-coated membrane (24-well insert; pore size, 8 &#181;m; BD Biosciences). Cells were plated in medium without serum or growth factors, and medium supplemented with 2% serum was used as a chemoattractant in the lower chamber. The cells were then incubated for 24 h. Cells that did not invade through the pores were removed using a cotton swab. Cells on the lower surface of the membrane were stained with crystal violet and counted. Quantification of the invasion is expressed as the number of invasive cells per field. Bottom, representative micrographs of the transwell invasion assay (10&#215; magnification). <bold>B.</bold> Analysis of invasion markers in Sox2-silenced NSC11, NSC7-26 and LN229 cells. Sox2 was silenced as described above. Quantification of the expression of the indicated genes was performed using TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems) specific for each gene. <italic>GAPDH</italic> was used as an internal control. For normalization, the cDNA equivalent to input RNA was measured in duplicate for GAPDH transcripts by RT-PCR. To determine relative gene expression, we used the comparative threshold cycle method. <bold>C.</bold> Assessment of migration in Sox2-overexpressing glioma cell lines by transwell migration. U-87 MG cells were left untreated or infected with 100 MOIs of AdCMV, AdLacZ cDNA, or AdSox2. Twenty-four h later, 1&#215;10<sup>4</sup> cells were plated in the top chamber with a noncoated membrane (24-well insert; pore size, 8 &#181;m; BD Biosciences). Cells were plated in medium without serum or growth factors, and medium supplemented with 2% serum was used as a chemoattractant in the lower chamber. The cells were then incubated for 24 h. Cells that did not invade through the pores were removed using a cotton swab. Cells on the lower surface of the membrane were stained with crystal violet and counted. Top, quantification of the invasion expressed as the number of migrating cells per HPF.
