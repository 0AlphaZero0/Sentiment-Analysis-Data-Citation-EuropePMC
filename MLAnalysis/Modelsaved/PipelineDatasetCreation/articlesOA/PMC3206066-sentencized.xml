<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>A better understanding of the cellular and molecular features of these tumors should propel the development of more effective therapies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In 2004, two independent groups identified brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs) as the tumor-initiating cells of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>This population of cells is thought to be responsible for the invariable recurrence of GBM after treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>BTSCs possess traits similar to those of neural stem cells, such as the property of self-renewal and the expression of several embryonic stem cell markers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a link has been reported between aberrant expression levels of these embryonic stem cell markers and the histological grade of gliomas [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Thus, abnormalities in genes and pathways involved in the regulation of stem cell self-renewal seem to be important in the stem cell model of cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In agreement with this notion, Sox2, a critical transcription regulator of embryonic and neural normal stem cell function [3], [4], has been reported to be dysregulated in several human cancers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Sox2 was found to be frequently downregulated in gastric cancers [5] and overexpressed in small-cell lung cancers, esophageal squamous carcinomas, and basal cell-like breast carcinomas [3], [6], [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In addition, the Sox2 locus was shown to be amplified in small-cell lung cancer, esophageal squamous carcinomas [6], [7], and, to a lesser extent, in GBM [8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Although overexpression of Sox2 mRNA has been reported in malignant gliomas when compared with nonmalignant tissue [4], an exhaustive molecular and mechanistic analysis of Sox2 has never been performed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to further investigate the status of Sox2 in GBM at the molecular level and to elucidate how this transcription factor contributes to the malignant phenotype of this lethal disease. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>First, we investigated Sox2 expression in two independent cohorts of 30 and 10 human surgical GBM specimens, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>We found that Sox2 was overexpressed at the protein level in all the analyzed tumors in the first cohort (30/30), and screening revealed mRNA overexpression in 90% of the specimens in the second cohort (9/10) (Figure 1A and 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, Sox2-positive cells were frequently observed in the invasive tumoral front, but endothelial and inflammatory cells did not stain positive for Sox2 (Figure 1A; and Figure S1A; and data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Since overexpression could be due to unbalanced genomic rearrangements in the Sox2 locus, we analyzed the genetic information of these tumors to determine Sox2 amplification and found that Sox2 was amplified in 3/30 (10% incidence) and 3/10 (30% incidence) of these samples (Figure 1C and 1D). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Sox2 mRNA expression was significantly higher in BTSCs than in the established glioma cell lines (Figure S1B), and Sox2 protein was more frequently detected in BTSCs (6/7) than in established glioma cell lines (4/8) (Figure S1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Sox2 amplification was present in both BTSCs (2/7) and established glioma cell lines (1/7) (Figure S1D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>These results prompted us to further investigate the mechanisms involved in Sox2 overexpression in GBM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>We first analyzed the methylation status of the Sox2 promoter because high-CpG-density promoters are associated with key developmental genes [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Our data revealed that the Sox2 promoter presented an extensive CpG island before the transcription start site (Figure 2A) that included part of the coding region (Figure S2A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Analysis using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction ([PCR] MSP) of 12 GBM samples showed that the Sox2 promoter was hypomethylated in all 12 samples when compared to normal human astrocytes (Figure 2B and S2B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Assessment of Sox2 promoter methylation status in BTSCs and established glioma cell lines confirmed that the Sox2 promoter was hypomethylated in Sox2-expressing cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Sox2-negative cell lines exhibited a methylated promoter pattern (Figure S1B and S2B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, this hypomethylated pattern in the Sox2 promoter mirrors the one found in neural precursor cells [10], [11], [12], suggesting that GBMs and BTSCs display a more undifferentiated phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>To rule out other possible epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, we treated two Sox2-negative cell lines (U-87 MG and T98G) with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) or with the DNA methyl-transferase inhibitor 5-azacitidine (AZA). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Treatment with AZA, but not TSA, resulted in the re-expression of Sox2 at the mRNA and protein levels (Figure 2C and 2D), further supporting a pivotal role of aberrant DNA promoter demethylation in the regulation of Sox2 levels in GBM. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Downmodulation of Sox2 jeopardized the neurosphere-forming activity, as indicated by the results of both clonal neurosphere (Figure 4A) and limited dilution assays (Figure S3A), and drove the cells to display a differentiation expression profile (Figure 4B), thus indicating impairment of the self-renewal phenotype of BTSCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Moreover, suppression of Sox2 prompted a decrease in cell viability (Figure 4C), a decrease in bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation (Figure 4D), accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 cell cycle phase (Figure S3B), and a decrease in proliferation markers such as E2F1 (Figure S3C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>These phenotypic modifications were evidenced by the generation of smaller neurospheres from Sox2-knockdown cells than from parental BTSCs (Figure 4E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>These data indicate Sox2 is involved in the maintenance of a more undifferentiated phenotype that includes the capacity of self-renewal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>We further confirmed these data in another BTSC line, NSC11 (Figure S4A–S4D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, when we introduced Sox2 in the Sox2-negative established cell line U-87 MG, we did not observe the acquisition of self-renewal or neurosphere-forming properties (Figure S5A–S5D), although we detected a modest but significant increase in cell viability and proliferation (Figure S5E and S5F). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Downregulation of Sox2 using siRNA resulted in a significant decrease in the migratory (Figure 5A) and invasive capabilities (Figure 5B) of not only BTSCs (Figure S6A) but also established glioma cells that express Sox2 (Figure S6A) This phenomenon was associated with a significant decrease in the expression of several proteins involved in migration, invasion, and angiogenesis (Figure S6B). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Here, we present the first comprehensive report, to our knowledge, of Sox2 overexpression mechanisms in GBM and reveal a previously undescribed role of this transcription factor in the invasion and migration properties of glioma BTSCs and cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>We identified Sox2 promoter DNA hypomethylation as the leading mechanism responsible for Sox2 aberrant expression in GBM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>The fact that the percentage of Sox2 amplification in GBMs (13%) did not justify the high frequency of Sox2 overexpression in these tumors prompted us to search for other molecular mechanisms, such as epigenetic dysregulation of the Sox2 promoter or its regulators. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>In this regard, DNA hypomethylation and histone acetylation are two of the mechanisms direct the pluripotency/differentiation fate of neural stem cells [11], [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Our data revealed that Sox2 presents a high CpG density throughout the promoter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>These data are in accordance with other studies that found that the Sox2 locus is flanked by two bivalent CpG islands that, under certain physiological conditions, may poise the gene for repression upon differentiation [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>In this regard, our results suggest that the Sox2 promoter hypomethylation we observed in GBM reflects a more primitive cellular state resembling that found in neural stem cells [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Even though our findings suggest that DNA promoter hypomethylation is the major contributing factor to Sox2 overexpression, others have shown that DNA methylation patterns can be better explained by histone methylation patterns than by CpG density [12], [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in embryonic and neural stem cells, the Sox2 promoter is enriched with the transcription initiation mark H3k4me3, and this mark resolves to H3k27me3 (which is known to be repressive) in differentiated cells [12], [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we could not rule out that in GBM, the Sox2 promoter presents an enrichment of the positive transcription mark H3k4me3; further experiments are needed to test this hypothesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>According to data from the present study and others [17], Sox2 overexpression in BTSCs is essential for maintaining the self-renewal of BTSCs, as assessed by neurosphere-forming activity and expression levels of pluripotent markers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>Importantly, data from our study suggest the involvement of critical factors besides Sox2 in maintaining self-renewal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>This function mimics a well-described role of Sox2 in the developing central neural system, in which Sox2 plays a critical role in maintaining the self-renewal and pluripotency of the neural stem cells [18] in a coordinated fashion with other transcriptional factors, such as Oct4 and Klf4 or c-Myc [19], [20]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Sox2 has been shown to maintain neural stem cell identity in the developing brain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Constitutive expression of Sox2 inhibited neuronal differentiation and preserved neural progenitor characteristics, whereas inhibition of Sox2 led to an early onset of neuronal differentiation [21], [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>In the adult brain, Sox2 expression is retained in the neural stem cell compartment [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, reduced expression of Sox2 in adult mice resulted in a substantial reduction in proliferating neural precursors, suggesting an important role of Sox2 in neural stem cell maintenance or proliferation in the adult brain [23], [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>In addition, our data show that Sox2-driven malignant glioma cells are highly invasive and have migratory characteristics mimicking those of neural stem cells [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>This finding supports those of other studies which showed that Sox2 is expressed in the rostral migratory stream [23] and in the migratory cells of the developing pituitary gland [26]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>On the basis of our data, we propose that Sox2 acts as an oncogene in GBM and that its reactivation in glioma cells, due to its genomic amplification and promoter hypomethylation, could be responsible for the acquisition of the invasive phenotype. </plain></SENT>
