Along with other five LTPs from peach, mulberry, hazelnut, peanut, mugwort, KF LTPs, preliminary tested positive for IgE, have been immobilized on a microarray, used for IgE testing 1,003 allergic subjects. Comparative analysis has been carried out.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Alignment of Act d 10 primary structure with the other allergenic LTPs shows amino acid identities to be in a narrow range between 40 and 55%, with a number of substitutions making the sequences quite different from each other. Although peach LTP dominates the IgE immune response in terms of prevalence, epitope recognition driven by sequence heterogeneity has been recorded to be distributed in a wide range of behaviors. KF LTPs IgE positive results were obtained in a patient subset IgE positive for the peach LTP. Anyhow, the negative results on homologous molecules allowed us to reintroduce KF in patients' diet.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The biochemical nature of allergenic molecule belonging to a group of homologous ones should not be taken as proof of immunological recognition as well.

Thus there is the need for a robust understanding of all aspects characterizing IgE response to allergens, being the IgE production the first step for allergy-mediated food hypersensitivity <xref rid="pone.0027856-Johansson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. A great help in the process of a better knowledge in the field is coming from the increasing number of allergenic molecules identified so far (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.allergome.org/script/statistic.php">http://www.allergome.org/script/statistic.php</ext-link>) and made available for studies in combination with micro-technology <xref rid="pone.0027856-Mari1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Such combination allows exploring in deep details relationships among structurally distant as well as closely related homologous molecules <xref rid="pone.0027856-Scala1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>The grouping of allergens in families because of their biochemical structure is leading to assign a similar IgE immune-recognition to similar structures, furthermore supported by <italic>in silico</italic> studies <xref rid="pone.0027856-Borges1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Allergenic molecules are in fact currently considered to be a unique entity because of their biochemical definition <xref rid="pone.0027856-Ferreira1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027856-Radauer1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. That is the case of many allergen families, which got the definition of panallergens because of their distribution in certain distant subsets of living organisms rather than for their real and obvious IgE pan-recognition of protein structures <xref rid="pone.0027856-Hauser1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Recent reports based on broad IgE testing using the powerful combination mentioned above show how the IgE-mediated immune response toward homologous structure could be influenced by other factors not easily interpreted just using the molecule structures <xref rid="pone.0027856-Scala1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Nowadays there is a claim for a more personalized medicine. Such claim seems to fit perfectly in the allergy field where the clinical phenotype is tightly linked to the IgE immune recognition and each patient seems to display a different clinical picture when compared to another. Such personalized approach, formerly almost impossible because of the number of tests to be performed in each patient, is now becoming increasingly feasible because of the biotechnology/microtechnology combination supported by information technology tools recently made available for the routine work <xref rid="pone.0027856-Mari1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027856-Mari2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Plant LTPs are widely distributed, structurally related, small proteins involved in defense mechanisms. Although their lipid-binding ability has been well reported, the biological function of LTPs is still largely unknown. The plant LTP family includes two subfamilies according to their molecular masses: the 9-kDa LTP1 and the 7-kDa LTP2. Although LTP1 and LTP2 share a common compact fold consisting of four &#945;-helices stabilized by four disulfide bridges, the pairing partners of cysteines are not completely conserved between the two subfamilies, that also display a low overall sequence similarity (about 30% identity) <xref rid="pone.0027856-Yeats1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Up to now 63 LTPs have been characterized as allergens, being 46 of them expressed in edible parts of plants, almost all of them belonging to the LTP1 protein subfamily, and just two, having very preliminary reported data, to the LTP2 subfamily (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.allergome.org">www.allergome.org</ext-link>, accessed September 12, 2011).</p><p>Several reviews on the topic of LTP as allergens reported preliminary evidence of a heterogeneous behavior of this group of molecules <xref rid="pone.0027856-Salcedo1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0027856-Egger1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, but few of them suggested strategies how to overcome the peculiarity of such behavior within a routine workup <xref rid="pone.0027856-Egger1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Unless we performed a broad study on 23,077 subjects using the microarray approach, we could not have evidence of such heterogeneity as we had just the LTP from peach available on the microarray used at the time the study had been performed <xref rid="pone.0027856-Scala1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Taking advantage of the implementation of a full molecule-, microtechnology-, and information technology-based infrastructure at the Center in Rome, Italy, and of the expansion of the number of available LTPs to a panel of seven allergens, including two new proteins identified in the kiwifruits (KF), we sought to compare the LTP biochemical, immunochemical, and clinical features in order to define the extent of their heterogeneity. The study, leading first to the full characterization of KF LTPs, brought us to abandon the former interpretation of &#8220;one molecule fits all&#8221; and to search for as much differences as possible among allergenic proteins facing each allergic patient, in order to increase the quality of personal decision making he or she deserves.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Allergic subjects</title><p>The study received the approval of the Institutional ethical committee of the Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata, Rome, Italy (66/CE/2006).

A control sample, where only the buffer solution was added, was used as reference value for no IgE inhibition. A trypsin solution has been added to controls when the SPHIAa using digested preparations was performed. To control the specificity of the IgE inhibition obtained on LTP molecules, several other allergens available on the two microarrays which were recognized by the IgE of the same patient or the pool were used.

The analysis of a peak eluted at a retention time very similar to that observed for nPru p 3 allowed the identification of the LTP, namely Act c 10 and Act d 10, in the seed extracts from the gold and the green KFs, respectively, rather than from the pulp (see below). Act c 10 was eluted as a single peak, whereas Act d 10 was eluted in three overlapping peaks suggesting the presence of some isoforms. Direct protein sequencing of the purified protein allowed the identification of two different isoforms of Act d 10 (see below).

A small fraction of the molecules contained the amino acid threonine (T) rather than alanine (A) as first residue. The N-terminal sequence of nAct c 10, comprising 17 amino acid residues, was identical to that of nAct d 10 (AVSCGQVDTALTPCLTY), and no heterogeneity at the first position was observed. The complete amino acid sequence of nAct d 10 was elucidated by automated sequencing of peptides resulting from the enzymatic digestion of denatured and S-pyridilethylated protein. Most of the primary structure was obtained by aligning the amino acid sequence of peptides from trypsin and Asp-N digestions, whereas the regions corresponding to the residues 18&#8211;35 and 36&#8211;42 were obtained by sequencing peptides from chymotrypsin digestion. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027856-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows only the peptides necessary to elucidate the complete amino acid sequence. nAct d 10 comprises 92 amino acids producing a molecular mass of 9,458 Da for the most abundant isoform, having alanine at the N-terminus. The 100% sequence identity in the N-terminal region, together with the observation that nAct d 10 and nAct c 10 have the same chromatographic behavior and very similar molecular masses as estimated by mass spectrometry analyses (see below), suggested a very high structural similarity between the two proteins. Therefore, only the full nAct d 10 primary structure was elucidated. The full amino acid sequence of the nAct d 10 isoforms having alanine or threonine as N-terminal residue, and the partial N-terminal sequence of nAct c 10, have been registered in the UniProt Knowledgebase with the accession numbers P85205, P85206, and P85204, respectively.

The analysis of a peak eluted at a retention time very similar to that observed for nPru p 3 allowed the identification of nAct c 10 and nAct d 10 in the seed extracts from the gold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027856-g012">Figure 12</xref> A, left) and the green KFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027856-g012">Figure 12</xref> A, right), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027856-g012">Figure 12</xref>, panel A, upper parts), whereas that peak was lacking in the RP-HPLC profiles obtained for the pulp extracts of the two KF species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027856-g012">Figure 12</xref>, panel A, lower parts). Nevertheless, the fractions of pulp extracts eluted at the retention time of nAct d 10 and nAct c 10 were collected and analyzed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The results obtained confirmed the absence of detectable amounts of nAct d 10 and nAct c 10 in the pulp extracts. As the biochemical findings reported above seemed to be quite conclusive, to increase the confidence with the negative data we approached the issue of LTP distribution in KF tissues using the SPHIAa as well. The inhibition was performed using the same pulp and seed preparations from the green and gold KFs, along with whole KF extracts. A pool of sera having IgE for both the two KF LTPs was used as probe. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027856-g012">Figure 12</xref>, panel B, full or almost full IgE inhibition results were obtained with the whole KF extracts and the seed ones, whereas the pulp gave either no inhibition (green KF pulp on nAct c 10, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027856-g012">Figure 12</xref>, panel B) or inhibition values ranging between 18% and 28% (all other pulp/allergen combinations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027856-g012">Figure 12</xref>, panel B). These slightly positive results were replicated and could suggest the presence of minimal amount of LTP in the KF pulp not detected by the biochemical methods. The very low inhibition values were anyhow not considered conclusive, and needing a third discriminating proof. We thus performed <italic>in vivo</italic> skin testing with green KF seed and pulp preparations in 21 selected subjects. As reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027856-g012">Figure 12</xref>, panel C, the comparative analysis showed statistically significant different results between green KF seed and pulp preparations, nevertheless some of the patients did react to the pulp as better shown for individual patients in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0027856-t003">Table 3</xref>.

In addition to those reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0027856-t003">Table 3</xref>, seven subjects, who were invited to participate to the study, underwent tests foreseen in the first part, where their diagnostic profile was recorded very similar to that reported for patients 15&#8211;21 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0027856-t003">Table 3</xref> (data not shown). They declined to undergo the DBPCFC. Six of 7 reported a generalized reaction on KF ingestion sometime in the past, thus they found our nAct c 10 and nAct d 10 positive tests &#8220;sufficient to prove their clinically relevant allergy to KF&#8221;.</p><p>In the attempt to explain why the nAct c 10 or nAct d 10 positive results were not accompanied by a clinical reactivity, we simulated physiological digestion of the two KF LTPs as reported above, and, using the SPHIAa, evaluated the retained capability to induce IgE inhibition. nPru p 3 was comparatively evaluated, as it is known to be resistant to digestion. The results showed that also digestion resistant nAct c 10 and nAct d 10 are still active in the IgE inhibition assay (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>We herein report for the first time the identification of two new LTPs from the gold and the green KFs and their characterization as clinically relevant allergens. The primary structure of nAct d 10, the one from green KF, has been fully elucidated, being the one of nAct c 10 from gold KF very similar, mainly on the basis of the almost overlapping findings described throughout the present study. The identification process was straight forward as, using a panel of other KF allergens we selected patients being IgE negative for them and having just a positive IgE result for a potentially homologous molecule, namely nPru p 3. This process is highly suggested as leads to a secured evaluation of the newly identified structure, without overlapping positivity as sometimes reported in literature <xref rid="pone.0027856-Palacin1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. As the presence of still unknown KF allergens cannot be excluded, patients from the present study should be re-evaluated on the basis of a more comprehensive allergen panel.</p><p>Unless we started the identification using subjects having the double clinical reactivity to peach and KF, the first evidence that we were dealing with new allergens not being part of a tight homogeneous group of molecules came by the comparative evaluation of primary structures and the preliminary extended parallel comparative testing with the peach LTP on the 44 peach allergic subjects. The former is the biochemical evidence that Act d 10 is not closely related to anyone of the already known allergenic LTPs. In fact, the observed sequence identities are never higher than 55% and generally fall in the narrow range of 40&#8211;55%, whereas more closely related LTPs display higher values. For instance, identities of 97, 91, 88, 87 and 79% are obtained when Pru p 3 sequence is compared with Pru du 3, Pru ar 3, Pru d 3, Pru av 3, Mal d 3 ones, respectively <xref rid="pone.0027856-Ciardiello1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The alignment of Act d 10 sequence with the five LTPs included in this study (Ara h 9, Art v 3, Cor a 8, Mor n 3, Pru p 3) and the additional fifteen allergenic LTPs listed above shows that seven residues, G31, D45, R46, L53, K54, A67, S83 (Act d 10 numbering) and the 8 cysteine residues, playing a key role in the stabilization of the tertiary structure of the LTP1 proteins, are conserved in all these molecules (data not shown). The analysis of the alignment also shows that, depending on the compared sequences pair, unique combinations of conserved residues occurr. The absence of sequence regions conserved in all the LTP1 suggests that the existence of even one identical epitope, shared by all the allergenic LTP1, is unlikely. It is coincevable that a complete or partial epitope sharing can be found only when closely related LTPs are compared. The observed sequence micro-heterogeneity, mainly found in distantly related LTPs, could be thus the main cause of inhomogeneous epitope patterns producing inhomogeneous LTP IgE recognition as shown at least on the LTP1 included in the present study.</p><p>About comparative testing, our data on a huge population where just one LTP, nPru p 3, was tested did not arise such suspicion <xref rid="pone.0027856-Scala1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Reports from literature leading to characterization of new LTPs are much focusing the description of the new allergen behavior comparing it with Pru p 3, considered the prototype of LTP allergy. We could conclude the same if we stopped our allergen characterization looking at few, highly affected patients as many other reports do on allergens belonging to the same LTP family <xref rid="pone.0027856-Ciardiello1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027856-DiazPerales1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0027856-Gadermaier1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Anyhow, during the time several Authors have observed a certain inhomogeneous behavior of LTPs mainly using IgE inhibition assays or parallel testing with LTPs <xref rid="pone.0027856-Ciardiello1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027856-DiazPerales1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027856-Krause1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027856-Gadermaier1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0027856-Tordesillas1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Cited studies, always performed on a limited number of subjects, did not achieve the evidence, we are now reporting, of the highly heterogeneous behavior of LTPs, leading in our opinion to the need of a thorough testing of every single patient with the most comprehensive panel of available LTPs. More emphasis on the topic has been recently brought by Tordesillas et al. <xref rid="pone.0027856-Tordesillas1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. In their study, carried out on a limited number of subjects as well, they included LTPs biochemically-wise quite distant from each other in term of sequences, testing Pru p 3, a very close one, Mal d 3, some as distant as those used in our study (Art v 3, Sin a 3, Tri a 14) and two very remote ones (Par j 1, Ole e 7). Authors finally raised the doubt that the biochemical grouping of allergens can be misleading in the allergy diagnosis. Although Par j 1 and Par j 2 <xref rid="pone.0027856-Ciardiello1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> seem definitely placed outside the LTP IgE co-recognized molecules, additional data are required before such conclusion can be drawn at least for Ole e 7, Tri a 14, and Sin a 3.</p><p>Regarding molecule to molecule immunological relationships, some studies reported on the need of studying conformational epitopes shared or not by different LTPs <xref rid="pone.0027856-GarciaCasado1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0027856-Tordesillas2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Using the peptide display library authors searched for identification of peptides working as mimotopes of surface IgE binding regions, giving evidence of the heterogeneity of the molecule surface in LTPs. We tried to give a contribution to the molecule to molecule relationship understanding by extensively studying IgE correlations between paired molecules. IgE correlations have been already reported in few studies in a limited number of subjects, sometimes showing similar results with ours, sometime different <xref rid="pone.0027856-Hartz1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027856-Lauer1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027856-Hartz2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. In our opinion this much depend on recruitment selection criteria used to enroll patients in studies. Gadermaier et al. <xref rid="pone.0027856-Gadermaier2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> performed IgE correlation experiments on Api g 2, Art v 3, Pru p 3 on a quite large population reporting some findings shown in the present manuscript in a more comprehensive way. In the two studies the sampling bias has been avoided by enrolling patient consecutively without preliminary selection criteria and in a high number. This strategy seems to hold true also for comparing quality of different preparations of the same allergen, as in our case for nPru p 3 from two different providers. Incidentally we have been able to compare them in this high throughput study. Although the large majority of samples were double positive for the two preparations immobilized on the two microarrays, the discrepant results, mainly when high IgE levels are recorded and replicated, require further investigation focusing on both the spotting technology but mainly on the allergen preparation quality.</p><p>In the need of profiling patients reporting KF allergy, we used in collaboration with other research groups, Pru p 3 as representative LTP also for KF LTP <xref rid="pone.0027856-Bublin2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. After the findings reported in our study we presume that in that study there has been an overestimation of the KF LTP involvement in the patient profiling. Such substitutions should be discouraged as they can lead to over or underestimation of the phenomenon as might be argued for other studies <xref rid="pone.0027856-Nicolaou1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Nevertheless, unless a high number of LTPs is now available for testing, there are studies claiming the possibility of performing diagnosis and epidemiology of LTP or other allergen sensitizations by using just one representative molecule for each group <xref rid="pone.0027856-Asero2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0027856-Asero4" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Evidence of a non-homogeneous behavior of profilins as allergens has already been reported by Radauer et al. <xref rid="pone.0027856-Radauer2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Recently the heterogeneous behavior of patients toward Bet v 1 homologous molecules when describing a new Bet v 1-like molecule from green KF, Act d 11 <xref rid="pone.0027856-DAvino1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, and within the established hevein-like molecule group <xref rid="pone.0027856-Radauer3" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> have been reported. Both studies suggest how the combination of a microarray testing system and panel of molecules might be useful for describing single patient profiles and the overall molecule group picture at the same time. In a very recent paper from Gadermaier et al. <xref rid="pone.0027856-Gadermaier2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> this new approach is given for LTPs starting from Api g 2, the celery stalk LTP1. It is evident from this report that a highly selected cohort could drive to wrong conclusions, whereas exploring the behavior in a larger cohort and combining other experimental approaches as in the present study highlights the inhomogeneity of LTP as allergens. Other collaborative studies have been recently accepted for publication showing or reinforcing the demonstration of the valuable use of the multiple homologous molecule approach for Bet v 1-like, tropomyosins, profilins as pan-allergens <xref rid="pone.0027856-Hauser2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027856-Scala2" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>.</p><p>Overall we can describe the clinical relevance of our findings as follows: we found non-symptomatic subjects as in previous studies <xref rid="pone.0027856-Hartz1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027856-Hartz2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027856-Pastorello1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, or different clinical pictures to the leading Pru p 3 sensitization as described so far <xref rid="pone.0027856-Lauer2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027856-Flinterman1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. As shown in several experiments reported in the present study, each LTP shows a different recognition pattern and we could not come to our conclusions without considering such heterogeneity. Thus, level of Pru p 3 IgE cannot account of sensitization toward other LTPs, as recently proposed by Asero et al. <xref rid="pone.0027856-Asero3" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, whereas the finding of several subjects having isolated IgE positivity to single LTP should be further explored with a broader allergen panel in order to identify whether sources other than peach can account of an IgE sensitization leading to a different LTP subset. At this regard, previously reported data on Art v 3, the mugwort pollen LTP, seem to support this idea <xref rid="pone.0027856-Gadermaier1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027856-Gadermaier2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. As levels of IgE in case of isolated positivity were never high, we can speculate about single epitope IgE recognition creating the condition for a positive in vitro test but no clinical reactions. Although requiring further studies on a higher number of subjects, our approach leads to allergy test driven decision on what to exclude but, most importantly, on what to leave in patient's diet, we do consider this approach of great clinical relevance as it has never been proposed before. Having robust data coming from a broad positive and negative IgE testing will help the clinical allergist in her/his therapeutic decisions, and hopefully reduce the fear of eating any plant-derived food, typical behavior of LTP allergic patients. The re-introduction of KF under supervision in a clinical setting ready for emergencies is the suggested strategy, mostly in those patients showing discordant <italic>in vivo/in vitro</italic> results as herein reported.</p><p>After all, it remains that LTP represent a cross-sectional group of allergens having a patient's related IgE co-recognition. What should be avoided is the interpretation of LTP as part of a given allergenic source in the so called component-resolved diagnosis <xref rid="pone.0027856-Schocker1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027856-Krause1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027856-Bublin2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027856-Nicolaou1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027856-Lombardero1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0027856-SkamstrupHansen1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. This concept leads back to the allergenic extract-based diagnosis, whereas the allergist needs to be informed on the extension of the IgE recognized homologous molecules and translate that for the patients.</p><p>Last important finding of our study is the original distribution of LTP within the KF tissues. LTP is generally reported to be found on the surface of fruits, as in the case of peach <xref rid="pone.0027856-Cavatorta2" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. We found a great gap in the presence of the molecule comparing the seeds and the pulp, unless a tiny amount might be found in the latter that we considered enough to exclude the use of KF pulp separated from seed in KF allergic patients. Furthermore, this can justify why in a recent study from us where green KF were evaluated at different ripening stage we did not describe the LTP band <xref rid="pone.0027856-Ciardiello3" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. Moreover, the absence of good quantity of the LTP in the pulp raises doubts about the usefulness of the prick-prick test technique as reported negative in some subjects in the present study.</p><p>In conclusion, we suggest the use of the microarray testing system bearing panels of homologous molecules as it adds much to our comparative knowledge on biochemical, immunochemical and clinical differences between closely related structures. Clinical allergists might take advantage of missing IgE recognition of one or the other LTP for keeping the specific food in patient's diet, avoiding useless exclusion, generally leading to deterioration of patient's quality of life.</p><p>Furthermore, we herein document the need of having the microarray-based testing available for routine allergy diagnosis workup, as it creates the conditions for generating a wealth of data without selection biases and on cohorts otherwise not approachable, as we cannot exclude a different behavior of patients living in different geographical areas. As preliminary depicted in a review by us <xref rid="pone.0027856-Mari1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and more recently discussed on defining the best diagnostic approach to atopic dermatitis patients <xref rid="pone.0027856-Mari3" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, the most extended and comprehensive panel of molecules will lead us to increase our knowledge on reciprocal IgE recognition of allergenic molecule and of patient's immune profiling, leading to a great improvement of disease management.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Silvia Monti and Giorgio Perotti for their timely support in patients' data management, Ms. Chiara Rafaiani and Debora Pomponi for performing the routine ISAC testing during the course of the study, and the remaining allergy specialists of the Center for their work in recruiting patients.
