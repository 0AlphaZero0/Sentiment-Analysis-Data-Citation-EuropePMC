</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Using the model of lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) from plants as allergens, including two new structures, we sought to define how heterogeneous is the behavior of homologous proteins. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Allergic disease prevalence is on the increase worldwide, and recent reports show that food allergy is going to be a greater problem than before [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Thus there is the need for a robust understanding of all aspects characterizing IgE response to allergens, being the IgE production the first step for allergy-mediated food hypersensitivity [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>A great help in the process of a better knowledge in the field is coming from the increasing number of allergenic molecules identified so far (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.allergome.org/script/statistic.php">http://www.allergome.org/script/statistic.php</ext-link>) and made available for studies in combination with micro-technology [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Such combination allows exploring in deep details relationships among structurally distant as well as closely related homologous molecules [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The grouping of allergens in families because of their biochemical structure is leading to assign a similar IgE immune-recognition to similar structures, furthermore supported by in silico studies [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Allergenic molecules are in fact currently considered to be a unique entity because of their biochemical definition [6], [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>That is the case of many allergen families, which got the definition of panallergens because of their distribution in certain distant subsets of living organisms rather than for their real and obvious IgE pan-recognition of protein structures [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Recent reports based on broad IgE testing using the powerful combination mentioned above show how the IgE-mediated immune response toward homologous structure could be influenced by other factors not easily interpreted just using the molecule structures [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Nowadays there is a claim for a more personalized medicine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Such claim seems to fit perfectly in the allergy field where the clinical phenotype is tightly linked to the IgE immune recognition and each patient seems to display a different clinical picture when compared to another. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Such personalized approach, formerly almost impossible because of the number of tests to be performed in each patient, is now becoming increasingly feasible because of the biotechnology/microtechnology combination supported by information technology tools recently made available for the routine work [3], [9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Plant LTPs are widely distributed, structurally related, small proteins involved in defense mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Although their lipid-binding ability has been well reported, the biological function of LTPs is still largely unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The plant LTP family includes two subfamilies according to their molecular masses: the 9-kDa LTP1 and the 7-kDa LTP2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Although LTP1 and LTP2 share a common compact fold consisting of four α-helices stabilized by four disulfide bridges, the pairing partners of cysteines are not completely conserved between the two subfamilies, that also display a low overall sequence similarity (about 30% identity) [10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Up to now 63 LTPs have been characterized as allergens, being 46 of them expressed in edible parts of plants, almost all of them belonging to the LTP1 protein subfamily, and just two, having very preliminary reported data, to the LTP2 subfamily (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.allergome.org">www.allergome.org</ext-link>, accessed September 12, 2011). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Several reviews on the topic of LTP as allergens reported preliminary evidence of a heterogeneous behavior of this group of molecules [11]–[13], but few of them suggested strategies how to overcome the peculiarity of such behavior within a routine workup [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Unless we performed a broad study on 23,077 subjects using the microarray approach, we could not have evidence of such heterogeneity as we had just the LTP from peach available on the microarray used at the time the study had been performed [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Taking advantage of the implementation of a full molecule-, microtechnology-, and information technology-based infrastructure at the Center in Rome, Italy, and of the expansion of the number of available LTPs to a panel of seven allergens, including two new proteins identified in the kiwifruits (KF), we sought to compare the LTP biochemical, immunochemical, and clinical features in order to define the extent of their heterogeneity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The study, leading first to the full characterization of KF LTPs, brought us to abandon the former interpretation of “one molecule fits all” and to search for as much differences as possible among allergenic proteins facing each allergic patient, in order to increase the quality of personal decision making he or she deserves. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>As reported in the first paragraph of the Result section, using biochemical methods, seed and pulp extracts were fractionated by RP-HPLC (Figure 12, panel A) and the separated protein components were analyzed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>The analysis of a peak eluted at a retention time very similar to that observed for nPru p 3 allowed the identification of nAct c 10 and nAct d 10 in the seed extracts from the gold (Figure 12 A, left) and the green KFs (Figure 12 A, right), respectively (Figure 12, panel A, upper parts), whereas that peak was lacking in the RP-HPLC profiles obtained for the pulp extracts of the two KF species (Figure 12, panel A, lower parts). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the fractions of pulp extracts eluted at the retention time of nAct d 10 and nAct c 10 were collected and analyzed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>The results obtained confirmed the absence of detectable amounts of nAct d 10 and nAct c 10 in the pulp extracts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>As the biochemical findings reported above seemed to be quite conclusive, to increase the confidence with the negative data we approached the issue of LTP distribution in KF tissues using the SPHIAa as well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>The inhibition was performed using the same pulp and seed preparations from the green and gold KFs, along with whole KF extracts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>A pool of sera having IgE for both the two KF LTPs was used as probe. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>As shown in Figure 12, panel B, full or almost full IgE inhibition results were obtained with the whole KF extracts and the seed ones, whereas the pulp gave either no inhibition (green KF pulp on nAct c 10, Figure 12, panel B) or inhibition values ranging between 18% and 28% (all other pulp/allergen combinations in Figure 12, panel B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="343" pm="."><plain>These slightly positive results were replicated and could suggest the presence of minimal amount of LTP in the KF pulp not detected by the biochemical methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>The very low inhibition values were anyhow not considered conclusive, and needing a third discriminating proof. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>We thus performed in vivo skin testing with green KF seed and pulp preparations in 21 selected subjects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>As reported in Figure 12, panel C, the comparative analysis showed statistically significant different results between green KF seed and pulp preparations, nevertheless some of the patients did react to the pulp as better shown for individual patients in Table 3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>As the key values were those obtained on patients having severe clinical reactions on KF ingestion, and high or very high ST and IgE scores when tested with nAct c 10 and nAct d 10 (Table 3, lines 15–21), we concluded that tiny amount of LTP are present in the KF pulp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>We thus abandoned the idea of challenging KF clinically allergic patients with the separated KF pulp. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="392" pm="."><plain>We herein report for the first time the identification of two new LTPs from the gold and the green KFs and their characterization as clinically relevant allergens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="393" pm="."><plain>The primary structure of nAct d 10, the one from green KF, has been fully elucidated, being the one of nAct c 10 from gold KF very similar, mainly on the basis of the almost overlapping findings described throughout the present study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="394" pm="."><plain>The identification process was straight forward as, using a panel of other KF allergens we selected patients being IgE negative for them and having just a positive IgE result for a potentially homologous molecule, namely nPru p 3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="395" pm="."><plain>This process is highly suggested as leads to a secured evaluation of the newly identified structure, without overlapping positivity as sometimes reported in literature [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="396" pm="."><plain>As the presence of still unknown KF allergens cannot be excluded, patients from the present study should be re-evaluated on the basis of a more comprehensive allergen panel. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="397" pm="."><plain>Unless we started the identification using subjects having the double clinical reactivity to peach and KF, the first evidence that we were dealing with new allergens not being part of a tight homogeneous group of molecules came by the comparative evaluation of primary structures and the preliminary extended parallel comparative testing with the peach LTP on the 44 peach allergic subjects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="398" pm="."><plain>The former is the biochemical evidence that Act d 10 is not closely related to anyone of the already known allergenic LTPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="399" pm="."><plain>In fact, the observed sequence identities are never higher than 55% and generally fall in the narrow range of 40–55%, whereas more closely related LTPs display higher values. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="400" pm="."><plain>For instance, identities of 97, 91, 88, 87 and 79% are obtained when Pru p 3 sequence is compared with Pru du 3, Pru ar 3, Pru d 3, Pru av 3, Mal d 3 ones, respectively [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="401" pm="."><plain>The alignment of Act d 10 sequence with the five LTPs included in this study (Ara h 9, Art v 3, Cor a 8, Mor n 3, Pru p 3) and the additional fifteen allergenic LTPs listed above shows that seven residues, G31, D45, R46, L53, K54, A67, S83 (Act d 10 numbering) and the 8 cysteine residues, playing a key role in the stabilization of the tertiary structure of the LTP1 proteins, are conserved in all these molecules (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="402" pm="."><plain>The analysis of the alignment also shows that, depending on the compared sequences pair, unique combinations of conserved residues occurr. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="403" pm="."><plain>The absence of sequence regions conserved in all the LTP1 suggests that the existence of even one identical epitope, shared by all the allergenic LTP1, is unlikely. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="404" pm="."><plain>It is coincevable that a complete or partial epitope sharing can be found only when closely related LTPs are compared. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="405" pm="."><plain>The observed sequence micro-heterogeneity, mainly found in distantly related LTPs, could be thus the main cause of inhomogeneous epitope patterns producing inhomogeneous LTP IgE recognition as shown at least on the LTP1 included in the present study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="406" pm="."><plain>About comparative testing, our data on a huge population where just one LTP, nPru p 3, was tested did not arise such suspicion [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="407" pm="."><plain>Reports from literature leading to characterization of new LTPs are much focusing the description of the new allergen behavior comparing it with Pru p 3, considered the prototype of LTP allergy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="408" pm="."><plain>We could conclude the same if we stopped our allergen characterization looking at few, highly affected patients as many other reports do on allergens belonging to the same LTP family [19], [24]–[33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="409" pm="."><plain>Anyhow, during the time several Authors have observed a certain inhomogeneous behavior of LTPs mainly using IgE inhibition assays or parallel testing with LTPs [19], [24], [29], [33]–[39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="410" pm="."><plain>Cited studies, always performed on a limited number of subjects, did not achieve the evidence, we are now reporting, of the highly heterogeneous behavior of LTPs, leading in our opinion to the need of a thorough testing of every single patient with the most comprehensive panel of available LTPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="411" pm="."><plain>More emphasis on the topic has been recently brought by Tordesillas et al. [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="412" pm="."><plain>In their study, carried out on a limited number of subjects as well, they included LTPs biochemically-wise quite distant from each other in term of sequences, testing Pru p 3, a very close one, Mal d 3, some as distant as those used in our study (Art v 3, Sin a 3, Tri a 14) and two very remote ones (Par j 1, Ole e 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="413" pm="."><plain>Authors finally raised the doubt that the biochemical grouping of allergens can be misleading in the allergy diagnosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="414" pm="."><plain>Although Par j 1 and Par j 2 [19] seem definitely placed outside the LTP IgE co-recognized molecules, additional data are required before such conclusion can be drawn at least for Ole e 7, Tri a 14, and Sin a 3. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="415" pm="."><plain>Regarding molecule to molecule immunological relationships, some studies reported on the need of studying conformational epitopes shared or not by different LTPs [40]–[42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="416" pm="."><plain>Using the peptide display library authors searched for identification of peptides working as mimotopes of surface IgE binding regions, giving evidence of the heterogeneity of the molecule surface in LTPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="417" pm="."><plain>We tried to give a contribution to the molecule to molecule relationship understanding by extensively studying IgE correlations between paired molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="418" pm="."><plain>IgE correlations have been already reported in few studies in a limited number of subjects, sometimes showing similar results with ours, sometime different [28], [32], [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="419" pm="."><plain>In our opinion this much depend on recruitment selection criteria used to enroll patients in studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="420" pm="."><plain>Gadermaier et al. [43] performed IgE correlation experiments on Api g 2, Art v 3, Pru p 3 on a quite large population reporting some findings shown in the present manuscript in a more comprehensive way. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="421" pm="."><plain>In the two studies the sampling bias has been avoided by enrolling patient consecutively without preliminary selection criteria and in a high number. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="422" pm="."><plain>This strategy seems to hold true also for comparing quality of different preparations of the same allergen, as in our case for nPru p 3 from two different providers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="423" pm="."><plain>Incidentally we have been able to compare them in this high throughput study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="424" pm="."><plain>Although the large majority of samples were double positive for the two preparations immobilized on the two microarrays, the discrepant results, mainly when high IgE levels are recorded and replicated, require further investigation focusing on both the spotting technology but mainly on the allergen preparation quality. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="425" pm="."><plain>In the need of profiling patients reporting KF allergy, we used in collaboration with other research groups, Pru p 3 as representative LTP also for KF LTP [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="426" pm="."><plain>After the findings reported in our study we presume that in that study there has been an overestimation of the KF LTP involvement in the patient profiling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="427" pm="."><plain>Such substitutions should be discouraged as they can lead to over or underestimation of the phenomenon as might be argued for other studies [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="428" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, unless a high number of LTPs is now available for testing, there are studies claiming the possibility of performing diagnosis and epidemiology of LTP or other allergen sensitizations by using just one representative molecule for each group [46]–[50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="429" pm="."><plain>Evidence of a non-homogeneous behavior of profilins as allergens has already been reported by Radauer et al. [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="430" pm="."><plain>Recently the heterogeneous behavior of patients toward Bet v 1 homologous molecules when describing a new Bet v 1-like molecule from green KF, Act d 11 [14], and within the established hevein-like molecule group [52] have been reported. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="431" pm="."><plain>Both studies suggest how the combination of a microarray testing system and panel of molecules might be useful for describing single patient profiles and the overall molecule group picture at the same time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="432" pm="."><plain>In a very recent paper from Gadermaier et al. [43] this new approach is given for LTPs starting from Api g 2, the celery stalk LTP1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="433" pm="."><plain>It is evident from this report that a highly selected cohort could drive to wrong conclusions, whereas exploring the behavior in a larger cohort and combining other experimental approaches as in the present study highlights the inhomogeneity of LTP as allergens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="434" pm="."><plain>Other collaborative studies have been recently accepted for publication showing or reinforcing the demonstration of the valuable use of the multiple homologous molecule approach for Bet v 1-like, tropomyosins, profilins as pan-allergens [53], [54]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="435" pm="."><plain>Overall we can describe the clinical relevance of our findings as follows: we found non-symptomatic subjects as in previous studies [28], [38], [55], or different clinical pictures to the leading Pru p 3 sensitization as described so far [36], [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="436" pm="."><plain>As shown in several experiments reported in the present study, each LTP shows a different recognition pattern and we could not come to our conclusions without considering such heterogeneity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="437" pm="."><plain>Thus, level of Pru p 3 IgE cannot account of sensitization toward other LTPs, as recently proposed by Asero et al. [49], whereas the finding of several subjects having isolated IgE positivity to single LTP should be further explored with a broader allergen panel in order to identify whether sources other than peach can account of an IgE sensitization leading to a different LTP subset. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="438" pm="."><plain>At this regard, previously reported data on Art v 3, the mugwort pollen LTP, seem to support this idea [33], [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="439" pm="."><plain>As levels of IgE in case of isolated positivity were never high, we can speculate about single epitope IgE recognition creating the condition for a positive in vitro test but no clinical reactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="440" pm="."><plain>Although requiring further studies on a higher number of subjects, our approach leads to allergy test driven decision on what to exclude but, most importantly, on what to leave in patient's diet, we do consider this approach of great clinical relevance as it has never been proposed before. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="441" pm="."><plain>Having robust data coming from a broad positive and negative IgE testing will help the clinical allergist in her/his therapeutic decisions, and hopefully reduce the fear of eating any plant-derived food, typical behavior of LTP allergic patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="442" pm="."><plain>The re-introduction of KF under supervision in a clinical setting ready for emergencies is the suggested strategy, mostly in those patients showing discordant in vivo/in vitro results as herein reported. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="443" pm="."><plain>After all, it remains that LTP represent a cross-sectional group of allergens having a patient's related IgE co-recognition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="444" pm="."><plain>What should be avoided is the interpretation of LTP as part of a given allergenic source in the so called component-resolved diagnosis [26], [29], [44], [45], [56]–[59]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="445" pm="."><plain>This concept leads back to the allergenic extract-based diagnosis, whereas the allergist needs to be informed on the extension of the IgE recognized homologous molecules and translate that for the patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="446" pm="."><plain>Last important finding of our study is the original distribution of LTP within the KF tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="447" pm="."><plain>LTP is generally reported to be found on the surface of fruits, as in the case of peach [60]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="448" pm="."><plain>We found a great gap in the presence of the molecule comparing the seeds and the pulp, unless a tiny amount might be found in the latter that we considered enough to exclude the use of KF pulp separated from seed in KF allergic patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="449" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this can justify why in a recent study from us where green KF were evaluated at different ripening stage we did not describe the LTP band [61]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="450" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the absence of good quantity of the LTP in the pulp raises doubts about the usefulness of the prick-prick test technique as reported negative in some subjects in the present study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="451" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we suggest the use of the microarray testing system bearing panels of homologous molecules as it adds much to our comparative knowledge on biochemical, immunochemical and clinical differences between closely related structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="452" pm="."><plain>Clinical allergists might take advantage of missing IgE recognition of one or the other LTP for keeping the specific food in patient's diet, avoiding useless exclusion, generally leading to deterioration of patient's quality of life. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="453" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we herein document the need of having the microarray-based testing available for routine allergy diagnosis workup, as it creates the conditions for generating a wealth of data without selection biases and on cohorts otherwise not approachable, as we cannot exclude a different behavior of patients living in different geographical areas. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="454" pm="."><plain>As preliminary depicted in a review by us [3] and more recently discussed on defining the best diagnostic approach to atopic dermatitis patients [62], the most extended and comprehensive panel of molecules will lead us to increase our knowledge on reciprocal IgE recognition of allergenic molecule and of patient's immune profiling, leading to a great improvement of disease management. </plain></SENT>
