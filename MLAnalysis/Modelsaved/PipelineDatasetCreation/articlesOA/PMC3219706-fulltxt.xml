Patient reports of tick bites suggested that infection could contribute to FTLS. Many tick-transmitted microbial pathogens were tested for by PCR/RT-PCR and/or indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). However, only 8% (24/285) of samples collected from 2007 to 2010 tested positive for human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), suggesting that other pathogens could be involved. Here, we used an unbiased metagenomic approach to screen and survey for microbes possibly associated with FTLS. BLASTx analysis of deduced protein sequences revealed that a novel bunyavirus (36% identity to Tehran virus, accession: HQ412604) was present only in sera from FTLS patients. A phylogenetic analysis further showed that, although closely related to Uukuniemi virus of the <italic>Phlebovirus</italic> genus, this virus was distinct. The candidate virus was examined for association with FTLS among samples collected from Henan province during 2007&#8211;2010. RT-PCR, viral cultures, and a seroepidemiologic survey were undertaken. RT-PCR results showed that 223 of 285 (78.24%) acute-phase serum samples contained viral RNA. Of 95 patients for whom paired acute and convalescent sera were available, 73 had serologic evidence of infection, with 52 seroconversions and 21 exhibiting a 4-fold increase in antibody titer to the virus. The new virus was isolated from patient acute-phase serum samples and named Henan Fever Virus (HNF virus). Whole-genome sequencing confirmed that the virus was a novel bunyavirus with genetic similarity to known bunyaviruses, and was most closely related to the Uukuniemi virus (34%, 24%, and 29% of maximum identity, respectively, for segment L, M, S at maximum query coverage). After the release of the GenBank sequences of SFTSV, we found that they were nearly identical (&gt;99% identity). These results show that the novel bunyavirus (HNF virus) is strongly correlated with FTLS.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Initially in 2007, and again between 2008 and 2010, cases of a life-threatening disease with sudden fever, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia were reported in Henan Province, China. Patient reports of tick bites suggested that this disease could be infectious or tick-transmitted. Many patients were provisionally diagnosed with human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA). However, only 24 of 285 (8%) had objective evidence of HGA, suggesting that other pathogens likely contributed to fever, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia syndrome (FTLS). Illumina sequencing was used for direct detection in clinical samples of pathogens possibly associated with FTLS. A novel bunyavirus was found only in samples from FTLS patients. Further epidemiologic and laboratory investigation confirmed that the novel bunyavirus was associated with FTLS. The results illustrate that metagenomic analysis is a powerful method for the discovery of novel pathogenic agents. Combined with epidemiologic investigation, it could assist in rapid diagnosis of unknown diseases and distinguish them from other diseases with similar symptoms caused by known pathogens.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In May 2007, a county hospital in Xinyang City, Henan Province treated three patients with fever, abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal bleeding, and elevated aminotransferases. The local hospital diagnosed the disease as acute gastroenteritis. A family member of one patient reported the disease to the Henan Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which sent a team to investigate. The investigation revealed that the disease had the following characteristics: (1) acute onset with fever; (2) low white blood cell and platelet counts; (3) high levels of alanine and aspartate transaminases; (4) positive urine protein. On the basis of these features, the Henan CDC excluded the possibility of gastrointestinal disorders. In order to identify the disease etiology, the Henan CDC team used the above clinical characteristics as the case definition to search for similar cases in local hospitals in this and neighboring counties, while establishing a disease surveillance system that required all medical institutions to report cases that met the above case definition. Altogether, 79 cases were found in 2007 in Henan, with 10 fatalities (case fatality rate, 12.7%). All patients were farmers and resided in mountainous or hilly villages, and many had reported tick bites 7&#8211;9 days before illness, further suggesting an infectious etiology. In recent years, patients with similar clinical symptoms were reported with human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA; <italic>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</italic>) in neighboring Anhui province <xref rid="ppat.1002369-He1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In 2005, there was an epidemic of Tsutsugamushi (scrub typhus/<italic>Orientia tsutsugamushi</italic>) in this area <xref rid="ppat.1002369-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Clinical investigations, epidemiological analyses, and laboratory testing prompted consideration of rickettsial diseases as possible causes, including HGA, human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME; <italic>Ehrlichia chaffeensis</italic>), and Tsutsugamushi disease. Specific methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunofluorescence assays (IFAs) for these pathogens were then used to determine if these cases were attributable to HGA or HME <xref rid="ppat.1002369-Wen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002369-Du1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, only 18 of 79 (22.7%) patients were positive for <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> based on serology and DNA testing. Thus, the disease was initially considered at least partly caused by <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic>, and cases were provisionally diagnosed as suspected HGA based on clinical and epidemiological data <xref rid="ppat.1002369-He1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ppat.1002369-Wen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002369-Dumler1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ppat.1002369-MOH1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In the 3 years since 2007, 206 suspected cases have been discovered in Henan, but there was only a very low positive rate of <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> confirmation (6 of 206 patients) and no pathogen was isolated. Similar cases were also reported in the mountainous and hilly areas of nearby Shandong, Jiangsu, Hubei and Anhui provinces, indicating that the disease already existed for some time and was widely distributed <xref rid="ppat.1002369-MOH1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. We decided to address the possible causative pathogen underlying this infection.</p><p>On the basis of epidemiological and clinical characteristics, we considered two types of diseases to be possible: rickettsial and arthropod-borne viral disease. Because of the low rates of <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> (rickettsial disease) detection, the research team intensified its virus search to take into account arthropod-borne viruses, including <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> (Dengue viruses [DENV], Japanese encephalitis virus [JEV]), <italic>Togaviridae</italic> (Chikungunya virus, Eastern equine encephalitis virus [EEEV], Western equine encephalitis virus), and <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> (Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Hantaan virus, and Rift valley fever virus) <xref rid="ppat.1002369-Paul1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Specific PCR assays for these viruses were used <xref rid="ppat.1002369-Meiyu1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ppat.1002369-Garcia1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, none of the patients from 2007 to 2010 was positive for these viruses, suggesting a new infectious agent, possibly a virus, remained to be discovered. Thus, the syndrome was considered an emerging infectious disease and was named fever, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia syndrome (FTLS). To identify the etiology, the research team adopted the following strategy: 1) sequencing of randomly amplified cDNA/DNA from FTLS patient samples using high-throughput Illumina sequencing to specifically explore viral communities present in patients suffering from FTLS, 2) PCR detection of target DNA directly from clinical specimens, 3) viral culture, 4) immunodetection methods, and 5) electron microscopic study of the morphology of the cultured virus.</p><p>Culture followed by serological and molecular tests is a standard approach for identifying an unknown virus. However, culture of an unknown virus is time-consuming, even taking several years to confirm a novel infection like HIV <xref rid="ppat.1002369-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Otherwise, virus culture often fails because of the lack of cell lines capable of supporting propagation of viruses (e.g., hepatitis B and C virus). Methods for cloning nucleic acids of microbial pathogens directly from clinical samples offer opportunities for pathogen discovery, thereby laying the foundation for future studies aimed at assessing whether novel or unexpected viruses play a role in disease etiology. Random PCR and subtractive cloning sequencing have identified previously unknown pathogens as etiological agents of several acute and chronic infectious diseases <xref rid="ppat.1002369-Peiris1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002369-Franchini1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Recently, high-throughput sequencing approaches have been used for pathogen detection and discovery in clinical samples <xref rid="ppat.1002369-CoxFoster1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ppat.1002369-Palacios1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. We also developed a method for exploring viruses, both known and novel, using high-throughput Illumina sequencing. In this study, high-throughput Illumina sequencing was applied to specifically explore the viral communities in patients with FTLS, using healthy subjects as controls. Here, we provide evidence for the discovery of a novel bunyavirus associated with FTLS through high-throughput sequencing. Subsequent culture of the virus and PCR detection of the specific virus in patient specimens confirmed these findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This research was approved by the Review Board of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Henan Province, the Review Board of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Xinyang city, the Review Board of Beijing Institute of Genomics, the Review Board of Beijing Genomics Institute in Shenzhen, and the Review Board of the Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology.

In brief, RT-PCR and PCR products were roughly quantified by UV absorption and equal amounts of each sample were mixed. Nucleic acids within the mixtures were sheared by sonication, and fragments in the 150&#8211;180-bp range were collected by cutting bands from an agarose gel after electrophoresis. The sheared DNA and cDNA ends were repaired using Klenow DNA polymerase, after which 5' termini were phosphorylated and 3' termini were polyadenylated.

Briefly, after filtering out highly repetitive sequences and adaptor sequences, the overlapping datasets between FTLS and healthy subjects were analyzed by subtracting fragments that mapped to both host genomic-plus-transcript and bacteria databases.

The resulting alignments were filtered to identify unique sequences by examining alignment (identity &#8805;80%) and E-value scores (e&#8804;10<sup>&#8722;2</sup>). Filtered unique alignments were examined in the taxonomy database (NCBI) using a custom software application written in Perl (BioPerl version 5.8.5).

However, only a few (8.4%, 24/285) such patients had evidence for <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> infection, and none of the 285 patients tested positive for the many other pathogens capable of causing similar clinical and laboratory manifestations that were also investigated. These findings suggested novel infectious agents, including viruses.</p><p>Traditionally, virus culture is very important for identifying an unknown viral infection. Before performing the Illumina sequencing strategy, we attempted viral and rickettsial culture with DH82 and BHK cell lines, but the lack of an obvious CPE led us to initially abandon this approach. Here, mass sequence data obtained by Illumina sequencing revealed four virus families that appeared only in FTLS patient sera. Among these four virus families, viruses from the <italic>Parvoviridae</italic> and <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> families reportedly can cause signs of FTLS and be transmitted by arthropods. However, only one sample from a pool of ten samples tested positive for bocavirus by PCR, suggesting that bocavirus from the <italic>Parvoviridae</italic> is not likely involved in FTLS. For viruses in the <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> family, the incidence of infection is closely linked to vector activity. For example, tick-borne viruses are more common in the late spring and late summer when tick activity peaks. Human infections with certain <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic>, such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, are associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality <xref rid="ppat.1002369-Bishop1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Considering the tick-bite history of many FTLS patients, we focused on <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> family viruses.</p><p>The entire <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> family contains more than 300 members arranged in four genera of arthropod-borne viruses (<italic>Orthobunyavirus</italic>, <italic>Nairovirus</italic>, <italic>Phlebovirus</italic> and <italic>Tospovirus</italic>) and one genus (<italic>Hantavirus</italic>) of rodent-borne viruses <xref rid="ppat.1002369-Bishop1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002369-Mayo1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.

Thus, we used all sequences in the family <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> for our analysis. A 168-bp fragment of the polymerase gene with the lowest E-value and high sequence identity was used as the sequence of the unknown virus. This virus sequence was detected in all 10 pooled samples, indicating that the virus is involved in FTLS. After detecting a possible novel bunyavirus through high-throughput Illumina sequencing, we inoculated Vero cell lines, which are known to be sensitive to phleboviruses, with sera from six positive patients and were subsequently able to detect the virus by RT-PCR <xref rid="ppat.1002369-Bishop1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002369-Jin2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.

As we first identified the syndrome in 2007 and described the presence of the virus in patients between 2007 and 2010, we suggest that the name &#8220;HNF virus&#8221; should take precedence. The most distinctive feature of the current work includes the use of an unbiased metagenomic approach for viral pathogen discovery that facilitated the rapid creation and implementation of standard culture, serological, and molecular diagnostic approaches. However, there are other differences between the results described here and those reported by Yu et al; notably, we observed slight, but distinctive, CPE in Vero cells. The reason for the failure to observe CPE in Vero cells infected with the &#8220;SFTSV&#8221; bunyavirus <xref rid="ppat.1002369-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, whose genome is nearly identical to that of bunyavirus isolated from our FTLS patients, is unclear. Perhaps this reflects the fact that the ensuing CPE is not dramatic. Alternately, this could indicate the existence of distinct viral strains that vary in pathogenicity, virulence, and possibly even disease manifestations. This is an area of active study in our laboratories.</p><p>The discovery of this new virus will assist in the rapid diagnosis of this disease and help to distinguish it from other diseases caused by pathogens such as <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic>, <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic>, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Hantavirus, dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and Chikungunya virus. Furthermore, the availability of the new virus will facilitate the future development of new therapeutic interventions, such as vaccines and drugs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1002369.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Sensitivity and dynamic range of real-time PCR in the detection of bunyavirus RNA.
