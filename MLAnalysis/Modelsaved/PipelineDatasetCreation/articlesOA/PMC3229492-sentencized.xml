</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Experimentally determining a protein's structure is labor-intensive and time-consuming. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Homology search, on the other hand, is a very effective way to predict the properties of an uncharacterized protein [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Homologous proteins tend to have similar structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Their residue-residue equivalences can easily be established using any standard alignment procedure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>This strategy is reasonably effective for proteins having more than 40% identity but its accuracy, defined as the capacity to identify structurally equivalent amino-acids, decreases significantly when considering remote homologues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>It is quite well established that below 25% identity, sequence alignments become non-informative with respect to the structural similarity [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In this range of identity, an alignment based on amino-acid similarity may not be structurally correct. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>This situation is very common with remote homologues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In fact, the accurate alignment of remote homologues remains a major challenge for computational biology [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Most protein sequence alignment tools rely on a scoring function to measure the similarity between residues and give penalties for insertion/deletions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The quality of the resulting alignments is greatly influenced by the scoring function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The most common scoring functions are called substitution matrices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>They include the PAM matrices [4], the BLOSUM series [5], GONNET [6], JTT [7], and VT [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Each substitution matrix is designed for a different purpose. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>For example, PAM matrices are designed to identify evolutionary origins of proteins, while the BLOSUM matrices are to identify protein members of the same family and to detect conserved domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Selecting a substitution matrix is difficult as it is still not well understood which matrix is the best choice when aligning different sequence pairs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>A recent study [9] concluded that the common belief that more accurate alignments of distantly related sequences may be achieved using low-identity matrices is shown to be false. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Moreover, no evidence exists that selecting a matrix based on sequence divergence improves accuracy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>This point is quite relevant, since the automated matrix selection is a key feature of ClustalW [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Substitution matrices are extremely simplified models of protein evolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>They assume all residues to evolve at the same pace, and ignore any local effect that may influence the mutability of a given amino-acid. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The last issue has been an intense focus of research over the last few years, and many methods have been produced that make an attempt to model amino acid mutations in a position specific manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>All these methods have their reliance on a pre-assembled multiple sequence alignment (MSA) used as a profile. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>They include Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], and Position Specific Scoring Matrices (PSSMs) which gives a weighted score or a probability reflecting the frequency of each residue at each position observed in a group of related sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>PSI-BLAST [17] is probably the best known method to generate PSSM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Profile-sequence and profile-profile comparisons have been successfully applied on homology detection and fold recognition [12], [18], [19], [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>A couple of multiple sequence aligners have also been developed that use the profile-profile alignment approach, which include PCMA [16], SATCHMO [21], [22], PRALINEpsi [23], SPEM [24], PROMALS [25] and PSI-Coffee [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The last three packages combine the profile-profile scoring scheme with a T-Coffee style consistency based scoring scheme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>A study [26] found that profile-profile alignment gave an average improvement of 2â3% over profile-sequence alignment and â¼40% over sequence-sequence alignment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>However, profile-profile alignment is not an entirely trivial process and the improvement depends heavily on the intrinsic properties of the considered dataset (average identity, density of the phylogenetic tree, etc). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>This probably explains why alternative studies [24] have found profile-profile alignment approaches to lack a clear superiority over traditional sequence-sequence alignment approaches. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Optimizing an MSA has been shown to be an NP-hard problem, hence a large number of methods have been developed to address this important biological problem [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>A majority of the methods can be described as sophisticated variations around the progressive alignment algorithm, originally described by Hogeweg [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>The algorithm starts with an all-against-all step where pairwise comparisons are carried out in order to fill up a distance matrix. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>This distance matrix is then resolved into a guide tree whose topology defines the order in which the sequences will be incorporated (one by one) within the MSA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>This strategy is extremely time-effective, but it can suffer from its extreme greediness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Indeed, any pair of aligned sequences cannot be re-aligned, and early inaccurate alignments may impact the whole process through their influence on subsequent sub-alignments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>The quality of an MSA is therefore very sensitive to the guide tree accuracy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>The excessive greediness of the progressive alignment can be tackled by improving the quality of the first pairwise alignments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>This goal was the original motivation for the development of a novel class of progressive aligners known as consistency based progressive aligners. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>The original algorithm was developed for the T-Coffee and later re-implemented in several aligners including ProbCons [29] and PROMALS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>The rationale of the consistency-based approach is to use the all-against-all computation in order to define a position specific scoring scheme for each pair of sequences that takes into account their relation with the other sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>In this study, we decided to go further and extend the idea of the consistency based approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Its principle relies on synonyms, a notion quite common in natural language processing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Its usage makes it possible to capture local sequence similarities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>In this context, a protein synonym is an n-gram fragment of amino acids that reflects the sequence variation in the evolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Synonymous n-grams can be effectively used to improve protein secondary structure predictions [30]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we extend the application of synonyms to the problem of sequence alignment and present a method, called SymAlign, to demonstrate how protein synonyms can be used to improve the quality of protein sequence alignment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>We applied this method to two well-known benchmark datasets and estimated the alignment quality using either reference alignments or structure based evaluation methods (RMSD and iRMSD). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Our results show that SymAlign can generate alignments with better RMSD/iRMSD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrate that SymAlign is less sensitive to structurally non-similar proteins when they are aligned together with structurally similar proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Finally, in the analysis of the relationship between sequence identity and structure similarity, we demonstrate that SymAlign can better differentiate structurally similar proteins from non-similar proteins. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><sec id="s2a"><title><text><SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>The idea of protein synonyms </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>A synonym is a word that has identical or similar meaning as another word in the same language. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>For example, lovely, pretty, attractive, gorgeous, and so on all have similar meaning as beautiful but with different spelling in English. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>They are literally interchangeable with each other without changing the semantics of a sentence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Polysemy is the opposite phenomenon, that is to say the possibility for a single word to have different alternative meanings, depending on the context. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>For example, the word âplayâ could be used as a verb, in the sense âbeing involved in a gameâ or as a noun referring to a piece of writing performed by actors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>The exact meaning of a polysemy depends on the context in which the word occurs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Technically, it is possible to align words in two sentences according to the meanings of known words and to infer the meaning of an unknown word from the word it is aligned with. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>We used this idea to propose the definition and identification of synonyms in protein sequences. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>It is well known that a protein structure is encoded by its amino acid sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a protein sequence can be treated as a text written in a language whose alphabet comprises 20 letters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>The protein's structure is analogous to the semantic meaning of the text. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>However, the translation from sequence to structure remains a mystery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>It is well known that homologous proteins share similar structures [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we can learn something about protein language from those protein sequences. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>We consider homologous proteins as sentences with similar meanings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>They contain similar information and describe similar actions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Taking this analogy further, we may consider that the mutations between homologous sequences are like synonyms in two sentences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Thus we can create a mapping relationship between those sequence variations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>In terms of natural language, a group of homologous sequences can be treated as a series of texts with identical or similar meanings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>These texts can therefore be used to infer synonymous relationship from sequence alignments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>The main limitation here is that we do not have much knowledge on how protein languages are composed and the precise rules or grammar indicating the boundaries of protein words. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Structure conformation is a highly complicated process where both long and short range interactions play an important role. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Long-range interactions are very hard to model, but the short range ones can be effectively estimated using the n-gram model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>The simplicity of the underlying modeling is very popular in formal linguistic analysis and bioinformatics sequence comparison. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>For instance, the BLAST's algorithm uses an n-gram model to generate a collection of similar words [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Our approach follows the same lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Given a sequence alignment for proteins A and B with high sequence identity (typically above 30%), we use a sliding window to extract all word pairs to define synonyms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>For each word w in protein A, if there is another word w' in protein B aligned with w and there is no gap between w and w', we say w and w' are synonymous. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>The rationale is that since proteins A and B are similar in sequences, the two words would probably express similar structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>By extending the collection of proteins similar to protein A, we can define a larger number of synonyms for each word in A. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>An important difference between protein synonyms and similar words in BLAST is that protein synonyms are defined from biologically significant sequence alignments (context-sensitive) while similar words are more or less context-free. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Protein words share some properties with natural language words, including polysemy: the same protein word may appear in different proteins with different structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Kabsch and Sander demonstrated that the same five residues can be a part of an alpha-helix in one protein and a part of a beta-strand in another protein, and they suggested that pentapeptide structure is strongly dependent on sequence context [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>We can deal with this situation by restricting synonymous assignments to protein pairs similar enough. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>In practice, given a target protein pair S and T to be aligned, we define synonyms for each word in S and T by using a sliding window to screen the sequence alignments between one of the target sequences and its similar sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>We perform a PSI-BLAST search to generate a number of sequence alignments between S and S' (similar sequences of S). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Each synonym sw extracted from S' is associated with a word in S. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>All synonyms for the words in protein S and T are collected this way. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Whenever a word sw is found that are both synonymous with a word ws in S and a word wt in T, then ws and wt are considered to be synonymous by transitivity. Figure 1 shows how this idea can be used to connect regions of two protein sequences. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>It is defined as the ratio of the number of correctly aligned residue pairs compared with the reference alignment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>The measure that depends on a reference alignment has been criticized for the limited capacity to capture the structural correctness of an alignment globally [37]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Two such metrics have been proposed: the RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) that estimates the quality of the superposition, and the iRMSD (intra molecular Root Mean Square Deviation) [37] that estimates the difference of intra-molecular distances between pairs of equivalent alpha carbons in a way similar to APDB [38]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>This should be an essential feature for any sequence aligner because the inclusion of outliers within a group of homologues frequently occurs in sequence analysis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>SymAlign can align sequences to better indicate their preserved 3D structures than standard sequence aligners. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>On the benchmark datasets, we show that whenever SymAlign delivers an alignment with more than 15% identity, the considered sequences are more likely to be in the same fold. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, SymAlign displays not only the optimal but also the sub-optimal alignments on dot-matrices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>A fine grayscale makes it easy to identify alternative alignments that may not have been identified by dynamic programming. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>It is especially useful when aligning distantly related sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Altogether SymAlign should prove an interesting development for T-Coffee. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>The increased accuracy provided by SymAlign will be especially important and useful in all situations where accurately aligning distantly relates homologues is a limiting step. </plain></SENT>
