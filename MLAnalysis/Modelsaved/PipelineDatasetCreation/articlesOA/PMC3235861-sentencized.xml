<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MFM are partly caused by mutations in genes that encode mainly Z-disk-related proteins (desmin, αB-crystallin, myotilin, ZASP, filamin C and BAG3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reviewed clinical, light and electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting and genetic findings of 21 patients with MFM (15 unrelated patients and three pairs of brothers) investigated at our neuromuscular center. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiac involvement and peripheral neuropathy are common. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Myoﬁbrillar myopathies (MFM) are uncommon inherited or sporadic progressive neuromuscular disorders with clinical and genetic heterogeneity (1, 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>MFM are morphologically deﬁned by foci of myoﬁbril dissolution, accumulation of myoﬁbrillar degradation products, and ectopic expression of multiple proteins including desmin, αB-crystallin, dystrophin, myotilin, sarcoglycans, neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), plectin, gelsolin, ubiquitin, filamin C, and congophilic amyloid material (3-5). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>To date, mutations in six genes are known to cause MFM, but these account for less than half of patients with a diagnosis of MFM (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These genes encode mainly sarcomeric Z-disk or Z-disk-related proteins and the mutated proteins are usually found inside the aggregates: desmin (6), αB-crystallin (7), myotilin (8), Z-band alternatively spliced PDZ motif containing protein (ZASP) (9) and ﬁlamin C (10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Additionally, mutations in BAG3 have recently been shown to cause MFM (11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Despite the identification of several mutations in different genes, the typical histological features are observed in all patients (12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>To date, the mechanisms leading to protein aggregation are not fully understood and recent studies proposed that the fiber abnormalities in MFM probably are a common step of a stress-induced pathway, triggered by different stimuli (13, 14). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>We here describe our clinical, light and electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting and genetic analysis findings in 21 MFM patients investigated at our neuromuscular center. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>We present here a retrospective analysis of data derived from 21 patients with MFM investigated at our neuromuscular center. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>MFM patients begin to show symptoms at any age, from juvenile to late adult life and diagnosis is delayed compared to the age of the first appearance of the symptoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>In our cohort onset was not observed until after reaching 16 years of age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>From clinical point of view, we should emphasize that symptoms reported at the time of diagnosis are extremely variable and muscle weakness is not documented in all our patients at the time of being subjected to muscle biopsy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Cardiac involvement is common occuring in 39% of our patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>There is an increased incidence of electrocardiographic abnormalities, including atrial arrhythmias, atrioventricular conduction defects and bundle branch block. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>Congestive heart failure is not uncommon; in our series it was documented in 4 of 21 patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>In our study we also found a frequent involvement of peripheral nervous system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Clinical signs and/or EMG findings of peripheral neuropathy are present in approximately 44% of our cohort and even in one patient sensory deficits are presenting symptoms. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>A broad spectrum of light microscopic changes ranging from mild to severe abnormalities was documented in all muscle biopsy specimens of our patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>The typical pathological findings include: (1) focal areas with either reduction/loss of NADH, SDH and COX staining or decreased ATPase activity present in almost all patients; (2) amorphous material that stains eosinophilic on hematoxylin and eosin and dark blue on Engel-Gomori trichrome in most of these abnormal fiber areas; (3) rimmed and non-rimmed vacuoles observed in 45% of cases and cytoplasmic bodies in only 10%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>In addition to myopathic features, the presence of small angulated fibers of either histochemical type which may occur singly or in groups suggest a neurogenic process; these findings were present in more than 60% of patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Although none of these histological abnormalities is specific for MFM, the combination of these changes outline the diagnosis (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopic studies documented disintegration of myofibrils starting from the Z-disk and accumulation of granular and filamentous material widely distributed among the myofilaments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities observed at ulrastructural level suggested the temporal sequence of pathological events occurring in MFM (12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Initially there is a breakdown of myofibrils beginning at the Z-disk owing to loss of the normal architecture of the myofibrils and disruption of intermediate filaments; then deposits of filamentous material accumulate in different shape and size displacing membranous organelles; and ultimately membranous organelles are sequestered in autophagic vacuoles. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>Our immunohistochemical data demonstrated the focal accumulation of desmin, αB-crystallin and myotilin in muscle fibers of all patients and thus confirm that immunohistochemistry is a sensitive tool to detect protein aggregation in MFM muscle specimens (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>These deposits correspond to the abnormal fiber regions without, or with reduced, ATPase and/or oxidative enzyme activity and are higly variable in terms of number, shape, size and intracellular localization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>While in some specimens protein aggregates are multiple, widespread within muscle fibers and affect up to 15% of all fibers, in others these inclusions are singly, tiny and only in a small percentage of fibers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>In most cases aggregates are immunoreactive for all three proteins but αB-crystallin deposits are more numerous than the other two. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>In contrast to light and electron microscopy, immunoblot analysis is not useful and informative for the diagnosis of MFM because in muscle of MFM patients it does not highlight differences in the expression of mostly commonly proteins observed in the intracellular deposits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>These data seem to suggest, therefore, that the total content of proteins in MFM muscle might be unchanged when compared to normal controls and are in agreement with the previous demonstration that in patients with MFM there is no increased gene transcription of different proteins that are believed involved in the pathogenesis of this disease including desmin and αB-crystallin (19). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Finally we identified genetic mutations in six out of 21 patients with MFM: three from two families had different mutations in the desmin gene while in three other cases, which also belonged to two different families, mutations in the genes encoding myotilin (in two affected brothers) and alpha crystallin B chain were found. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Instead in our cohort we did not find any pathogenic variations in the genes encoding LIM domain-binding protein 3 and BAG3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>One of the four reported mutations was never described in the literature and in particular the missense mutation S7F in the desmin gene identified in two affected brothers; the other three missense mutations including one in the gene encoding desmin (R454W), one in the myotilin gene (S39F) and the other in the gene of αBcrystallin (G154S) have already been documented and considered as pathogenetic (16-18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the genetic basis of MFM was established in only 28% of our cases and these data are consistent with those reported in other studies (20). </plain></SENT>
