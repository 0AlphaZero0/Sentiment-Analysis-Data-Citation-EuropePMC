In a recent paper [Syed,S.H., Goutte-Gattat,D., Becker,N., Meyer,S., Shukla,M.S., Hayes,J.J., Everaers,R., Angelov,D., Bednar,J. and Dimitrov,S. (2010) Single-base resolution mapping of H1-nucleosome interactions and 3D organization of the nucleosome. <italic>Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA</italic>, 107, 9620&#8211;9625], we published results of biochemical footprinting and cryo-electron-micrographs of reconstituted mono-, di- and tri-nucleosomes, for H1 variants with different lengths of the cationic C-terminus. Here, we present a detailed account of the analysis of the experimental data and we include thermal fluctuations into our nano-scale model of the stem structure. By combining (i) crystal and NMR structures of the nucleosome core particle and H1, (ii) the known nano-scale structure and elasticity of DNA, (iii) footprinting information on the location of protected sites on the DNA backbone and (iv) cryo-electron micrographs of reconstituted tri-nucleosomes, we arrive at a description of a polymorphic, hierarchically organized stem with a typical length of 20&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2 base pairs. A comparison to linker conformations inferred for poly-601 fibers with different linker lengths suggests, that intra-stem interactions stabilize and facilitate the formation of dense chromatin fibers.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Fifty years after the discovery of the molecular structure of the DNA double helix, it is still unclear how DNA is arranged on the mesoscale between 10 and several hundred nanometers where essential processes such as replication, transcription and repair occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B1">1</xref>). In eukaryotic cells DNA is coated with at least an equal mass of proteins, forming a complex called chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B2">2</xref>). Its fundamental repeating unit, the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B3">3</xref>), is made of ~200&#8201;&#177;&#8201;40 base pairs (bp) of DNA and an octamer of core histones containing two copies of each H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B4">4</xref>).</p><p>The structure of the relatively rigid nucleosome core particle (NCP) has been resolved by cristallography at almost atomic resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B6">6</xref>). It comprises 145&#8211;147&#8201;bp of DNA, wrapped in ~1.65 left-handed superhelical turns around the core histones, with 14 well-defined contact points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B8">8</xref>).</p><p>Comparably detailed structural information does not exist for the <italic>soft</italic> parts of the nucleosome: thermal fluctuations displace their elements on lengthscales larger than atomic distances, preventing the use of standard high-resolution techniques. Filling this gap remains an important challenge, since the flexible elements are essential in the formation and the maintenance of chromatin fibers and mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B9 gkr573-B10 gkr573-B11">9&#8211;11</xref>): the linker DNA between NCPs, comprising 10&#8211;90&#8201;bp of DNA, via their mechanical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B12 gkr573-B13 gkr573-B14 gkr573-B15">12&#8211;15</xref>); the flexible NH<sub>2</sub>-tails of the core histones, introducing subtle interactions between NCPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B16 gkr573-B17 gkr573-B18 gkr573-B19 gkr573-B20 gkr573-B21 gkr573-B22">16&#8211;22</xref>); and the linker histone (H1/H5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B23 gkr573-B24 gkr573-B25 gkr573-B26">23&#8211;26</xref>). Here we focus on the linker histone, which plays a key role in the organization of linker DNA in chromatin fibers. It consists of a central globular domain (gH1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B27">27</xref>), flanked by basic amino- and C-terminal tails, and it binds DNA close to the entry of the NCP, resulting in a characteristic &#8216;stem&#8217; structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B28">28</xref>).</p><p>In a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B23">23</xref>), we have mapped the histone H1&#8211;DNA interactions within the nucleosome at a single base resolution. The physiologically relevant linker histone chaperone (NAP-1) was used to reconstitute histone H1 and truncated mutants on precisely positioned nucleosomal templates containing the 601 sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B29">29</xref>). The resulting complexes were validated and investigated by a combination of cryo-electron-microscopy (CEM) and &#8226;OH footprinting techniques. The footprints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr573-F1">Figure 1</xref>A) showed that binding of the globular domain protects the first 10&#8201;bp of the linkers as well as the DNA at the NCP dyad against &#8226;OH-induced cleavage. Binding either full-length H1 or the 1-127 COOH terminus truncation mutant causes the appearance of the characteristic stem structure in CEM images of tri-nucleosomes and an additional 10-bp repeat in the &#8226;OH cleavage pattern in the stem region of the linker DNA. The raw experimental data clearly identify sections of the nucleosomal DNA affected by the stem formation. As in the case of scattering or NMR experiments, further interpretation of the biochemical data requires the use of macromolecular models.

In the &#8216;Discussion&#8217; section, we present the emerging picture of the nucleosomal stem as a dynamic, polymorphic, hierarchically organized structure, composed of a &#8216;root&#8217; where gH1 binds to the first ~10&#8201;bp of the DNA linkers, a &#8216;trunk&#8217; formed by the association of the subsequent 10&#177;2 bp with the cationic C-terminus of H1, and a flexible &#8216;crown&#8217; or outer stem where the branching linkers exhibit substantial fluctuations, while preserving well-defined preferential contacts. In particular, we show that intra-stem interactions stabilize linker conformations closely related to those inferred from experiments on reconstituted poly-601 fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B35">35</xref>).

Intensity variations in parts of the traces (see window in the inset, right panel) allow the resolution of bands corresponding to strands with a specific length. Outside these windows, one can only discern an oscillation with the 10&#8201;bp helical period of DNA. The key step in the quantitative analysis of the gels is the identification of individual bands, i.e. the mapping from pixels to base pairs (see details in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr573/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link>). <bold>Middle panels:</bold> intensity per base pair, obtained by the integration of the raw signal over the bp width.

For a non-oscillating signal (in particular, the left end of the -H1 black trace), the last step effectively amplifies pure noise.

In each iteration, the running phase of the cosine is adjusted, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="gkr573i1.jpg"/></inline-formula>, to improve the correlation between signal and modulated cosine, in a moving window of 7 bands length. The width of the moving window allows to assign bands even in short intermediate regions without sufficient contrast, by using the fact that band widths do not change abruptly.

Thus by rotating the DNA loop by a half turn around the dyad axis while keeping the histone core in place, one generates a second approximately symmetric conformation in which the two strands change roles.</p><p>We make the hypothesis that these two conformations are equally represented in our experiments and take the accessibility profile of the complementary strand equal to that of the measured strand (both read from 5&#8242; to 3&#8242;). This hypothesis is supported by the co-localization of protected sites from both strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr573-F4">Figure 4</xref>B), and by the close agreement of the two dinucleosome signals obtained independently from the complementary strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr573-F2">Figure 2</xref>, left hand-side).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DNA and histone modeling</title><p>We have modeled DNA and histones at two different resolutions.

In contrast, the three-contact model is compatible with the experimentally observed protection pattern, reproducing both the characteristic double-peak dyad protection at bp 2 and the protected site at &#8722;80&#8201;bp.</p></sec><sec><title>(iii) Fully-protected stem structure based on DNA nano-mechanics</title><p>For the linker DNA stem, models based on high-resolution experimental studies are not available.</p><p>We argue that under the assumption that the protected sites in the stem arise from DNA&#8211;DNA contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B50">50</xref>), knowledge of (i) the detailed register of the protected sites along the stem and (ii) DNA nanoscale structure and elasticity are necessary and sufficient to extract valuable structural information.</p><p>To see that both types of information are required, consider first stem structures with juxtaposed, weakly deformed DNA entry and exit linkers. In general, these structures will fail to create contacts at the observed sites of maximal protection, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr573-F6">Figure 6</xref>A. Second, we note that any model for the center-line trajectory of the DNA linkers can be modified such that the protected sites on the two linkers face each other; this can be achieved simply by twisting DNA appropriately along its contour. It is thus impossible to conclude on a particular shape of the linker DNA center-lines purely on the basis of the geometric arrangement of protection patterns, neglecting the physical properties of DNA.</p><p>To construct a model for the linker stem structure we therefore minimized the DNA nanoscale elastic energy under the constraint that the alignment of the linkers in space reproduces the observed protection pattern (see &#8216;Materials and Methods&#8217; section for details). The resulting stem structure is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr573-F6">Figure 6</xref>C. The linkers come together ~20 bases outside the core particle, slightly curving into a two-start superhelical stem with a large pitch of around 100&#8211;120&#8201;bp, and extending at least to 40&#8201;bp from the NCP. This structure has, as the core particle itself, a 2-fold symmetry.</p></sec><sec><title>(iv) Soft structure based on nanoscale modeling of fluctuations</title><p>By construction, there is perfect agreement for the location and phasing of the protected sites in the experimental traces and in the structure-derived accessibility profile of the proposed stem structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr573-F7">Figure 7</xref>F). There is also qualitative agreement between the calculated and the observed degree of protection, even though one might argue that the model fails to reproduce the apparently weaker protection at the outermost P4 site. Since neither model nor experiment yield <italic>quantitative</italic> predictions or measurements of the DNA accessibility in the complex relative to naked DNA, it is difficult to refine the modeling or to draw more definite conclusions on the basis of the footprints alone.</p><p>However, a serious objection to the model presented thus far and in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B23">23</xref>) can be raised from a direct visual inspection of the CEM images of trinucleosomes: stems of corresponding size can only be distinguished in some of the CEM images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr573-F1">Figure 1</xref>B, row 3, image 2). Most images show considerable angles between the in- and outgoing linkers of the central nucleosome, i.e<italic>.</italic> conformations for which we would not expect any mutual protection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr573-F1">Figure 1</xref>, row 3, images 1, 3, 4, 5: note that the linker DNA between two successive NCPs is here 53&#8201;bp long, so that a 40&#8201;bp-long stem would fill nearly all of it. More images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr573-F8">Figure 8</xref>).

However, there is no reason to assume that the stem is rigid and always found in this conformation. Instead of considering our fully protected structure as &#8216;the&#8217; stem structure, we now develop a description of the stem in terms of an <italic>ensemble of thermally fluctuating, partially protected structures</italic>.</p><p>How and where do we expect fluctuations to occur? Can we obtain meaningful results without a detailed modeling of the physical interactions responsible for the stem formation (gH1 docking, tail-linker interactions including a full exploration of the conformational freedom of the histone tails, ion mediated DNA&#8211;DNA interactions, zipper-motives etc)?</p><p>We note that the DNA deformation free energy in the fully protected stem structure is small and not uniformly distributed: 90% of a total of 2<italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic> are localized in the first ~20&#8201;bp of the stem, close to gH1. While the binding of gH1 alone seems ineffective, H1 variants with a small fraction of the tail induce a noticable level of stem-like associations of the incoming and outgoing linker. In modeling fluctuations in this structure, it seems reasonable to assume that the effect of H1 decreases with physical distance from the molecule.</p><p>We therefore expect the stem to open and close in a zipper-like fashion from a nucleotide around the region where H1 is localized. The simplest way to build a range of corresponding models is to divide our original, fully protected structure into two zones: completely rigid up to a variable position beyond the identified docking points with the H1 globular domain and completely free beyond. By construction, our minimal-energy structure of the fully protected stem is part of all ensembles.</p><p>We have considered three variants of the stem with 16, 20, 24 rigid bp respectively. For comparison, we also built ensembles for gH1 (9 rigid bp) and -H1 nucleosomes (allowing partial unwrapping of the core DNA, see &#8216;Materials and Methods&#8217; section). For each model we have generated representative mono- and trinucleosome conformations. The fluctuating part of each ensemble is the result of thermal fluctuations of DNA modeled as a rigid base pair chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B30 gkr573-B31 gkr573-B32 gkr573-B33">30&#8211;33</xref>), with no adjustable parameter. The superpositions of aligned mononucleosome conformations shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr573-F7">Figure 7</xref> illustrate the range of fluctuations in the different ensembles with a crossover from extremely floppy to very rigid linkers. For each ensemble we have analyzed protection patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr573-F7">Figure 7</xref>) and trinucleosome snapshots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr573-F8">Figure 8</xref>), to see if we can reconcile the experimental footprinting and CEM data. The mononucleosome protection patterns shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr573-F7">Figure 7</xref> were computed directly on the nanoscale structures using a coarse-grained variant of the solvent-accessible area method. As to the trinucleosome conformations, we obviously do not expect to match the cryo-EM pictures one-by-one in a comparison to a correspondingly small ensemble of appropriately projected model conformations. Rather, we have classified snapshots into five categories from open structures (red) to more closed ones (blue), allowing us to compare ensembles according to a coarse statistics (we give the number of configurations of each color group, red-yellow-green-light blue-dark blue). For the definitions of the groups, see &#8216;Materials and Methods&#8217; section, last section. In the following we discuss the results for the various ensembles, where an increasing fraction of the linker DNA is held fixed in a rigid &#8216;root&#8217; of the nucleosomal stem.</p><p><bold>-H1:</bold> the gels show a protected site just at the level of statistical noise, at the position of the gH1 domain (P1, -79&#8201;bp), and no other protected sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr573-F7">Figure 7</xref>A). The -H1 ensemble exhibits a weak protection near the same position, generated by those nucleosomes where one linker arm transiently wraps around the core histones.</p><p>Furthermore, the ensemble reproduces the characteristic open trinucleosome conformations observed in the cryo-EM experiments. The repartition of the snapshots among the &#8216;color groups&#8217;, ranging from red (open structures) to blue, are: Experimental: 1-5-0-0-0; Model: 2-3-1-0-0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr573-F8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p><bold>gH1:</bold> experimental traces show weakly protected sites at the same positions as the ones observed for H1 (P2, P3 in the resolved region of that gel lane). The predicted positions for transiently protected sites are those observed, generated by particular conformations in which linkers spontaneously protect each other.</p><p>The model-derived trinucleosome pictures reproduce the tendency toward more closed conformations observed in the CEM pictures. Because of the apparent variety of shapes and the poorer quality of the images, it is difficult to draw any conclusion (Exp: 1-1-0-0-0, Mod: 0-0-4-1-0).</p><p><bold>H1:</bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr573-F7">Figure 7</xref>C&#8211;E show the protection patterns derived from the three ensembles with 16, 20, and 24&#8201;bp constrained to their positions in our minimal energy conformation for the fully protected stem. The extension of the rigid parts are indicated by green bars at the bottom of the graphs. Within these zones, the ensembles reproduce by construction the experimental protection patterns as well as the minimal elastic energy conformation of the fully protected stem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr573-F7">Figure 7</xref>F). As expected, the fluctuations reduce the protection in the outer zones. Interestingly, the transient contacts in the fluctuating ensembles are preferentially located at the experimentally observed positions. This is not an accident, but a direct consequence of the small elastic deformation energies in the outer part of our fully protected stem structure: the preferred positions of transient contacts in our model are controlled by the elastic properties of the linker DNA and the boundary conditions imposed by the rigidly held part. While the protection at P3 remains discernible in all three ensembles, the most flexible variant with only 16 fixed bp generates too little protection at P4 to be compatible with the experimental data. In contrast, the comparison of the model-derived trinucleosome images with the cryo EM pictures rather favors the softer models of the stem. The 16 and the 20 rigid bp models generate comparable distributions and varieties of structures, while the conformations from the 24-rigid bp model appear too uniform. (Exp: 0-0-5-4-2; Mod: H1-16 0-0-5-4-1, H1- 20 0-0-6-4-1, H1-24 0-0-9-1-0).</p><p>The comparisons show that we arrive at a coherent description, if we assume that the nucleosomal stem includes 20&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2&#8201;bp of linker DNA: (i) closed conformations occur with sufficient probability to explain the experimentally observed protection; (ii) the corresponding low resolution structures of tri-nucleosomes reproduce the conformational statistics of the corresponding cryo-pictures.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Based on our results, we view the nucleosomal stem as a dynamic, polymorphic, hierarchically organized structure composed of several parts:</p><p><italic>A root</italic> comprising the globular part of H1 and the first 10&#8201;bp of the linkers, where gH1 preferentially establishes three contacts: one at the dyad of the histone octamer and two with the linkers, which remain on average straight and symmetric up to bp 8. The formation of the root considerably reduces the range of fluctuations of the linkers and suppresses unwrapping from the histone core.</p><p><italic>A trunk</italic> or relatively rigid inner part of the stem, comprising the linkers up to bp 20&#177;2, in direct contact with the cationic amino&#8201;acids of the C-terminus of H1. It is in this region, that the DNA is deformed to partially align the two linkers. In our nanomechanical model, 90% of the elastic energy of the fully-protected stem structure of ~2<italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic> are located in the trunk. In our experiments, the formation of the trunk required a tail length of at least 15 AA (H1-127), indicating a biochemical control mechanism for this step.</p><p><italic>A flexible crown</italic> or outer stem where the branching linkers exhibit substantial fluctuations, while preserving well-defined preferential contacts. We note that by imposing a boundary condition on the linker conformation, the influence of the trunk structure may extend beyond the region of direct interactions between H1 and the linker DNA. In particular, the linkers might appear connected without there being strong direct interactions. In our experiments, this influence extends to at least 40&#8201;bp away from the NCP, reaching the typical linker lengths of native fibers (40&#8201;bp for a <italic>half-linker</italic>). Our experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B23">23</xref>) also suggest that the full C-terminus, while possibly stabilizing further the stem, does not qualitatively modify its structure. As a natural explanation for this effect, we suggest that the terminus may remain confined in the trunk region.</p><p>The hierarchical organization implies that the stem opens and closes in a zipper-like fashion. Under our experimental conditions, thermal fluctuations mainly affect the branching linkers in the crown. The response to external forces depends on their magnitude. While weak forces should essentially deform the crown, larger forces should disrupt the trunk and eventually the root before unwrapping the core particle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B51">51</xref>). Such forces may be exerted in a controlled manner in single-molecule experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B52">52</xref>). They also arise during the condensation of the chromatin fiber, where H1 might accommodate a fairly large range of linker conformations, if other interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B21">21</xref>) compensate the free energy cost of a stem deformation or a partial stem disruption. We note, that this view of the stem is a natural extension of the current, dynamic picture of the nucleosome core particle: instead of a passive and rigid wrapping of 147&#8201;bp of DNA in a conformation resembling crystal structure(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B53">53</xref>), DNA and histone octamers form a highly dynamic complex, where DNA spontaneously unwraps and rewraps from the ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B54">54</xref>) with actively created (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B55">55</xref>), diffusing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B57">57</xref>) defects ensuring mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B58">58</xref>).</p><p>How do our results match those of previous studies? There is a remarkable diversity of experimental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B26">26</xref>) and modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B59 gkr573-B60 gkr573-B61 gkr573-B62">59&#8211;62</xref>) results for the mode in which gH1 binds in what we now refer to as the &#8216;root&#8217; of the stem. The structures presented here are derived from experiments where mono-, di- and tri-nucleosomes were reconstituted following a carefully elaborated protocol recreating <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions such as the presence of the chaperone NAP-1. If we believe them to represent a free energy minimum for systems dominated by intra-stem interactions, it is an interesting question, whether other binding modes might serve to stabilize alternate structures in nucleosomes under external constraints. If one interprets the multitude of predicted gH1 binding modes in the root as a <italic>feature</italic> of the molecule and not as a failure of the employed modeling schemes, then the ability of the stem to adapt to external constraints might be even larger than apparent from our experiments.</p><p>Little was known about the trunk region. Neglecting fluctuations, Bharath <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B60">60</xref>) used structural analogies and bioinformatics methods to predict a placement of gH1 close to the two-contacts model of Zhoul <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B25">25</xref>). For the trunk, they proposed a particular conformation of the C-terminus making contact with the linker DNA up to 24&#8201;bp away from the NCP, beyond which the sharply bent linkers were supposed to diverge in the crown. While the predicted extension of the H1-DNA contacts is rather close to that of our trunk, the details of the proposed stem structure are incompatible with our experimental results. This hold for the resulting protection pattern close to the DNA dyad as well as for the predicted divergence of the two linkers beyond the contact zone with the H1 tail, which is difficult to reconcile with the experimentally observed protections P3 and P4 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr573-F7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, our results shed some new light on the question, which factors determine the structure of dense chromatin fibers. Is it the structure and elasticity of the stem, which discriminates between the possible helical arrangements of nucleosomes? Or do the linkers simply adapt to whatever constraints follow from the packing and the interactions of the core particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B63">63</xref>), thereby possibly frustrating the formation of a proper stem? Robinson <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B35">35</xref>) reported the properties of well-defined chromatin fibers reconstituted <italic>in vitro</italic> from poly-601 templates in presence of the linker histone H5. The templates were prepared for a range of well-controlled linker lengths (multiples of 10, from 30 to 90&#8201;bp). Based on these experiments, Wong <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B59">59</xref>) used DNA elastic models to infer the linker DNA paths in the Robinson <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B35">35</xref>) reconstituted fibers. The resulting Wong <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B59">59</xref>) &#8216;most favorable&#8217; structures shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr573-F9">Figure 9</xref> (A and C) belong to a remarkable variety of helix families. Nevertheless, the authors argued that (in our language) the DNA conformation in the root is approximately conserved among the structures: <italic>a posteriori</italic>, this feature allows for a common asymmetric three-contact binding mode of gH1/5, rather similar to the one inferred from our experiments. The only exception is the most favorable structure for the shortest linkers (30&#8201;bp or 15&#8201;bp for a <italic>half-linker</italic>), where the steric constraints seem indeed too strong to allow for the formation of the structure preferred by gH1 and where Wong <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B59">59</xref>) propose an alternative binding mode. Otherwise, it is striking to see on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr573-F9">Figure 9</xref>A, how, with increasing linker length, the Wong <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B59">59</xref>) conformations reproduce larger and larger parts of the mono-nucleosomal stem shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr573-F9">Figure 9</xref>B. Linker lengths 40&#8201;bp and larger thus possibly allow for the formation of a (deformed) trunk and further stabilization by the H1 tail, whereas they exhibit substantial variations in the external part corresponding to our crown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr573-F9">Figure 9</xref>C). At least qualitatively, the comparison of the two completely independent studies suggests a remarkable agreement between linker conformations required for achieving nucleosome packing in dense chromatin fibers and those stabilized by intra-stem interactions. Furthermore, the comparison illustrates the role of the polymorphic structure and hierarchic organization of the stem in stabilizing a wide variety of fibers. From a kinetic point of view, the emerging picture is that of a folding funnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B64">64</xref>), where the local stem formation helps to achieve the cooperative fiber folding. Some of these features may already be included in a coarse-grain model of the chromatin fiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B65">65</xref>), which is compatible with our description of the root of the stem. Quantitatively, we crucially miss experimental or computational estimates of the orientation-dependent interactions between the core particles and of the (deformation-dependent) stem formation and interaction free energies to be able to embark on the systematic modeling of fiber conformations.

The relevant structures are huge on the molecular scale and their intrinsic softness is a major obstacle to diffraction or NMR studies. On the other hand, they are too small to be imaged with the required resolution. Here, we have presented a detailed report of our attempt to develop a three-dimensional, dynamical coarse-grain model of the nucleosomal stem formed by the histone H1/H5 and the in- and outgoing linker DNA. We have combined available crystal and NMR structures (NCP and gH1, respectively) and the knowledge of the (sequence-dependent) B-DNA structure and elasticity with the results of our CEM and &#8226;OH footprinting experiments for carefully reconstituded model nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B23">23</xref>).</p><p>This combination lead to a surprisingly clear picture of the nucleosome and of how H1 binds to and organizes nucleosomal DNA. In a first step of our analysis, we have shown that the calculated footprinting pattern of a three-contact gH1-nucleosome structure based on a model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B24">24</xref>) for the placement of H5 (gH5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr573-F5">Figure 5</xref>A) matches very well the experimental pattern, whereas suggested two-contact models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B26">26</xref>) were incompatible with the strong protection observed at the dyad.</p><p>In a second step, we reasoned that the observed periodic protections on the linker DNA stem are a signature of DNA&#8211;DNA contacts, and that the precise positioning of the protected sites provides a valuable information. To model the stem structure, we have used a nanomechanical model of DNA, compatible with the qualitative character of the measured protection amplitude. We have aligned the linkers in space in a way that their mutual protection reproduces the measured accessibility profile and have assumed that the most likely structure has minimal DNA elastic energy. The resulting stem structure is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr573-F6">Figure 6</xref>C. The linkers come together ~20 bases outside the core particle, slightly curving into a two-start superhelical stem with a large pitch of around 100&#8211;120&#8201;bp, and extending at least to 40&#8201;bp from the NCP. This structure has, as the core particle itself, a 2-fold symmetry.</p><p>In the third step, we have developed a description of the stem in terms of an ensemble of fluctuating, partially-protected structures. We have shown that (i) transient contacts are sufficiently well-defined to cause an experimentally observable partial protection if we assume a stem length of 20 or 24&#8201;bp, and (ii) the CEM pictures of reconstituted tri-nucleosomes are best reproduced by ensembles of fluctuating stems with a rigid part of 16 or 20&#8201;bps Combining these results, we therefore estimate that the rigid part of the stem incorporates 20&#177;2&#8201;bps of linker DNA. Interestingly, this corresponds to the extent of the linker DNA which is close enough to the globular part of H1 to directly interact with the (truncated) COOH-terminus of H1, which plays a crucial role in the stem formation.</p><p>In the final step, we have developed a picture of the nucleosomal stem as a dynamic, polymorphic, hierarchically organized structure, composed of a &#8216;root&#8217; where gH1 binds to the first ~10&#8201;bp of the DNA linkers, a &#8216;trunk&#8217; formed by the association of the subsequent 10&#177;2&#8201;bp with the cationic C-terminus of H1, and a flexible &#8216;crown&#8217; or outer stem where the branching linkers exhibit substantial fluctuations, while preserving well-defined preferential contacts. To understand the role of H1 in the folding of compact chromatin fibers, we have compared our (thermal) ensemble of <italic>mono-</italic>nucleosome stem conformations to an ensemble of &#8216;most favorable&#8217; linker conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B59">59</xref>) inferred from experiments on reconstituted poly-601 <italic>fibers</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr573-B35">35</xref>). Remarkably, for a wide range of linker lengths, the inferred linker conformations in the poly-601 fibers appear compatible with slightly deformed variants of the mono-nucleosomal stem. For shorter linkers, where the packing constraints become more severe, partial binding of H1 can still contribute to the stabilization of dense fibers. Finally, we hypothesize that the cooperative folding of dense chromatin fibers is facilitated by the hierarchical of the stem and the tendency of local intra-stem interactions to stabilize linker conformations, which prevent non organization-local steric clashes between nucleosomes.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr573/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Grants from <funding-source>Institut National de la Sant&#233; et de la Recherche M&#233;dicale</funding-source>, <funding-source>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</funding-source>; <funding-source>Agence Nationale de la Recherche &#8216;EPIVAR&#8217;</funding-source> <award-id>N 08-BLAN-0320-02</award-id> (to S.D.); <award-id>ANR-09-BLAN-NT09-485720</award-id> &#8216;CHROREMBER&#8217; (to D.A., S.D. and J.B.); Chair of excellence program from the ANR (to R.E.); Grant <funding-source>Agency of the Czech Republic</funding-source> (<award-id>LC535,30 MSM0021620806</award-id> and <award-id>AV0Z50110509</award-id>).
