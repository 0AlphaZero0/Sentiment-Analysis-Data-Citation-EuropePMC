</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fifty years after the discovery of the molecular structure of the DNA double helix, it is still unclear how DNA is arranged on the mesoscale between 10 and several hundred nanometers where essential processes such as replication, transcription and repair occur (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In eukaryotic cells DNA is coated with at least an equal mass of proteins, forming a complex called chromatin (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Its fundamental repeating unit, the nucleosome (3), is made of ~200 ± 40 base pairs (bp) of DNA and an octamer of core histones containing two copies of each H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 (4). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The structure of the relatively rigid nucleosome core particle (NCP) has been resolved by cristallography at almost atomic resolution (5,6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It comprises 145–147 bp of DNA, wrapped in ~1.65 left-handed superhelical turns around the core histones, with 14 well-defined contact points (7,8). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Comparably detailed structural information does not exist for the soft parts of the nucleosome: thermal fluctuations displace their elements on lengthscales larger than atomic distances, preventing the use of standard high-resolution techniques. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Filling this gap remains an important challenge, since the flexible elements are essential in the formation and the maintenance of chromatin fibers and mitotic chromosomes (9–11): the linker DNA between NCPs, comprising 10–90 bp of DNA, via their mechanical properties (12–15); the flexible NH2-tails of the core histones, introducing subtle interactions between NCPs (16–22); and the linker histone (H1/H5) (23–26). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Here we focus on the linker histone, which plays a key role in the organization of linker DNA in chromatin fibers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>It consists of a central globular domain (gH1) (27), flanked by basic amino- and C-terminal tails, and it binds DNA close to the entry of the NCP, resulting in a characteristic ‘stem’ structure (28). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In a recent study (23), we have mapped the histone H1–DNA interactions within the nucleosome at a single base resolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The physiologically relevant linker histone chaperone (NAP-1) was used to reconstitute histone H1 and truncated mutants on precisely positioned nucleosomal templates containing the 601 sequence (29). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The resulting complexes were validated and investigated by a combination of cryo-electron-microscopy (CEM) and •OH footprinting techniques. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The footprints (Figure 1A) showed that binding of the globular domain protects the first 10 bp of the linkers as well as the DNA at the NCP dyad against •OH-induced cleavage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Binding either full-length H1 or the 1-127 COOH terminus truncation mutant causes the appearance of the characteristic stem structure in CEM images of tri-nucleosomes and an additional 10-bp repeat in the •OH cleavage pattern in the stem region of the linker DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The raw experimental data clearly identify sections of the nucleosomal DNA affected by the stem formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>As in the case of scattering or NMR experiments, further interpretation of the biochemical data requires the use of macromolecular models. Figure 1.Illustration of the available data from (23). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The dyad region is protected by all H1 mutants, as well as the first 10 bps of the linker. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In the present article, we develop a three-dimensional, dynamical coarse-grain model of the nucleosomal stem formed by the histone H1/H5 and the in- and outgoing linker DNA chains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The model integrates our CEM and footprinting results (23) together with crystal and NMR structures for the NCP (7) and the linker histone (27) and knowledge on the (sequence-dependent) B-DNA structure and elasticity (30–34), and can be related to experiments on model chromatin fibers (35). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The article is organized as follows: in the ‘Materials and Methods’ section and the ‘Results’ section we cover (i) the numerical analysis of the footprinting gels, (ii) the test of previously proposed atomistic models for the placement of the globular gH1 domain (24–26), (iii) the determination of the most likely coarse-grain conformation of the H1-bound linker DNA stem in the state of maximal protection, and (iv) the comparison of a thermal ensemble of fluctuating stem structures to footprinting and CEM data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In the ‘Discussion’ section, we present the emerging picture of the nucleosomal stem as a dynamic, polymorphic, hierarchically organized structure, composed of a ‘root’ where gH1 binds to the first ~10 bp of the DNA linkers, a ‘trunk’ formed by the association of the subsequent 10±2 bp with the cationic C-terminus of H1, and a flexible ‘crown’ or outer stem where the branching linkers exhibit substantial fluctuations, while preserving well-defined preferential contacts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In particular, we show that intra-stem interactions stabilize linker conformations closely related to those inferred from experiments on reconstituted poly-601 fibers (35). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>These raw traces are processed as described below. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The steps of the process are illustrated on Figure 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>More details are available in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr573/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link>. Figure 2.Post-processing of the footprinting gels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Upper panels: available raw data for di- and mononucleosomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Intensity variations in parts of the traces (see window in the inset, right panel) allow the resolution of bands corresponding to strands with a specific length. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Outside these windows, one can only discern an oscillation with the 10 bp helical period of DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The key step in the quantitative analysis of the gels is the identification of individual bands, i.e. the mapping from pixels to base pairs (see details in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr573/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link>). Middle panels: intensity per base pair, obtained by the integration of the raw signal over the bp width. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Bottom panels: relative accessibilities: the intensity per base pair is rescaled by the maxima in a moving window (of 7–20 bp width). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The resulting signal represents the relative accessibility of a site compared to its neighbors (in the same trace). Left hand-side: H1-bound dinucleosome traces in the NCP dyad region—red, green, blue—from the same gel, with different •OH concentrations; black: complementary strand, from another gel. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The consistency of the resulting signals (from independent traces with different relative noise) shows the robustness of the procedure (maximum difference ~0.1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>However, this signal does not represent the absolute accessibility, so that the amplitudes of different traces (or regions) cannot be directly compared (see text). Right hand-side: available mononucleosome traces in the linker region: -H1 (black), gH1 (green), +H1 (purple); the signals are shown in the resolved region where individual bands could be identified for the three signals (see window in the inset): only one available trace for each. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>For a non-oscillating signal (in particular, the left end of the -H1 black trace), the last step effectively amplifies pure noise. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>We therefore excluded from the subsequent analysis the data for which this effect prevents any reliable interpretation. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>The varying width of individual bands (7–14 pixels in this example) results from a combination of logarithmic migration and irregularities in the gel material. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>In a first step we determine the non-linear relation between migrated distance (in pixels) and base number. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>To determine the positions in pixels x(n) of individual bands (numbered by n), we first de-trended the intensity traces by subtracting a suitable moving average. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>We then iteratively maximized the correlation between this signal and a modulated cosine function A(x)cos[2πn(x)], where A is slowly varying. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>In each iteration, the running phase of the cosine is adjusted, , to improve the correlation between signal and modulated cosine, in a moving window of 7 bands length. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The width of the moving window allows to assign bands even in short intermediate regions without sufficient contrast, by using the fact that band widths do not change abruptly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>To ensure that no base pair has been missed, we checked by eye the maximum positions and the final base pair-pixel correspondence x(n). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The unresolved regions, where the bands could not be reliably positioned (irregular band widths), were excluded of the analysis (the resolved region of the linker is shown in the inset of Figure 2, right upper panel). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>To relate •OH protected areas to absolute sites on the nucleosome (with the dyad base pair centered at 0), rather than band numbers only, we identified absolute lengths of DNA fragments on the gels by using a combination of molecular weight markers present in the mononucleosome gels, laser UV irradiation and Fpg glycosylase treatment (36), and comparison with absolute positions determined in dinucleosome gels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>The unique positioning of the 601 sequence on the nucleosome then allowed to assign DNA lengths to nucleosomal sites. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Thus by rotating the DNA loop by a half turn around the dyad axis while keeping the histone core in place, one generates a second approximately symmetric conformation in which the two strands change roles. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>Based on our results, we view the nucleosomal stem as a dynamic, polymorphic, hierarchically organized structure composed of several parts: </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>A root comprising the globular part of H1 and the first 10 bp of the linkers, where gH1 preferentially establishes three contacts: one at the dyad of the histone octamer and two with the linkers, which remain on average straight and symmetric up to bp 8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>The formation of the root considerably reduces the range of fluctuations of the linkers and suppresses unwrapping from the histone core. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>A trunk or relatively rigid inner part of the stem, comprising the linkers up to bp 20±2, in direct contact with the cationic amino acids of the C-terminus of H1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>It is in this region, that the DNA is deformed to partially align the two linkers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>In our nanomechanical model, 90% of the elastic energy of the fully-protected stem structure of ~2kBT are located in the trunk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>In our experiments, the formation of the trunk required a tail length of at least 15 AA (H1-127), indicating a biochemical control mechanism for this step. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="343" pm="."><plain>A flexible crown or outer stem where the branching linkers exhibit substantial fluctuations, while preserving well-defined preferential contacts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>We note that by imposing a boundary condition on the linker conformation, the influence of the trunk structure may extend beyond the region of direct interactions between H1 and the linker DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>In particular, the linkers might appear connected without there being strong direct interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>In our experiments, this influence extends to at least 40 bp away from the NCP, reaching the typical linker lengths of native fibers (40 bp for a half-linker). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>Our experiments (23) also suggest that the full C-terminus, while possibly stabilizing further the stem, does not qualitatively modify its structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>As a natural explanation for this effect, we suggest that the terminus may remain confined in the trunk region. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>The hierarchical organization implies that the stem opens and closes in a zipper-like fashion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>Under our experimental conditions, thermal fluctuations mainly affect the branching linkers in the crown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>The response to external forces depends on their magnitude. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="352" pm="."><plain>While weak forces should essentially deform the crown, larger forces should disrupt the trunk and eventually the root before unwrapping the core particle (51). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="353" pm="."><plain>Such forces may be exerted in a controlled manner in single-molecule experiments (52). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="354" pm="."><plain>They also arise during the condensation of the chromatin fiber, where H1 might accommodate a fairly large range of linker conformations, if other interactions (18,20,21) compensate the free energy cost of a stem deformation or a partial stem disruption. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="355" pm="."><plain>We note, that this view of the stem is a natural extension of the current, dynamic picture of the nucleosome core particle: instead of a passive and rigid wrapping of 147 bp of DNA in a conformation resembling crystal structure(s) (7,53), DNA and histone octamers form a highly dynamic complex, where DNA spontaneously unwraps and rewraps from the ends (48,49,54) with actively created (55), diffusing (56,57) defects ensuring mobility (58). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="356" pm="?"><plain>How do our results match those of previous studies? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="357" pm="."><plain>There is a remarkable diversity of experimental (25,26) and modeling (24,59–62) results for the mode in which gH1 binds in what we now refer to as the ‘root’ of the stem. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="358" pm="."><plain>The structures presented here are derived from experiments where mono-, di- and tri-nucleosomes were reconstituted following a carefully elaborated protocol recreating in vivo conditions such as the presence of the chaperone NAP-1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="359" pm="."><plain>If we believe them to represent a free energy minimum for systems dominated by intra-stem interactions, it is an interesting question, whether other binding modes might serve to stabilize alternate structures in nucleosomes under external constraints. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="360" pm="."><plain>If one interprets the multitude of predicted gH1 binding modes in the root as a feature of the molecule and not as a failure of the employed modeling schemes, then the ability of the stem to adapt to external constraints might be even larger than apparent from our experiments. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="361" pm="."><plain>Little was known about the trunk region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="362" pm="."><plain>Neglecting fluctuations, Bharath et al. (60) used structural analogies and bioinformatics methods to predict a placement of gH1 close to the two-contacts model of Zhoul et al. (25). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="363" pm="."><plain>For the trunk, they proposed a particular conformation of the C-terminus making contact with the linker DNA up to 24 bp away from the NCP, beyond which the sharply bent linkers were supposed to diverge in the crown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="364" pm="."><plain>While the predicted extension of the H1-DNA contacts is rather close to that of our trunk, the details of the proposed stem structure are incompatible with our experimental results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="365" pm="."><plain>This hold for the resulting protection pattern close to the DNA dyad as well as for the predicted divergence of the two linkers beyond the contact zone with the H1 tail, which is difficult to reconcile with the experimentally observed protections P3 and P4 (see Figure 7). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="366" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, our results shed some new light on the question, which factors determine the structure of dense chromatin fibers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="367" pm="?"><plain>Is it the structure and elasticity of the stem, which discriminates between the possible helical arrangements of nucleosomes? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="368" pm="?"><plain>Or do the linkers simply adapt to whatever constraints follow from the packing and the interactions of the core particles (63), thereby possibly frustrating the formation of a proper stem? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="369" pm="."><plain>Robinson et al. (35) reported the properties of well-defined chromatin fibers reconstituted in vitro from poly-601 templates in presence of the linker histone H5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="370" pm="."><plain>The templates were prepared for a range of well-controlled linker lengths (multiples of 10, from 30 to 90 bp). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="371" pm="."><plain>Based on these experiments, Wong et al. (59) used DNA elastic models to infer the linker DNA paths in the Robinson et al. (35) reconstituted fibers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="372" pm="."><plain>The resulting Wong et al. (59) ‘most favorable’ structures shown in Figure 9 (A and C) belong to a remarkable variety of helix families. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="373" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the authors argued that (in our language) the DNA conformation in the root is approximately conserved among the structures: a posteriori, this feature allows for a common asymmetric three-contact binding mode of gH1/5, rather similar to the one inferred from our experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="374" pm="."><plain>The only exception is the most favorable structure for the shortest linkers (30 bp or 15 bp for a half-linker), where the steric constraints seem indeed too strong to allow for the formation of the structure preferred by gH1 and where Wong et al. (59) propose an alternative binding mode. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="375" pm="."><plain>Otherwise, it is striking to see on Figure 9A, how, with increasing linker length, the Wong et al. (59) conformations reproduce larger and larger parts of the mono-nucleosomal stem shown in Figure 9B. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="376" pm="."><plain>Linker lengths 40 bp and larger thus possibly allow for the formation of a (deformed) trunk and further stabilization by the H1 tail, whereas they exhibit substantial variations in the external part corresponding to our crown (Figure 9C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="377" pm="."><plain>At least qualitatively, the comparison of the two completely independent studies suggests a remarkable agreement between linker conformations required for achieving nucleosome packing in dense chromatin fibers and those stabilized by intra-stem interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="378" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the comparison illustrates the role of the polymorphic structure and hierarchic organization of the stem in stabilizing a wide variety of fibers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="379" pm="."><plain>From a kinetic point of view, the emerging picture is that of a folding funnel (64), where the local stem formation helps to achieve the cooperative fiber folding. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="399" pm="."><plain>In a first step of our analysis, we have shown that the calculated footprinting pattern of a three-contact gH1-nucleosome structure based on a model (24) for the placement of H5 (gH5) (Figure 5A) matches very well the experimental pattern, whereas suggested two-contact models (25,26) were incompatible with the strong protection observed at the dyad. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="400" pm="."><plain>In a second step, we reasoned that the observed periodic protections on the linker DNA stem are a signature of DNA–DNA contacts, and that the precise positioning of the protected sites provides a valuable information. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="401" pm="."><plain>To model the stem structure, we have used a nanomechanical model of DNA, compatible with the qualitative character of the measured protection amplitude. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="402" pm="."><plain>We have aligned the linkers in space in a way that their mutual protection reproduces the measured accessibility profile and have assumed that the most likely structure has minimal DNA elastic energy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="403" pm="."><plain>The resulting stem structure is shown in Figure 6C. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="404" pm="."><plain>The linkers come together ~20 bases outside the core particle, slightly curving into a two-start superhelical stem with a large pitch of around 100–120 bp, and extending at least to 40 bp from the NCP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="405" pm="."><plain>This structure has, as the core particle itself, a 2-fold symmetry. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="406" pm="."><plain>In the third step, we have developed a description of the stem in terms of an ensemble of fluctuating, partially-protected structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="407" pm="."><plain>We have shown that (i) transient contacts are sufficiently well-defined to cause an experimentally observable partial protection if we assume a stem length of 20 or 24 bp, and (ii) the CEM pictures of reconstituted tri-nucleosomes are best reproduced by ensembles of fluctuating stems with a rigid part of 16 or 20 bps Combining these results, we therefore estimate that the rigid part of the stem incorporates 20±2 bps of linker DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="408" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, this corresponds to the extent of the linker DNA which is close enough to the globular part of H1 to directly interact with the (truncated) COOH-terminus of H1, which plays a crucial role in the stem formation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="409" pm="."><plain>In the final step, we have developed a picture of the nucleosomal stem as a dynamic, polymorphic, hierarchically organized structure, composed of a ‘root’ where gH1 binds to the first ~10 bp of the DNA linkers, a ‘trunk’ formed by the association of the subsequent 10±2 bp with the cationic C-terminus of H1, and a flexible ‘crown’ or outer stem where the branching linkers exhibit substantial fluctuations, while preserving well-defined preferential contacts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="410" pm="."><plain>To understand the role of H1 in the folding of compact chromatin fibers, we have compared our (thermal) ensemble of mono-nucleosome stem conformations to an ensemble of ‘most favorable’ linker conformations (59) inferred from experiments on reconstituted poly-601 fibers (35). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="411" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, for a wide range of linker lengths, the inferred linker conformations in the poly-601 fibers appear compatible with slightly deformed variants of the mono-nucleosomal stem. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="412" pm="."><plain>For shorter linkers, where the packing constraints become more severe, partial binding of H1 can still contribute to the stabilization of dense fibers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="413" pm="."><plain>Finally, we hypothesize that the cooperative folding of dense chromatin fibers is facilitated by the hierarchical of the stem and the tendency of local intra-stem interactions to stabilize linker conformations, which prevent non organization-local steric clashes between nucleosomes. </plain></SENT>
