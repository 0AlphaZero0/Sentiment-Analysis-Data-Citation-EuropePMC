</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Although the capability of mass spectrometry based proteomics has been greatly enhanced, the challenge of dynamic range is not fully solved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Individual proteins in a proteome are expressed at dramatically different levels, and the low abundance, or ‘deep’ proteome remains elusive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In blood plasma, the dynamic range of protein abundance may span as much as 12 orders of magnitude [1], [2] and even in simple cellular systems such as yeast cytosol, expression may range over four orders of magnitude [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The most common approach to global proteome analysis is based on LC-MS/MS of tryptic peptides. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The dynamic range of a typical LC-MS/MS analysis is such that it is not feasible to accommodate the range of protein expression levels in a typical tissue preparation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In particular, the low abundance proteins are difficult to analyze because of limited instrument sensitivity and ‘crowding’ of the analyte stream by high abundance peptides that trigger data dependent acquisition and which may cause ion suppression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Data independent data acquisition can ease this problem, but not completely. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Prefractionation and enrichment of subclasses of proteins such as those decorated with specific post-translational modifications can give selective enrichment [5], but can introduce the possibility of higher variance due to sample preparation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>More commonly and generically, two strategies of selective proteome manipulation have been employed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>First, depletion strategies are subtractive methods that use affinity methods, usually based on antigen∶antibody interaction for selective removal of abundant proteins from a sample [6], [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Almost without exception, this approach has been applied to human blood plasma [8]–[10] and has the goal of removal of major protein species that contribute the most intense ions in an LC-MS/MS analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Whilst such approaches can deplete abundant proteins (provided appropriate high specificity antibodies are available) they are not capable of enriching trace proteins, and under certain conditions can be non-specific in removing selected high abundance proteins [11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The second common approach to reduction of the dynamic range of a complex mixture of proteins is that of sample equalization [12]–[20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>This method uses combinatorial peptide libraries to generate a complex set of bead-immobilized ligands, each of which is able to bind, with variable affinity, a small subset of proteins in the analyte. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>A library of linear hexapeptides based on 20 naturally occurring amino acids has the potential to create a library of 64 million different ligands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Because each ligand is present at low abundance, the outcome is that high abundance proteins are bound to the beads at a finite capacity, and provided that adequate starting material is applied to the beads, low abundance proteins will eventually bind a similar number of beads, the outcome of which is to equalize the protein mixture attached to the beads. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Proteome equalization has predominantly been applied to analysis of human blood plasma, but lesserly to urine [12], [13] and serum [15], [21] as well as non-blood samples including cell and tissue lysates [22]–[27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>However, the emphasis on secreted biofluids, and in particular blood plasma has tended to direct focus to the specific challenges associated with this material and in particular, the reduction in the signal for serum albumin, antibodies and other major plasma proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In tissues, protein dynamic range is often not as exaggerated as in plasma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>However, one tissue in particular, skeletal muscle, exhibits an asymmetry in the dynamic range of protein expression that is probably as extreme as blood plasma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>This is due to two dominant fractions – the contractile apparatus and the sarcoplasmic fraction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The contractile apparatus (predominantly actin and myosin) is readily removed from skeletal muscle preparations as it is insoluble under low ionic strength conditions [28], [29], but the residual component - the soluble protein fraction - also betrays a remarkable degree of specialization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>One-dimensional or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis emphasizes the high level expression of a few tens of proteins, largely comprising the glycolytic enzymes responsible for fuelling muscle contraction – see for example [30]–[35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In fact, the soluble fraction from skeletal muscle might present as much of a challenge in terms of proteome dynamic range as does blood plasma. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>It is thought that combinatorial equalization might not be compatible with absolute quantification, because of the finite capacity of the library for each protein, and because experiments are designed to suppress high abundance proteins, allowing measurement of low abundance components. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Thus, high abundance proteins saturate the beads, and cannot be quantified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>However, low abundance proteins might be accumulated on the library in sufficiently a linear fashion to permit sub-saturating quantification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>That is only possible if the binding of the analyte is unaffected by the total protein exposure to the beads or the time of exposure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>In this study, we applied the combinatorial equalization library to the soluble proteins of chicken skeletal muscle, a tissue that we have studied previously [31], [35], [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>In particular, we set out to explore the outcome of an exaggerated over-saturation of the library to input protein pool. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>By the use of label-free [37]–[42] and QconCAT-based [35], [43], [44] analyses, we have uncovered behaviors, not previously seen in studies of extracellular fluids such as blood plasma, that may complicate the equalization of some types of cellular proteins. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Two explanations are offered for this behavior. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>First, the hexapeptide library on the bead might contain sufficient hydrophobic peptides to permit binding of proteins such as heat shock proteins to multiple beads, leading to asymmetric equalization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>However, this is not a particularly satisfactory explanation for the other proteins that demonstrate similar behavior. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>The second explanation is that the beads can act as scaffolds for the assembly of complex networks that can accumulate in successive layers on the bead surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>The heat shock proteins are able to bind a wide range of proteins with exposed hydrophobic surfaces, and their marked predominance in the heavily loaded beads suggests that this is the case. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>The marked enhancement of HSP90 and α-actinin imply the development of a large assembly of protein complexes consisting primarily of these proteins, implying a preferential association between these molecules. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>The interaction between the hexapeptides in the library and the target proteins should be expected to vary from protein to protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Electrostatic interactions would be anticipated to diminish at high ionic strength, whereas for salts such as NaCl used here, hydrophobic interactions should be strengthened. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>The pattern of protein binding could therefore be expected to depend on solution conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>To test this, portions of the hexapeptide beads were incubated with skeletal muscle soluble proteins in two buffers, one at low ionic strength (50 mM) and one at high ionic strength (200 mM). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Slightly more protein was bound to the beads at high ionic strength (Figure 6a), behavior that would be consistent with enhancement of hydrophobic interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>At these low protein loadings, similar numbers of proteins were bound, with slightly more proteins being retained by the beads at the higher ionic strength. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>However, this overall description conceals the variation elicited by ionic strength. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Of 222 proteins bound to the beads at 25 mg load, 107 were exclusively bound at high ionic strength, 41 proteins were bound at low ionic strength and 74 were bound at both ionic strength values. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>For the proteins bound at both solution conditions, the ratio of the quantity of protein bound at high∶low ionic strength values varied considerably, from over 30∶1 (lactate dehydrogenase A) to 0.03∶1 (titin). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>It is clear that the solution conditions can have a profound influence on the protein binding profile, which opens up new opportunities for extending the scope and range of the equalization profiles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>To illustrate the difference in behavior of individual proteins at different ionic strength values, representative proteins are included in Figure 6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Some proteins, notably the glycolytic enzymes such as glyceraldehyde-3-phospate dehydrogenase or glycogen phosphorylase are bound to a greater extent in high ionic strength buffers. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Although it has a high dynamic range of protein expression, plasma does not contain high concentrations of heat shock proteins, and, almost by virtue of their function in plasma, true plasma proteins might not be anticipated to have exposed hydrophobic surfaces, although serum albumin is known to have exposed hydrophobic regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>However, any tissue sample would be anticipated to be replete with heat shock proteins, and the behavior that is observed here with the soluble proteins of skeletal muscle might be replicated with other tissue samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>For cellular material or tissues, the quest for the ‘democratic proteome’ [18] may well be thwarted by the inability of some proteins to behave as anticipated, democratically, and indeed, subvert the behavior of other proteins. </plain></SENT>
