Current methods focus on the geometry and detailed chemical interactions within putative binding pockets, but may not recognize distant similarities where dynamics or modified interactions allow one ligand to bind apparently divergent binding pockets. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm that seeks similar microenvironments within two binding sites, and assesses overall binding site similarity by the presence of multiple shared microenvironments. The method has relatively weak geometric requirements (to allow for conformational change or dynamics in both the ligand and the pocket) and uses multiple biophysical and biochemical measures to characterize the microenvironments (to allow for diverse modes of ligand binding). We term the algorithm PocketFEATURE, since it focuses on pockets using the FEATURE system for characterizing microenvironments. We validate PocketFEATURE first by showing that it can better discriminate sites that bind similar ligands from those that do not, and by showing that we can recognize FAD-binding sites on a proteome scale with Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 92%. We then apply PocketFEATURE to evolutionarily distant kinases, for which the method recognizes several proven distant relationships, and predicts unexpected shared ligand binding. Using experimental data from ChEMBL and Ambit, we show that at high significance level, 40 kinase pairs are predicted to share ligands. Some of these pairs offer new opportunities for inhibiting two proteins in a single pathway.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Small molecule drugs may interact with many proteins. Some of these interactions may cause unexpected effects, including side effects or potentially useful therapeutic effects. One way to predict these effects is to analyze the three-dimensional structure of target proteins, and identify new binding sites for small molecule drugs. Several methods have been proposed for predicting new binding sites, relying on geometric and functional complementarity of the sites and the small molecules. In this paper, we report on a new method for identifying novel protein-drug interactions by analyzing the similarity between binding sites in proteins. The method has relatively weak geometric requirements and allows for conformational change or dynamics in both the ligand and protein. Our results show that geometric flexibility is useful for effectively comparing sites. We have applied the method to evolutionarily distant kinases, and find unexpected shared inhibitor binding. Our results may be valuable for drug repurposing in order to find novel uses for existing kinase inhibitors.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Structural biology studies have provided large numbers of high-resolution proteins, often bound to small molecule ligands. The ability to predict additional ligands that will bind these proteins is an exciting opportunity for understanding drug action and repurposing. In some cases, the binding of a small molecule to a protein may explain otherwise unexpected effects of the small molecule, such as side effects of drugs. In other cases, the binding of a small molecule may suggest new uses of existing drugs, based on unexpected affinity to new targets.</p><p>Previous methods for predicting the potential binding of small molecules to protein pockets have used evolutionary, structural, biochemical and geometric properties in order to assess pocket similarity, or ligand-pocket complementarity <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-Brakoulias1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-Weisel1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-Weill1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-Schalon1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-KellenbergerE1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. For example, the method of sequence order-independent profile-profile alignment (SOIPPA) <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-Xie1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> can recognize binding site similarity between the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and off-targets, including retinoid X receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). These new targets may explain adverse drug effects of CETP inhibitors <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-Xie2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. SOIPPA represents binding sites with a tessellation of C-alpha atoms and characterizes binding sites using geometric similarity potentials. SOIPPA evaluates 3D alignments between binding sites that are enriched for similar angles and distances between residues. It then gauges overall similarity based on geometric criteria, evolutionary and biochemical properties.</p><p>Like SOIPPA, other methods for locally comparing binding sites typically have three steps <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-KellenbergerE1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>: (1) representation of binding sites, (2) 3D alignment between two sites and (3) evaluation of a similarity metric to the two sites. Searching for the best 3D alignment is the essential step. There are geometric hashing methods (SiteEngine <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-ShulmanPeleg1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and SiteBase <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-Brakoulias1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>) and methods based on clique detection (SOIPPA <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-Xie1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, CavBase <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-Kuhn1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and eF-site <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-Kinoshita1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>). These methods use thresholds to control the similarity of local geometries in both types of methods, but these can be difficult to set. In particular, flexible matching can be critical in achieving high performance <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-Teague1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Thornton et al showed that binding sites with similar ligands display greater conformational variability than the corresponding ligand molecules <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-Kahraman1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Thus, using predefined geometric models and thresholds is not optimal. Excessive reliance on crystallographic poses for both the protein and the ligand can miss potential similarities.</p><p>We have previously described the FEATURE methods for describing active sites <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-Bagley1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In the FEATURE representation, a protein site is represented by one or more microenvironments&#8212;statistical descriptions of the occurrence of atoms, residues, secondary structures as well as biochemical and biophysical properties in radial shells around a central point <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. We have shown that the FEATURE representation is useful for describing sites for Ca++ binding <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, Mg++ binding <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-Banatao1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, serine protease active sites <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-Bagley1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, thioredoxin active sites <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-Tang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and others <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. We have also used it to evaluate the ability of engineered loops to bind ligands <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In this work, we reasoned that the interactions between microenvironments in the target protein and chemical fragments in the ligand may drive molecular recognition. Because the conformational arrangement of fragments within flexible ligand molecules can be very different, we allow the corresponding microenvironments to adopt different relative geometries. We develop an algorithm, PocketFEATURE, to match microenvironments within pockets in order to find pockets with potentially similar binding capabilities.</p><p>We validate PocketFEATURE by testing its performance on two tasks. First, we test its ability to detect the similarity of binding sites that are known to bind the same (containing adenine-ribose) ligands&#8211;a test of sensitivity. Second, we test its ability to detect FAD binding across a large proteome-scale set of proteins&#8211;a test of specificity. In both tests, the method shows very strong performance, including an ability to detect similarities missed by other methods.</p><p>Kinases play an important role in cell signaling, and can be dysregulated in cancer. Several recently introduced cancer drugs act as ATP analogues and inhibit kinase action <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-Benson1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1002326-Sheridan1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Therefore, the binding capabilities (or binding profiles) of kinases may be useful for discovering novel kinase inhibitors. In particular, kinase inhibitors that bind two or more kinases in the same pathway are attractive because they can more effectively interfere with the pathway, without the need for very high doses or multiple drugs <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-Morphy1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Kinase binding profiles may also be useful for understanding side effects of drugs that bind multiple proteins <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In principle, the ability of an inhibitor to bind multiple kinases may occur despite very low sequence and structure homology. For these reasons, the ability to detect similar binding sites in divergent kinases is potentially valuable.</p><p>There are sixteen cancer drugs approved or in advanced development that are known to have multiple targets <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. All of these drugs target members of the same protein family that regulate the same signaling process. Accordingly, most studies have focused on dissecting the detailed binding preferences of drugs on a relatively small set of kinases that are known to be important. In fact, multi-target drugs that work on proteins within distant families are only rarely reported <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-Apsel1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Therefore, one of the goals of this work is to discover unrecognized binding similarities between remotely related proteins to increase the repertoire of kinase inhibitor action and utility. Accordingly, we apply PocketFEATURE to predict the similarity in inhibitor-binding profiles between kinases. In particular, we seek similar inhibitor-binding profiles for kinases that are evolutionarily distant.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Detecting binding site similarity</title><p>We first validated PocketFEATURE's ability to detect binding site similarity.

We then applied it to the problem of predicting cross binding of ATP analogues inhibitors of kinases.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Summary of PocketFEATURE method</title><p>Our method works for two reasons. First, we employ a novel microenviroment-based representation and scoring system for comparing pockets that captures the physical and chemical properties in the binding pocket, and second, we do not impose rigid geometric matching criteria on the microenvironments within the pocket. The resulting method accurately recognizes similar microenvironments, and identifies combinations of microenvironments that can interact with fragments within ligand molecules.</p><sec id="s3a1"><title>Representation and similarity measure between individual microenvironments</title><p>Microenvironments are represented using the FEATURE representation that captures physiochemical properties of a local subsite. The raw Tc score measures similarity between two microenvironments. However, it is difficult to compare Tc scores across pairs of microenvironments because the background similarities between different pairs are not the same. Therefore, it is necessary to normalize the Tc scores. We normalize the scores by creating a background distribution for each pair type (See Method). The normalized score S(Tc) is negative, decreases monotonically with increasing Tc, and changing most rapidly for Tc&gt;Tc<sub>0</sub>. Therefore, our method seeks microenvironment-pairs that have high similarity, given the expected background score distribution.</p><p>We aligned microenvironments from an ATP, FAD and an NAD binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002326-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Microenvironment similarity score S(Tc) of aligned ones are outliers within the PDF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002326-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). The aligned microenvironments constitute functional modules for ligand recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002326-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). That is, particular microenviroments are associated with the recognition of particular molecular fragments with ligands. A better (more negative) S(Tc) similarity captures this shared recognition role in different binding sites.</p></sec><sec id="s3a2"><title>Geometric flexible matching between microenvironments</title><p>The combined interactions between multiple microenvironments in a target protein and molecular fragments within its ligand molecule drive molecular recognition. Because fragments can adopt different poses within a ligand molecule, the FEATURE based microenvironments in the target protein can adopt different relative geometries, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002326-g003">Figure 3C</xref>. Some methods use geometric constraints to control local arrangements of functional modules. PocketFEATURE has relatively weak geometric requirements (only that the matching microenvironments be present within the pocket of interest). As a result, the number of possible alignments between pockets is increased, and PocketFEATURE can recognize site that bind similar ligands in different poses.</p><p>Our results with FAD-binding sites illustrate the value of geometric flexibility; FAD contains highly flexible regions between flavin and adenine. The FAD conformation and orientation varies widely across different protein families. By using PocketFEATURE, microenvironments corresponding to the same fragments within FAD are recognized even though these microenvironments adopt different local geometries according to their ligand poses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002326-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). These results demonstrate the value of allowing microenvironments to adopt variable orientations within pockets.</p><p>We have also assessed whether the microenvironment alignments identified by PocketFEATURE correspond to specific recognition of ligand chemical substructures. The average number of microenvironments between two ATP sites is six; while that of ADP is six, that of NAD is ten and that of FAD is twelve. The common aligned microenvironments of high frequencies for these four types of binding sites are: mD, mE, mR, mK, mS and mT, all of which are in close proximity to the common sub-fragments contained within ADP, ATP, FAD and NAD: the adenine, ribose and phosphate. Thus, these microenvironments have specific roles in recognizing particular fragments within the overall molecule. Furthermore, the additional aligned microenvironments observed in FAD and NAD sites are mW and mP, which &#8220;recognize&#8221; the phosphate, flavin or nicotinamide moieties.</p><p>In summary, PocketFEATURE is more sensitive than other state-of-the-art methods. It is suitable for application on a genome scale.</p><p>PocketFEATURE defines sites based on position of known ligand binding. For apo structures and uncharacterized sites, we can also use published patch-searching algorithms, such as CONCAVITY <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-Capra1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and PocketPicker <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-Weisel1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> to define sites (on-going projects).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Application of PocketFEATURE to drug discovery</title><p>Current computational studies on comparing kinase inhibitor binding sites often focus on known drug targets Tyrosine kinase (TK family, EC 2.7.10) and Serine/Threonine kinases ISTE family (EC 2.7.11). Potential similarity between divergent kinases has not been systematically explored either computationally or experimentally. For example, of the 6058 pairs of divergent kinases we compared in this work, only 40 pairs have experimental data from CHEMBL and Ambit. The literature is biased towards a few well-validated kinases. Some inhibitors may appear to be more promiscuous simply because they have been profiled more systematically.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002326-g004">Figure 4</xref>, PocketFEATURE identifies similar ligand binding sites across distantly related kinases. The surprisingly accurate predictions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002326-t001">Table 1</xref>) for those that have been tested make the remaining untested predictions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002326-t003">Table 3</xref>) with high similarity scores particular interesting.</p><p>Some of our predictions rediscover combinations of divergent kinases for multi-targeted drug design. One highly ranked prediction is the pair SRC (a Tyrosine kinase) and PIK3CG (a lipid kinase in PI3K family), which are evolutionarily distant (PID&lt;10%). Both kinases have been observed to bind to a similar series of inhibitors (PP121 and its derivatives) <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-Apsel1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The PocketFEATURE binding site similarity score (&#8722;4.26) ranks high &#8212;20th out of 6058 pairs. PocketFEATURE identifies six key microenvironments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002326-g005">Figure 5</xref>). One alignment matches mT338/SRC to mY867/PIK3CG, both of which reside near the typical &#8220;gate&#8221; of an ATP-binding site. The gatekeeper residue enables interactions between the deep hydrophobic pocket and ligands (adenine in ATP or pyrazolopyrimidine in inhibitor ABJ). In SRC structures, residue T338 is designated as the gatekeeper and in PIK3CG structures, residue I879 <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-Apsel1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. As PocketFEATURE does not seek alignments between polar and hydrophobic residues, it does not find a match between mT338/SRC and mI879/PIK3CG. Instead, in the PIK3CG structure, the proximal mY867/PIK3CG is aligned to mT338/SRC. Thus, PocketFEATURE detects similar binding sites from these two distant kinases. SRC activates the lipid kinases of the PI3K family, a central regulator of cell growth. Molecules that target both SRC and PIK3CG may have potent antitumor activity.</p><fig id="pcbi-1002326-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002326.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>An example of validated positive predictions.</title><p>SRC (a Tyrosine kinase) and PIK3CG (a lipid kinase) bind to a same series of inhibitors (PP121 and its derivatives).

It is possible that drugs inhibiting both CSNK21A and PIK3CG may have synergistic anti-tumor activity. ACK2 is a homolog of CSNK21A (PID&gt;90%).

These proteins do not share known ligands using our stringent interpretation of CHEMBL results (see Method). However, this apparent false positive deserves further scrutiny. MAP2K1 encodes an essential kinase in mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signal transduction pathway. Activation of MAP kinase pathway plays important roles in the metastasis of pancreatic cancer. Specific inhibitors have been developed to inhibit oncogenic pathways. However, activation of PI3K pathway in response to MAP2K1 inhibition through a negative feed back loop limits the efficacy <xref rid="pcbi.1002326-Mirzoeva1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.
