</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Structural biology studies have provided large numbers of high-resolution proteins, often bound to small molecule ligands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The ability to predict additional ligands that will bind these proteins is an exciting opportunity for understanding drug action and repurposing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In some cases, the binding of a small molecule to a protein may explain otherwise unexpected effects of the small molecule, such as side effects of drugs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In other cases, the binding of a small molecule may suggest new uses of existing drugs, based on unexpected affinity to new targets. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Previous methods for predicting the potential binding of small molecules to protein pockets have used evolutionary, structural, biochemical and geometric properties in order to assess pocket similarity, or ligand-pocket complementarity [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>For example, the method of sequence order-independent profile-profile alignment (SOIPPA) [6] can recognize binding site similarity between the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and off-targets, including retinoid X receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>These new targets may explain adverse drug effects of CETP inhibitors [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>SOIPPA represents binding sites with a tessellation of C-alpha atoms and characterizes binding sites using geometric similarity potentials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>SOIPPA evaluates 3D alignments between binding sites that are enriched for similar angles and distances between residues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>It then gauges overall similarity based on geometric criteria, evolutionary and biochemical properties. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Like SOIPPA, other methods for locally comparing binding sites typically have three steps [5]: (1) representation of binding sites, (2) 3D alignment between two sites and (3) evaluation of a similarity metric to the two sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Searching for the best 3D alignment is the essential step. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>There are geometric hashing methods (SiteEngine [8] and SiteBase [1]) and methods based on clique detection (SOIPPA [6], CavBase [9] and eF-site [10]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>These methods use thresholds to control the similarity of local geometries in both types of methods, but these can be difficult to set. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In particular, flexible matching can be critical in achieving high performance [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Thornton et al showed that binding sites with similar ligands display greater conformational variability than the corresponding ligand molecules [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Thus, using predefined geometric models and thresholds is not optimal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Excessive reliance on crystallographic poses for both the protein and the ligand can miss potential similarities. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>We have previously described the FEATURE methods for describing active sites [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>In the FEATURE representation, a protein site is represented by one or more microenvironments—statistical descriptions of the occurrence of atoms, residues, secondary structures as well as biochemical and biophysical properties in radial shells around a central point [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>We have shown that the FEATURE representation is useful for describing sites for Ca++ binding [14], Mg++ binding [15], serine protease active sites [13], thioredoxin active sites [16] and others [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>We have also used it to evaluate the ability of engineered loops to bind ligands [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>In this work, we reasoned that the interactions between microenvironments in the target protein and chemical fragments in the ligand may drive molecular recognition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Because the conformational arrangement of fragments within flexible ligand molecules can be very different, we allow the corresponding microenvironments to adopt different relative geometries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>We develop an algorithm, PocketFEATURE, to match microenvironments within pockets in order to find pockets with potentially similar binding capabilities. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>We validate PocketFEATURE by testing its performance on two tasks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>First, we test its ability to detect the similarity of binding sites that are known to bind the same (containing adenine-ribose) ligands–a test of sensitivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Second, we test its ability to detect FAD binding across a large proteome-scale set of proteins–a test of specificity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>In both tests, the method shows very strong performance, including an ability to detect similarities missed by other methods. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Kinases play an important role in cell signaling, and can be dysregulated in cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Several recently introduced cancer drugs act as ATP analogues and inhibit kinase action [19],[20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the binding capabilities (or binding profiles) of kinases may be useful for discovering novel kinase inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>In particular, kinase inhibitors that bind two or more kinases in the same pathway are attractive because they can more effectively interfere with the pathway, without the need for very high doses or multiple drugs [21], [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Kinase binding profiles may also be useful for understanding side effects of drugs that bind multiple proteins [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>In principle, the ability of an inhibitor to bind multiple kinases may occur despite very low sequence and structure homology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>For these reasons, the ability to detect similar binding sites in divergent kinases is potentially valuable. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>There are sixteen cancer drugs approved or in advanced development that are known to have multiple targets [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>All of these drugs target members of the same protein family that regulate the same signaling process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, most studies have focused on dissecting the detailed binding preferences of drugs on a relatively small set of kinases that are known to be important. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>In fact, multi-target drugs that work on proteins within distant families are only rarely reported [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Therefore, one of the goals of this work is to discover unrecognized binding similarities between remotely related proteins to increase the repertoire of kinase inhibitor action and utility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we apply PocketFEATURE to predict the similarity in inhibitor-binding profiles between kinases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>In particular, we seek similar inhibitor-binding profiles for kinases that are evolutionarily distant. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Our method works for two reasons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>First, we employ a novel microenviroment-based representation and scoring system for comparing pockets that captures the physical and chemical properties in the binding pocket, and second, we do not impose rigid geometric matching criteria on the microenvironments within the pocket. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>The resulting method accurately recognizes similar microenvironments, and identifies combinations of microenvironments that can interact with fragments within ligand molecules. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Microenvironments are represented using the FEATURE representation that captures physiochemical properties of a local subsite. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>The raw Tc score measures similarity between two microenvironments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>However, it is difficult to compare Tc scores across pairs of microenvironments because the background similarities between different pairs are not the same. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is necessary to normalize the Tc scores. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>We normalize the scores by creating a background distribution for each pair type (See Method). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>The normalized score S(Tc) is negative, decreases monotonically with increasing Tc, and changing most rapidly for Tc&gt;Tc0. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our method seeks microenvironment-pairs that have high similarity, given the expected background score distribution. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>We aligned microenvironments from an ATP, FAD and an NAD binding site (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Microenvironment similarity score S(Tc) of aligned ones are outliers within the PDF (Figure 2C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>The aligned microenvironments constitute functional modules for ligand recognition (Figure 2A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>That is, particular microenviroments are associated with the recognition of particular molecular fragments with ligands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>A better (more negative) S(Tc) similarity captures this shared recognition role in different binding sites. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>The combined interactions between multiple microenvironments in a target protein and molecular fragments within its ligand molecule drive molecular recognition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>Because fragments can adopt different poses within a ligand molecule, the FEATURE based microenvironments in the target protein can adopt different relative geometries, as shown in Figure 3C. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Some methods use geometric constraints to control local arrangements of functional modules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>PocketFEATURE has relatively weak geometric requirements (only that the matching microenvironments be present within the pocket of interest). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>As a result, the number of possible alignments between pockets is increased, and PocketFEATURE can recognize site that bind similar ligands in different poses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Our results with FAD-binding sites illustrate the value of geometric flexibility; FAD contains highly flexible regions between flavin and adenine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>The FAD conformation and orientation varies widely across different protein families. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>By using PocketFEATURE, microenvironments corresponding to the same fragments within FAD are recognized even though these microenvironments adopt different local geometries according to their ligand poses (Figure 3C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate the value of allowing microenvironments to adopt variable orientations within pockets. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>We have also assessed whether the microenvironment alignments identified by PocketFEATURE correspond to specific recognition of ligand chemical substructures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>The average number of microenvironments between two ATP sites is six; while that of ADP is six, that of NAD is ten and that of FAD is twelve. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>The common aligned microenvironments of high frequencies for these four types of binding sites are: mD, mE, mR, mK, mS and mT, all of which are in close proximity to the common sub-fragments contained within ADP, ATP, FAD and NAD: the adenine, ribose and phosphate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Thus, these microenvironments have specific roles in recognizing particular fragments within the overall molecule. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the additional aligned microenvironments observed in FAD and NAD sites are mW and mP, which “recognize” the phosphate, flavin or nicotinamide moieties. </plain></SENT>
