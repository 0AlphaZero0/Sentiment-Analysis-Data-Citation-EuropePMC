</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>High level of adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is needed to achieve and maintain virological suppression, prevent drug resistance and improve survival in HIV-infected individuals [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The minimal level of adherence was initially established as 95% of drug intake and was based on data from non-boosted protease inhibitors (PI) based regimens [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>More recent studies have indicated that the optimal level of adherence may differ according to the antiretroviral class [2], [3], and should be greater than 95% for non-boosted PI or boosted PI and at least 80% for non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) based regimens [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Although nearly perfect adherence to ART is critical for successful HIV treatment, some patients remain suppressed despite poor adherence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The ability to achieve and sustain virological suppression despite suboptimal adherence could result from host genetic and/or pharmacological factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In fact, the administration of standard doses of most antiretroviral drugs results in a large inter-individual variability in plasma drug concentrations [5], [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The reasons for this variability are multifactorial and may involve, besides adherence, factors such as drug-drug interactions, co-morbidities, ethnicity or weight differences, and genetics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In the recent years, genetic polymorphisms in genes coding for drug metabolizing enzymes or transporters have been shown to influence the pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral agents [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>For instance, a correlation with efavirenz disposition was demonstrated for a 516G&gt;T polymorphism in CYP2B6 (CYP2B6*6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Individuals with the CYP2B6 516TT (homozygous loss of function) genotype had higher efavirenz levels compared to carriers of 516GT (heterozygous loss of function) or 516CC (homozygous reference) genotypes [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>More recently, the contribution of CYP2B6 genetic variants to efavirenz disposition was assessed in a pharmacogenetic- pharmacokinetic population analysis, and interestingly, explained half of the inter-individual variability observed with this drug [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>All together, these factors could explain that some individuals may have higher drug concentrations and may be able to maintain effective levels even after missing doses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Intrinsic drug characteristics such as half-life (long half-life) or drug potency are additional factors that may also contribute to a continuous drug pressure despite suboptimal adherence. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>We used the longitudinal nature of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) to select individuals with long periods of self-reported poor adherence to HIV therapy and to investigate the genetic and pharmacological characteristics in those remaining suppressed compared to those not suppressed. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Nearly perfect adherence to antiretroviral therapy is widely accepted as the primary determinant for achieving and maintaining viral response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>However, less is known about the determinants of virological suppression observed paradoxically in some individuals with long periods of self-reported poor adherence to ART. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that individuals carrying genetic variants associated with a slow metabolizing profile would maintain sufficient viral inhibitory drug levels even after missing doses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>In our study population, we failed to show a correlation between 516G&gt;T polymorphism in CYP2B6 and the likelihood of remaining suppressed in patients with self-reported suboptimal adherence to EFV based regimens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>The population pharmacokinetic estimates of EFV half-lives have been reported to be 23, 27 and 48 hours for individuals with the CYP2B6 516 GG, GT and TT genotypes, respectively [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Our study population was mainly characterized by carriers of the CYP2B6 516 GG (53%) and 516 GT genotypes (44%) whereas only one patient had the 516 TT genotype (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Thus, our results suggest that the modest increase in EFV half-life (17%) associated with the CYP2B6 516 GT genotype might not be strong enough to compensate for inconsistent adherence by maintaining effective levels until the subsequent dose. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>In the multivariable analyses, no correlation was found between independent or combined genetic variants and the likelihood of remaining suppressed in patients with suboptimal adherence to LPV/r based regimens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Although there was a trend to increased drug levels with the SLCO1B1*5 allele, this did not translate in protection from virological failure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>One should note that while the genetic determinants of EFV blood levels are well understood [9]), the contribution of genetics to the inter-individual variability of LPV/r pharmacokinetics is modest (less than 5%) [12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>In our population, the likelihood of remaining suppressed was rather related to the degree of adherence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>The estimated minimal level of adherence to maintain viral suppression was 86% for EFV and 93% for LPV/r (mainly administered twice daily in our population) as indicated by the increased risk of viral failure in patients missing more than 1 dose a week compared to those missing 1 dose a week (Tables 3 and 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>The lower adherence threshold required for EFV compared to LPV/r was supported by the difference in observed rate of viral suppression in that 76% of the patients receiving EFV versus 55% treated with LPV/r remained suppressed throughout the study period. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Our results are consistent with previous studies showing that viral suppression can be reached in some but not all patients at a level of adherence averaging 80% for NNRTI-based regimens [3], [4], [18], [19] and &gt;90% for PI-based regimens [2], [3], [4], [18], [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>The higher adherence threshold observed in our study might reflect the fact that we used self-reported adherence, which overestimates adherence by 10–20% compared to electronic monitoring [21], [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>In our study, the degree of adherence rather than consecutive missed doses was a stronger predictor for viral suppression in EFV and LPV/r models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>EFV forgiveness of non-adherence has been reported to be likely attributable to its extended half-life [3], [4], [19], whereas LPV/r has a high genetic barrier to resistance which may enhance its forgiveness [23], [24]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Besides the degree of adherence, we found that the likelihood of remaining suppressed was also dependent on the dosing schedule for LPV/r. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>In our population, LPV/r was administered twice daily (BID) in 64 patients and once daily (QD) in 5 patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the failure rate was higher in those on a QD regimen with 80% (4/5) of the patients on the LPV/r QD regimen compared to 42% (27/64) on the LPV/r BID regimen not maintaining viral suppression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>This observation is compatible with the findings of a recent study comparing the pharmacokinetics of LPV/r BID and QD following drug cessation [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Although no participants receiving LPV/r BID had drug levels below the minimal effective concentration (MEC) at 12 hours, 44% of participants receiving LPV/r QD were below the MEC at 24 hours. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>The higher occurrence of virological failure observed in some clinical trials with the LPV/r QD regimen seems to be related to the fast decay of LPV/r and the achievement of sub-therapeutic concentrations [25]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, our data showed that the probability of remaining suppressed increased with the duration of continuous suppression prior to the poor adherence period in both groups, which is in agreement with previous data [26], [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>It has been postulated that initial treatment during high viral burden likely required higher levels of adherence for full viral suppression than later in chronic treatment when viral burden was less [26], [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it has been reported that the latent reservoir and its ability to reactivate upon stimulation with cognate antigen decreases with duration of treatment [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Thus, individuals may be more vulnerable to suboptimal adherence shortly after achieving viral suppression but may be able to tolerate missed doses after long-term viral suppression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>It should be noted that the probability of remaining suppressed might also be related to inter-individual differences in immune response to HIV virus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Factors such as thymus output, co-infections, residual viral production, age, gender, genetics of immune system, nadir of CD4 cell are known to impact the immune response to HIV [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>This assumption is supported by the observation that in the univariable model of LPV/r patients, higher baseline CD4 cell count was associated with an increased likelihood of remaining suppressed. </plain></SENT>
