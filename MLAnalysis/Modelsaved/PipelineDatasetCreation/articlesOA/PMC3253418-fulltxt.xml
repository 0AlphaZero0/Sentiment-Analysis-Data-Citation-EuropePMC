HIV diagnostic testing was accomplished using two rapid tests on whole blood from either finger prick or venipuncture: determine HIV-1/2 (Abbott Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan) and Oraquick (Orasure Technologies, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, USA). Those found to be HIV infected were referred to appropriate referral clinics for HIV care. A urine specimen was collected for testing for gonorrhoea, chlamydia and <italic>Trichomonas vaginalis</italic> infections and a blood specimen for syphilis and herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV2) testing. STI testing was completed using the following methodologies: chlamydia and gonorrhoea were assessed using PCR (Roche Pharmaceuticals, Branchburg, New Jersey, USA), syphilis by rapid plasma reagin in combination with <italic>Treponema pallidum</italic> haemagglutination (Randox Laboratories, Crumlin, UK), HSV2 by ELISA (FOCUS Diagnostics, Cypress, California, USA) and <italic>T vaginalis</italic> by PCR (Roche Pharmaceuticals).</p><p>At the enrolment visit, participants provided written informed consent, underwent a pelvic examination, provided a blood sample for testing for syphilis (rapid plasma reagin and <italic>T pallidum</italic> haemagglutinin; Randox Laboratories) and HSV2 (ELISA; FOCUS Diagnostics) and provided a urine sample for pregnancy testing. After enrolment, at each quarterly follow-up visit, HIV and STI testing were conducted.</p><p>The MIRA study protocol was reviewed and approved by the University of California at San Francisco Institutional Review Board Committee on Human Research.

Finally, to test the fitness of the model, we performed the goodness of fit test examined using the Hosmer&#8211;Lemeshow criteria. A low &#967;<sup>2</sup> value and a high non-significant p value for the Hosmer&#8211;Lemeshow test indicated that the fit of the model and observed values was acceptable.</p><p>The incidence rate for HIV infection, expressed as time to seroconversion, was estimated for women who were HIV negative at screening and satisfied the eligibility criteria. The date of seroconversion was estimated using the midpoint between the last negative and the first positive antibody test results within the follow-up period.

Compared with the highest two quintiles, women in the lowest three quintiles were younger (p&lt;0.001). Significant associations were found between age at sexual debut and key sexual risk behaviours. There was a linear decreasing trend observed between the proportion of women who had less than high school education and age at first sex (P<sub>trend</sub>&lt;0.001). For example, compared with the oldest age at first sexual debut (&gt;20&#8197;years), those women in the earliest age at first sexual debut quintile (&lt;15&#8197;years) were less likely to have completed high school (62% vs 86%, P<sub>trend</sub>&lt;0.001).

A slightly higher proportion of women reported speaking Zulu at home in the earlier quintiles of the age at first sex compared with the higher quintiles (P<sub>trend</sub>=0.037). Women who initiated sexual activity at an early age were more likely to report not living with their husband or sexual partners compared with those who were older. With regard to the number of sexual partners during their lifetime, early initiators were significantly more likely to have had multiple partners over their lifetimes (having at least four lifetime sex partners, P<sub>trend</sub>&lt;0.001). However, other sexual risk behaviours such as proportion of women using any contraception and condoms as their main form of contraception were similar across the quintiles (P<sub>trend</sub>=0.784 and P<sub>trend</sub>=0.347, respectively).

In the South African context, in particular, recent evidence shows that higher levels of education are protective,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> in agreement with our findings.</p><p>This study is exploratory, raising questions about the dynamics of women's vulnerability and sexual risk. Lack of education may indeed be the key factor and pathway to risk among women with early sexual debut, although we could not determine the direction of the association. However, recent data from northern Malawi appear to indicate that early sexual debut may lead to school dropout since girls were viewed as &#8216;ready for marriage&#8217;.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref></p><p>Our results also showed that women who initiated sexual activity early were more likely to engage in risky sexual behaviours and a clear trend emerged, indicating that early onset sexual activity was associated with increased risk of HIV seroconversion during the study follow-up.</p><p>Overall, impact of risk factors considered in this study was associated with considerable potential reductions in HIV prevalence and incidence rates (85% and 77%, respectively). If these results are applied to the target population, majority of the HIV cases among women could potentially have been avoided by effective public health interventions, particularly measures aimed at reducing number of lifetime sexual partners by keeping couples together through changes in labour migrating patterns.</p><p>Interventions for young women should start in late primary (10&#8211;12&#8197;years old)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> or early high school (13&#8211;15&#8197;years old) to emphasise condom promotion, as well as delay in sexual activity. Reaching young women prior to sexual debut is important since it has been shown that better outcomes may be expected from programmes that establish protective behaviours, rather than attempting to change existing behaviour patterns.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> A &#8216;life skills orientation&#8217; programme addressing HIV prevention education (among other needs) was intended to be fully implemented in South African high schools by 2005, and thus, the women in this study may not have directly benefited from this intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref></p><p>Continued assessment of the impact of the life skills orientation programme on HIV protective behaviours and especially biological outcomes among young people will be necessary for an effective tailored response to the epidemic&#8212;early research indicated that the programme had positive effects on reported condom use among adolescents in two centres in KwaZulu-Natal but that other effects were at best modest.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> Also of concern in light of this is evidence from a large-scale prevention/education programme in Tanzania, which found no effect on HIV or STI prevalence, although changes in behaviour were reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref></p><sec><title>Potential limitations of the study</title><p>Several limitations need to be borne in mind when considering the interpretation of our results: these data were taken from the responses of women participating in a large, randomised controlled trial. Therefore, they may have limited representativeness. We also cannot rule out the effects of unmeasured characteristics such as poverty, cultural differences, multiple or concurrent sex partners and commercial sex on our findings. No data concerning migration, socioeconomic status at the time of sexual debut or sexual behaviour data from male partners were collected or included in these analyses. We could not determine whether young women were in school at the time of sexual debut.</p><p>Current study calculated the PAR where both the odds and HRs and population prevalences were estimated from the same study population. In order to interpret a PAR as the proportion of cases caused by a risk factor and thus that could be prevented by its elimination from the target population, causality needs to be proven. When PARs are estimated for more speculative risk factors, they can be regarded as measuring potential impact on disease incidence and the potential reduction in disease incidence could be attained from their elimination were later proven to be causal.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results indicate that a theory-based, contextually appropriate HIV/sexually transmitted disease risk-reduction programme may be important in shaping the sexual behaviour of young adolescents before or at the beginning of their sexual lives. Particularly, efforts to delay sexual debut should be incorporated into comprehensive sexual education programmes and should begin early, offering age-appropriate messages over time. Comprehensive sexual education programmes are typically targeted towards youth and are predominately school based. Opportunities to reach out-of-school youth, who may be at heightened vulnerability, should be identified as well. These programmes may include messages such as reinforcing safer sex practices for young people who are already sexually active.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supporting Statement</title></caption><media xlink:href="bmjopen-2011-000285-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d32e1390" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d32e126" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2011-000285.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the MIRA trial participants, Gates Foundation and PI Dr Nancy Padian.
