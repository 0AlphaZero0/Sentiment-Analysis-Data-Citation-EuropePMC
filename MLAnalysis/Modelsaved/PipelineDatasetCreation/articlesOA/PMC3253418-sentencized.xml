</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Forty per cent of all adult women living with HIV reside in southern Africa.1 In many Southern African countries, &gt;30% of young women are infected with HIV.2 3 Adolescent and young women may be especially prone to HIV infection in comparison with older women due to the occurrence of larger areas of cervical ectopy in young women and an increased likelihood of trauma to the immature genital tract during sex.4 5 Early age at sexual debut has been shown to correlate with subsequent risky sexual behaviours.6 7 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Early sexual debut (commonly defined as having had first sexual intercourse at or before age 14) and experience of sexual coercion or violence have been reported to contribute unintended adolescent pregnancy.8 9 In South Africa, data from a nationally representative household survey of young people showed that 7.8% of women aged 15–24 years had had sexual intercourse by age 14, and risk of HIV infection was significantly raised if a woman had been sexually active for &gt;12 months at the time of the survey.2 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Age at first sex is an important indicator of sexual risk, as it can be used as a proxy for the onset of exposure to HIV infection.10 Early sexual debut has been associated with increased sexual risk-taking behaviour, such as having multiple partners and decreased contraceptive and condom use, and with incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs).7 11 Another study has shown an association between having sex at an early age and incidence of HIV infection in Malawi.12 Delaying sexual debut may have been one of the key changes in behaviour, which lead to a decline in HIV infection in Uganda.13 14 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>There is also particular interest in the role of schooling in sexual risk behaviours.10 15 The association between level of schooling completed and sexual debut is complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Although a woman's level of education may be an indicator of socioeconomic status, poor socioeconomic conditions limiting school access or contributing to poor performance may also correlate with an increase in sexual activity at an early age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>In Tanzania, an analysis of the relationship between education level and HIV prevalence has indicated a steep decline over time in HIV infection among people who had a secondary education; of particular interest, the lowest HIV prevalence was found in young women (15–24 years) who had attended secondary school.16 Earlier meta-analysis of education and HIV prevalence data from across sub-Saharan Africa showed that the relationship between education and risk of HIV infection has changed over time, with more educated individuals initially at higher risk and with a later shift of risk towards the less educated, the inflection point being around 1996.17 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to better understand the risk factors that may increase South African women's risk of HIV infection, we investigated the independent risk factors and their population level impact on HIV infection among sexually active women in rural and semi-rural neighbourhoods of Durban. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>A sub-analysis was performed to investigate the association between the age at sexual debut and HIV seroconversion during the study by including only women who were HIV seronegative at the screening and enrolled in the study. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>In this study of sexually active young women who initiated sexual activity early were significantly associated with prevalent HIV infection in multivariate analysis along with the other factors namely—reporting less than high school education, more than one lifetime sexual partners, single/not cohabiting with a sexual partner, diagnosed as having HSV2 and other STIs at the screening. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>In addition, women 25–29 years old were more likely to be infected compared with those aged &lt;25 years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Several studies have reported associations between early onset of sexual activity and higher HIV prevalence among young people, who may not be biologically or psychologically ready for sex.20–24 In fact, increasing age at first sex appears to be one contributing factor to declines in HIV prevalence among youth in sub-Saharan countries with generalised epidemics14 25; each year of delay in sexual debut has been found to increase the chances that a condom would be used at debut by 1.44 times, which in turn increased the chances of subsequent consistent use substantially (among young men in Kenya).26 The relationship between lack of education, early sexual debut and HIV risk may be indicative of a social milieu in which young women are made vulnerable to HIV infection through interacting factors, with poverty or depressed socioeconomic status27 as one of a number of mediating forces. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>A number of authors have analysed the relationship between educational attainment and risk of HIV infection, and an emerging dynamic pattern indicates that the correlation differs according to the stage of the epidemic in the country in question16 17 28 29—the highest risk shifts from populations with higher to lower educational levels as the epidemic progresses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>In the South African context, in particular, recent evidence shows that higher levels of education are protective,30 in agreement with our findings. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>This study is exploratory, raising questions about the dynamics of women's vulnerability and sexual risk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Lack of education may indeed be the key factor and pathway to risk among women with early sexual debut, although we could not determine the direction of the association. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>However, recent data from northern Malawi appear to indicate that early sexual debut may lead to school dropout since girls were viewed as ‘ready for marriage’.6 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Our results also showed that women who initiated sexual activity early were more likely to engage in risky sexual behaviours and a clear trend emerged, indicating that early onset sexual activity was associated with increased risk of HIV seroconversion during the study follow-up. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Overall, impact of risk factors considered in this study was associated with considerable potential reductions in HIV prevalence and incidence rates (85% and 77%, respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>If these results are applied to the target population, majority of the HIV cases among women could potentially have been avoided by effective public health interventions, particularly measures aimed at reducing number of lifetime sexual partners by keeping couples together through changes in labour migrating patterns. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Interventions for young women should start in late primary (10–12 years old)31 or early high school (13–15 years old) to emphasise condom promotion, as well as delay in sexual activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Reaching young women prior to sexual debut is important since it has been shown that better outcomes may be expected from programmes that establish protective behaviours, rather than attempting to change existing behaviour patterns.32 A ‘life skills orientation’ programme addressing HIV prevention education (among other needs) was intended to be fully implemented in South African high schools by 2005, and thus, the women in this study may not have directly benefited from this intervention.33 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Continued assessment of the impact of the life skills orientation programme on HIV protective behaviours and especially biological outcomes among young people will be necessary for an effective tailored response to the epidemic—early research indicated that the programme had positive effects on reported condom use among adolescents in two centres in KwaZulu-Natal but that other effects were at best modest.34 Also of concern in light of this is evidence from a large-scale prevention/education programme in Tanzania, which found no effect on HIV or STI prevalence, although changes in behaviour were reported.35 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec><title><text><SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Potential limitations of the study </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Several limitations need to be borne in mind when considering the interpretation of our results: these data were taken from the responses of women participating in a large, randomised controlled trial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Therefore, they may have limited representativeness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>We also cannot rule out the effects of unmeasured characteristics such as poverty, cultural differences, multiple or concurrent sex partners and commercial sex on our findings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>No data concerning migration, socioeconomic status at the time of sexual debut or sexual behaviour data from male partners were collected or included in these analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>We could not determine whether young women were in school at the time of sexual debut. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Current study calculated the PAR where both the odds and HRs and population prevalences were estimated from the same study population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>In order to interpret a PAR as the proportion of cases caused by a risk factor and thus that could be prevented by its elimination from the target population, causality needs to be proven. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>When PARs are estimated for more speculative risk factors, they can be regarded as measuring potential impact on disease incidence and the potential reduction in disease incidence could be attained from their elimination were later proven to be causal. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that a theory-based, contextually appropriate HIV/sexually transmitted disease risk-reduction programme may be important in shaping the sexual behaviour of young adolescents before or at the beginning of their sexual lives. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Particularly, efforts to delay sexual debut should be incorporated into comprehensive sexual education programmes and should begin early, offering age-appropriate messages over time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Comprehensive sexual education programmes are typically targeted towards youth and are predominately school based. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Opportunities to reach out-of-school youth, who may be at heightened vulnerability, should be identified as well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>These programmes may include messages such as reinforcing safer sex practices for young people who are already sexually active. </plain></SENT>
