An often-overlooked aspect of these interactions is the circadian state of the host. Previously, we demonstrated that <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants lacking the circadian regulatory proteins Timeless (Tim) and Period (Per) are sensitive to infection by <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. Sensitivity to infection can be mediated either by changes in resistance (control of microbial load) or tolerance (endurance of the pathogenic effects of infection). Here we show that Tim regulates resistance against both <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>S. marcescens</italic>. We set out to characterize and identify the underlying mechanism of resistance that is circadian-regulated. Using <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, we found that resistance oscillates daily in adult wild-type flies and that these oscillations are absent in <italic>Tim</italic> mutants. <italic>Drosophila</italic> have at least three main resistance mechanisms to kill high levels of bacteria in their hemolymph: melanization, antimicrobial peptides, and phagocytosis. We found that melanization is not circadian-regulated. We further found that basal levels of AMP gene expression exhibit time-of-day oscillations but that these are Tim-independent; moreover, infection-induced AMP gene expression is not circadian-regulated. We then show that phagocytosis is circadian-regulated. Wild-type flies exhibit up-regulated phagocytic activity at night; <italic>Tim</italic> mutants have normal phagocytic activity during the day but lack this night-time peak. Tim appears to regulate an upstream event in phagocytosis, such as bacterial recognition or activation of phagocytic hemocytes. Interestingly, inhibition of phagocytosis in wild type flies results in survival kinetics similar to <italic>Tim</italic> mutants after infection with <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. Taken together, these results suggest that loss of circadian oscillation of a specific immune function (phagocytosis) can have significant effects on long-term survival of infection.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Circadian rhythms, or daily oscillations in physiological functions, are nearly ubiquitous among animals. Though immune parameters are known to vary with time of day, circadian regulation of the immune system is not well understood. Studies of circadian biology and innate immunity are well established in the genetically tractable model organism, the fruit fly. We use this model to investigate the mechanisms underlying circadian-regulated immunity. We and others have found that flies infected at different times of day exhibit different mean survival times. There are three main components of fly immune defense against bacterial pathogens: antimicrobial peptide synthesis, reactive oxygen species generation, and phagocytosis, or the ingestion of microbes by host immune cells. Of these three, we found that only the phagocytic activity of host immune cells is circadian-regulated and peaks at night, during the rest phase. This night-time peak of phagocytosis correlates with the time of day of maximal resistance to infection by the bacteria <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>. Mutants that lack circadian regulation also lack this night-time peak in phagocytosis. Inhibition of phagocytosis sensitized wild type flies to infection but did not further sensitize circadian mutants. These results suggest that this night-time peak in immune system function has significant effects on survival of infection.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Survival of bacterial infection is the result of complex host-pathogen interactions. An often-overlooked aspect of these interactions is the circadian state of the host. Most metazoans undergo daily, dynamic changes in their physiology that are regulated by well-characterized circadian machinery. At its core, the circadian clock is composed of four transcriptional regulators paired as two distinct heterodimers. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Period and Timeless form one heterodimer and Clock and Cycle form the other. These two heterodimers engage in an autoregulatory negative feedback loop that causes circadian oscillations in the expression levels of target genes <xref rid="ppat.1002445-Lowrey1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Microarray analyses of different vertebrate tissues, such as heart, liver, or spleen-derived macrophages, have shown that approximately 5&#8211;10% of total gene expression in each tissue is circadian-regulated <xref rid="ppat.1002445-Storch1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002445-Keller1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. These oscillations in transcription are thought to underlie circadian changes in the organism's physiology and behavior.</p><p>Reflecting the pervasiveness of circadian regulation, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> circadian mutants <italic>Timeless</italic> (<italic>Tim</italic>) and <italic>Period</italic> (<italic>Per</italic>) have pleiotropic phenotypes.

These circadian mutants are also sensitive to infection by at least two bacterial pathogens and resistant to infection by another <xref rid="ppat.1002445-ShirasuHiza1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002445-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The circadian-regulated mechanisms underlying these changes in immunity were not known.</p><p>Two types of mechanisms can affect survival after infection: resistance and tolerance <xref rid="ppat.1002445-Schneider1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Resistance mechanisms control microbial growth, while tolerance mechanisms allow the host to endure the pathogenic effects of infection, including the host's response to infection. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, known resistance mechanisms to control microbial growth in the hemolymph include antimicrobial peptide synthesis, reactive oxygen species generation, and phagocytosis by immune cells. Previously, microarray analysis comparing wild type and circadian mutants suggested that expression of immune signaling molecules that induce resistance mechanisms such as <italic>Imd</italic> (Immune deficient) may be circadian-regulated <xref rid="ppat.1002445-McDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002445-Ceriani1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Here we test the hypothesis that circadian mutants are sensitive to infection due to changes in mechanisms of resistance and investigate specific resistance mechanisms for circadian regulation.</p><p>It has been recently shown that in mice, many immune cell functions, such as cytokine secretion by macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells, undergo oscillatory time-of-day variation <xref rid="ppat.1002445-Keller1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002445-MendezFerrer1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Phagocytosis by immune cells such as macrophages and neutrophils has been reported to change with time of day, though it is not clear if this oscillation is diurnal (due to photoperiod) or circadian (regulated by circadian proteins) <xref rid="ppat.1002445-Kondo1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002445-Kurepa1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002445-Hriscu1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002445-Roy1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Phagocytosis of photoreceptors by pigment cells in the vertebrate retina has also been shown to be circadian-regulated <xref rid="ppat.1002445-NguyenLegros1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Thus we further hypothesized that phagocytosis of bacteria by immune cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is also circadian-regulated and that decreased phagocytic activity may significantly contribute to the sensitivity of circadian mutants to certain types of bacterial infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Circadian immune phenotypes are pathogen-specific</title><p>The fly immune response to infection is highly complex and pathogen-specific.

We hypothesized that <italic>Tim</italic> mutants might lack resistance because of a developmental defect (such as malformation of immune tissues) or because of a direct effect of circadian disruption on immunity in the adult fly. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we disrupted Tim protein in genetically wild-type adult flies using constant light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002445-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Blue light (&#8764;380 to 475 nm) causes complete and rapid ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Tim protein <xref rid="ppat.1002445-Naidoo1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>; normally, this allows the internal molecular clock to be synchronized with external light cues <xref rid="ppat.1002445-Hardin1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

Fluorescently-labeled <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> have often been used in phagocytosis assays to determine whether specific phagocytic components discriminate between different types of bacteria. Many cellular steps of phagocytosis subsequent to substrate recognition do not appear to be bacteria-specific.

As described above, <italic>Tim</italic> mutants are highly sensitive to <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> infection relative to wild type flies.

Bead pre-injection of wild type flies decreased survival rate to those similar to <italic>Tim</italic> mutants, suggesting that inhibition of phagocytosis is sufficient to recapitulate <italic>Tim</italic> mutant sensitivity. Consistent with this, we also found that bead pre-injection did not increase the sensitivity of <italic>Tim</italic> mutants to <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, suggesting that phagocytosis is already impaired in these flies.
