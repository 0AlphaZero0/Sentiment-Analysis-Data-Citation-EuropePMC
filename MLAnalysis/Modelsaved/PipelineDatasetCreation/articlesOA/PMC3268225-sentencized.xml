</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>eEF2K [eEF2 (eukaryotic elongation factor 2) kinase] catalyses the phosphorylation of eEF2, which inactivates eEF2 by impairing its ability to bind to the ribosome [1,2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>eEF2K was first identified as a Ca2+/CaM (calmodulin)-dependent enzyme [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Following the cloning of cDNAs encoding eEF2K, it became clear that eEF2K does not belong to the main eukaryotic superfamily of protein kinases, but instead to a small group of genes dubbed ‘α-kinases’ [4,5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The α-kinases display no clear sequence homology to other protein kinases [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>eEF2K is a well-characterized member of this group; its substrate eEF2 is known and there is substantial information on the intracellular regulation of eEF2K activity (reviewed in [7,8]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In contrast, less information is available about these aspects for other members of this group, although MHCKA (myosin heavy-chain kinase A), in particular, has been studied in considerable detail (see for example [9–11]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The first crystal structure for an α-kinase (for the kinase domain of the ion-channel TRPM7 (transient receptor potential melastatin-like 7, also termed ChaK1 (channel-kinase 1) [12]) revealed that, despite the lack of sequence homology, the three-dimensional structure of this α-kinase displayed marked similarity to members of the main eukaryotic protein kinase superfamily. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Structures have also now been determined for the catalytic domain of Dictyostelium MHCKA [13], and these show substantial similarity to that of the α-kinase domain of TRPM7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Both TRPM7 and the closely related channel TRPM6 have been studied in some detail (reviewed in [14]); however, the biological significance of their α-kinase domains remains to be elucidated since, for example, this domain of TRPM7 does not appear to be required for its channel function [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The activity of eEF2K is normally completely dependent upon Ca2+/CaM [3,16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>It can also be activated by phosphorylation by the AMP-activated protein kinase (at Ser398; [17]) or cAMP-dependent protein kinase (at Ser499; [18]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Conversely, its activity is impaired by signalling through mTORC1 (mammalian target of rapamycin, complex 1) [19], an effect which involves phosphorylation of eEF2K at one or more of three sites, Ser78 [20], Ser366 [21] and Ser359 [22]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The overall layout of the structure of eEF2K is depicted in Figure 1(A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Its α-kinase catalytic domain lies towards the N-terminus, with the CaM-binding site immediately N-terminal to this [23,24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The function of the region that is N-terminal of the CaM-binding site is not understood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Towards the C-terminus lie four predicted α-helical regions, which resemble SEL1-type repeats found in certain other proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Such features often provide a platform for protein–protein interactions [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Their role in eEF2K is unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>At the extreme C-terminus is a region that is required for eEF2K to phosphorylate its substrate, eEF2 [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Between the catalytic and SEL1-type domains lies a region that is predicted to be unstructured and which may act as a linker between the two other major domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the fact that this region is highly conserved (Figure 1A) suggests that it is important for the function and/or regulation of eEF2K. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>This prompted us to investigate the roles of the identified domains in eEF2K in its function and its control, in particular the possible interplay between the kinase domain and C-terminal regions of eEF2K. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The results of the present study show that the extreme N-terminal, linker and C-terminal ‘SEL1’ regions of eEF2K are not required for intrinsic activity or control by Ca2+/CaM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>However, the C-terminal SEL1 region is indispensable for phosphorylation of substrates in trans, i.e. both the physiological substrate eEF2 and an artificial peptide substrate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of eEF2 was much more strongly dependent upon the highly conserved C-terminal tip of the eEF2K polypeptide than phosphorylation of a peptide substrate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The present study shows that the catalytic and C-terminal domains, expressed separately, can interact with one another, leading to a model where the C-terminal part of eEF2K serves to recruit substrates to the catalytic domain for phosphorylation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="367" pm="."><plain>Glu717 is also universally conserved, but mutating it to alanine, to eliminate the negative charge, actually enhanced activity against eEF2 and, strikingly, also increased phosphorylation of the MH-1 peptide (Figures 8C and 8D). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="368" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data extend earlier findings by revealing that the conserved pair of tyrosine residues near the C-terminus of eEF2K is critical for phosphorylation of eEF2, and that they also play a role in the phosphorylation of the non-physiological MH-1 peptide substrate (albeit to a much lesser extent). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="369" pm="."><plain>As discussed above, the C-terminal part may recruit substrates for phosphorylation by the N-terminal domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="370" pm="."><plain>One might therefore expect that a truncated (e.g. Δ15) version of the C-terminal region would fail to restore activity to the 1–402 fragment; unfortunately, despite strenuous efforts, we were unable to express the 478–710 fragment or a version of 478–725 in which the two key tyrosine residues were mutated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="371" pm="."><plain>We therefore adopted an alternative approach where we first studied whether the intact C-terminal domain fragment of eEF2K could restore activity to eEF2K[Δ15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="372" pm="."><plain>As shown in Figure 8(F), it was indeed able to do so, yielding a level of activity only slightly below that seen for eEF2K itself or for the 1–402 plus 478–725 combination (Figure 8F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="373" pm="."><plain>This implies that the 478–725 region can recruit eEF2 for phosphorylation by the catalytic domain of the eEF2K[Δ15] protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="374" pm="."><plain>This effect was independent of the GST tag on the C-terminal fragment (Figure 6E). </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec></sec></SecTag><SecTag type="DISCUSS"><sec><title><text><SENT sid="375" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="376" pm="."><plain>Two previous studies provided initial insights into the functions of the domains of eEF2K [23,24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="377" pm="."><plain>Pavur et al. [23] conducted a comprehensive deletion analysis of eEF2K, removing sections of roughly 50 residues from the protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="378" pm="."><plain>Although this approach carries a higher risk of causing misfolding of the internally deleted polypeptide, the authors' conclusions largely concur with those of the present study, in that we find that the regions between residues 1–75 and 357–477 are not required for function, whereas the section 76–356 shows activity, at least in autophosphorylation, and the C-terminal region 478–725 is required for phosphorylation of eEF2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="379" pm="."><plain>Pavur et al. [23] found that, although some variants of eEF2K with deletions within the C-terminal region could still phosphorylate the MH-1 peptide, a number of others could not, and most did so at a greatly decreased rate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="380" pm="."><plain>These findings are broadly consistent with the results of the present study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="381" pm="."><plain>Diggle et al. [24] found that removal of the final 19 amino acids abolished the ability of eEF2K to phosphorylate eEF2, in line with the present findings, but also reported that removing the last 133 residues eliminated autophosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="382" pm="."><plain>This is at odds with the results of the present study, which show that even fragments as short as 76–356 undergo robust autophosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="383" pm="."><plain>The CaM target database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://calcium.uhnres.utoronto.ca/ctdb/ctdb/home.html">http://calcium.uhnres.utoronto.ca/ctdb/ctdb/home.html</ext-link>) indicates a CaM-binding site at residues 514–526 in eEF2K (sequence LEKKIGKSILGKVHL). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="384" pm="."><plain>However, the results of the present study show that the entire C-terminal region is dispensable for the control of eEF2K activity by Ca2+/CaM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="385" pm="."><plain>Our data also show that the eEF2K[478–725] fragment cannot bind CaM (C.R. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="386" pm="."><plain>Pigott, unpublished work) or CaM–Sepharose, whereas full-length eEF2K can. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="387" pm="."><plain>These data are consistent with previous work indicating that the CaM-binding site lies immediately N-terminal to the catalytic domain, and includes Trp85 (equivalent to Trp84 in rat eEF2K), which was shown to be essential for binding to CaM [24]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="388" pm="."><plain>The findings of the present study extend previous work in a number of other ways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="389" pm="."><plain>First, they imply that the N-terminal region (e.g. residues 1–75) exerts an inhibitory effect on eEF2K activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="390" pm="."><plain>Removal of this region enhances both the intrinsic autophosphorylation of the resulting fragment and the activity (in combination with the 478–725 region) against the MH-1 peptide. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="391" pm="."><plain>Secondly, the results of the present study show that several residues which appear to be universally conserved among α-kinases are critical for activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="392" pm="."><plain>These data are in good agreement with the effects of mutating the corresponding conserved residues in TRPM7 and with deductions made from the crystal structures of the catalytic domains of other α-kinases, i.e. ChaK1/TRPM7 and MHCKA [12,13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="393" pm="."><plain>This extends to residues that are implicated in binding a metal ion; mutating these residues in eEF2K essentially abolishes kinase function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="394" pm="."><plain>We tested whether incubation of eEF2K with metal ion-chelators such as N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine might be able to strip out the bound metal; however, this had no effect on kinase activity (C.R. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="395" pm="."><plain>Pigott, unpublished work). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="396" pm="."><plain>It is possible that, within the folded structure of eEF2K, the ion is inaccessible to chelating agents. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="397" pm="."><plain>Thirdly, our data identify specific residues in the extreme C-terminus which are required for phosphorylation of eEF2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="398" pm="."><plain>Our data agree with those of Diggle et al. [24] who showed that removing the last 19, but not the final eight, residues from the C-terminus of rat eEF2K abolished its ability to phosphorylate eEF2 in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="399" pm="."><plain>This implies that the intervening residues, several of which are absolutely conserved among eEF2K sequences from species as diverse as nematodes and mammals, play a key role in substrate phosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="400" pm="."><plain>Focusing on those residues, we show that the adjacent tyrosines (Tyr712/Tyr713 in human eEF2K) are critical for the ability to phosphorylate eEF2, although the eEF2K[Y712A/Y713A] mutant could still quite efficiently phosphorylate the MH-1 peptide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="401" pm="."><plain>Ala716 is also crucial for this, since mutating it to a proline residue abolishes activity against eEF2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="402" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, although Glu717 is also completely conserved, converting it into alanine actually enhanced activity, both against eEF2 and the MH-1 peptide. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="403" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the requirements for activity against eEF2 and the MH-1 peptide clearly differ quite markedly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="404" pm="."><plain>Although the eEF2K[478–725] region is essential for activity against both, the removal of the C-terminal region had little effect on the ability to phosphorylate the MH-1 peptide, while abolishing phosphorylation of eEF2 even at the highest substrate concentrations tested. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="405" pm="."><plain>Thus the region containing the SEL1 domains and the extreme C-terminus is essential for the phosphorylation of either substrate in trans, whereas the C-terminal tail is only required for phosphorylation of the physiological substrate eEF2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="406" pm="."><plain>Mutating universally conserved residues within this region strongly decreased activity against eEF2 (e.g. the YY712/713AA and A716P mutants), but only modestly affected activity against the MH-1 peptide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="407" pm="."><plain>This suggests that these residues might interact with eEF2 itself. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="408" pm="."><plain>However, despite strenuous efforts using several approaches, we were unable to demonstrate a stable interaction using wild-type eEF2K, so were unable to test the effect of these mutations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="409" pm="."><plain>Fourthly, it is striking that the N-terminal region containing the kinase domain and the C-terminal section of eEF2K can efficiently cooperate in trans to phosphorylate both eEF2 and the MH-1 peptide, i.e. they do not need to be part of the same polypeptide to do so. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="410" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the finding that these two regions associate with one another (when expressed separately). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="411" pm="."><plain>This prompts the model shown in Figure 9 where the C-terminal region, including the SEL1 domains and the tip, recruit eEF2 to the catalytic domain for phosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="412" pm="."><plain>Several of the regulatory phosphorylation sites in eEF2K (e.g. Ser359 [27], Ser366 [21], Ser377 [22] or Ser398 [17]) are located in the intervening ‘linker’ region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="413" pm="."><plain>It is tempting to speculate that phosphorylation of these sites may influence the association of the N- and C-terminal domains and thus modulate substrate recruitment and activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="414" pm="."><plain>Further work is required to study this. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="415" pm="."><plain>It is interesting to note that in TRPM7, another α-kinase, a region outside the catalytic domain (immediately N-terminal to it) is again required for catalytic activity [10], although several aspects of the structural organization and control of this enzyme differ substantially from those of eEF2K. </plain></SENT>
