</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Chloroviruses in the family Phycodnaviridae have a long evolutionary history possibly dating back to the time when eukaryotes arose from prokaryotes [1]–[3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>They are predicted to have a common ancestor with the poxviruses (e.g., vaccinia virus), asfarvirues, iridoviruses, ascoviruses and mimiviruses [1], [4], [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these viruses are referred to as nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>PBCV-1 virions, the prototype chlorovirus, are large icosahedral particles (190 nm in external diameter) that have an internal lipid bilayered membrane [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>However, the particles have more surface features than was originally thought. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>One of the PBCV-1 vertices has a 560 Å long spike structure; 340 Å protrudes from the surface of the virus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The part of the spike structure that is outside the capsid has an external diameter of 35 Å at the tip expanding to 70 Å at the base [7], [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The spike structure widens to 160 Å inside the capsid and forms a closed cavity inside a large pocket between the capsid and the internal membrane enclosing the virus DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the internal virus membrane departs from icosahedral symmetry adjacent to the unique vertex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the virus DNA located inside the envelope is packaged non-uniformly in the virion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In addition to the spike, external fibers extend from some virus capsomers. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>PBCV-1 infection resembles infection by tailed bacteriophages because its genome must cross the cell wall (and membrane) of its host C. variabilis to initiate infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The PBCV-1 spike first contacts the host cell wall [8] and the fibers aid in holding the virus to the wall. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The spike is too thin to deliver DNA and so it probably serves to puncture the wall and is then jettisoned. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Following expansion of the hole in the host wall by a virus-packaged enzyme(s), the viral internal membrane presumably fuses with the host membrane, facilitating entry of the PBCV-1 DNA and virion-associated proteins into the cell, leaving an empty capsid attached to the surface [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>This fusion process triggers rapid depolarization of the host membrane [10], possibly by a virus encoded K+ channel (named Kcv) predicted to be located in the internal membrane of the virus, followed by rapid release of K+ from the cell [11] and altered secondary active transport of solutes [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The rapid loss of K+ and associated water fluxes from the host reduce its turgor pressure, which may aid ejection of viral DNA and virion-associated proteins into the host [13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>A property that all NCLDVs including the chloroviruses share with dsDNA bacteriophages and other DNA viruses is that they package a dsDNA genome into a geometrically confined capsid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>An example of DNA packaging is the 48.5 kb genome of bacteriophage λ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Its extended linear form of 16.5 µm [14] is compressed into a capsid with an inside radius of 27.5 nm [15], creating a DNA density inside the particle of 0.6 bp nm−3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>This value approaches the maximal theoretical density for DNA packaging and the DNA is almost at crystalline density inside the phage head [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>A lower DNA packaging density occurs in the two NCLDVs, vaccinia virus and mimivirus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Both viruses package their large DNA genomes with a density of ∼0.05 bp nm−3 [17], [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Our estimates of DNA packaging density place the chlorovirus PBCV-1 between phage λ and vaccinia virus and mimivirus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The ∼330 kb genome of virus PBCV-1 is compressed into a capsid with an inner radius of about 72 nm providing a DNA density of ∼0.2 bp nm−3. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>DNA packaging density has implications for virus infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that the high DNA packaging density in phages generates enormous internal pressure in the particles ranging up to 50 bars [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>This pressure serves as a driving force for the rapid ejection of DNA from the virus particle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>For example, phage λ expels its DNA with an initial velocity of 60 kbp/sec, which then decreases as the residual amount of DNA in the particle decreases [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>As a result, the entire DNA can be propelled from the capsid in ∼1.5 sec under optimal conditions [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>In another example, phage T5 DNA is expelled in a stepwise fashion at a rate reaching 75 kpb/sec [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>This pressure driven DNA ejection provides at least part of the energy required for transfer of the DNAs into their hosts [22]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>PBCV-1 is unique among the NCLDVs in that it uncoats its DNA at the cell surface and leaves an empty capsid on the outside of the cell wall, similar to many tailed bacteriophages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Consequently, PBCV-1 may use similar mechanical forces to eject its genome into its host cell as phages [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>In contrast, most NCLDVs are not faced with a cell wall and they initiate infection by either an endocytotic or an envelope fusion mechanism with the host plasma membrane; they then uncoat inside the cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Consequently, most NCLDVs do not require a high DNA density to initiate infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>In fact, when DNA is released from the vaccinia capsid it does not burst out but rather pours out like a thick fluid [17], suggesting that forced ejection of vaccinia DNA is not important for its infection. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Phage DNA packaging depends primarily on two parameters, the function of motor proteins and cations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Dense packaging of DNA requires that 90% of its charge is neutralized [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Evidence for charge neutralization of densely stored DNA in phages existed more than 50 years ago. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>While phages typically use cations to neutralize their DNA some phages use polyamines, such as putrescine and spermidine in addition to cations [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>There is no evidence indicating basic proteins contribute much to neutralizing phage dsDNA genomes [25], [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Indeed the dense DNA-packaging in many phages leaves little room for DNA binding proteins [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>As mentioned above, DNA packaging in NCLDVs faces similar challenges to those in bacteriophages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Indeed many dsDNA viruses use proteins for DNA packaging. Polyomaviridae [28] and Papillomaviridae [29] for example can functionally co-opt host histone proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Other dsDNA viruses (Adenoviridae, Asfarviridae, Baculoviridae) express small arginine rich protamine-like proteins with putative DNA condensation functions [30], [31]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Currently little information is available on the mode of DNA packaging in the large chloroviruses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>At least in the case of PBCV-1, and presumably the other chloroviruses, DNA neutralization may also employ proteins because PBCV-1 virions contain 148 different viral-encoded proteins (Dunigan et al., manuscript in preparation), some of which have been described as DNA-binding proteins [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>This large number suggests that DNA binding proteins play a role in the organization and packaging of chlorovirus DNA genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Here we report a procedure for releasing PBCV-1 DNA from the virus particle and analyze its structural properties. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Phage DNA release is often triggered by an interaction between phage tails and host receptor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>This interaction causes the DNA to rapidly expand and the DNA catapults out of the capsid [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>The host receptor for virus PBCV-1 is unknown, although circumstantial evidence suggests it is carbohydrate [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Still DNA release from PBCV-1 can be achieved by infecting C. variabilis cells with a high m.o.i. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>(e.g., 100). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Under these conditions it occurs as if the DNA is released from the virus particle but not able to enter the host; as a consequence the particle is dynamically catapulted away from the host cell leaving an unraveled, quasi-linear DNA polymer tethered to the cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>In some images it is possible to see the capsid at the end of the DNA thread projected away from the host (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>The reason for the release of DNA into the medium is not known. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>However we know from other studies that usually only one virus infects the host cell, while the remaining viruses are excluded [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>The fact that DNA release into the medium is only apparent at very high m.o.i. suggests that most viruses under these circumstances are not able to eject their DNA into the host because of an yet unknown exclusion mechanism. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>This release of DNA into the medium must be fast because it is possible to detect isolated DNA molecules already within 5 min post infection. Figure 1A shows a fluorescent image with a host cell and the unfolded DNA polymer from a virus particle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>The DNA dye DAPI produces bright staining of the nucleus of the chlorella cell in the lower right part of the figure; in the upper left part of the figure the unraveled DNA from a virus capsid protrudes as a nearly linear structure from the cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>In the case of phages it has been argued that the release of the genome can be explained on the basis of Brownian motion [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Such a process however cannot account for the observed DNA ejection from virus PBCV1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Brownian movement would not generate the sort of straight lines and would also be much slower [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Hence the present data stress the importance of an osmotic pressure in the dense environment of the capsid, which creates a driving force for DNA ejection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>In this sense PBCV-1 DNA ejection into the medium resembles that of many phage genomes [14], [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>The forceful ejection of DNA from the PBCV-1 particle is consistent with the concept that PBCV-1 depends, at least to some extent, on these mechanical forces to eject its DNA against the turgor pressure of the chlorella host cell [13]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon was not only observed once but in ∼20% of the ejected DNA molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Since the surface of a Chlorella cell is ca. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>500 times larger than that of a virus it is statistically rather unlikely that two virus particles independently infect at an m.o.i of 100 a host cell so frequently in the same spot. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>Hence it is more likely that the two DNA polymers were not from separate viruses but from a single virus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>This interpretation is supported by the electron microscopic images depicted in Figs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>1E, F. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>These images show a C. variabilis cell with the typical hole in the wall, which a virus digests in the course of infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>From this location two linear structures project away from the host in an angular fashion. The projecting structures are most likely unfolded viral DNA because the half width of their cross section is &lt;10 nm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>The combination of electron microscopic and fluorescent images suggests that PBCV-1 DNA might not in all cases enter its host initially by either of its termini. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>This scenario would suggest that packaging of the DNA in the virion differs from ejection because it is unlikely that DNA packaging begins in the middle of the genome. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Close scrutiny of the fluorescently labeled ejected PBCV-1 DNA suggests it is structured. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>The images indicate: i) a non-uniform distribution of DNA and ii) loops in the DNA polymer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Images of ejected DNA at higher magnifications indicate that the fluorescence associated with the DNA exhibits distinct maxima. Fig. 1B shows part of an enlarged fluorescent DNA band from Fig. 1A. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>The fluorescence signal alternates between high and low fluorescence intensity along an imaginary line (Fig. 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>The locations of the intensity maxima coincide with structures, which occasionally can be seen with phase contrast in a light microscope (inset Fig. 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>This observation implies that the non-uniform fluorescence of DAPI staining is not caused by a preference of the dye to interact with A-T rich regions in the DNA but instead the intensity maxima are due to local concentrations of DNA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>In regions where the fluorescence signal was well resolved the intensity maxima were quasi periodic (Fig. 1G). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>In this example, the maxima were ca. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>1.2 µm apart. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>The distances between fluorescence peaks measured in 30 individual ejected DNA molecules are summarized in Fig. 1H. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>The histogram shows a broad distribution of gap sizes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>The distribution has a maximum below 1 µm and possibly a second one below 3 µm (Fig. 1H). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>The structured pattern seen with PBCV-1 DNA does not occur in fully ejected DNA from phages λ or T5; the phage DNAs fluoresce homogeneously along the axis of the extended polymer [14], [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these results suggest that the distribution of fluorescent maxima is an inherent property of PBCV-1 DNA structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Hence PBCV-1 DNA molecules in the capsid are apparently organized differently than those in the two phages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>The PBCV-1 DNA is most likely concentrated in a periodic fashion in submicroscopic coils. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>DNA is presumably wound around the respective basic proteins for neutralization and packaging. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>The interaction results in the isolated DNA containing periodic thickenings; a higher order of organization may also involve small loops, which contribute to packaging DNA and/or gene regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>The robust aggregation of the DNA with proteins also favors a stable structure for the virus DNA when it is ejected into the cytosol of the host, where the cation concentration is reduced [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>The current results do not distinguish if this organization of DNA is contributing to the neutralization of the entire DNA polymer or if it is just a component of its meta-organization with the goal to achieve a crystalline-like or ordered structure inside the virion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>The data however indicate that the chlorella viruses and possibly other large DNA viruses have developed a DNA packaging strategy, which involves proteins and hence shares similarities to that of chromatin in eukaryotes. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>First, we scanned the genome for 6 and 8 bp motifs including two wildcard characters at most, which match any nucleotide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>We computed the Hamming distance of all possible fragments (330,742 fragments) to all possible, potential motifs (15,361 and 311,297 motifs, respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>This produces a string of integers – representing the hamming distance - ranging from zero to N, where N is the motif length. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Any periodic or semi-periodic structures in this data are revealed by Fourier analysis as peaks in the Fourier components. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>We restricted our analysis to small motifs because of computational constraints. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we could not detect signals for larger motifs directly, e.g., two binding motifs connected by a highly variable region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>This prompted us to not look for one particular motif with the most pronounced peak in the Fourier spectrum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Instead, we counted how often a particular length scale appeared, averaged over all motifs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>This protocol has an additional advantage because it also reveals periodicities of much larger motifs; e.g., consider the simple case of two motifs separated by some variable genomic region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Separately these two motifs would exhibit the same periodicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>If we analyze the data averaged over all motifs, however, we also uncover the “synchronization” of the motifs along the chain and therefore the correlated periodicity. </plain></SENT>
