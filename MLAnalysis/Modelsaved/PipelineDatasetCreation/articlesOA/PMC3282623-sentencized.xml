</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A hydrostatic pressure of several hundred megapascals has been reported to induce structural changes in proteins such as conformational changes, dissociation of oligomeric proteins and denaturation (Boonyaratanakornkit et al., 2002 ▶; Akasaka, 2006 ▶). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the basis of experimental studies and simulations (Frye &amp; Royer, 1998 ▶; Paliwal et al., 2004 ▶), these effects are currently considered to be mainly caused by the penetration of water molecules into the protein interior under high pressure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The solution structure of ubiquitin determined at 300 MPa by high-pressure NMR spectroscopy (Kitahara et al., 2005 ▶) was marked by a conformational change from a closed to an open form of ubiquitin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Based on this high-pressure structure of ubiquitin, computational studies were performed using the three-dimensional reference interaction-site model (RISM) theory. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The results of this investigation illustrated the penetration of water molecules into the hydrophobic interior of ubiquitin at high pressure, confirming an alteration of the hydration of proteins under high pressure (Imai et al., 2007 ▶). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Notably, these simulations demonstrated how water penetration reduces the partial molar volume (PMV) of ubiquitin. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In the past decades, high-pressure protein crystallography (HPPX) has been established and applied to structural studies of several macromolecules (Kundrot &amp; Richards, 1986 ▶, 1987 ▶; Katrusiak &amp; Dauter, 1996 ▶; Fourme et al., 2001 ▶, 2009 ▶; Urayama et al., 2002 ▶; Collins et al., 2005 ▶, 2011 ▶; Girard et al., 2007 ▶, 2010 ▶; Ascone et al., 2010 ▶; Kurpiewska &amp; Kewiński, 2010 ▶). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It is believed that the HPPX method can be a powerful tool to elucidate the mechanism of the effects of high pressure on proteins owing to the fact that it allows direct observation of structured water molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>An example is illustrated by the structure determination of T4 lysozyme carrying the L99A mutation-specific large hydrophobic cavity, for which water penetration was observed at 200 MPa (Collins et al., 2005 ▶). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In this structure, the volume of the cavity at 200 MPa was reduced by less than 3% compared with that in the structure at atmospheric pressure, while additional conformation changes of the protein itself were scarcely induced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Another example of HPPX measurements is represented by structure determination of the urate oxidase (UOX) tetramer at 150 MPa (Girard et al., 2010 ▶). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In contrast to L99A T4 lysozyme, water penetration into the hydrophobic cavity of UOX was not observed in the crystal structure at high pressure, although structure changes occurred in a polar pocket neighbouring the hydrophobic cavity, which expanded to 111% of its original volume even though the pressure was increased. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In addition to studies of the effects of pressure on proteins from land organisms, which live in an ambient environment, detailed analyses have also been performed on proteins from deep-sea organisms that have evolved at higher pressures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, most enzymes originating from deep-sea organisms remain active at high pressure, while related enzymes from land organisms lose their activity (Kato et al., 2008 ▶). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>For example, 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (IPMDH) from the obligate piezophile Shewanella benthica DB21MT-2, originally isolated from the Mariana Trench (Kato et al., 1998 ▶; Nogi &amp; Kato, 1999 ▶), was shown to be more tolerant to high-pressure stress than the same enzyme originating from the nonpiezophile S. oneidensis MR-1 (Kasahara et al., 2009 ▶). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>IPMDH catalyzes the reduction of 3-isopropylmalate (IPM) to 2-­isopropyl-3-oxosuccinate in the presence of divalent metal cations such as magnesium or manganese ion and nicotin­amide adenine dinucleotide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In order to elucidate the pressure tolerance of proteins from deep-sea organisms, we have initiated a series of structural studies on several IPMDHs using the HPPX method. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In the present report, we attempt to underpin mechanisms explaining the regulation of pressure-induced effects on the IPMDH from the nonpiezophile S. oneidensis MR-1 (SoIPMDH). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>The crystals were mounted in the DAC and slowly com­pressed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The solution used as a pressure medium consisted of 18%(w/v) PEG 3350 in 100 mM Na HEPES pH 7.0, 200 mM calcium acetate, 10 mM magnesium chloride, 10 mM IPM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>The actual pressure in the sample chamber was determined using the wavelength shift of the fluorescence emanating from a ruby ball loaded into the chamber together with the protein crystals (Zha et al., 2000 ▶). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Pressure measurements were performed before and after X-ray measurements. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>While performing HPPX measurements, several difficulties were noticed (Kurpiewska &amp; Kewiński, 2010 ▶). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>(i) The pressure medium being liquid, crystals in the DAC were mobile and were moving during measurements of the X-ray diffraction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>(ii) Recording highly complete data is difficult for crystals belonging to lower symmetry space groups such as C2 owing to the restricted aperture of the DAC, the angle of which is often less than 90°. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>(iii) Radiation damage during data collection is not negligible because the HPPX measurements are performed at room temperature. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>HPPX experiments were performed on beamline AR-NW12A of the Photon Factory. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Crystal movement in the DAC is significant at AR-NW12A because of the horizontal spindle axis of the goniometer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>To prevent such motion, Katrusiak and Dauter used cotton wool fibres to fill in the chamber (Katrusiak &amp; Dauter, 1996 ▶). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>As a substitute for cotton wool fibres, the crystals were placed into the sample chamber with a few cigarette-filter fibres, which had the advantage of being somewhat flexible and springy and could be tied into a loose knot (Fig. 1 ▶). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>In order to record more complete data using crystals of lower symmetry, Fourme and coworkers developed a special splinter made of low-absorbing boron nitride in order to mechanically force the crystals to take different orientations within the DAC (Girard et al., 2007 ▶). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Since the space group of the SoIPMDH–IPM crystals is C2, we placed three crystals into the pressure cell at one time in order to collect high-completeness data sets at a given pressure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The different crystals were tiled with different orientations from each other, with the knotted fibres acting as splinters. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>To make HPPX measurements possible at AR-NW12A, the beamline diffractometer, including the goniometer head and the direct-beam stopper, were modified to accept the DAC. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Under high-pressure stress, proteins adopt a state of lower partial molar volume (PMV) according to Le Chatelier’s principle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>The PMV of a macromolecule is expressed as the summation of the van der Waals volume, the void volume and the volume change caused by hydration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>At 160 MPa, the system reduces the PMV of the SoIPMDH dimer by compressing the interior cavities (including the cavity at the dimer interface). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>At pressures over 410 MPa, the system reduces the PMV of the dimer by filling the cavity at the dimer interface with water molecules from the bulk region, in addition to compressing the other cavities within the interior of the protein, which results in an overall reduction of the PMV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>The occupancy of the penetrating water molecules increases with pressure, which implies a rise in the rate of penetration of the water molecules into the cavity, partly explaining the swelling of the cavity volume with pressure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>The water filling of the cavity probably plays a role by cancelling the void volume of the cavity, despite apparently increasing the total volume of the cavity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>As shown in Fig. 7 ▶, the volume of the cavity starts to increase above 340 MPa, which might indicate the beginning of the entrance of the water molecules into the cavity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>At 650 MPa, both water molecules in the cavity at the dimer interface show nearly full occupancies, which might initiate the destabilization of the dimer itself because of the repulsion generated between the too closely positioned water molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>In previously published HPPX and MD simulation work on L99A-mutated T4 lysozyme, water penetration into the large hydrophobic cavity (∼160 Å3) created by the mutation was observed at high pressure (Collins et al., 2005 ▶). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>These results illustrated that at least two, and possibly as many as four, water molecules simultaneously penetrated into the large cavity at high pressure, while the volume of the cavity decreased by 3%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>In the case of T4 lysozyme, there is no need to increase the volume of the cavity prior to accommodating water molecules because its volume is already large enough. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>In the case of SoIPMDH, the volume of the cavity at the dimer interface is only 56 Å3 at 0.1 MPa and reduces slightly to 50 Å3 at 160 MPa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, there is a need to increase the volume of the cavity at higher pressures (over 340 MPa) in order to accommodate additional water molecules. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>In the 580 and 650 MPa structures, an additional cleft is generated at the bottom of the groove on the opposite side to the active site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Two water molecules W697 and W698 appeared inside the cleft, together with another water molecule W699 near the groove. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>These three waters were not observed in the structures at lower pressures ranging from 0.1 to 410 MPa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>The generation of the cleft together with water penetration can be considered as an initial step in the pressure-denaturation process of SoIPMDH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>In the 580 MPa structure, Ser266 Oγ forms a hydrogen bond to W697, allowing anchoring of W697 into the cleft. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the three new water molecules form a hydrogen-bond network among each other as well as with the atoms of the protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>In the structures at pressures ranging from 0.1 to 410 MPa, the solvent-excluded surface at the bottom of the groove is nonpolar since it is mostly composed of the Pro108 and Leu305 side chains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, the penetrating water molecules, especially W697 and W698, force this nonpolar surface to open. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>In the previously published work of Imai and coworkers, the change in PMV associated with the pressure-induced conformation change of ubiquitin was analyzed using a three-dimensional RISM theory of molecular solvation (Imai et al., 2007 ▶). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Their study showed that the conformational change from a closed to an open form of ubiquitin at high pressure is the main cause of the reduction in PMV, which can be ascribed to water penetration into the hydrophobic core of the protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>The authors subsequently performed a 1 µs high-pressure MD simulation of ubiquitin and observed the conformational change accompanied by water penetration (Imai &amp; Sugita, 2010 ▶). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>The present structural aspect of the SoIPMDH cleft with water penetration strongly resembles that of the computational study of ubiquitin denaturation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>In the case of ubiquitin, a water molecule penetrates deeply into the cleft when the protein is in its open state and is buried among internal hydrophobic side chains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in the case of SoIPMDH water molecules also penetrate the cleft and are buried among the internal hydrophobic side chains of Leu106, Pro108, Ala268 and Leu305. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>The SoIPMDH surface at the cleft is not completely hydrophobic, but rather shows some hydrophilic properties, notably owing to the Leu106 carbonyl O atom, the Ser266 amide N and Oγ atoms and His309 N∊2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>The hydrogen-bond network resulting from these polar groups contributes to the proper localization of the water molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Thus, the generation of the cleft accompanied by water penetration observed in our study may be a representation of the conformational change driven by the reduction of the PMV induced by the pressure increase. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>More precisely, the hydrogen bond between W697 and Ser266 Oγ seems to play an important role in this structural change. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>SoIPMDH from the nonpiezophile S. oneidensis MR-1 contains a serine at position 266, while IPMDH from the obligate piezophile S. benthica DB21MT-2 (SbIPMDH) contains an alanine at the same position. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>A possible explan­ation of the different piezo-sensitivity of SbIPMDH could be that a water molecule cannot be stabilized at the same position as W697 because of the lack of the side chain in Ala266, which would cause the formation of a limited hydrogen-bond network. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>We therefore propose that the mutation of Ser266 in SoIPMDH to alanine may be characterized by a different behaviour of the protein at 580 MPa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the amino-acid residues surrounding the internal hydrophobic cavity (Fig. 6 ▶) are conserved in SoIPMDH and SbIPMDH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Thus, the water penetration into this cavity does not seem to be related to the difference in the pressure tolerances of SoIPMDH and SbIPMDH. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>As shown in Table 1 ▶, the number of water molecules found at the SoIPMDH surface increases up to 410 MPa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>High-pressure simulations showed an augmentation of the inter­actions of proteins with water (Marchi &amp; Akasaka, 2001 ▶). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Additionally, an increase in the number of ordered water molecules with pressure has been reported for HPPX using lysozyme (Kundrot &amp; Richards, 1987 ▶) and cubic cowpea mosaic virus (Girard et al., 2005 ▶), in which an increase in the number of hydrogen bonds between the water molecules and the protein was observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>In the case of SoIPMDH, the number of waters decreases again above 580 MPa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>We think that this might be caused by the start of pressure denaturation as we have found water penetration into the cavity and the cleft, but systematic changes in the water network that would correspond to a reduction of the number of structured waters found were not clearly observed. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Structures of SoIPMDH at pressures ranging from 0.1 to 650 MPa were determined at about 2 Å resolution using the HPPX method. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>A thorough comparison of these structures gives a detailed picture of the phenomena induced by high pressure on the protein, such as compression of the protein cavities, water penetration into hydrophobic cavities and the generation of a new cleft on the molecular surface accompanied by water penetration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>These observations qualitatively agree with the computational and experimental results reported previously (Imai et al., 2007 ▶; Imai &amp; Sugita, 2010 ▶; Harano &amp; Kinoshita, 2006 ▶). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>The water penetration into the hydrophobic regions of SoIPMDH is supported by hydrogen bonding to polar regions which are interspersed on the hydrophobic surface of the protein, such as the carbonyl O atom of Pro120 or Ser266 Oγ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>The role of the penetrating water molecules in reducing the PMV will be confirmed by estimating how much the PMV is reduced by water penetration into the cavity or the cleft using computational methods such as the three-dimensional RISM theory (Imai et al., 2007 ▶) or the three-dimensional integral equation theory (Harano &amp; Kinoshita, 2006 ▶). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>In addition, the comparison of high-pressure structures of SoIPMDH with those of IPMDH from deep-sea bacteria will illuminate the mechanism of pressure tolerance and will deepen our understanding of how piezophiles adapt their enzymes to extreme high-pressure environments in deep seas. </plain></SENT>
