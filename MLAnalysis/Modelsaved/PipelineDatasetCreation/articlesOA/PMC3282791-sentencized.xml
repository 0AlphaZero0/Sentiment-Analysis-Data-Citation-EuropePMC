</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignancy in developed countries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In the USA it is the second highest cause of cancer-related deaths, with an estimated 102,900 new cases occurring during 2010 [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CRC is typically much less common in developing countries of the world, including Southeast Asia; however, rates are on the rise, perhaps due to aging populations, smoking, changes in diet and a lack of screening programs [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In the South Asian population, patients tend to present with CRC at a younger age and typically at later stage [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Cancer cells are characterized by cytogenetic abnormalities that can be used to define specific disease entities and their prognostic and predictive markers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In CRC, chromosomal abnormalities occur in a non-random pattern along the pathway from adenoma to carcinoma and then to advanced lesions and the formation of metastasis [5]–[8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>There are three known pathways in CRC pathogenesis: chromosomal instability (CIN), microsatellite instability (MSI), and the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) pathways [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>These three pathways are closely related and tumors occasionally exhibit features of multiple pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Most cases of CRC arise through the CIN pathway: for example, via structural rearrangements, amplifications and deletions [10], with copy number (CN) variation being a common finding [11], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Some of the believed consequences of CIN are loss of tumor suppressor genes and amplification of oncogenes in the affected regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In contrast, MSI is less common and is more likely to be associated with hereditary CRC and a better prognosis [8], [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>CIN and MSI are thought to involve two separate pathways in the development of CRC [6], [10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal abnormalities in CRC have been studied by multiple groups using either comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) or array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) [5]–[8], [10]–[12], [14]–[22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>This has led to the discovery of many chromosomal aberrations, including gains and losses, portraying a complex picture of disease progression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Particularly common findings are gains in 20q, 13q, 7p, and 8q and losses in 17p, 18q, 8p, 4q, and 5q [23]–[29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>High-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays are an alternative and advantageous method for the analysis of chromosomal abnormalities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>This is because a higher resolution can be achieved alongside simultaneous analysis of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and CN variation [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, there are only a few published cytogenetic studies in CRC performed using relatively low-density SNP arrays [23], [29], [31]–[35], and these studies plead a strong case for their use. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In 2007, Andersen et al., using a SNP array (Affymetrix 10 K array), found copy neutral LOH (cnLOH) as a common occurrence in CRC [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Middeldorp et al. genotyped FFPE tissues from 19 MUTHY-associated CRC patients using Illumina's Golden Gate genotyping and found similar changes mainly in 17p, 18q, 15q and 6p region [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>CGH or aCGH are unable to detect the occurrence of cnLOH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The consequences of such lesion during human development and cancer have been recently reviewed [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>SNP arrays therefore capture more detailed information regarding the underlying possible mechanism of the abnormalities detected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Gaasenbeek et al. [31] compared SNP array analysis on the Affymetrix platform (10 K Xba131) with CGH on 45 unselected CRC cell lines and found many abnormalities that were apparent using the SNP array but were undetected in CGH, confirming the advantage of using a SNP array platform. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Lips et al. compared 4 FFPE CRC tissue using Illumina's GoldenGate SNP array (containing 5,861 probes) with DNA from leukocyte, normal FFPE and fresh frozen tissue from the same cases and found comparable results [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Lips et al. [29] used Affymetrix 10 K SNP array for 78 fresh frozen rectal tumor tissues to show the difference in CIN in adenoma and carcinoma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>They found five specific chromosomal aberrations that could discriminate between adenoma and carcinoma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Sheffer et al. [35] used the Affymetrix 50 K XbaI SNP array to correlate CN variations in CRC with gene expression (using Affymetrix U133A), disease progression and survival outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>They tested 130 SNP array profiles from different types of tissue (normal, adenoma, different stages CRC and metastasis).They found deletions of 8p, 4p and 15q to be associated with progression of CRC and poor survival outcome. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the previous studies, with paired and much larger sample size from a homogenous group of 86 CRC patients, our present study aimed to detect chromosomal aberrations using Illumina's Infinium based high-density (610 k and 300 k) SNP array. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the data for correlations between CIN and various histopathological and clinical parameters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we identified genes harbored within the affected regions which may contribute to tumor development or may have a protective effect on tumor metastasis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Using the Therapeutic Targets Database (TTD) we matched the genes in the amplification and deletion regions with drugs that are either already approved or are in stages of drug development for targeting these genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>With this novel interrogation, it is possible to identify appropriate drugs for patients exhibiting these particular aberrations and therefore tailor treatment to the individual. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Our study, to our knowledge, is the first to report the findings from the use of a high density SNP array platform on a paired and much larger sample size to analyze chromosomal abnormalities in relation to tumor type, location, grade, stage and sex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Our study is also unique in correlating the altered genes with drugs targeting the genes for potential identification of personalized therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Finally, our study was conducted in an understudied Southeast Asian population with CRC. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Patient characteristics and histopathological data are presented in Table 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Paired CN analysis of the SNP and Copy Number Variation (CNV) probe data from the 86 CRC tissues and their corresponding surrounding healthy colonic tissue samples revealed a total of 10,878 genomic segments (autosomes only) with amplification (1501), deletion (1630) and no CN change (7747). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>By “amplification” we mean an increase in the number of copies of a specific DNA fragment and by “deletion” we mean a loss of part of the DNA from a chromosome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/glossary/">http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/glossary/</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The chromosomal locations of these amplifications (in red) or deletions (in blue) found in the CRC samples are shown in Figure 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>The width of the bar is proportional to the number of samples showing the CN change. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>For example, amplification was most frequently found in 20q13.2 region (21 of 86 CRC samples) and deletion was most frequently found in 18q21 region (19 of 86 CRC samples). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>In comparison to corresponding healthy tissue we found amplification in the following cytoband regions of the CRC tissue: chromosome 20 (q11, q12, q13, p11), chromosome 13 (q12, q13, q14, q21, q22, q24, q32, q33), chromosome 8 (q12, q21, q22, q23, q24), chromosome 5 (p12, p13, p14, p15) and chromosome 9 (p21, p22, p23, p24). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Similarly, deletions were found in chromosome 18 (q21, q22, q23, q11, q12, p11), chromosome 8 (p21, p22, p23, p12), chromosome 17 (p11, p12, p13), chromosome 9p21 and chromosome 1p36. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Most of these findings are also reported by other authors [29], [33], [35]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Unlike CGH, which provides only CN data, SNP chips provide information about both CN and BAF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>The BAF refers to a measure of “allelic composition”, i.e., the relative contribution to the signal from the B allele. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>In other words, BAF for a sample shows the theta value for a SNP corrected for cluster position. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the BAF values for a particular locus for an individual who is homozygous for the B allele, homozygous for the A allele or heterozygous for AB are 1, 0 or 0.5 respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>BAF offers two major advantages to the use of high density SNP array platforms in cytogenetic studies, as described below with illustration from relevant findings from our study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>First, mosaicism or proportions of different cell populations (in this case, tumor cells) can be obtained from a back calculation using the formula described in our “Statistical Methods” section. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>In other words, the cytogenomic data derived from such high density SNP chips can also provide information regarding admixture of normal and chromosomally abnormal cells in the studied DNA sample. Figures 2–6 illustrate this in our study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>In each of the figures, the upper panel shows the genomic segmentation in different samples (where each row represents a sample, amplification is shown in red, deletion in blue and normal CN without color); the second panel shows the CN in linear scale for a single sample marked in the first and third panel; the third panel shows the BAF of the same sample; and the bottom or fourth panel shows the corresponding chromosomal location with cytoband information. Figure 2 shows that almost the entire 8q arm of sample C_10 had amplification (CN 2.9) with splitting of heterozygote (AB) pane of BAF at ∼0.34 (representing AAB) and 0.66 (representing ABB) indicating mono-allelic amplification in ∼90% cells (in this case cancer cells) giving rise to a mixture of cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>The formula for calculation of mosaicism is shown in “Material and Method” section. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>It may be noted that if 100% of the cells had similar change, then theoretically we would expect CN = 3 and BAF to be 0.33 and 0.67 (a typical picture of trisomy). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>The same sample shows deletion in 8p in ∼45% cells. Figure 3 shows amplification in the same 8q arm in another sample, C_1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>In contrast to Figure 2, however, BAF in this case does not show any split at all despite increase in CN suggesting bi-allelic amplification in ∼30% of the cell population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>BAF, in this case looks absolutely like normal cell, but the CN data clearly shows amplification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Only the combination of CN and BAF data could suggest the possible pathology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>If 100% cells had such change, we would expect CN = 4 and BAF = 0.5 (i.e., no splitting). Figure 4 shows chromosome 8p of sample C_1 and clearly shows mono-allelic deletion (e.g. A_ or _B) in ∼80% cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>If 100% cells had such mono-allelic deletion, we would expect CN = 1 and splitting of BAF to 0.0 and 1.0 (a typical picture of complete LOH due to mono-allelic loss). Figure 5 shows mono-allelic deletion of 8p and mono-allelic amplification of 8q both in one sample (C_21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>The CN and the BAF splitting suggest this deletion-amplification in ∼65% cell population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the deletion events in Figure 4 and Figure 5 clearly show the advantage of analyzing BAF data and CN data together to obtain the proportion of abnormal cells in the tumor sample. Figure 5 also clearly shows that splitting of AB pane in BAF plot may be found both in deletion and amplification states emphasizing the importance of combined data (CN and BAF) for interpreting the cytogenetic change seen in tumor samples. Figure 6 shows an example of splitting of AB pane in BAF data in chromosome 17p without any change in CN status (may be called cnLOH). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>This type of change is possible in case of acquired UPD or isodisomy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>In this case (sample C_19) ∼50% cells show cnLOH in 17p arm only whereas the entire 17q arm is normal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>It may be noted that this type of abnormality can not be detected by aCGH. Figure 7 shows an example of monoallelic amplification superimposed on cnLOH in chromosome 20q. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>A summary of the combination of changes in CN status and BAF and their possible explanation for the mechanism of cytogenetic abnormality is presented in Table 2. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Cellular adhesion is an important function in tumor localization, or in other words may play a role in prevention of tumor spread and therefore may be another protective gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Chalmers et al have previously suggested that cadherins are important tumor suppressor genes and are often lost in many cancers [51]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>From another point of view, tumors with lymph node metastasis were more often found to have amplification of the AURKA gene than tumors without metastasis, which suggests this gene may have a role in progression and promotion of tumor spread. </plain></SENT>
