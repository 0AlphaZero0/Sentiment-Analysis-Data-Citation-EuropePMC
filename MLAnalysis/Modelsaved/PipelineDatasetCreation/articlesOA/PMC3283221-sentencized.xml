</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Previous estimates have suggested that atrial fibrillation (AF) affects over 2 million people in the USA and over 4 million across the European Union.1,2Atrial fibrillation is more common in older people,1suggesting that it will become an ever-greater problem in an increasingly ageing population. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with AF are reported to have a five-fold increased risk of stroke; moreover, compared with the other identified risk factors for stroke (hypertension, heart failure, and coronary heart disease), AF has the strongest association.3Atrial fibrillation-related stroke is cardiac in origin; thrombi form in the left atrial appendage and embolize, causing ischaemic stroke.2Therefore, antithrombotic therapy has become an established method of preventing stroke in patients with AF. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Numerous risk stratification schemes have been developed to help predict the level of stroke risk in patients with AF (low, moderate, or high) and to manage them accordingly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Among the best known is the CHADS2scale, where points are attributed to the presence of known risk factors: congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes (1 point each), or previous stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA; two points, to reflect its greater associated risk).4Stratification schemes (and management guidelines) have also been developed by the joint Task Force of the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and European Society of Cardiology (ACC/AHA/ESC),2and by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP).5Because the various schemes have been developed by independent groups over several years, there is some heterogeneity between them; this leads to considerable differences in a patient's predicted level of stroke risk, depending on the scheme used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>An analysis of 12 published risk stratification schemes showed that, in a representative sample of 1000 patients with AF, the proportion of those classified as ‘low risk’ varied from 7% to 42%, depending on the scheme used.4A similar analysis by Lip et al.6found that, of a sample of patients with AF from the Euro Heart Survey (n= 1084), the percentage defined as ‘low risk’ ranged from 9% to48% across several different schemes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the 9% relates to the ‘Birmingham 2009’ scheme, an adaptation of CHADS2referred to as CHA2DS2-VASc, which incorporates additional risk factors including vascular disease, age 65–74 years, and female gender. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In the CHA2DS2-VASc scoring scheme, age ≥75 years is also assigned a greater weight, i.e. two points.6In this 9% of patients, the incidence of thromboembolism was 0% (compared with 1.4% using the CHADS2definition), suggesting that they were ‘truly’ low risk.6Taken together, these analyses indicate that perhaps as many as 90% of patients with AF can be classed as being at moderate-to-high risk of stroke. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A recent retrospective analysis of 73 538 patients with AF in Denmark assessed the predictive capability of the new scheme and found the rate of thromboembolism per 100 person-years in patients with a zero score was 1.67 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.47–1.89] for CHADS2and 0.78 (95% CI 0.58–1.04) for CHA2DS2-VASc at 1 year.7In all risk categories except for CHA2DS2-VASc score equal to 0 there was a reduction in risk with vitamin K antagonist (VKA) treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Another study followed 79 844 patients with AF in the UK General Practice Research Database for an average of 4 years.8In this study, the annual stroke rate per 100 person-years in patients with a zero score was 1% for CHADS2and 0.5% for CHA2DS2-VASc. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a small-scale Chinese study also reported that, unlike CHADS2, the CHA2DS2-VASc score was an independent predictor of left atrial thrombus in patients with paroxysmal AF.9However, larger studies are needed to validate this. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Notably, the most recent ESC guidelines incorporate CHA2DS2-VASc, recommending that CHADS2be used for initial assessments of the need for oral anticoagulation, with CHA2DS2-VASc being invoked for further refinement in patients with a CHADS2score of 0–1.10 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Thromboprophylaxis with antithrombotic agents is associated with an increased risk of bleeding, and guidelines recommend that individual patients' bleeding risks should also be considered before starting antithrombotic treatment.2,10–12Because many of the risk factors for stroke and bleeding are similar, the rate of major haemorrhage is higher in patients with higher CHADS2scores,6,13,14and so an accurate tool for assessing individual bleeding risk is of value to help guide treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>A comparison of bleeding risk schemes using a trial cohort of 7329 patients with AF found the HAS-BLED scheme to have the best predictive value.14The risk factors included in the HAS-BLED scheme (given 1 point each) are hypertension, abnormal renal or liver function, history of stroke, history of bleeding or bleeding predisposition, labile international normalized ratios (INRs), age &gt;65 years, and concomitant drug use or alcohol abuse. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The predictive ability of the HAS-BLED scheme has also been compared with the alternative scheme, HEMORR2HAGES, in a Danish registry of 118 584 patients with AF.15HEMORR2HAGES, like HAS-BLED, is a point scheme with two points assigned for a prior bleed and one point for other risk factors including: hepatic or renal disease, ethanol abuse, malignancy, older (age &gt;75 years), reduced platelet count or function, hypertension (uncontrolled), anaemia, genetic factors, excessive fall risk, and stroke.16The two schemes had a similar ability to predict the rate of hospitalization or death from major bleeding in 1 year, with both schemes demonstrating increasing bleeding rates with increasing score.15The authors concluded, however, that the simplicity of HAS-BLED was advantageous as it could be used more easily in clinical practice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) and ESC 2010 guidelines both advocate the use of the HAS-BLED scheme, with HAS-BLED score ≥3 deemed to indicate high risk of bleeding, and caution and regular review recommended regardless of whether the patient is treated with an oral anticoagulant or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA).10,12 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>According to ACC/AHA/ESC 2006/2011 and ACCP 2008 guidelines, patients with moderate-to-high risk of stroke should be considered for stroke prophylaxis with a VKA.2,5,11The ESC 2010 guidelines recommend that patients with a CHADS2score ≥2 should receive oral anticoagulation therapy; patients with a CHADS2score of &lt;2 should be assessed using CHA2DS2-VASc.10Those with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 may receive either oral anticoagulation therapy or ASA (with oral anticoagulation the preferred option of the two), and patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0 may receive either ASA or no antithrombotic therapy—with the guidelines also stating that no antithrombotic therapy is the preferred choice in these patients.10 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In 2007, Hart et al.17published the findings of a comprehensive meta-analysis of data from 29 randomized clinical trials assessing the efficacy and safety of antithrombotic agents (including VKAs) in patients with non-valvular AF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Reviewing six trials that compared a VKA with placebo or control, the meta-analysis found that adjusted-dose warfarin reduced the relative risk (RR) of stroke by 64% (95% CI 49–74) vs. placebo or control (53 events in 2396 patient-years vs. 133 events in 2207 patient-years) (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>When ischaemic stroke alone was analysed, the RR reduction with adjusted-dose warfarin was 67% (95% CI 54–77).17Compared with placebo or control, a 26% (95% CI 3–43) reduction in all-cause mortality was also seen with adjusted-dose warfarin (110 vs. 143 deaths). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Vitamin K antagonist therapy has considerable limitations, one of which is its association with increased bleeding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The 2007 meta-analysis showed that dose-adjusted warfarin increased the RR of intracranial haemorrhage by 128% compared with ASA; the difference in absolute risk between warfarin and ASA was small (0.2% per year), but was reported as being statistically significant.17It has been suggested that rates of haemorrhage in younger non-inception trial cohorts underestimate warfarin-related bleeding in practice.13In a cohort of patients with AF receiving warfarin who were ≥65 years of age, the rate of intracranial haemorrhage was 2.5%.13The first 90 days of warfarin, age ≥80 years, and INR ≥4.0 were associated with an increased risk of major haemorrhage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Warfarin use was the cause of 15% of the drug-related adverse events in a cohort of 1247 long-term care residents.18In fact, 17% of first admissions for intracranial haemorrhage have been found to be associated with anticoagulation therapy, with 98% of these patients receiving warfarin treatment.19 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Vitamin K antagonists also have a delayed onset of action; in the first few days, heparin bridging therapy is required until the anticoagulant effect of the VKA is established.20Vitamin K antagonists are also associated with variable dose–response profiles: reasons for this include environmental and hereditary factors (body weight, age, and genetic polymorphisms), and interactions with foods and drugs.20The narrow therapeutic window of VKAs (INR of prothrombin times ranging between 2.0 and 3.0 in patients with AF)20is another limitation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving VKA therapy, therefore, need regular coagulation monitoring and dose adjustment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Thus, VKAs are often underused in the clinical setting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>For example, a retrospective US cohort study of hospitalized patients with AF (n= 945) found that, although 86% of patients were classed as being at high risk of stroke, only 55% were given a VKA.21More surprisingly, 21% of high-risk patients did not receive a VKA or ASA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>There are similar findings regarding the suboptimal use of VKAs in those at high risk of stroke in the out-of-hospital setting.22 </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="s4"><title><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Antiplatelet therapy </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Acetylsalicylic acid has been widely used as an agent for stroke prophylaxis in patients with AF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Until recently, guidelines recommended ASA therapy only in patients with non-valvular AF who are considered at low risk of stroke, or in whom VKA therapy is contraindicated.2,5However, the ESC 2010 guidelines and the ACC Foundation/AHA/Heart Rhythm Society (ACCF/AHA/HRS) focussed update to the ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 guidelines include a role for clopidogrel use in conjunction with ASA, suggesting that this dual-antiplatelet combination could be considered for stroke prevention in patients for whom oral anticoagulation therapy may be unsuitable.10,23 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>A number of studies have evaluated the efficacy of antiplatelet agents, principally ASA, in reducing thromboembolism in patients with AF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>In their meta-analysis, Hart et al.17reported a 19% (95% CI –1 to 35) reduction in the RR of stroke in patients with AF treated with ASA compared with placebo or no treatment (179 events in 3432 patient-years vs. 209 events in 3302 patient-years). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>However, this reduction in risk was not statistically significant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the dose of ASA varied widely from 50 to 1300 mg per day in the studies included in the meta-analysis with most of the beneficial effects of ASA driven from the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) I study, which utilized a 325 mg dose.10,24In contrast, the Japan Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Trial compared an ASA dose of 150–200 mg per day with no treatment in 871 patients with AF.25This trial was stopped early due to a non-significant increase in the risk of major bleeding of 1.6% with ASA, compared with 0.4% in the no-treatment group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Also, the greater number of primary endpoint events (cardiovascular death, symptomatic brain infarction, or TIA) in the ASA arm (3.1% per year) compared with no-treatment group (2.4% per year) meant that treatment with ASA was unlikely to be superior to no treatment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>A comparison of antiplatelets (including clopidogrel, triflusal, and indobufen as well as ASA) with VKA therapy in the meta-analysis by Hart et al. revealed that adjusted-dose warfarin reduced the RR of all stroke by 37% (95% CI 23–48) compared with antiplatelet therapy (180 vs. 282 events in 8946 patient-years) (Figure 1B).17The modest effect of antiplatelet agents on stroke risk may be more due to the inhibition of platelet thrombi in the carotid and cerebral arteries than the inhibition of cardiogenic thrombi that occur in AF.26However, it is likely that the lower bleeding risk with antiplatelet agents compared with that of VKAs (albeit at the cost of reduced efficacy) remains their key attraction. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>In the Atrial fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for prevention of Vascular Events (ACTIVE) W study, patients with electrocardiogram-confirmed AF and at least one risk factor for stroke were randomized to receive clopidogrel with ASA or VKA therapy (target INR 2.0–3.0).27Clopidogrel plus ASA therapy was associated with significantly more major vascular events [stroke, non-central nervous system (CNS) systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, or vascular death] than VKA therapy (P= 0.0003) (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Rates of major bleeding were similar between the two groups, but there were significantly more cases of minor bleeding in the clopidogrel plus ASA group (P= 0.0009). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>A higher cumulative rate of bleeding was seen with warfarin after 3 years (P= 0.003). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Despite differences in study design, the phase III trials in patients with AF published to date for three of the newer agents (RE-LY, ROCKET AF, and ARISTOTLE) drew broadly similar conclusions.82Rates of stroke and systemic embolism with the newer agents were at the very least comparable to those of warfarin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Favourable bleeding profiles compared with warfarin were reported across the trials, and there was an indication of reduced mortality compared with warfarin (reaching statistical significance in the ARISTOTLE trial). </plain></SENT>
