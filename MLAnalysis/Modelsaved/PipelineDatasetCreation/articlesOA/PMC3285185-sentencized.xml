</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>DNA polymorphisms provide an invaluable means to study the influence of historical processes that shape genetic diversity, such as divergence times, gene flow, and fluctuations in population sizes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>To increase the statistical rigor by which these processes are inferred, the field of phylogeography has advanced in two directions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>First, coalescent theory [1], [2] is now routinely applied in phylogeographic studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Coalescent methods incorporate the stochastic variance of genetic processes by estimating parameters from many genealogies consistent with the data, and thus provide a framework for testing competing hypotheses while accounting for uncertainty (i.e., confidence intervals) in parameter estimates [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Second, estimating parameters from multiple independent loci has become common [5]–[12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>A multilocus approach has been motivated by two fundamental problems with single-locus studies: the stochasticity of mutation and genetic drift creates variable signatures in DNA even when different loci experienced identical population histories [3], [13], [14], and single-locus studies do not adequately address the possibility that selection, not population history, has generated patterns in DNA [15]–[17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Because mutation, drift, and selection operate independently on unlinked loci, applying coalescent methods to multiple loci can strengthen inferences of population history. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Although coalescent methods and multilocus approaches have advanced the field substantially, there are still a number of challenges to be addressed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Among them is how well the genetic data fit the coalescent models used to infer population histories [18], [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Actual population histories are usually, if not always, more complex than the available models, and they can violate any number of simplifying assumptions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Common assumptions in analytical programs using coalescence include constant or exponentially-changing effective population sizes (Ne), constant migration rates over time, panmictic populations that do not exchange genes with other populations, simple models of molecular evolution, and selective neutrality [20]–[22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Simulation studies demonstrate that violating these assumptions can sometimes bias parameter estimates [23]–[25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Therefore, understanding how well empirical data fit these models is necessary to obtain robust inferences of population history and to understand the influences of selection and other processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Although coalescent methods can be incredibly flexible, and additional relevant parameters can be added [26], doing so increases computational demands and requires additional data (e.g., more loci) to obtain sufficient signal in the DNA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Empirical studies have revealed that heterogeneity in the patterns of genetic diversity can be substantially higher than expected under simple, neutral models of population history, which is attributed to more complex demographic histories or selection [27]–[32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Distinguishing between these scenarios is difficult, because patterns generated by different forms of selection can mimic the patterns generated by various population histories [15], [33], [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>A key to disentangling the effects of population history and selection is that population history affects loci throughout the genome in a similar fashion, whereas selection only affects the locus (or loci) under selection and those that are closely linked. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Thus, population history generates similar patterns of DNA polymorphisms throughout the genome, whereas selection has a local effect causing idiosyncratic patterns among loci [34]–[36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>However, some forms of demographic history, such as bottlenecks, can cause heterogeneous patterns among loci that are difficult to distinguish from the effects of selection [27], [28], [30], [31], [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, if selection is pervasive throughout the genome, it might have a strong net effect on our ability to infer population histories. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested the fit of non-coding DNA sequence data sampled from a genomic transect (∼1 locus per chromosome; 22 loci) in a species of duck, the gadwall (Anas strepera), to two popular coalescent models: the two-island model from the program lamarc [22] and the isolation-migration model from the program im [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>We then used coalescent simulations to test three hypotheses that might explain the poor fit between empirical data and the models, including a pre-divergence bottleneck, interspecific hybridization, and selection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Because there are an infinite number of complexities that could contribute to empirical data deviating from the models, these hypotheses are not intended to be exhaustive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Rather, we focus on these three hypotheses because we suspect a priori that these factors might have had a prominent influence on measures of genetic diversity. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the observed among-locus heterogeneity was significantly higher than expected under both neutral models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>Because we incorporated relative substitution rates obtained from outgroup comparisons, heterogeneous substitution rates alone cannot explain the among-locus heterogeneity that we observed. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Any other changes in population sizes would violate these assumptions and could have contributed to the poor fit between the empirical data and the models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>For example, bottlenecks of moderate strength can cause high among-locus heterogeneity in π, which can result in an overly liberal HKA test [28], [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>However, including a pre-divergence bottleneck in our simulations did not appreciably change the variance expected under the isolation-migration model, despite simulating data using a broad range of values for both the timing and the magnitude of the simulated bottleneck. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we did not find a significant relationship between the among-locus heterogeneity in π and the magnitude of the simulated bottleneck. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>Although there are an infinite number of possible bottleneck scenarios that have not been examined here, a pre-divergence bottleneck seems insufficient for explaining the high among-locus heterogeneity in our empirical dataset [27], [28], [31]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>Long term fluctuations in population sizes, which we did not explicitly examine, could also have contributed to our findings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>Fluctuations in population size cause Ne to be approximately equal to the harmonic mean of long-term population size [69], [70]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Because Θ is a function of Ne, an assumption of constant size would seem adequate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>However, when using genetic data, Θ is estimated over the genealogy and thus represents the harmonic mean of Ne between the present and the time of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) within the sampled genealogy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>Given the differences in nucleotide diversity among our loci, TMRCA likely varied considerably, and this variance could result in among-locus heterogeneity in Θ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>For example, if population sizes were small in the recent past, then any locus that coalesces within that timeframe would have a small Θ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>However, a locus with a substantially older TMRCA could include periods of larger sizes within their history, which would cause Θ to be larger. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>Thus, fluctuating population sizes contributing to among-locus differences in TMRCA theoretically could have caused the high among-locus heterogeneity in Θ that we observed in the two-island model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>Despite allowing for exponential growth or decline following divergence, the isolation-migration model could also be sensitive to among-locus differences in timescales reflected in our data, because this model assumes a constant ancestral Ne. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>This possibility is supported by our observation that removing the low-diversity loci (those inferred to be under selection) from the im analysis resulted in a significantly larger estimate for the ancestral population size and a better fit between the empirical and the simulated data. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>Ducks are well known for their capacity to hybridize and produce fertile offspring with other species [71]–[74], and larger sample sizes of gadwalls revealed introgression of mtDNA from several species [38], [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>In particular, about 5% of North American gadwalls carry mtDNA haplotypes derived from falcated ducks, and one Asian gadwall had a putatively introgressed CHD1Z allele (no evidence of introgression for LDHB was found). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>Thus, falcated ducks and other species potentially contributed to the nuclear gene pool of gadwalls as well, which could have caused heterogeneity among loci. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>In support of this hypothesis, we found that incorporating hybridization from falcated ducks into our simulations resulted in the CV for π to be consistent with the observed empirical data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>These simulations demonstrate that the stochasticity of genetic drift can cause the genetic contribution of a third population to vary among loci, thus creating among-locus heterogeneity in genetic diversity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>Although hybridization is a strong candidate for explaining our results in gadwall, results from a previously published simulation study [24] seem inconsistent with this hypothesis. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>Both im and lamarc assume that the loci studied are selectively neutral. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>However, selection can affect polymorphisms in non-coding DNA both directly and indirectly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>For example, components of introns such as structural and regulatory elements are functional and selectively constrained [76], [77]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>Indirect effects of selection via genetic hitchhiking can also alter genetic signatures in non-coding DNA that is closely linked to coding exons [78], [79]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>Although different forms of selection can create patterns that mimic the genetic signatures of various population histories [15], the overall importance of selection in biasing inferences of population-level parameters is not well understood. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>Three lines of evidence support the hypothesis that selection has influenced some of our loci. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>First, low-diversity loci were more likely than high-diversity loci to contain an excess of rare polymorphisms, which is consistent with the effects of purifying or directional selection acting at those loci [89]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>For example, CD4 is critical for an adaptive immune response and has a conserved interaction with the class II major histocompatibility complex that is required for the activation of T-helper cells [90]–[92]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the CD4 gene is likely subject to strong selection, which could have an indirect effect on polymorphisms within the linked introns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this possibility, CD4 had low nucleotide diversity and an excess of rare polymorphisms (i.e., a significantly negative Tajima's D) relative to the values simulated under all five of our models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the network topology exhibited the classic star-like pattern (Fig. 3) suggestive of a selective sweep [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>GRIN1, Sf3A2, and LDHB also exhibited this star-like network, negative Tajima's Ds, and a paucity of intraspecific polymorphisms relative to interspecific divergence, all of which are consistent with selective sweeps. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>Second, removing low-diversity loci that the HKA test detected as significant outliers resulted in a better fit between the heterogeneity observed in the empirical data and data simulated under the isolation-migration model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>Third, removing the low-diversity loci resulted in a significantly larger estimate of the ancestral Ne, suggesting that different categories of loci contain heterogeneous signatures of population history. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>This heterogeneity is also reflected in the among-locus differences in Θ estimated from the two-island model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>Although the HKA test might have caused the liberal removal of loci (i.e., loci not influenced by selection; see [28]), these results demonstrate that selection is a strong candidate for explaining the among-locus heterogeneity in π that we observed. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>This assumption seems reasonable for our data. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>In addition to finding a poor fit between the empirical data and the basic coalescent models, we found that simulating data under the inferred two-island and isolation-migration models gave different null expectations, especially for π and Tajima's D. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>One possible explanation for these discrepancies was the manner in which recombining loci were handled. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>Whereas lamarc incorporates recombination into the analyses, im assumes no recombination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>To meet this assumption of no recombination, we used a recombination-filtered data set that removed 19.4% of the nucleotides and 41.6% of the segregating sites from the im analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>Simulations show that this practice of truncating sequences causes a systematic downward bias in estimates of θ [24], [61]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="352" pm="."><plain>This bias might have been especially problematic in our data set, because only small fragments of high-diversity loci could be used, whereas the low-diversity loci did not require truncating. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="353" pm="."><plain>If using recombination-filtered data sets caused im to underestimate θ, then mean π also would be under-predicted in our simulations, as we observed for the isolation-migration model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="354" pm="."><plain>However, this difference cannot explain why the two-island model over-predicted mean π. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="355" pm="."><plain>Other differences between the models could also have contributed to the contrasting results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="356" pm="."><plain>The isolation-migration model included estimates of divergence time, ancestral population size, and population growth rates, which were not incorporated into the two-island model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="357" pm="."><plain>Indeed, assuming a constant Ne in the two-island model is a probable explanation for the over-prediction of Tajima's D in the simulated data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="358" pm="."><plain>In addition, im infers differences in substitution rates (mutation scalars) from the data analyzed [20], whereas we defined relative substitution rates for the lamarc analysis that were estimated from independent data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="359" pm="."><plain>Any differences in the inferred rates could have contributed to differences between parameters estimated from the two models, especially for θ and π. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="360" pm="."><plain>Despite these inconsistencies, it is encouraging that both models supported a larger Ne for OW gadwalls relative to NW gadwalls (average θ over the long term), and both models supported asymmetrical gene flow, with greater movements from OW to NW than vice versa. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="362" pm="."><plain>The high heterogeneity in nucleotide diversity that we observed among 22 non-coding loci in gadwall ducks did not fit simple, neutral models of population history. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="363" pm="."><plain>Based on simulations, interspecific hybridization and selection are both strong candidates for causing the observed deviations from the models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="364" pm="."><plain>The effects of hybridization and selection could be synergistic, thereby having an additive effect on among-locus heterogeneity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="365" pm="."><plain>For example, selection could inhibit or prevent some genes from crossing species or population boundaries, which can create heterogeneous patterns among different loci [8], [32], [43], [44], [93]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="366" pm="."><plain>More specifically, loci with a higher propensity for introgression would have a higher Ne than loci for which gene flow is restricted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="367" pm="."><plain>Examining both of these hypotheses simultaneously might provide a better understanding of the complexity underlying genetic diversity within the genomes of diverging populations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="368" pm="."><plain>Given our results suggesting that genomic diversity is more complex than predicted by available coalescent models, one might question the value of these methods for studying population histories, especially given their sensitivity to the violation of assumptions [23], [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="369" pm="."><plain>We argue that our results do not undermine the value of coalescent models but rather demonstrate the need to test how well empirical data fit these models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="370" pm="."><plain>The results from coalescent analyses serve as an invaluable null model, and comparing empirical and simulated data enables the evaluation of factors that might have contributed to a lack of fit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="371" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, other research might show that sequence data from other species and populations fit the models well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="372" pm="."><plain>In either case, coalescent methods coupled with coalescent simulations offer rigorous means of examining how historical events have contributed to DNA polymorphisms, and thus should continue to provide insights into the generation and maintenance of genetic diversity. </plain></SENT>
