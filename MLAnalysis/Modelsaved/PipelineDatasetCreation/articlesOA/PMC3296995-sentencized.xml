<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An increasing incidence of food allergies in Europe and USA [1,2] is being reflected in clinical studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>European legislation recognizes so far 14 major allergenic foods [3] and requires a mandatory declaration when they are part of the ingredients; in cases where the manufacturer cannot exclude their presence as a result of accidental contamination in foodstuffs the label often contains the phrase “may contain”. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>But so far, there are no established threshold limits below which an allergen poses only a small risk of causing harm to an allergic consumer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Even though commonly accepted trigger levels have not been established yet, there is consensus among the scientific community, that allergen detection methods should be capable of covering the low ppm range (1–10 mg allergenic ingredient kg−1 food product). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Currently, to detect allergens in food products, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and PCR analyses were adopted as methods of choice by the food industry and official food control agencies [2,4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, food matrix and processing effects can result in large numbers of false positives and negatives using these methods [5], which lack the precision and rigor needed in cases of liability issues [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Mass spectrometry driven approaches on the other hand can be successfully used as a confirmatory platform given the specificity and sensitivity that can be achieved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In addition, multi-allergen detection and quantification is feasible after some stringent considerations are fulfilled [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The bottom up mass spectrometry approach (reconstruction of the protein based on peptides) either for characterization of the allergenic protein or by a targeted approach for sensitive detection/quantification are being used as platforms for allergen detection with promising outcomes [7,8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The lack of established guidelines addressing different issues during sample preparation for analysis of food allergens makes it difficult to have a generic platform for multi-allergen detection and quantification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Published investigations in many cases lack experimental details and pose question marks relating to critical points of the food allergen detection workflows. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>It is of urgent necessity that certain aspects of the protocol used are stated: target analyte, source of allergenic food used (e.g., raw, roasted, defatted, etc.), incurred or spiked allergenic food (before or after processing); clear statement of reporting units (mass ratio of allergenic food, total proteins, allergenic protein target), digestion conditions (possible peptide modifications), etc., just to cite a few aspects of the sample preparation phase. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In this manuscript, we would like to illustrate with peanut serving as an example: (i) the challenges to be faced to detect food allergens at trace levels in complex food matrices (1–10 mg peanuts kg−1 cookie); (ii) the need for improvements in sample preparation and mass spectrometry analytical tools to achieve low levels of detection; and (iii) the awareness on key issues related to the development of a robust multi-allergen and quantitative method for trace analysis of food allergens. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>The LOD values reported need to be considered with caution since the allergen food sources are not fully described and might not be representative of real scenarios, being by far too optimistic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>However, it is a first attempt that brings new insights into this possible multi allergen detection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>For absolute allergen quantification, the topic is much more sensitive and we should be cautious on how to interpret quantification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Ideally, an isotopically labeled target protein that can be incorporated during the sample preparation workflow or even before processing simulating real processing and extraction conditions should be used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>However, so far it is more realistic to use isotopically labeled peptides [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>The digestion step for quantification of proteins/peptides is a key aspect and requires being reproducible and complete [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Assessment of the stability of target peptides (e.g., possible deaminations) during the proteolysis and afterwards is also of key importance for absolute protein quantification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Absolute quantification of milk allergens in a variety of food matrices has been recently reported [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Many of the target peptides present Q and N in their sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>We have experimentally observed with our target peptides that when these amino acids are present they can undergo deamination to a certain degrees. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Of course, this issue might be circumvented by accounting for the amidated and de-aminated forms in the SRM method. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Given the different physico-chemical properties of the different allergenic proteins to target, the complexity of the different potential food matrices encountered and the diversity of food processing conditions, a generic sample preparation platform might not be realistic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>However, it might be feasible to rely on a few number of sample preparation workflows grouping food products sharing similar characteristics (e.g., high protein content, high polyphenol content, etc.). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>This would certainly help for validation and standardization of food allergen detection methods through SRM targeted approaches. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Concluding Remarks </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>A well described and representative food allergen source (IRMM-481f), which is a mix of five commercially available different peanut varieties and five different processing conditions, was used contrary to previous reported investigations in which the food allergen source is vague or not representative enough. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>A representative and highly processed food matrix (cookies) with a high protein content of non target proteins (milk and wheat) was employed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>This matrix is representative of what is to be expected when analyzing food samples contaminated with allergens: a wide range in protein concentration and a highly processed sample. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>This work mainly focused on method development through shotgun proteomics and sample preparation for future targeted confirmatory approaches such as SRM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>The SRM approach followed, allowed us to detect Ara h 3 peptides at levels as low as 10 μg peanuts g−1 cookies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>The two proteotypic Ara h 3/4 peptides AHVQVVDSNGNR and SPDIYNPQAGSLK were confirmed as markers of peanut presence in cookies containing as low as 10 μg peanuts g−1 cookies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>This targeted SRM is being further optimized by our group to allow detection, confirmation and potential quantification of Ara h 3 and Ara h 1 peanut allergens in different food matrices. </plain></SENT>
