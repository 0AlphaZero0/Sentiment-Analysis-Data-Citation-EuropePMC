</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Archaeal CRISPR-based immune systems provide a defence against invading genetic elements, primarily viruses and conjugative plasmids, and they fall into three main types, the DNA-targeting CRISPR/Cas systems where CRISPR loci and cas genes are invariably linked on the genome, and the DNA-targeting CRISPR/Csm and RNA-targeting CRISPR/Cmr systems for which the csm and cmr gene cassettes are often uncoupled from CRISPR loci (1–4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Almost all archaea carry CRISPR-based defence systems and crenarchaea often exhibit a complex mixture of different types (5,6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The CRISPR locus is an essential functional component of all these systems and consists of a long leader region followed by up to about 100 spacer-repeat units. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Spacer sequences originating from foreign genetic elements are about 30–40 bp long and the interspaced identical direct repeats are ∼25–37 bp in length; both tend to be conserved in length for a given CRISPR locus (2,7–9). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>All CRISPR-based immune systems are basically modular with three primary functions: (i) adaptation that involves excision of DNA from invading DNA genetic elements and integration of the DNA as a new spacer in a CRISPR locus at or near the leader, (ii) generation and processing of CRISPR transcripts to yield mature crRNAs, and (iii) interference of the genetic element by targeting and cleavage via a crRNA–protein complex (10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A few Cas, Cmr and Csm proteins have been assigned roles associated with each of these functional steps on the basis of predictions from bioinformatical or crystal structure analyses and, less commonly, experiments (2,4). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The crenarchaeal genus Sulfolobus, in particular, has yielded novel insights into these CRISPR-based systems. Sulfolobus species generally carry complex and diverse systems including DNA-targeting CRISPR/Cas and CRISPR/Csm and RNA targeting CRISPR/Cmr, sometimes encoded in multiple copies in a given species (5,7,11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Moreover, many novel viruses have been characterized for Sulfolobus and the related genus Acidianus which have recently been classified into seven new viral families with several remaining unclassified (12,13), and plasmids with an archaea-specific conjugative apparatus have also been identified (14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>These provide a major advantage for studying the interplay between genetic elements and host CRISPR-based systems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>For example, numerous virus and conjugative plasmid sequence matches to CRISPR spacers were used to demonstrate that the uptake of DNA from invading genetic elements was essentially a random process (15). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it was recently shown that by employing vectors carrying viral genes or sequences matching CRISPR spacers under selection, one can induce different sized CRISPR deletions which all include the matching spacer (16), and these genetic systems were also used to study sequence stringency requirements for DNA targeting by crRNAs (16,17). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Our understanding of mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of CRISPR loci is still at an early stage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In enterobacteria transcription of CRISPR loci and associated cas genes is silenced by the H-NS regulator and activation of the system requires an anti-silencer (18–20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a bacteriophage EPV1 was characterized in a metagenomic study encoding the H-NS protein which could inactivate the host defence system upon viral infection (21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>For Sulfolobus, the complexity and diversity of the CRISPR systems, and the presence of putative transcriptional regulators associated with the different genetic modules, would require multiple regulatory mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>For example, the putative provirus M164 was found integrated into the gene of the putative transcriptional regulator Csa3 associated with the gene cassette encoding proteins involved in adaptation (22). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The simplest way to inactivate the diverse systems would be to inhibit production of crRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>However, it has been shown for Sulfolobus, and other hyperthermophilic archaea, that pre-crRNAs are generated constitutively in the absence of invading foreign DNA elements (7,11,23–25) and, currently, there is no evidence to indicate that the level of pre-crRNA transcripts increases when genetic elements enter cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Presumably, this reflects that the CRISPR immune system can respond rapidly to the continual exposure to a wide variety of foreign genetic elements that frequent these extreme natural environments (12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The regulatory difference between pre-crRNA regulation in the enterobacteria and Sulfolobus could also reflect that the diverse and complex CRISPR-based systems of Sulfolobus and other archaea are actively involved in maintaining relatively low levels of viruses intracellularly (12,13). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Only one protein to date has been shown to bind directly to a CRISPR locus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>That is the Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 protein Sso0454 (formerly SRSR repeat-binding protein) that exhibits a triple internal repeat sequence and binds specifically to DNA repeats of CRISPR loci of S. solfataricus and the Sulfolobus conjugative plasmid pNOB8 (26). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>It protects the repeat and repeat–spacer junctions against endonuclease attack and induces a distortion at the centre of the DNA repeat (26). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Homologues of Cbp1 are found primarily amongst members of the acidothermophilic Sulfolobales but have also been detected in genomes of the hyperthermophilic Desulfurococcales (27). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The cbp1 gene is not physically linked on chromosomes to either CRISPR loci or CRISPR-associated proteins, which suggests that it also has other cellular target sites. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Prior to the discovery of CRISPR transcription, Cbp1 was considered to be involved in chromosomal packaging of CRISPR loci (26) but the detection of a range of intermediate processed CRISPR transcripts (pre-crRNAs) in Archaeoglobus fulgidus and S. solfataricus (23,24) raised the possibility of a transcriptional role for the protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>CRISPR loci generally appear to be transcribed as single transcripts from a promoter within the leader region (7,11) followed by processing within repeat sequences by Cas6 to yield mature crRNAs, carrying part of the repeat and all or most of the spacer sequence (28–30). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>It was also shown for S. acidocaldarius that transcripts are produced from reverse CRISPR strands for each of the five CRISPR loci present (11) and evidence for the formation of reverse-strand transcripts from the six CRISPR loci of S. solfataricus P2 was also provided by a whole-transcriptome analysis (31). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The functional significance, if any, of these reverse-strand transcripts remains unclear but potentially they can base pair with crRNAs and impede their interference reactions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins are often transcription factors but, since Cbp1 can potentially bind to all repeats of CRISPR loci within a cell, in total 208 repeats in S. islandicus REY15A and 423 in S. solfataricus P2 (11,16), it is not a typical transcriptional regulator. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In order to gain some insight into its function(s), we exploited the recently developed genetic systems for S. islandicus REY15A and S. solfataricus P2 as well as a microarray for the latter organism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Cbp1 knockout and overexpression mutants were generated and transcriptional properties of the CRISPR loci were examined for the mutants (16,32). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>We provide evidence for Cbp1 modulating transcription of CRISPR loci from the leader. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>We still know little about the stepwise processing of large CRISPR transcripts, and the mechanisms may vary for different CRISPR-based systems (11,23,24), Moreover, the yields of individual mature crRNAs are non-uniform (see, for example, Figure 7A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the data presented are consistent with a model in which Cbp1 inhibits internal initiation and termination at putative archaeal transcriptional motifs located within spacers, and occasionally within repeats, of CRISPR loci. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Such a function could be especially important for the acidothermophilic Sulfolobales and their genetic elements which carry A + T-rich (∼65%) genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>The frequency of possible archaeal-specific promoter motifs (hexameric TATA-like sequences) and archaeal terminator motifs (T-rich pyrimidine sequences) is likely to be high (38,39). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>An estimate of the number of such motifs in the 4800 spacers contained in sequenced genomes of the Sulfolobales indicated that a large fraction carried potential promoter motifs and a smaller fraction of terminator motifs (3) and there is an additional promoter motif (ATTAAT) within the repeats of loci A and B of S. solfataricus P2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Even if most of these motifs are ineffective or weakly effective, collectively they could severely impede generation of long CRISPR transcripts of up to about 7000 nt. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>The demonstration by footprinting studies that Cbp1 partially protects the ends of the spacer regions (26) provides a potential mechanism for the transcriptional modulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>To test this model further, we plan to generate knockout mutants of the CRISPR pre-crRNA processing enzyme Cas6 and study the effect of Cbp1 on the formation of primary CRISPR transcripts. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>There are no obvious precedents for this type of transcriptional modulation but there could be a mechanistic link to the eukaryotic THO complex consisting of four protein subunits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>This complex has been implicated in inhibiting formation of aberrant DNA structures during transcription of genes containing repeat sequences which might otherwise impede polymerase progression or lead to increased recombination (40). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>This potential mechanistic similarity also suggests a possible secondary role for Cbp1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Repeat-bound Cbp1 could reduce the likelihood of recombination occurring between CRISPR repeats which might lead to deletions within CRISPR loci that do occur periodically (7,11) and can be induced by vectors carrying matching protospacers (16,41). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>The cbp1 gene is not linked directly to the CRISPR-based gene cassettes in Sulfolobus chromosomes which suggests that it has other cellular functions. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Cbp1 binds specifically to a range of similar repeat sequences associated with different CRISPR loci of Sulfolobus and it is likely that the more conserved repeat sequence at the distal end from the leader provides the main binding specificity (26, our unpublished data). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Our results show that Cbp1 binds more strongly to the most common family I repeats of CRISPR loci C + D that dominate in the Sulfolobales and in other crenarchaea than to the less common family II repeats of loci A + B (11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Given that CRISPR/Cas and Cmr modules have been shown to exchange intercellularly for S. islandicus species (6), Cbp1 could influence which types of CRISPR loci are retained in the cell and also, explain the predominance of the family I repeats amongst the Sulfolobales (11). </plain></SENT>
