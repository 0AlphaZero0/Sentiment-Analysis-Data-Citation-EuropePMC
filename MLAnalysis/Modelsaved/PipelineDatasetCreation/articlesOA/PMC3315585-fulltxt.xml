The temperature in urban areas rises much higher than in surrounding areas, making these areas a so-called heat island. This is largely due to the heat stored in pavement and the concrete of buildings, the heavy use of air conditioners, and the heat emitted by vehicles. Covering buildings with plants is an effective solution to this problem. Besides enhancing aesthetics and improving air quality, green roofs decrease the energy consumption of buildings by reducing the temperature of roof surfaces <xref rid="pone.0033800-Saiz1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>Roof greening should be done accordingly, on a case by case basis. For most buildings that are small, have a low load capacity or have low accessibility, maintenance-free roof greening is desired. Roof greening technology using mosses is increasingly attracting attention, because it requires the least amount of soil, water, fertilizer, and maintenance. In addition, it is also applicable for wall greening. However, the production capacity does not meet the demand due to the slow growth of mosses.</p><p>
<italic>Racomitrium</italic> species are usually found on sunny, well-drained sand or rocks <xref rid="pone.0033800-Iwatsuki1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. As with many mosses, this species is tolerant to extreme desiccation. This trait enables the application of the moss for maintenance-free roof greening. We have succeeded in factory-level production of <italic>R. japonicum</italic>. The moss is grown in a liquid culture (moss dry weight 3.5 kg in a 1000-L tank) that enhances branching of the plant, which is then shaped into carpets and grown in a greenhouse. This results in 2&#8211;3 times faster growth than on sand. Since the liquid culture is not sterilized, however, sometimes the culture becomes unstable, apparently resulting from bacterial invasion. Thus understanding the microbial consortium in the liquid culture is a key to stabilize cultivation of the moss.</p><p>We isolated various microorganisms from liquid culture samples, and showed that they affect moss growth in vitro <xref rid="pone.0033800-Tani1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Because we used a cultivation-dependent technique, however, the analysis did not necessarily reflect the true microbial community structure in the liquid culture. In this paper, we applied a cultivation-independent technique to reveal the microbial community structure in the liquid culture samples, and isolated microorganisms able to promote moss growth, which enhances large-scale moss production as well as crop production.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Sample collection and moss liquid culture condition</title><p>The samples of adult gametophytes and liquid cultures of <italic>R. japonicum</italic> used in this study were the same as previously reported <xref rid="pone.0033800-Tani1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In brief, moss samples collected in Yamagata (fresh weight, 10 g; weight after drying overnight at 80&#176;C, 2 g) were washed 5 times with distilled water to remove soil and inoculated in 4 L of unsterilized liquid culture medium in a 5-L culture bottle. Since the culture medium evaporated during cultivation, medium was added occasionally to fill the flasks to the original volume. Four different culture conditions were used: (A) Hyponex (straight type, N-P-K&#8202;=&#8202;0.1/0.2/0.1, HYPOneX Japan Co., Osaka, Japan) diluted 10,000-fold with tap water; evaporation loss mentioned above was compensated using the same medium, (B) the same as condition A but evaporation loss was compensated with addition of tap water, (C) Hyponex diluted 10,000-fold with distilled water; evaporation loss was compensated using the same medium, (D) the same as condition C but evaporation loss was compensated with addition of distilled water. The pH in all cases was 7.2, and it was maintained with 1 M hydrochloric acid and/or 1 M sodium hydroxide. Air was bubbled into the flask at 3 L/min. The moss was allowed to grow under a continuous photon flux density of 100 &#181;mol/m<sup>2</sup>/s under a fluorescent lamp at 20&#176;C for 8 weeks.

</title><p>Using <italic>P. pastoris</italic> PPY12 (pYA005 and pYA006), we detected methanol emission from gametophytes and protonemata of the moss. As shown in the control experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033800-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), only methanol (YNM)-grown cells emitted fluorescence in their peroxisomes. Yeast cells applied on Y medium without plants did not emit fluorescence, and those on Y+0.5% methanol emitted fluorescence within 1&#8211;5 days. Yeast cells applied onto protonemata exhibited fluorescence for 5 days, with a weaker intensity than on Y+0.5% methanol, and yeast cells applied to gametophytes exhibited stronger YFP signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033800-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>) than those on protonemata. These results suggested that methanol is emitted from both gametophytes and protonemata of <italic>R. japonicum</italic>. Although methanol is considered to be emitted from plant stomata, since methanol is water-soluble and the cuticular surface of plants is hydrophobic <xref rid="pone.0033800-NemecekMarshall1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033800-AbandaNkpwatt1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, detection of methanol was recently reported on epidermal cells of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves <xref rid="pone.0033800-Kawaguchi1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.

Among the isolates, strain 22A showed the greatest effect as quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033800-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>.

These isolates could not grow in isolation on the medium since Y medium contains no carbon source, and methanol supplementation supported their growth (data not shown). Thus it is likely that the plant supplied a carbon source, possibly including methanol, to the isolates. The protonemata of <italic>R. japonicum</italic> rarely develop into gametophytes on agar plate media. Formation of gametophytes was observed when the protonemata were grown on Florialite.

The plants then had to be fixed onto support materials. There are several methods to fix the plants on trays that are later settled on roofs. In this experiment we used vermiculite, Kanuma soil, Yamakusari soil, and lime soil, all of which have good drainage and may have a nutritional effect. We also used plastic net and rock wool, which can fix the plants but have no nutritional effect. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033800-g005">Fig. 5C</xref> shows growth stimulation of gametophytes of <italic>R. japonicum</italic> by application of strain 22A in a field experiment. Since it was difficult to make the plant size uniform prior to the test, the average size before the experiment showed some variation (white bar). In the control experiment (in the absence of strain 22A), vermiculite and lime soil showed good performance in increasing plant size (23&#8211;38% increase). Although it is claimed that mosses require a little nutrient, support on plastic net and rock wool, with no nutrients, led to poor growth. In the strain 22A-treated samples, an increase in plant length was clear. Among the soils tested except for vermiculite, the application of strain 22A significantly increased the growth of the moss compared to the control. Kanuma soil is considered to be a good support material, because of its light weight, low cost, porousness, stability and ease of handling. By using Kanuma soil, strain 22A doubled the moss growth rate, which resulted in reducing the cultivation time by half. This is quite an advantage in cutting the cost and time to produce a moss carpet. We observed, however, moss grown this way is not resistant to strong wind at roof level, and other plant species disseminated by wind-borne seeds tend to grow on the soil. Support materials that can overcome these problems are still needed.</p><p>Here we report a unique methylotroph-predominating community structure in liquid cultures of <italic>R. japonicum</italic>. The moss emits methanol, which is considered to be the main carbon source supplied to the microbes in the liquid culture. We also showed strong plant-growth promotion activity of the isolated <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> species, and the growth-promotion effect was specific to the plant-microbe combination. It is not yet known which biochemical ability of the isolates is crucial for growth promotion. The methanol emission from the moss and growth promotion by <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> species are considered to result from their mutualistic symbiosis <xref rid="pone.0033800-Kutschera2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.
