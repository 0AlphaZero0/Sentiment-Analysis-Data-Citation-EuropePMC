</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>People living in large urban areas in mid- and low latitudes endure high summer temperatures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The temperature in urban areas rises much higher than in surrounding areas, making these areas a so-called heat island. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This is largely due to the heat stored in pavement and the concrete of buildings, the heavy use of air conditioners, and the heat emitted by vehicles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Covering buildings with plants is an effective solution to this problem. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Besides enhancing aesthetics and improving air quality, green roofs decrease the energy consumption of buildings by reducing the temperature of roof surfaces [1]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Roof greening should be done accordingly, on a case by case basis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>For most buildings that are small, have a low load capacity or have low accessibility, maintenance-free roof greening is desired. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Roof greening technology using mosses is increasingly attracting attention, because it requires the least amount of soil, water, fertilizer, and maintenance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In addition, it is also applicable for wall greening. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>However, the production capacity does not meet the demand due to the slow growth of mosses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Racomitrium species are usually found on sunny, well-drained sand or rocks [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>As with many mosses, this species is tolerant to extreme desiccation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>This trait enables the application of the moss for maintenance-free roof greening. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>We have succeeded in factory-level production of R. japonicum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The moss is grown in a liquid culture (moss dry weight 3.5 kg in a 1000-L tank) that enhances branching of the plant, which is then shaped into carpets and grown in a greenhouse. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>This results in 2–3 times faster growth than on sand. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Since the liquid culture is not sterilized, however, sometimes the culture becomes unstable, apparently resulting from bacterial invasion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Thus understanding the microbial consortium in the liquid culture is a key to stabilize cultivation of the moss. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>We isolated various microorganisms from liquid culture samples, and showed that they affect moss growth in vitro [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Because we used a cultivation-dependent technique, however, the analysis did not necessarily reflect the true microbial community structure in the liquid culture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we applied a cultivation-independent technique to reveal the microbial community structure in the liquid culture samples, and isolated microorganisms able to promote moss growth, which enhances large-scale moss production as well as crop production. </plain></SENT>
