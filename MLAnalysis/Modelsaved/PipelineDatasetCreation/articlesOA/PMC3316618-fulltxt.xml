In this report, miR-141 was identified to repress HBV expression by screening a small miRNA expressing library and synthetic miR-141 mimics could also significantly suppress HBV expression and replication in HepG2 cells. Bioinformatic analysis and experiment assays indicate that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA) was the target of hsa-miR-141 during this process. Furthermore, knockdown of PPARA by small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibited HBV replication similar to levels observed for miR-141. Promoter functional analysis indicated that repression of HBV replication by miR-141 mimics or siRNA was mediated by interfering with the HBV promoter functions, consistent with previous studies demonstrating that PPARA regulated HBV gene expression through interactions with HBV promoter regulatory elements. Our results suggest that miR-141 suppressed HBV replication by reducing HBV promoter activities by down-regulating PPARA. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms associated with HBV-host interactions. Furthermore, this information may facilitate the development of novel anti-HBV therapeutic strategies.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Structurally, microRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs with 18&#8211;25 nucleotides in length which are processed from short stem-loop precursors encoded by plant, animal and viral gemomes.

Our primary screening of HBV replication-related miRNAs showed similar results, indicating that a pri-miR-125a expression vector could repress HBsAg synthesis in HepG2 cells. Although miR-125a-5p was shown to repress HBsAg expression by targeting HBV sequences directly, interactions between host cell proteins and miR-125a-5p could not be excluded. On the other hand, Lu <italic>et al.</italic> recently demonstrated that miR-1 enhanced HBV core promoter activity by increasing the expression levels of the farnesoid X receptor alpha (FXRA), an essential HBV cellular transcription factor <xref rid="pone.0034165-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In the present study, exogenous expression of miR-141 could significantly inhibit HBV expression and DNA replication, whereas miR-141 inhibitor transfection had the opposite effects on HBsAg/HBeAg expression. Though the regulation of HBV replication by miR-141 inhibitor is less effective than miR-141 mimics, it is possible due to the relative low expression level of miR-141 in HepG2 cells (Information S1). These data suggest that miR-141 could suppress HBV transcription and replication.</p><p>HBV contains a 3.2 kb partially double-stranded DNA genome with four promoters (the core, pre-S1, pre-S2/S, and X promoters) and two enhancer regions (ENI and ENII) involved in viral transcription regulation <xref rid="pone.0034165-Ganem1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034165-Seeger1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, and transcriptional regulation plays a central role in control of HBV replication <xref rid="pone.0034165-Tang2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. HBV promoter and enhancer activities are regulated by a number of transcription factors <xref rid="pone.0034165-Quasdorff1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. For example, the core promoter, pre-S1 promoter, X promoter, ENI and ENII all contain a PPARA binding site and these regions were found to be transactivated in the presence of RXRA and PPARA <xref rid="pone.0034165-Raney1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Tang and McLachlan also demonstrated that nuclear hormone receptors (NRs), including HNF4, RXRA and PPARA, were essential liver-enriched transcription factors associated with HBV pregenomic RNA synthesis and viral replication in nonhepatic cell lines <xref rid="pone.0034165-Tang1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Since pregenomic RNA encodes both polymerase and core protein (and serves as the template for viral DNA synthesis), it is likely that PPARA plays a critical role in HBV biogenesis.</p><p>The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) that consist of PPAR&#945;, PPAR&#946;, and PPAR&#947; are ligand-activated transcription factors that belong to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily <xref rid="pone.0034165-Kersten1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034165-Chawla1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.

The luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-141 suppressed reporter activity significantly via 3 binding sites in the PPARA 3&#8242;-UTR. PPARA mRNA and protein levels were both reduced by miR-141 mimics transfection. This suggested that miR-141 would be an effective regulator of HBV replication by interfering with PPARA expression. Furthermore, our results showed that PPARA knockdown by miR-141 mimics or siRNA exerted a negative effect on HBV replication and reduced the HBV promoter transcription activities. This was consistent with previous findings regarding PPARA functional activity, suggesting that inhibition of HBV replication by miRNA-141 was mainly mediated via PPARA repression. Therefore, overexpression of miR-141 may be an effective strategy for diminishing HBV replication.</p><p>In conclusion, our data suggested that miR-141 down regulated HBV expression and replication by targeting cellular nuclear factor PPARA, and that PPARA could be a promising host-oriented drug target for the development of novel HBV therapy. Considering the importance and complexity of miRNAs in virus-host regulatory networks, further systematic studies will be necessary to fully unravel the role of miRNAs in viral replication. This would not only increase our knowledge regarding HBV pathogenesis mechanisms but also help in the development of novel antiviral therapeutic approaches.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Reagents</title><p>hsa-miR-141 2&#8242;-O-methyl (2&#8242;-OMe) mimic oligonucleotides, hsa-miR-141 inhibitor, PPARA-specific siRNAs and unrelated sequence negative controls were purchased from Genepharma (Shanghai, China).
