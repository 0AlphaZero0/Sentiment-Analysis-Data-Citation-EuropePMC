</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Structurally, microRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs with 18–25 nucleotides in length which are processed from short stem-loop precursors encoded by plant, animal and viral gemomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The growing miRNA database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mirbase.org">http://www.mirbase.org</ext-link>) currently contains ∼2100 human miRNAs [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Bioinformatic analyses have suggested that miRNAs could regulate a number of genes and each mRNA could also be regulated by several miRNAs [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>It is estimated that more than 30% of human genes are regulated by miRNAs [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>miRNAs have been shown to play significant roles in a variety of physiological processes including organ development, cell differentiation, apoptosis and metabolism by either mediating translational arrest or degrading target transcripts [4]–[6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Recent data has indicated that host miRNAs could be involved in host–virus interactions, and therefore could have a significant impact on the virus life-cycle [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Lecellier et al. [8] demonstrated for the first time that miR-32 possessed antiviral properties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Specifically, miR-32 was shown to inhibit primate foamy virus type 1 (PFV-1) mRNA translation and also restricted virus accumulation in cultured cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In addition, miR-24 and miR-93 were found to target vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and protect mice against VSV infection [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Jopling et al. reported that miR-122 was necessary for hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication by binding of miRNAs to the 5′ end of the viral genome [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>HBV is a strict intracellular pathogen that infects primary hepatocytes and is the prototypic Hepadnaviridae family virus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>HBV must utilize host cellular components and machinery as a means of completing replication and mediating pathogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we hypothesized whether hsa-miRNAs and HBV interactions could affect HBV replication. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>This study screened a hsa-miRNA expression library and identified several miRNAs with the potential of interfering with HBV replication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Among the candidate miRNAs, miR-141 was further analysized by considering its good inhibition rate of HBV replication. Results presented in this report demonstrated that miRNA-141 inhibited HBV replication by reducing the transcriptional ability of HBV promoters by targeting the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Increasing evidence suggests that there are complex interactions between cellular miRNAs and viral genes, suggesting that important regulatory networks exist between the virus, host miRNAs, and their respective target genes [8]–[10], [19]–[21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>In this report, we studied the effects of cellular miRNAs on HBV replication and found that miR-141 possessed antiviral properties. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Recent data suggested that the cellular miRNAs could regulate HBV propagation directly or indirectly by targeting cellular factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Potenza et al. demonstrated that hsa-miR-125a-5p interacted with HBV sequences and repressed HBsAg expression [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>Our primary screening of HBV replication-related miRNAs showed similar results, indicating that a pri-miR-125a expression vector could repress HBsAg synthesis in HepG2 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Although miR-125a-5p was shown to repress HBsAg expression by targeting HBV sequences directly, interactions between host cell proteins and miR-125a-5p could not be excluded. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, Lu et al. recently demonstrated that miR-1 enhanced HBV core promoter activity by increasing the expression levels of the farnesoid X receptor alpha (FXRA), an essential HBV cellular transcription factor [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>In the present study, exogenous expression of miR-141 could significantly inhibit HBV expression and DNA replication, whereas miR-141 inhibitor transfection had the opposite effects on HBsAg/HBeAg expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Though the regulation of HBV replication by miR-141 inhibitor is less effective than miR-141 mimics, it is possible due to the relative low expression level of miR-141 in HepG2 cells (Information S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that miR-141 could suppress HBV transcription and replication. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>HBV contains a 3.2 kb partially double-stranded DNA genome with four promoters (the core, pre-S1, pre-S2/S, and X promoters) and two enhancer regions (ENI and ENII) involved in viral transcription regulation [24], [25], and transcriptional regulation plays a central role in control of HBV replication [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>HBV promoter and enhancer activities are regulated by a number of transcription factors [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>For example, the core promoter, pre-S1 promoter, X promoter, ENI and ENII all contain a PPARA binding site and these regions were found to be transactivated in the presence of RXRA and PPARA [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Tang and McLachlan also demonstrated that nuclear hormone receptors (NRs), including HNF4, RXRA and PPARA, were essential liver-enriched transcription factors associated with HBV pregenomic RNA synthesis and viral replication in nonhepatic cell lines [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Since pregenomic RNA encodes both polymerase and core protein (and serves as the template for viral DNA synthesis), it is likely that PPARA plays a critical role in HBV biogenesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) that consist of PPARα, PPARβ, and PPARγ are ligand-activated transcription factors that belong to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily [28], [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>PPARs serve as lipid metabolism regulators and influence cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis [30], [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>The luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-141 suppressed reporter activity significantly via 3 binding sites in the PPARA 3′-UTR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>PPARA mRNA and protein levels were both reduced by miR-141 mimics transfection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>This suggested that miR-141 would be an effective regulator of HBV replication by interfering with PPARA expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our results showed that PPARA knockdown by miR-141 mimics or siRNA exerted a negative effect on HBV replication and reduced the HBV promoter transcription activities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>This was consistent with previous findings regarding PPARA functional activity, suggesting that inhibition of HBV replication by miRNA-141 was mainly mediated via PPARA repression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Therefore, overexpression of miR-141 may be an effective strategy for diminishing HBV replication. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data suggested that miR-141 down regulated HBV expression and replication by targeting cellular nuclear factor PPARA, and that PPARA could be a promising host-oriented drug target for the development of novel HBV therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Considering the importance and complexity of miRNAs in virus-host regulatory networks, further systematic studies will be necessary to fully unravel the role of miRNAs in viral replication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>This would not only increase our knowledge regarding HBV pathogenesis mechanisms but also help in the development of novel antiviral therapeutic approaches. </plain></SENT>
