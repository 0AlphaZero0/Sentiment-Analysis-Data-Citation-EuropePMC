<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a major mycotoxin in grapes and grape products [1,2,3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>OTA is nephrotoxic, hepatotoxic, genotoxic, teratogenic and immunotoxic to animals and its carcinogenicity in rats and mice is well-established [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It has been associated with the aetiology of Balkan Endemic Nephropathy [5] and the development of tumours in the urinary tract in humans [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The International Agency for Research on Cancer classified OTA as a possible carcinogen to humans (group 2B) [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The contamination of grapes and their by-products by OTA has emerged as a big problem for the health risk related to the consumption of such products by human beings [8,9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The European Union has introduced limits (2 μg L−1) for OTA in wine and grape products in order to minimize exposure to OTA in the diet (EC Regulation No 1881/2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Ochratoxin A is produced during the infection on grapes in vineyards by toxigenic species of black aspergilli belonging to Aspergillus section Nigri, in particular A. niger and A. carbonarius [10,11,12]. A. carbonarius is predominantly responsible for the production of OTA in grapes and wine [2,13,14,15], followed by some isolates of the A. niger aggregate [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In the present study, Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus tubingensis were considered two separate species according to Kusters-van Someren et al. [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Some authors claim the production of OTA by A. japonicus [18], however such ability is still unconfirmed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The percentage of A. niger aggregate isolates able to produce OTA is much lower than the share of A. carbonarius isolates [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The main OTA contamination in grapes and wine was reported in different countries but high levels of OTA were found in southern Europe [18,20], in particular in regions with a Mediterranean climate [21,22,23,24]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>An accurate identification of the species of Aspergillus is of great importance because the toxin profiles of each species vary, and the fungi present limit and define potential toxicological risks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Black aspergilli are difficult to classify and the taxonomy of this section is still unclear [25,26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Various molecular approaches have been proposed, though the taxonomy of Aspergillus section Nigri is not completely resolved, especially within the A. niger aggregate [26,27,28,29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Among the molecular tools proposed, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) has been used successfully to identify Aspergillus species [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Those findings were confirmed by RFLP on genomic DNA with different endonucleases, combined with rDNA hybridization probes [30], by RFLP on mtDNA [31,32], and by RAPD analysis [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Accensi et al. [33] proposed a new PCR-RFLP method to distinguish the A. niger aggregate and identified two types, N (corresponding to A. niger) and T (corresponding to A. tubingensis). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>More recently, a new group of ochratoxigenic strains, closely related to A. tubingensis, has been identified by ITS-RFLP method [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Moreover, some strains belonging to the uniseriate species Aspergillus aculeatus and A. japonicus showed to produce OTA [21], but their PCR-RFLP profile was not able to differentiate the two species. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The first objective was to monitor the population of black aspergilli in Northern Italian vineyards during the year 2006 and 2007, and the second objective was to assess the mycotoxigenicity of all the isolates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The collateral objective of this study was the optimization of a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method to distinguish the five species of Aspergillus present on grapes cultivated in Northern Italy. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>In the present study restriction digestion analysis of the ITS products was tested to assess its effectiveness as a rapid method to identify different species of Aspergillus isolated from grapes comparing with reference strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>The other fungal genera isolated were not considered in the present study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>The ITS-5.8S rDNA fragments of 356 Aspergillus strains isolated from grapes were amplified and their PCR amplicons were digested in order to differentiate the strains using the RFLP technique. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Five different RFLP patterns were identified among the Aspergillus isolates using the endonucleases HhaI, HinfI and RsaI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>By comparing the sequence analysis of the 356 isolates with that of some reference strains, all the isolates showed high similarity (&gt;99%) with one of the five reference species and were considered as isolates of the species A. niger, A. carbonarius, A. tubingensis, A. japonicus, or A. aculeatus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>No other species of Aspergillus were identified during the monitoring. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>In a previous study, Martínez-Culebras and Ramón [34] digested the ITS region of several strains of Aspergillus coming from Spanish grapes with the endonucleases HhaI, NlaIII, and RsaI, and distinguished five different RFLP patterns corresponding to A. niger, A. tubingensis, A. tubingensis-like, A. carbonarius, and A. aculeatus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>They obtained two restriction profiles using endonuclease RsaI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>One profile was specific for A. niger, A. aculeatus and A. carbonarius, and the second profile identified A. tubingensis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained in the present study by using the endonuclease RsaI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Similarly, Accensi et al. [33] described the restriction endonuclease RsaI as a useful tool to separate the isolates of A. niger aggregate into A. niger (corresponding to pattern N) and A. tubingensis (corresponding to pattern T). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>The results of the current study confirmed that the endonuclease RsaI can be used as a target for distinguishing the isolates of A. niger and A. tubingensis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>This classification supports previous RFLP studies suggesting the division of A. niger aggregate into over two species, including A. niger and A. tubingensis [33,34,40]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>The endonuclease HhaI distinguished three profiles [34]: profile A (specific for A. niger, A. tubingensis-like and A. tubingensis), profile B (A. carbonarius), and profile C (A. aculateus). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>The isolates A. tubingensis-like and A. tubingensis were not distinguished with the endonuclease RsaI and HhaI, and an additional endonuclease NlaIII was proposed for the new RFLP type that was called A. tubingensis-like. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>In the present study we could not differentiate the species A. aculeatus and A. japonicus with endonuclease RsaI and HhaI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>An alternative restriction enzyme HinfI was used successfully to distinguish the two uniseriate species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Previously, Parenicová et al. [41] reported that the ITS-5.8S ribosomal region could not be used to distinguish between A. japonicus and A. aculeatus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Anyway, the same authors, by using Southern blotting with hybridization probes on the pyruvate kinase (pkiA), the pectine lyase A (peIA) and the 28S rRNA, found a clear polymorphism between A. japonicus and A. aculeatus [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Similarly, Palencia et al. [42] reported the potential of a barcoding tool based on the rep-PCR, to differentiate between the two Aspergillus species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Our PCR-RFLP method can simply and easily differentiate five species of Aspergillus, including A. japonicus and A. aculeatus, present on grapes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>The phylogenetic analysis based on the 5.8S rRNA gene and the non-coding and variable regions (ITS1 and ITS2) showed that the isolates of five different Aspergillus species coming from Liguria region clustered with the CBS reference strains belonging to the same species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>The isolates of A. tubingensis and A. niger were clearly separated into two distinct groups within the A. niger aggregate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with the work of Martínez-Culebras et al. [41], who recently used the ap-PCR method to distinguish A. tubingensis and A. niger, and with previous studies [14,33,34,40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>More interestingly, the ITS sequences of the two uniseriate species of A. aculeatus and A. japonicus within the Aspergillus section Nigri were separated into two different subgroups by cluster analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Martínez-Culebras et al. [41] reported that the isolates of A. aculeatus and A. japonicus could not be separated by ITS or IGS sequences. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>In our 2-year survey, we monitored the presence of isolates of Aspergillus spp. associated with vineyards grown in Northern Italy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>The absolute dominance of black aspergilli on grapes before harvesting was reported by other surveys in other countries, including Italy [21,23,43], France [44], Argentina [45] and Spain [34,46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>No other species of Aspergillus were isolated and identified in our study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Among the black aspergilli, A. niger was the major species associated with grapes during 2006, while A. carbonarius was the major species during 2007. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>All the cultivars monitored possessed the same species and the same order of dominance over the two year period. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>We considered the average meteorological data of Liguria region (Italy) during the 2006 and 2007 trimesters characterized by grapevine ripening and harvest (July, August and September). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>The average temperatures in July, August and September 2006 were 26.0, 21.5 and 20.2 °C, while the same in 2007 were 22.7, 21.3 and 19.1 °C. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>By considering the rainfall of the trimester, in 2006 the total precipitation reached 546 mm, while it accounted for just 182 mm in 2007. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>The first year was characterized by higher temperatures on an average, especially in July, and three times more precipitation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>These climatic conditions could have influenced the composition of the black aspergilla found in vineyard. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Maximum growth for A. carbonarius occurred at 30 °C, while it occurred at higher temperatures (35 °C) for A. niger [26,47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Also the water activity (aw) could influence the maximum growth that occurred at aw values of 0.965 aw for A. carbonarius and 0.98 for A. niger [48]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>YES medium was chosen as it was previously evaluated as an optimal substrate for the evaluation of OTA production on black aspergilli [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Other studies considered the production of OTA by species of Aspergillus on other substrates, such as CYA (Czapek Yeast Extract agar). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>By a comparison of different Aspergillus isolates grown on YES or CYA, both culture media could be used for evaluating the OTA production [50]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Most of the ochratoxigenic strains were belonging to A. carbonarius in both years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>This result confirmed previous surveys carried out in Italy from 2000 to 2003 showing that A. carbonarius was never the dominant species in any phonological phase of grapevine, but its isolates were the most toxigenic ones in different grape varieties grown in several Italian regions [1,14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained in other European countries where a lower share of A. carbonarius was responsible for most of the OTA contamination [22,34,51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Ochratoxin A was measured during 2006 and 2007 on the wine produced from the grapes monitored, and the level of contamination was generally low, but higher during 2007 (0.15 µg L−1) compared to 2006 (0.09 µg L−1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Within the Aspergillus niger aggregate, no ochratoxigenic isolates of A. niger were detected, but 6 and 5 isolates of A. tubingensis, respectively in 2006 and 2007, were able to produce low amounts of OTA in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>The percentages of isolates of A. tubingensis able to produce OTA were 21.4% and 11.4% in 2006 and 2007. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Our results are in accordance with Medina et al. [52] and Martínez-Culebras and Ramón [34], but another study of Accensi et al. [53] showed that the isolates producing OTA belonged to A. niger, while none of the isolates of A. tubingensis was able to produce OTA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Recently some studies showed that also isolates of A. tubingensis can produce ochratoxin A [27,41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>The geographical origin of the isolates might be a reason for the disagreement in the results reported by different authors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Experimental conditions used in extraction and detection of OTA (culture medium, pH, incubation time and/or temperature) might also lead to different result. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>The ability of uniseriate black aspergilli to produce OTA is a controversial issue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>In our study, 6 isolates of A. japonicus out of 20 were ochratoxigenic, and our result is similar to the results of Battilani et al. [21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>The availability of reliable molecular markers for Aspergillus section Nigri occurring on grapes is of great interest since an early diagnosis of A. carbonarius occurrence in the field would provide very important information on possible OTA contamination in grapes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the identification of a large number of isolates using ITS-RFLP technique enables easy and rapid identification of the Aspergillus isolates from grapes and their assignation to different species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>This kind of information could help to understand the epidemiology and distribution of OTA producing Aspergilli in grapes, where large amounts of isolates should be screened in a short time. </plain></SENT>
