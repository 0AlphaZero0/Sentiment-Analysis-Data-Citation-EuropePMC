<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of CRCs are sporadic cancers that occur in individuals without family histories of CRC or inherited mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, whole-genome expression studies of sporadic CRCs are limited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A recent study used microarray techniques to identify a predictor gene set indicative of susceptibility to early-onset CRC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular mechanisms of the predictor gene set were not fully investigated in the previous study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To understand the functional roles of the predictor gene set, in the present study we applied a subpathway-based statistical model to the microarray data from the previous study and identified mechanisms that are reasonably associated with the predictor gene set. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, significant subpathways belonging to 2 KEGG pathways (focal adhesion; natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity) were found to be involved in the early-onset CRC patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We also showed that the 2 pathways were functionally involved in the predictor gene set using a text-mining technique. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Entry of a single member of the predictor gene set triggered a focal adhesion pathway, which confers anti-apoptosis in the early-onset CRC patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, intensive inspection of the predictor gene set in terms of the 2 pathways suggested that some entries of the predictor gene set were implicated in immunosuppression along with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the early-onset CRC patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In addition, we compared our subpathway-based statistical model with a gene set-based statistical model, MIT Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Our method showed better performance than GSEA in the sense that our method was more consistent with a well-known cancer-related pathway set. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Thus, the biological suggestion generated by our subpathway-based approach seems quite reasonable and warrants a further experimental study on early-onset CRC in terms of dedifferentiation or differentiation, which is underscored in EMT and immunosuppression. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, these diseases account for only 25% of the total number of colorectal cases in the United States in 2010 [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The remaining 75% of cancers are reportedly sporadic colorectal cancers (CRCs) without family histories [2] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancer.gov">www.cancer.gov</ext-link>), for which the mechanism is still not clear [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Hong et al. [3] identified 7 highly upregulated genes (CYR61, EGR1, FOSB, FOS, VIP, UCHL1, KRT24) in early onset sporadic CRC patients that were used as a predictor gene set assessed with a microarray technique. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>For their experiments, normal-appearing mucosa adjacent to tumor was obtained from the CRC patients and normal mucosa was obtained from healthy controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>They also provided a discussion on signaling pathways (MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling, NFAT-immune signaling, hypoxia signaling, insulin signaling, PI3K-AKT signaling, Wnt signaling, G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we further explored the microarray dataset in order to add a potential upstream regulator of some of the enumerated signaling pathways in the early-onset CRC patients assessed in the Hong et al. study [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Specifically, we performed advanced statistical analysis to enhance the molecular understanding of the predictor gene set using text-mining and significant subpathways related to the early-onset CRC cases. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Our approach involves public text-mining [4] using a new statistical model that handles regulation (e.g., inhibition, activation) among biological entries, and performs a permutation test for subpathway identification of a given pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>We first identified statistically significant subpathways related to the early onset CRCs from KEGG pathways [5] with the model, and subsequently used text-mining [4] to confirm literature associations among the predictor gene set and some representative significant subpathways. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Our proposed model suggests that early-onset CRC is involved in subcomponents of the focal adhesion pathway and the natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity pathway in particular hints at the presence of immune cells in the early-onset CRC patients, which implies paracrine communication between immune cells (e.g., NK cells, T cells, NK T cells) and various other cells [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In addition, our result indicates that the previously reported signaling pathways (Wnt, PI3K-AKT, MAPK) [3] are likely cascaded through their upstream focal adhesion kinase (FAK), [7] which belongs to the focal adhesion pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Therefore, FAK [7] may be a valuable therapeutic target candidate for the early-onset CRC predictor gene set diagnosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our text-mining analysis of the 2 pathways along with the predictor gene set implied that some elements of the predictor gene set are involved in cell survival and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [8], [9], [10] through the focal adhesion pathway and immunosuppression [8], [10], [11]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Growth factor signaling, Wnt signaling, and MAPK signaling, which are located in the left part of Figure S3, were activated in the samples from CRC patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>The signals are common driving forces during carcinogenesis [8], [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Apparently normal mucosa in the CRC patients has an intrinsic potential for further transformation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title><text><SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Focal adhesion pathway (hsa04510) </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Figure 3 shows the focal adhesion pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>This result indicates that the bottom part of the pathway is highly involved with the CRC patients, and FAK (PTK2, Table 1) is not only a sink node from its upstream receptors but also a source node toward its downstream signaling transductions (Wnt, PI3K-AKT/PKB, and MAPK signals) for survival. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>PTEN (Table 1) [14], a tumor suppressor and antagonizer of the PI3K-AKT/PKB signaling pathway, was downregulated in the focal adhesion pathway in the analysis of the CRC patients' samples compared with that of the healthy controls' samples. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Hong et al. [3] suggested that the Wnt signaling pathway is involved in CRC patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Our result regarding the focal adhesion pathway (Figure 3) supports the view that GSK-3β (GSK3B, Table 1) regulated by PI3K-AKT/PKB signaling of FAK downstream was downregulated in the CRC patients, and also that β-catenin (CTNNB1, Table 1) was highly expressed by downregulation of the Wnt signaling inhibitor GSK-3β in the CRC patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Upon looking further into the information in Figure S5, we determined that gene expression of various activators and inhibitors related to Wnt signaling activation is consistent with the regulation flows. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Another pathway, MAPK signaling (Figure S4) that was upregulated in the CRC patients is also located downstream of FAK (Figure 3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Since the 3 activated signals (Wnt, PI3K-AKT/PKB, and MAPK signals) are located downstream of FAK belonging to the focal adhesion pathway, FAK [7], [15] may be a therapeutic target for the early-onset CRC predictor gene set diagnosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, because the crucial roles of Wnt, PI3K-AKT/PKB, and MAPK signaling shed light on EMT [9], there has been gradually increasing importance placed on FAK. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, CYR61, which was included in the predictor gene set, is a ligand of ITGB5 (αVβ5 integrin, denoted as ITGB in Figure 3), according to the KEGG BRITE database [5]. Figure 3 shows that CYR61 is one of the far upstream cues that triggers FAK, implying that FAK subsequently activates 3 signals: Wnt, PI3K-AKT/PKB, and MAPK signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Recently, Wnt, PI3K-AKT/PKB, and MAPK signals were shown to be involved in EMT [9], and apparently normal mucosa in CRC patients could undergo phenotypical transformation by these 3 signals via the CYR61-FAK axis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>In other words, some cells in the normal-appearing mucosa in the CRC patients may be close to atypical cells by utilizing EMT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>We will describe the evidence of EMT in terms of gene expression level and explore any possible association between the predictor gene set and EMT in the Discussion. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Another finding relevant to the downstream region of the focal adhesion pathway is that the anti-apoptosis protein c-IAP (BIRC3, Table 1) [16], which is a negative regulator of caspases (e.g., CASP3, CASP8, CASP9), was also upregulated in the CRC patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Thus, we further examined the various downstream c-IAPs (cellular inhibitor of apoptosis) in the focal adhesion pathway, where c-IAPs along with survivin (BIRC5) are also important anti-apoptotic proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Of note, it has also been shown that the c-IAPs and survivin also inhibit downstream caspases of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>We found that the majority of c-IAPs were upregulated in the CRC patients (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Thus, the focal adhesion pathway may confer inhibition of caspase activity upon the tumorigenesis of potential atypical cells in apparently normal mucosa. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>The recent literature [6], [11], [18], [19], [22], [23], [24] has set up a conceptual framework in which interactions between tumor and immunity are thought to help a number of cancer cells escape from immune-raiding by undergoing the following 3 phases in a linear or mixed manner: elimination (immunosurveillance), equilibrium (tumor dormancy), and escape (immunosuppression). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>In particular, cancer cell escape by immunosuppression [6], [8], [11], [19], [25], [26] has been extensively studied, and 2 types of immunosuppressive cells are thought to negatively regulate anti-tumor immune response: regulatory T cells (TReg) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) [8], [11], [27], [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>We discuss below the roles of IFN-γ, other cytokines, and the predictor gene set in terms of these 2 types of immunosuppressive cells in early-onset CRC patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>It has been demonstrated previously that IFN-γ can induce activation and expansion of MDSCs in colon cancer [28], and that activated MDSCs not only inhibit effector T cell activity/proliferation but also induce immunosuppressive CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ TReg cells from CD4+CD25− T cells [6], [11], [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>TReg cells, which also express CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1 on their cell surfaces, positively regulate immunosuppressive cytokines interleukin (IL)-10 and tumor growth factor-beta (TGF-β), which can also induce TReg differentiation [6], [11], [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Since TReg cells are found in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in various cancers [6], [11], [29], the apparently normal mucosa in the CRC patients might have TILs present with immunosuppressive activity. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to identify subpathways in which gene expression agreed with prior regulation information (e.g., activation, inhibition) in KEGG pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>The gene regulation among the entries in KEGG pathways was considered to be prior knowledge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Edge types in KEGG represent regulations between the connected entities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>We simplified the edges into only 2 types: activation and repression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>We also assumed rules for matching an edge type of 2 adjacent entities to their gene expression changes (Figure 1A) [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Given a subpathway, we identified the longest consecutive segment beginning from its leaf node; the segment had to satisfy the assumed rules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>The segment is referred to as a “well-defined subpathway” in terms of gene expression data and prior knowledge (Figure 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Further mathematical representation is also described below detailing how we obtained the well-defined subpathway. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Given a subpathway with the number of nodes (genes) p, the leaf node was set to G1 and the root node to Gp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>The node Gi had its binary representation (bi) of a fold-change (fi) for cancer over control that was obtained from gene expression data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>If fi&gt;1, then bi was +1, otherwise it was −1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>The prior edge type ei between the source node Gi+1 and the sink node Gi was either +1 (activation) or −1 (repression) (Figures 1B and 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>The expression ei×bi×bi+1 should have been equal to 1 if the expression matched with the regulations under the rule. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Again, edge information ei was derived from the prior knowledge from KEGG, and fi and bi were derived from gene expression data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>In summary, the number of nodes (n) of a well-defined subpathway was defined as follows:The function I(·) represents the indicator function and the function R(·) is a penalizing term that prevents probing progression from the leaf node to the root node when prior edge information and expression data did not agree with the rules. Figure 7 shows an example of identification of the well-defined subpathway using the previous equation, given a subpathway. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>In this section, we describe a statistical model to determine significance for the well-defined subpathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>We conceptually divided the well-defined subpathway into 3 components referred to as node score (Fnode), edge score (Fedge), and score for the number of nodes (Fnum), ultimately in order to define a total score (Ftotal) of the well-defined subpathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>We designed Ftotal such that the more differentially expressed genes agreed with the rule (Figure 1A) in the well-defined subpathway, the less Ftotal was equal to. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>Fnode represents the differential expression of the entries, Fedge represents the regulation among the adjacent entries, and Fnum represents length normalization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Fnum, a normalization factor for n (the number of nodes in the well-defined subpathway), is necessary because the longer n was, the less Ftotal was when different well-defined subpathways were compared. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>In the text below, we describe the biological rationale and mathematical representation for the scores. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Before providing further explanation, we must define the terms source node and sink node. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>That is, given edge en−i, the upstream node Gn−(i−1) is called a source node, whereas the downstream node Gn−i is called a sink node (Figure 1A, B). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Typical expression analysis schemes focus only on highly differentially expressed genes under a certain cutoff (e.g., p-value), but it is important to consider that signaling proteins of an activated or repressed pathway involved in phenotype differences might not be changed drastically at the expression-level [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>In other words, employing strict cutoff usage in gene expression data involves difficulties in uncovering signal cascading flows because some entries within the signal cascading flows could be missed under that cutoff. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Fnode does not filter out low differential expression with an arbitrary condition because the p-values of all the entries within the well-defined subpathway are considered.where n is the number of nodes in the well-defined subpathway and p(·) is a p-value of a gene in a two-sample t-test between the cancer and control groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the node score contains both high and low differential expressions without a strict cutoff. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Fedge reflects edge information (e.g., activation, inhibition) between 2 adjacent entries and derives from a joint distribution of activities of a source node and its corresponding sink node. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>The basic idea of Fedge is that, given a source node activity of edge en−i, its corresponding sink node activity is expected to be highly dys-regulated, which indicates a rare event. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Therefore, Fedge follows, by nature, the first-order Markov chain property in which a current event depends only on its predecessor because we assume that Gn−i is only regulated by its direct upstream source node Gn−(i−1) of edge en−i. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>In Figure 1A, we used fold-changes to determine whether the edge information complied with gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>The activities around the edge were thus measured from fold-changes in cancer over control, and the activity was simply transformed into a log2 scale for better normality. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>In other words, log2-transformed fold-changes of the 2 adjacent nodes were used as a measure of edge information, and the joint distribution of a source node and its sink node was calculated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>According to the first-order Markov chain property, we can simply define Fedge as the products of conditional probabilities log2(fn−i)|log2(fn−(i−1)) from i = 1 to n−1 multiplied by a prior Pr(log2(f n)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>The conditional probabilities can be derived from the joint distribution of the pair (log2(fold-change of the source node), log2(fold-change of the sink node)), which is assumed to be a bivariate normal distribution.where n is the number of nodes in the well-defined subpathway. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>To determine the joint distribution of the pair (log2(fold-change of the source node), log2 (fold-change of the sink node)), we extracted all the edges from the KEGG XML files (KGML files) and obtained the source nodes and their corresponding sink nodes from the edges. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>The log2-transformed fold-changes (e.g., a pair (log2 fn −(i−1), log2 fn −i)) of the cancer group over the control group for the pair source node and sink node were obtained from the microarrays.Prior probability (e.g., Pr(log2 fn)) of the log2-transformed fold-change of a gene was assumed to be a univariate normal distribution, which is obtained from the log2-transformed fold-changes of all the entries belonging to the KEGG pathways. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Fnum was derived from a random graph model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>We used an R statistical package library “igraph” [46] to make 1,000 simulated random graphs with the number of nodes set to 200 and the number of edges to 100. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>We reduced the random graphs into all linearly connected paths from roots to leaves, and the distribution of the number of edges for the paths was calculated (Figure S8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Fnum was borrowed from the distribution of the number of edges from the random graphs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, n (the number of connected nodes in the well-defined subpathway) was considered as equal to 1 plus the number of edges in the well-defined subpathway. </plain></SENT>
