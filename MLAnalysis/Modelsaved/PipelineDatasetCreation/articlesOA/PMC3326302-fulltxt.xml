Contrary to the nucleo-cytosolic compartment or bacteria, there is little evidence for non-coding RNAs that play a role as riboregulators of chloroplasts. We mined deep-sequencing datasets to identify short (16&#8211;28&#8201;nt) RNAs in the chloroplast genome and found 50 abundant small RNAs (sRNAs) represented by multiple, in some cases, thousands of sequencing reads, whereas reads are in general absent from the surrounding sequence space. Other than sRNAs representing the most highly abundant mRNAs, tRNAs and rRNAs, most sRNAs are located in non-coding regions and many are found a short distance upstream of start codons. By transcript end mapping we show that the 5&#8242; and 3&#8242; termini of chloroplast RNAs coincide with the ends of sRNAs. Sequences of sRNAs identified in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> are conserved between different angiosperm species and in several cases, we identified putative orthologs in rice deep sequencing datasets. Recently, it was suggested that small chloroplast RNA fragments could result from the protective action of pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins against exonucleases, i.e. footprints of RNA binding proteins. Our data support this scenario on a transcriptome-wide level and suggest that a large number of sRNAs are in fact remnants of PPR protein targets.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p><related-article xlink:href="10.1093/nar/gkr1137" related-article-type="commentary-article" ext-link-type="highwire" id="d34e118"/></p><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In the last decade, small non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) have been shown to act as important regulators of gene expression in a broad variety of organisms. Few studies have addressed the presence of ncRNAs specifically in chloroplasts. A first ncRNA candidate called <italic>sprA</italic> was discovered in tobacco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B1">1</xref>). In the same species, a bulk cloning approach of short RNAs led to the identification of 18 chloroplast ncRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B2">2</xref>). Recently, deep sequencing of the Chinese cabbage (<italic>Brassica rapa</italic> ssp. Chinensis) identified hundreds of chloroplast small RNAs (sRNAs) that mostly corresponded to 5&#8242;-ends of chloroplast tRNAs and 3&#8242;-ends of chloroplast ribosomal RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B3">3</xref>). It is at present unclear, whether any of these chloroplast ncRNAs serve a specific function. Recently, a mode for the biogenesis of chloroplast sRNAs was suggested that implies protection from RNA degradation as a major driving force behind the accumulation of specific RNA fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B4">4</xref>). This proposal was based on current knowledge of a specific class of RNA binding proteins, called pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins. Hundreds of genes for PPR proteins are found in the nuclear genome of higher plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B5">5</xref>). The proteins are almost exclusively targeted to either mitochondria or chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B5">5</xref>). The family has no known counterpart in bacteria, and various members have been shown to be essential for specific RNA processing steps, e.g. RNA editing or RNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B6">6</xref>). Where investigated, PPR proteins display exquisitely specific binding to one or few organellar RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B6">6</xref>). For example, PPR10 was shown to contact &#8764;20&#8201;nt long RNA elements in two independent inter-cistronic spacers (<italic>psaJ&#8211;rpl33</italic>; <italic>atpI&#8211;atpH</italic>) and acts as a road block against exonucleolytic decay both in 5&#8242;-to-3&#8242;, as well as in 3&#8242;-to-5&#8242; direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B4">4</xref>). The exonucleolytic decay is initiated distal to the PPR10 binding site, probably by an endonucleolytic event, e.g. by chloroplast RNaseE. Eventually, RNA degradation leads to complete elimination of the <italic>psaJ&#8211;rpl33</italic> and <italic>atpI&#8211;atpH</italic> mRNAs with the exception of the small &#8764;25&#8201;nt stretch protected by PPR10. Such potential footprints have been found in sRNA databases in cereals, among them those attributed to the PPR proteins CRR2 and PPR10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B7">7</xref>). Moreover, sRNAs cloned in tobacco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B2">2</xref>) and in rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B7">7</xref>) correspond to a site in the <italic>psbH&#8211;petB</italic> intergenic spacers suspected to bind the PPR protein HCF152 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B4">4</xref>). We set out to comprehensively identify sRNAs in the chloroplast transcriptome of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice and evaluate, whether they could indeed be footprints of RNA binding proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Alignment of sRNAs to the chloroplast genome</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> sRNA data from Rajagopalan <italic>et al</italic>.

Such analyses have also been carried out in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> in order to identify nucleo-cytosolic miRNAs. Little attention has so far been paid to sRNAs from mitochondria or chloroplasts that are part of these datasets. We have screened a miRNA deep-sequencing dataset from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> generated by the Bartel group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B8">8</xref>) for small chloroplast RNAs: The four RNA seq libraries were assembled from RNA samples taken from whole seedlings, rosette leaves, flowers and siliques, harvested at 6 days, 4 weeks, 6 weeks and 2 months after planting, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B8">8</xref>). The RNAs were eluted from PAGE gel fragments that represent pools of RNA fragments between 16 and 28&#8201;nt in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B8">8</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr1138/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>). We identified sequences that match the chloroplast genome with 100% identity using the Geneious software package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneious.com">http://www.geneious.com</ext-link>). A sequence is defined as a unique set of identical reads from only a single library. In extreme cases, a sequence can represent hundreds of individual reads, i.e. hundreds of individual sequencing reactions. There are a total of 9750 sequences, which are highly unevenly distributed in the chloroplast genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1138-F1">Figure 1</xref>). Only four protein coding genes exhibited high sequence densities across the entire RNA, two of them known to be highly expressed, namely <italic>psbA</italic> and <italic>rbcL</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1138-F1">Figure 1</xref>). In addition to mRNAs, the abundant chloroplast rRNAs and tRNAs are covered well by sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1138-F1">Figure 1</xref>). For the present analysis, we excluded areas of continuous high sequence density. Instead, we focused on isolated peaks of multiple sequences that stood out over the otherwise low background of sequences in coding regions and intergenic spacers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1138-F1">Figure 1</xref>). We collected only clusters of minimally three sequences, which represent a combined number of at least 10 reads. We defined the core of each sequence cluster as the nucleotides that are found in 50% of all overlapping sequences. By these benchmarks, we found a total of 50 sRNAs with a median representation of 30 reads per sequence peak (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr1138/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>). In the following, we will refer to the core of a sequence cluster as chloroplast sRNA. A special class of sRNAs was identified in the 3&#8242;-regions of several chloroplast mRNAs. These RNAs are predicted to fold into a single stem-loop structure with a predicted free energy lower than &#8722;20&#8201;kcal/mol (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr1138/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>). Their connection with secondary structure elements distinguishes them from sRNAs and suggests a different biogenesis.
<fig id="gkr1138-F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Map of RNA sequencing data onto the chloroplast genome of <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. Individual RNA sequencing reads were extracted from the sRNA data set generated by Rajagopalan <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B8">8</xref>) and aligned with the chloroplast chromosome of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (accession no. NC_000932) using the Geneious software package. Only sequences matching 100% with the genome were considered. The bars below the genome map indicate groups of identical reads from a single library. Thus, several bars can represent identical sequence stretches but are from different RNA seq libraries&#8212;e.g. two identical bars could indicate a cluster of identical reads from the leaf library and the silique library. Note that abundant RNA species are covered across their entire length by sequencing reads like the rRNAs, whereas reads are sparse for most protein coding genes, e.g. for the <italic>psbE</italic> operon. In several cases, e.g. for the rRNA operon, the number of reads piled up at certain genomic positions exceeds the space between two rows of the genome map and are thus cut off. Genes are shown as arrows, with arrow points indicating the 3&#8242;-end of the open reading frame/mature tRNA or rRNA. Filled arrows&#8201;=&#8201;genes for rRNAs or tRNAs; open arrows&#8201;=&#8201;protein-coding genes. Small horizontal arrows denote sRNAs and indicate their 5&#8242;-to-3&#8242; direction.

Few sRNAs were found in intronic sequences (6 of 50, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr1138/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>) and even less antisense to known chloroplast RNA species (3 of 50, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr1138/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>). Of the sRNAs in non-coding regions, 17 are found closer than 50&#8201;nt to the next downstream start codon (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr1138/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>). Their uneven distribution supports a functional significance for sRNAs and argues against them being the result of randomly stable RNA degradation products or spurious mini-transcription units. Their proximity to start codons might indicate a function related to translation. Four of the 17 sRNAs found in proximity of start codons are special in that they are located inside an upstream ORF: a sRNA 43&#8201;nt upstream of the <italic>ndhA</italic> start codon lies within <italic>ndhH</italic>, another is 19&#8201;nt away from the <italic>psbC</italic> start codon within <italic>psbD</italic> and a third 35&#8201;nt upstream from <italic>rpl2</italic> within <italic>rpl23</italic>. The corresponding reading frames of <italic>psbC/psbD</italic> are overlapping by 17&#8201;nt, while <italic>ndhA</italic> and <italic>ndhH</italic> are spaced by 1 bp and <italic>rpl23/rpl2</italic> by 18&#8201;bp. Thus, the peculiar location of these four sRNAs might indicate their role for the downstream ORF of these closely-knit di-cistronic transcripts. Noteworthy, <italic>psbC</italic> possesses an additional promoter serving exclusively its own transcription without an intact upstream <italic>psbC</italic> reading frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B12">12</xref>). This would locate the corresponding sRNAs in a true UTR region even though it encompasses a partial coding sequence. Whether mono-cistronic forms for the other two ORFs with sRNAs in 5&#8242;-adjacent reading frames (<italic>rpl2</italic> and <italic>ndhA</italic>) can also be found is unknown. A fourth sRNA overlaps with the annotated start codon of <italic>ndhB&#8212;</italic>the only such case among all sRNAs identified. However, when comparing alignments of hundreds of <italic>ndhB</italic> genes using the NCBI protein cluster tool, we found a downstream ATG much more conserved than the one annotated as start codon in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/prkview.cgi?result=align&amp;cluster=CHL00049">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/prkview.cgi?result=align&amp;cluster=CHL00049</ext-link>). This suggests that the <italic>ndhB</italic> 5&#8242; sRNA is in fact at position &#8722;45 relative to the true start codon (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1138-F5">Figure 5</xref>D). In sum, sRNAs are highly biased toward non-coding regions and many are found a short distance (&#8764;30&#8211;70&#8201;nt) upstream of start codons.</p></sec><sec><title>A subset of sRNAs is conserved across angiosperms</title><p>If sRNAs are functional and under selection, they should be evolutionarily conserved. We tested this for a number of sRNAs by comparing homologous intergenic regions containing sRNAs <italic>in Arabidopsis</italic>. An example is shown <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1138-F2">Figure 2</xref> with an alignment of the clpP&#8211;rps12 intergenic spacer. Here, a sRNA 3&#8242; of <italic>clpP</italic> and a sRNA 5&#8242; of <italic>rps12</italic> are found. Both regions exhibit conservation exceeding adjacent non-coding regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1138-F2">Figure 2</xref>). However, the degree of conservation differs between the two sRNAs. The <italic>clpP</italic> 3&#8242; sRNA is conserved only in angiosperms, including the GATTTC hexamer and a following triple-A stretch. Additional bases are found in most, but not all angiosperms. The sRNA 5&#8242; to the <italic>rps12</italic> reading frame is conserved even in the moss <italic>P. paten</italic>s and in the fern <italic>A. capillus-veneris</italic> with 10&#8201;nt being identical between all species in the alignment. Such conservation down to Bryophytes was, however found only one more time among the eight sRNAs we prepared alignments for: the sequence of the <italic>psbH&#8211;petB</italic> intergenic spacers shows conservation of a sRNA in all species analyzed with the exception of <italic>A. capillus-veneris</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr1138/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>). In contrast, conservation of sRNAs within angiosperms is more common. Like for the <italic>clpP</italic> 3&#8242; sRNA, sRNAs in the 5&#8242;-region of <italic>atpH</italic> and <italic>petL</italic> also show higher identity values than adjacent sequences (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr1138/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>). This suggests that at least some sRNAs are under selective pressure, i.e. are functional. A second group of sRNAs does not exhibit conservation in the set of species analyzed here. For example, sRNAs in the <italic>atpH&#8211;atpF</italic> intergenic spacer, and sRNAs upstream of <italic>rps15</italic>, <italic>ycf3</italic> and <italic>rps14</italic> do not stand out in conservation relative to the surrounding sequence (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr1138/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>). Thus, there are highly conserved sRNAs, as well as lineage-specific sRNAs.

Sequences pooled from different experiments were aligned with the chloroplast genome and evaluated in the same manner as outlined above for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr1138/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3</ext-link>). Like for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, we found a bias of sRNAs towards intergenic regions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr1138/DC1">supplementary Table S2</ext-link>). In total, we found 18 rice sRNAs in regions for which we also identified sRNAs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr1138/DC1">supplementary Table S1</ext-link>). As an initial test for orthology, we aligned all rice and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> sRNAs (with the exception of stem-loop sRNAs) and calculated a neighbor-joining tree based on percent identity between sRNAs. In this tree, we found 10 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>&#8211;rice pairs of sRNAs that are situated in the same intergenic region (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr1138/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4</ext-link>). The similarity between sRNAs with longer identical sequence stretches are favored by this method, whereas short or interrupted homologies are not found as sequence pairs. We therefore expect that the number of orthologous sRNAs between <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice is higher. Among the pairs identified here, four are in highly conserved regions, namely in the chloroplast inverted repeat (<italic>rrn16</italic>, <italic>rrn23, rps7&#8211;ndhB)</italic> or within the <italic>psbC</italic> reading frame. These four pairs each show either perfect or &gt;95% identity, which is however not different from adjacent sequences and is expected for the inverted repeat region. The remaining six sRNAs are found upstream or downstream (<italic>ndhJ</italic> 3&#8242;) of reading frames and show strong sequence conservation with an average of 84% identical bases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1138-F3">Figure 3</xref>). The 10 adjacent bases upstream and downstream of these sRNAs were on average only 51 and 54% identical, respectively. Evidently, these sRNAs are under selection and can be considered <italic>bona fide</italic> orthologs.

Finally, we screened for sRNAs in a taxon only distantly related to the land plants in focus here, the green algae <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>. Again, we identified a number of sRNAs in deep sequencing datasets that will be presented in detail elsewhere.

In conclusion, selected sRNAs accumulate not only in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, but also in tobacco and in rice, i.e. are conserved in dicot and monocot angiosperms and are <italic>bona fide</italic> orthologs.

We did, however not find more widespread similarities between sRNAs or any sort of consensus.

Therefore, ends in the vicinity of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> sRNAs were mapped by a modified rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) protocol. This included sRNAs in seven randomly chosen intergenic regions, <italic>clpP&#8211;rps12</italic>, <italic>atpH&#8211;atpF</italic>, <italic>cemA&#8211;petA</italic>, <italic>rpl18&#8211;rps20</italic>, <italic>rps7&#8211;ndhB</italic>, <italic>rps15</italic> 5&#8242; and <italic>psaI</italic>&#8211;ycf4. In addition we analyzed the sRNA in the coding region of psbD. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1138-F5">Figure 5</xref>, single PCR-products were obtained for the 5&#8242;- and 3&#8242;-mapping of the <italic>rps15</italic> 5&#8242; sRNA. Clones obtained for these PCR products do end close to the 5&#8242;- and 3&#8242;-end of the sRNA. Similarly, 5&#8242;-ends detected in the <italic>rps7&#8211;ndhB</italic> intergenic region are all found in the immediate vicinity of an sRNA's 5&#8242;-terminus. For the <italic>rps7</italic> 3&#8242;-RACE, two PCR products were obtained and cloned separately. The <italic>rps7/ndhB</italic> inter-cistronic cleavage has been mapped to this area previously by RNase protection assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B13">13</xref>). Clones from the longer PCR product correspond to RNA 3&#8242;-ends coinciding with the sRNA's 3&#8242;-end. The location of this sRNA and its conservation in rice and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> makes it likely that it is caused by the action of CRR2 as has been pointed out previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B4">4</xref>). Clones from the shorter PCR product map to upstream sites at positions 100&#8211;112&#8201;nt relative to the <italic>rps7</italic> stop codon. These latter transcript ends have been described previously as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B13">13</xref>), but do not match one of the sRNAs. For the <italic>psbD&#8211;psbC</italic> sRNA, a single 5&#8242;-RACE PCR product was obtained and again, this identified a transcript terminus in the vicinity of the sRNA's 5&#8242;-end. In contrast, we were unable to obtain a PCR product for the 3&#8242;-end of the <italic>psbD</italic> transcript in this region despite usage of two alternative primers for amplification. The same observation was made for <italic>psbD&#8211;psbC</italic> as described in the accompanying manuscript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B14">14</xref>). This is in congruence with RNA accumulation data that did not detect a <italic>psbD</italic> transcript with a length suggestive of a terminus in the proximity of the <italic>psbD&#8211;psbC</italic> sRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B15">15</xref>). Possibly, degradation of the di-cistronic <italic>psbD/psbC</italic> mRNA from the 3&#8242;-end could be an extremely rare event.

In barley and maize, only a single sRNA was identified that demarks both the 5&#8242;-end of the rps12 mRNA, as well as the 3&#8242;-end of the <italic>clpP</italic> mRNA, thus in perfect accordance with most sRNAs delineating overlapping transcript ends. As noted above, this sRNA is highly conserved in land plants including the moss <italic>P. patens</italic>. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, two sRNAs are found in the same region, with the one closer to <italic>rps12</italic> being orthologous to the conserved barley sRNA. When mapping 5&#8242;-and 3&#8242;-ends of transcripts in this region, we found a correlation of <italic>rps12</italic> 5&#8242;-ends with the downstream sRNA and a correlation of <italic>clpP</italic> 3&#8242;-ends with the upstream sRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1138-F5">Figure 5</xref>D). In contrast, no <italic>clpP</italic> 3&#8242;-ends correspond to the second sRNA nor are there 5&#8242;-ends of rps12 that would map to the upstream end of the sRNA closer to <italic>clpP</italic>. Thus, in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the major ends of the <italic>clpP</italic> and <italic>rps12</italic> transcripts within this intergenic region are generated by independent processes, and likely independent proteins. In any case, <italic>clpP&#8211;rps12</italic> transcript ends correlate well with ends of sRNAs.</p><p>To support these findings statistically, we analyzed the number of mapped mRNA ends that are found in proximity to sRNA ends. For this, we counted how many of the mRNA ends fall into a window of 31&#8201;nt centered on the ends of sRNAs relevant in our RACE experiments. We repeated this analysis with a window of only 7&#8201;nt. Of the total 185 mRNA ends, 142 map within the 31-nt window and still 107 ends within the 7-nt window. Thus, we find a strong correlation of mRNA ends and ends of sRNAs.</p><p>In addition to our own data, there are some interesting overlaps with previously identified transcript ends and the position of sRNAs identified here. Most strikingly, the end of the mature, 5&#8242;-processed <italic>rbcL</italic> mRNA determined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B16">16</xref>) matches exactly the 5&#8242;-end of the sRNA we find in this area. This end depends on the presence of the PPR protein MRL1 that is conserved not only in land plants, but even down to green algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B16">16</xref>). In line with conservation on the protein side, we find a highly similar sRNA in rice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1138-F3">Figure 3</xref>), although we could not detect a sRNA in the 5&#8242;-region of <italic>Chlamydomonas rbcL</italic>. Another PPR protein with a function in RNA stabilization is PGR3, which has recently been shown to bind the 5&#8242;-region of the <italic>petL</italic> and <italic>ndhA</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B17">17</xref>). The sRNA in the <italic>petL</italic> 5&#8242;-region identified here, starts 1&#8201;nt downstream of the transcript's 5&#8242;-end at &#8722;59 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B17">17</xref>) and this region is part of the RNA bound by PGR3 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B17">17</xref>). Similarly, a sRNA found in the 5&#8242;-region of ndhA is located 4&#8201;nt downstream of the mono-cistronic messages&#8217; 5&#8242;-end at &#8722;66 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B17">17</xref>). Again, this region is included in a longer probe bound by PGR3 <italic>in vitro</italic> and has slight similarities with the corresponding 5&#8242;-end of the <italic>petL</italic> mRNA. More mapping experiments demonstrating correspondence between sRNA termini and mRNA termini are described in the accompanying manuscript in this same issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B14">14</xref>).</p><p>In sum, sRNAs co-localize with transcript ends and potential binding sites of PPR proteins.

To determine whether this sRNA accumulates due to protection by HCF152, we have analyzed the accumulation of this sRNA by RNase protection experiments in a null mutant of HCF152 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B18">18</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1138-F6">Figure 6</xref>).

HCF152 and HCF107 are each required for the accumulation of different RNA segments from the <italic>psbB</italic> operon and display comparable phenotypic deviations from wild-type, i.e. seedling lethality and high chlorophyll fluorescence (HCF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B20">20</xref>). The probe used in our RNase Protection assay detects the unprocessed and processed RNAs, as well as the sRNA. The sRNA-precursors are reduced to comparative levels relative to wild-type in both <italic>hcf</italic> mutants analyzed. In contrast, the sRNA was only detected in <italic>hcf107</italic> mutants, but not in <italic>hcf152</italic> mutants. This demonstrates that a PPR protein is specifically responsible for the accumulation of the sRNA harboring its binding site.

The conservation extends to sRNAs found in maize and barley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B14">14</xref>). This is mirrored by the amino acid sequence conservation encountered between PPR proteins of land plants, that is exceptionally high when compared with other large plant protein families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B25">25</xref>). This suggests that sRNAs are selectively constrained because they serve as target sequences for conserved RNA binding proteins like PPR proteins. PPR proteins are known to be conserved between angiosperms and some even down to bryophytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B25">25</xref>). Thus, ancient PPR proteins could be behind the conserved sequences identified here. Next to conserved sRNAs, a large number of lineage-specific sRNAs was found as well. A non-find of a sRNA in one species versus another could of course always be explained by experimental differences, e.g. choice of tissue, age of material, etc. Alternatively, they could be the result of lineage-specific PPR proteins. For example, despite the overall impressive conservation of PPR proteins between angiosperms, there is also a fraction of PPR proteins that seem to be specific to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and are not found in the rice genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B25">25</xref>). Finally, it is also possible that particular PPR proteins are capable of accommodating divergent RNA sequences and thus, would allow for a more freely evolving target sequence despite conservation of the PPR protein.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Support for sRNAs as footprints of PPR proteins comes also from the finding that overlapping chloroplast transcript ends co-localize with ends of sRNAs. Most of the mRNA ends we were able to map correspond to ends of sRNAs. Furthermore, ends of sRNAs map to a number of transcript ends reported previously. Importantly, for several of these ends, functionally-linked RNA binding proteins are known, among them the PPR proteins CRR2, PGR3, MRL1 and of course, PPR10 [and HCF152 as confirmed by Zhelyakova <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B14">14</xref>)]. That this co-localization of PPR binding sites, transcript ends and sRNA ends were a chance event seems unlikely. Particularly striking are cases, where the sRNA's ends co-localize with the overlapping ends of upstream and downstream messages, i.e. in perfect agreement with the model for PPR proteins as bidirectional roadblocks against exonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B21">21</xref>).

From the class of RNA recognition motif (RRM) proteins, the chloroplast ribonucleoprotein CP31A has been implicated in stabilization of the <italic>ndhF</italic> message (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B27">27</xref>) and may be involved in generating the footprint in the 3&#8242;-region of <italic>ndhF</italic> identified here. Identification of minimal binding sites for more of the multitude of chloroplast RNA binding proteins, in particular for PPR proteins, is obviously urgently needed to investigate this.</p></sec><sec><title>Outlook: the use of sRNAs</title><p>If we accept that most sRNAs will be footprints of RBPs, we have to expect that their abundance will change with changes in the abundance of the corresponding proteins. In turn, a change of sRNA abundance will be telling of changes in the stability and translation status of the corresponding mRNA. Indeed, in the deep sequencing dataset on the chloroplast transcriptome of Chinese cabbage, the abundance of selected sRNAs changes in response to heat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1138-B3">3</xref>). It will be exciting to determine sRNA patterns in the future under different conditions and thus link outside signals with chloroplast RBPs and the chloroplast RNA pool. This has the potential to uncover regulatory roles for chloroplast RBPs&#8212;such regulatory functions have been notoriously difficult to nail down so far. Moreover, the question of whether sRNAs are really only footprints or serve a role by themselves is wide open. If sRNAs are really only useless remnants of a degraded 5&#8242;-non-coding region, their accumulation could be detrimental, because they would titrate their cognate RBP away from its real job on the mRNA. So, is each sRNA covered by its cognate RBP? If not, why are they not degraded down to nucleotides? A quantitative understanding of the relation between the abundance of the mRNA, the RBP and the sRNA will be necessary to answer these problems. In the future, overexpression of sRNAs or expression of antisense sRNAs could probe putative roles for sRNAs as modulators of gene expression.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr1138/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online: Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, Supplementary Figures 1&#8211;7 and Supplementary References [9&#8211;11].</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><funding-source>The Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</funding-source> (<funding-source>Emmy-Noether stipend SCHM</funding-source>
