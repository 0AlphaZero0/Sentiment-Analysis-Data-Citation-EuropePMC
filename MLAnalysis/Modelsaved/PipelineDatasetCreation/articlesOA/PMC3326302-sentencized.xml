</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the last decade, small non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) have been shown to act as important regulators of gene expression in a broad variety of organisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Few studies have addressed the presence of ncRNAs specifically in chloroplasts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A first ncRNA candidate called sprA was discovered in tobacco (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the same species, a bulk cloning approach of short RNAs led to the identification of 18 chloroplast ncRNAs (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Recently, deep sequencing of the Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa ssp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Chinensis) identified hundreds of chloroplast small RNAs (sRNAs) that mostly corresponded to 5′-ends of chloroplast tRNAs and 3′-ends of chloroplast ribosomal RNAs (3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It is at present unclear, whether any of these chloroplast ncRNAs serve a specific function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Recently, a mode for the biogenesis of chloroplast sRNAs was suggested that implies protection from RNA degradation as a major driving force behind the accumulation of specific RNA fragments (4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This proposal was based on current knowledge of a specific class of RNA binding proteins, called pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Hundreds of genes for PPR proteins are found in the nuclear genome of higher plants (5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The proteins are almost exclusively targeted to either mitochondria or chloroplasts (5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The family has no known counterpart in bacteria, and various members have been shown to be essential for specific RNA processing steps, e.g. RNA editing or RNA splicing (6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Where investigated, PPR proteins display exquisitely specific binding to one or few organellar RNAs (6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>For example, PPR10 was shown to contact ∼20 nt long RNA elements in two independent inter-cistronic spacers (psaJ–rpl33; atpI–atpH) and acts as a road block against exonucleolytic decay both in 5′-to-3′, as well as in 3′-to-5′ direction (4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The exonucleolytic decay is initiated distal to the PPR10 binding site, probably by an endonucleolytic event, e.g. by chloroplast RNaseE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Eventually, RNA degradation leads to complete elimination of the psaJ–rpl33 and atpI–atpH mRNAs with the exception of the small ∼25 nt stretch protected by PPR10. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Such potential footprints have been found in sRNA databases in cereals, among them those attributed to the PPR proteins CRR2 and PPR10 (4,7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Moreover, sRNAs cloned in tobacco (2) and in rice (7) correspond to a site in the psbH–petB intergenic spacers suspected to bind the PPR protein HCF152 (4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>We set out to comprehensively identify sRNAs in the chloroplast transcriptome of Arabidopsis and rice and evaluate, whether they could indeed be footprints of RNA binding proteins. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>We have screened a miRNA deep-sequencing dataset from Arabidopsis generated by the Bartel group (8) for small chloroplast RNAs: The four RNA seq libraries were assembled from RNA samples taken from whole seedlings, rosette leaves, flowers and siliques, harvested at 6 days, 4 weeks, 6 weeks and 2 months after planting, respectively (8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>The RNAs were eluted from PAGE gel fragments that represent pools of RNA fragments between 16 and 28 nt in length (8) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr1138/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>A sequence is defined as a unique set of identical reads from only a single library. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>In extreme cases, a sequence can represent hundreds of individual reads, i.e. hundreds of individual sequencing reactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>There are a total of 9750 sequences, which are highly unevenly distributed in the chloroplast genome (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Only four protein coding genes exhibited high sequence densities across the entire RNA, two of them known to be highly expressed, namely psbA and rbcL (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>In addition to mRNAs, the abundant chloroplast rRNAs and tRNAs are covered well by sequences (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>For the present analysis, we excluded areas of continuous high sequence density. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Instead, we focused on isolated peaks of multiple sequences that stood out over the otherwise low background of sequences in coding regions and intergenic spacers (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>We collected only clusters of minimally three sequences, which represent a combined number of at least 10 reads. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>We defined the core of each sequence cluster as the nucleotides that are found in 50% of all overlapping sequences. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>sRNAs are not randomly distributed in the chloroplast transcriptome: sRNAs are concentrated in non-coding regions (46 of 50, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr1138/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Few sRNAs were found in intronic sequences (6 of 50, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr1138/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>) and even less antisense to known chloroplast RNA species (3 of 50, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr1138/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Of the sRNAs in non-coding regions, 17 are found closer than 50 nt to the next downstream start codon (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr1138/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Their uneven distribution supports a functional significance for sRNAs and argues against them being the result of randomly stable RNA degradation products or spurious mini-transcription units. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Their proximity to start codons might indicate a function related to translation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Four of the 17 sRNAs found in proximity of start codons are special in that they are located inside an upstream ORF: a sRNA 43 nt upstream of the ndhA start codon lies within ndhH, another is 19 nt away from the psbC start codon within psbD and a third 35 nt upstream from rpl2 within rpl23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>The corresponding reading frames of psbC/psbD are overlapping by 17 nt, while ndhA and ndhH are spaced by 1 bp and rpl23/rpl2 by 18 bp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>Thus, the peculiar location of these four sRNAs might indicate their role for the downstream ORF of these closely-knit di-cistronic transcripts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Noteworthy, psbC possesses an additional promoter serving exclusively its own transcription without an intact upstream psbC reading frame (12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>This would locate the corresponding sRNAs in a true UTR region even though it encompasses a partial coding sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Whether mono-cistronic forms for the other two ORFs with sRNAs in 5′-adjacent reading frames (rpl2 and ndhA) can also be found is unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>A fourth sRNA overlaps with the annotated start codon of ndhB—the only such case among all sRNAs identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>However, when comparing alignments of hundreds of ndhB genes using the NCBI protein cluster tool, we found a downstream ATG much more conserved than the one annotated as start codon in Arabidopsis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/prkview.cgi?result=align&amp;cluster=CHL00049">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/prkview.cgi?result=align&amp;cluster=CHL00049</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the ndhB 5′ sRNA is in fact at position −45 relative to the true start codon (see also Figure 5D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>In sum, sRNAs are highly biased toward non-coding regions and many are found a short distance (∼30–70 nt) upstream of start codons. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>We here identified 50 non-coding short chloroplast RNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>These RNAs are distributed non-randomly in the chloroplast transcriptome and are in particular prevalent in intergenic regions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Our data support the previously-proposed model on protection of short RNA segements by PPR proteins (4,21) The positional bias of sRNAs towards intergenic regions of the chloroplast transcriptome is consistent with the position of RNA binding proteins (RBPs), including PPR proteins that use these regions as points of entry to stabilize and translate mRNAs (22,23).The similarities we find for related sRNA pairs (on average 75%) is similar or higher than base identity values found for genetically identified pairs or triplets of binding sites of individual PPR proteins (Table 2 in 24). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Also, the two target sites of PPR10 upstream of atpH and rpl33 share 75% of all their residues (4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Thus, similarities uncovered here for pairs of sRNAs are within the range of target sequence divergence tolerated by PPR proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>As such, we hypothesize that members of such pairs are protected by the same protein.A number of sRNAs show a striking conservation between Arabidopsis, tobacco, Chinese cabbage and rice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>The conservation extends to sRNAs found in maize and barley (14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>This is mirrored by the amino acid sequence conservation encountered between PPR proteins of land plants, that is exceptionally high when compared with other large plant protein families (25). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>This suggests that sRNAs are selectively constrained because they serve as target sequences for conserved RNA binding proteins like PPR proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>PPR proteins are known to be conserved between angiosperms and some even down to bryophytes (25). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Thus, ancient PPR proteins could be behind the conserved sequences identified here. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Next to conserved sRNAs, a large number of lineage-specific sRNAs was found as well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>A non-find of a sRNA in one species versus another could of course always be explained by experimental differences, e.g. choice of tissue, age of material, etc. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, they could be the result of lineage-specific PPR proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>For example, despite the overall impressive conservation of PPR proteins between angiosperms, there is also a fraction of PPR proteins that seem to be specific to Arabidopsis and are not found in the rice genome (25). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Finally, it is also possible that particular PPR proteins are capable of accommodating divergent RNA sequences and thus, would allow for a more freely evolving target sequence despite conservation of the PPR protein.Support for sRNAs as footprints of PPR proteins comes also from the finding that overlapping chloroplast transcript ends co-localize with ends of sRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Most of the mRNA ends we were able to map correspond to ends of sRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ends of sRNAs map to a number of transcript ends reported previously. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Importantly, for several of these ends, functionally-linked RNA binding proteins are known, among them the PPR proteins CRR2, PGR3, MRL1 and of course, PPR10 [and HCF152 as confirmed by Zhelyakova et al. (14)]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>That this co-localization of PPR binding sites, transcript ends and sRNA ends were a chance event seems unlikely. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Particularly striking are cases, where the sRNA's ends co-localize with the overlapping ends of upstream and downstream messages, i.e. in perfect agreement with the model for PPR proteins as bidirectional roadblocks against exonucleases (4,21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Data presented in the accompanying paper (14) on sRNAs in barley chloroplasts and the interaction of the PPR protein HCF152 with its cognate mRNA extend these previous findings and complement data presented here on Arabidopsis and rice.Finally, we here show that the accumulation of a particular sRNA depends on the presence of its cognate PPR protein, HCF152. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>A similar link was made for the PPR proteins CRP1 and PPR10 in the accompanying paper (14).Most parsimoniously, loss of these PPR proteins eliminates the direct protection of the sRNAs against exonucleases and thus leads to complete sRNA degradation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec><title><text><SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Footprints by RNA binding proteins other than PPR10-like PPR proteins </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>We expect that the number of links between PPR proteins and sRNAs will rise as more PPR proteins will be analyzed biochemically for their exact target location in the chloroplast transcriptome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>Given the large number of PPR proteins in chloroplasts (5), and given the evidence provided here and by Zhelyakova et al. (14), we expect PPR proteins to be involved in the generation of most sRNAs found here. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>However, it cannot be excluded that in a minority of cases, other RNA binding proteins are generating sRNAs as well. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>For instance, the related tetratricopeptide repeat protein HCF107 has been suggested to make contact with the 5′-area of psbH (26), where we found an sRNA conserved between Arabidopsis, rice and Chlamydomonas. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>The transcript's 5′-end was previously mapped to a position 2 nt upstream of this sRNA (20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>Conservation of the sRNA is paralleled by conservation of HCF107, which is orthologous to the Chlamydomonas Mbb1 protein (20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>From the class of RNA recognition motif (RRM) proteins, the chloroplast ribonucleoprotein CP31A has been implicated in stabilization of the ndhF message (27) and may be involved in generating the footprint in the 3′-region of ndhF identified here. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>Identification of minimal binding sites for more of the multitude of chloroplast RNA binding proteins, in particular for PPR proteins, is obviously urgently needed to investigate this. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>Outlook: the use of sRNAs </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>If we accept that most sRNAs will be footprints of RBPs, we have to expect that their abundance will change with changes in the abundance of the corresponding proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>In turn, a change of sRNA abundance will be telling of changes in the stability and translation status of the corresponding mRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>Indeed, in the deep sequencing dataset on the chloroplast transcriptome of Chinese cabbage, the abundance of selected sRNAs changes in response to heat stress (3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>It will be exciting to determine sRNA patterns in the future under different conditions and thus link outside signals with chloroplast RBPs and the chloroplast RNA pool. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>This has the potential to uncover regulatory roles for chloroplast RBPs—such regulatory functions have been notoriously difficult to nail down so far. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the question of whether sRNAs are really only footprints or serve a role by themselves is wide open. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>If sRNAs are really only useless remnants of a degraded 5′-non-coding region, their accumulation could be detrimental, because they would titrate their cognate RBP away from its real job on the mRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="?"><plain>So, is each sRNA covered by its cognate RBP? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="?"><plain>If not, why are they not degraded down to nucleotides? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>A quantitative understanding of the relation between the abundance of the mRNA, the RBP and the sRNA will be necessary to answer these problems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>In the future, overexpression of sRNAs or expression of antisense sRNAs could probe putative roles for sRNAs as modulators of gene expression. </plain></SENT>
