</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major public health problem in many industrialized countries and remains the leading cause of death in most of them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a well-described hormone system that regulates blood pressure and salt/water homeostasis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RAAS dysfunction contributes to functional and structural perturbations that occur in atherosclerosis formation (Farmer and Torre-Amione 2001). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The studies investigating the relation between the RAAS gene polymorphisms and CAD progression are designed either to search for an association between the polymorphisms and the atherosclerosis severity represented by the chosen scale of arterial narrowing (e.g. Gensini, jeopardy, Leaman’s, number of vessels narrowed at least in 50% or 75%), which is the approach we applied, or to evaluate the CAD risk associated with the presence of specific genotype in case-control studies, the approach that prevails. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The most studied and clinically important polymorphism in the angiotensin converting enzyme gene (ACE) is an insertion/deletion (I/D) of a 288 bp Alu repeat sequence within the intron 16 (ACE c.2306-117_404, rs4340). ACE c.2306-117_404 I/D polymorphism has been suggested to be related to approximately 50% of the variability in the ACE levels in the bloodstream, with the highest values present among DD homozygotes (Rigat et al. 1990). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Further, the ACE c.2306-117_404 I/D polymorphism has been widely investigated as a CAD risk factor (Zintzaras et al. 2008; Agerholm-Larsen et al. 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>An association between this polymorphism and the extent of coronary atherosclerosis has been reported for populations ranging from 152 to 1162 participants (Ye et al. 2003; Mendonca et al. 2004; Niemiec et al. 2008a; Hibi et al. 1997), although other studies did not report such an association (Jeunemaitre et al. 1997; Nakauchi et al. 1996; Qiu et al. 2007; Foy et al. 1997; van Geel et al. 2001). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The 1166A&gt;C substitution within the 3‘ untranslated region of the angiotensin II type-1 receptor gene (AGTR1 c.1080*86A&gt;C, rs5186) occurs in a cis-regulatory region recognized by a specific microRNA-155 (miR-155) (Martin et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>For the C allele, the base-pairing complementarity of miR-155 and the AGTR1 transcript is interrupted, thus decreasing the ability of miR-155 to interact with the cis-regulatory site, which results in miR-155 being no longer an attenuator of translation, which further leads to a higher expression of AGTR1 (Martin et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>It has been demonstrated that AGTR1 expression is significantly increased in the CC homozygotes in comparison to AA and AC genotype carriers (Ceolotto et al. 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The AGTR1 c.1080*86A&gt;C polymorphism has been investigated as a CAD risk factor (Xu et al. 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Further, the correlation between the AGTR1 c.1080*86A&gt;C polymorphism and the extension of CAD has been found by some (Nakauchi et al. 1996; Qiu et al. 2007) (study populations of 133 and 130 participants, respectively), but not by all investigators (Gardemann et al. 1998; van Geel et al. 2001; Jeunemaitre et al. 1997) (study populations ranging from 463 to 2244 participants). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The aldosterone synthase gene (CYP11B2) polymorphism (CYP11B2 c.-344C&gt;T, rs1799998) is located within the steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) binding site, thus SF-1 binding capability has been suggested to vary between the alleles, although this hypothesis has not been finally confirmed (White and Rainey 2005) and thus the potential biological functionality needs to be yet determined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, the association between the CYP11B2 c.-344C&gt;T polymorphism and the extent of atherosclerosis in CAD has not been reported; however the CYP11B2 c.-344C&gt;T polymorphism has been related to the severity of atherosclerotic plaque size in the carotid artery (Sharma and Katz 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Previously the relationship between the CYP11B2 c.-344C&gt;T polymorphism and hypertension (Sookoian et al. 2007) has been extensively studied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Also, to date, either the T (Casiglia et al. 2005) or C allele (Tsukada et al. 2002) have been reported to be risk factors in cardiovascular events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>However, a study finding no relation has also been published (Payne et al. 2004). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to examine whether three common RAAS genes polymorphisms: ACE c.2306-117_404 I/D, AGTR1 c.1080*86A&gt;C and CYP11B2 c.-344C&gt;T are associated with the extension of coronary atherosclerosis, represented by the Gensini score, which is a reliable estimate of the severity of coronary artery stenosis (Gensini 1983), in a relatively large cohort of 647 Polish-Caucasian patients undergoing elective coronary angiography. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Investigating a case-control study, Niemiec et al.

<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, Nakauchi et al. (1996) report that among the patients with the AC genotype the number of arteries narrowed by 75% was higher than among those carrying the AA genotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Further, Qiu et al.

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Our results are in agreement with those reported by Freitas et al.

<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>However, Niemiec et al. (2008b) found that the C allele is associated with a higher risk of CAD in patients with hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol level ≥5 mmol/l). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the CYP11B2 c.-344C&gt;T polymorphism has been associated with the progression of atherosclerotic plaque size in the carotid artery (Sharma and Katz 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Our results are in agreement with previous investigations reporting no association between the CYP11B2 c.-344C&gt;T polymorphism and bypass degradation measured by adjusted Gensini score (Ortlepp et al. 2001), stent restenosis (Ryu et al. 2002), caroid IMT (Balkestein et al. 2002; Sarzani et al. 2003) and overall CAD events risk in 2490 healthy men (Payne et al. 2004). </plain></SENT>
