</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Protozoan parasites are major causative agents of global infectious diseases that affect millions of people in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In the absence of effective vaccination strategies, treatment for many of these infections depends on chemotherapy and is reliant on “old” drugs that have often been in use for long periods; were originally developed for other types of disease; give rise to increasing levels of microbial resistance; and often show unacceptable levels of toxicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>There is a pressing need for new therapeutics that can be targeted to the populations that need them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>This work focuses on two groups of diseases: the leishmaniases (caused by species of the kinetoplastid parasite, Leishmania) and malaria (caused by species of the apicomplexan parasite, Plasmodium). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In the case of the leishmaniases (a spectrum of diseases associated with immune dysfunction), there are estimated to be 1.5–2 million new cases each year in 88 countries around the globe, with 350 million people at risk and a disease burden of ∼2.4 million disability-adjusted life years [2], [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Clinical symptoms, ranging from the disfiguring skin lesions of cutaneous leishmaniasis to the often fatal visceral leishmaniasis (VL – predominantly caused by Leishmania donovani) are exacerbated in children and immuno-compromised patients, such as those diagnosed as HIV positive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Pentavalent antimonials have been the first-line treatment for VL since the 1930s but these compounds are toxic, with resistance an increasing problem in the Indian sub-continent [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>While significant progress has been made in the last 10 years, with the approval of lipid formulations of amphotericin B, miltefosine and paromomycin, none of these has been developed by rational design, and resistance may still be a problem. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>There is no effective vaccine available, although vaccination should theoretically be possible against these infections that can “self-heal” in their most benign states. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Thus new strategies for vaccination and chemotherapy, particularly for visceral leishmaniasis (VL), remain an urgent international priority [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Malaria remains one of the most important infectious diseases of the developing world. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>There were an estimated 216 million episodes in 2010, resulting in between 650,000 and 1.2 million deaths, according to two recent reports, with over 90% occurring in Africa [6], [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Although P. falciparum accounts for 75% of malaria cases and most of the deaths, P. vivax is also a significant problem in South East Asia, and South and Central America [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>There is an urgent need to develop new drugs with rapid efficacy, minimal toxicity and low cost to replace chloroquine and pyrimethamine-sulphadoxine (available as Fansidar), which are failing rapidly due to resistance in P. falciparum [9]–[11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The use of artemisinin and its derivatives, such as artesunate or artemether, which have good efficacy but very short half-lives, together with longer acting agents such as amodiaquine or lumefantrine in artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), offers some respite. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>However these drugs are expensive, development of resistance is an ever present possibility, and new effective drugs will be required [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In addition it is important to develop new drugs that also target blood stage sexual forms of the parasite to prevent transmission, particularly of drug resistant parasites [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>At a recent Malaria Forum, the Gates Foundation [14] called for the eradication of malaria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>This goal will realistically only be achieved by supplementing current control methods with the development of vaccines and new drugs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The disease statistics above make a compelling case for accelerated drug development, which should be facilitated by recent rapid progress in genome sequencing and subsequent post-genomic strategies for target identification [12], [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Numerous targets have been assessed, including pyrimidine biosynthesis [16], nucleotide signalling [17], kinase pathways [18] and lipidation [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of prenylation has shown potential to treat malaria and more recently, lipid modification through inhibition of N-myristoylation has shown encouraging progress. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Co–translational myristoylation is catalysed by the monomeric enzyme myristoyl CoA: protein N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) in all eukaryotes and has been shown to be essential for viability in fungi and protozoa, through both genetic studies and by chemical inhibition of Candida albicans NMT [20], [21] and Trypanosoma brucei NMT (Tb NMT) [22], [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Our earlier work on the NMTs of T. brucei (the kinetoplastid causative agent of African sleeping sickness) [24]–[26], L. major [26] (causative agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis) and P. falciparum (Pfal) [27], [28], identified NMT as a suitable candidate for drug development against the diseases caused by these protozoan organisms [29], [30]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>NMT from Tb has already been demonstrated to be a druggable target using small molecules (Figure 1) [22], [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>In addition, NMTs from fungal species e.g. C. albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus have also been long-standing targets within the pharmaceutical industry and several inhibitor series have been reported [20], [21], [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>With the exception of the Searle series, which are peptidomimetics based on the C. albicans Arf protein, all other published NMT inhibitor series were obtained by high-throughput screening. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Despite binding in the same region of their respective NMT, each compound occupies a different sub-region, which supported the case for high-throughput screening as a source of novel NMT inhibitor series. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pntd.0001625.g002"/></fig></SecTag><p><text><SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>The presence of compounds from the legacy Searle and Pfizer fungal NMT programs, within the Pfizer corporate collection, has made screening of the Pfizer file an attractive option for the identification of inhibitors of Plasmodium and Leishmania NMTs [33]–[35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>In this study, we extend the scope of screening to sample the diversity of the entire Pfizer compound file. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Due to time and cost constraints, we decided to limit our primary screening campaign to ∼150,000 compounds from the Pfizer Global Diverse Representative Set [36], against both Pfal NMT and L. donovani (Ldon) NMT since these protozoan NMTs are sufficiently dissimilar at the sequence level to warrant separate screens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Activity of hit compounds would be confirmed in replicated dose-response assays to generate a preliminary SAR for each target. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>All mammalian systems studied to date have been shown to have two NMT genes, nmt1 and nmt2 [37]. HsNMT1 has been shown to be essential for embryonic development in mice, whilst the physiological role of HsNMT2 is currently unknown [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>However, a number of oncogenic proteins are substrates of human NMTs, and certain viruses and bacteria also exploit host NMTs to myristoylate their own proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Consequently, human NMTs have been proposed as targets for the treatment of cancer and viral infections [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>To date, there have been no conclusive reports on the potential toxicity of mammalian NMT inhibition in vivo, but in view of the essential role of NMT in mammalian development, selectivity over human NMTs is desirable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>All hits from this study should therefore be screened in dose–response assays against both human isoforms HsNMT1 &amp; HsNMT2 (Hs1 &amp; Hs2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Hits might also be tested against the NMT from Tb, since activity against multiple protozoan NMTs would be an advantage, provided selectivity over human NMTs could be achieved. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Although an ideal compound would have broad-spectrum activity against the protozoan NMTs but would lack activity against both human NMTs, our analysis suggested that this could difficult to achieve, unless some distinct differences in the binding sites could be exploited. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>We have exploited knowledge of the essential function of NMT in protozoa, and harnessed the strength of the Pfizer compound collection, to initiate a drug discovery program for this target in Plasmodium and Leishmania. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>150,000 compounds were screened against Pfal and Ldon NMTs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Based on initial modelling studies and sequence alignments, we opted to assess the quality of the hits through selectivity assays against both Hs NMT isoforms and against Tb NMT, to assess their potential to deliver broad-spectrum anti-protozoan NMT activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that this objective is unlikely to be successful since we found that selectivity between the protozoan NMTs is readily achievable but that most Pfal NMT inhibitors are equipotent against the human isoforms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Pfal/human NMT selectivity might be a barrier to drug discovery for this target, unless inhibition of mammalian NMTs is shown to have no toxicological effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>However, we discovered two novel series with sufficient selectivity to encourage further medicinal chemistry follow-up. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that some compound series are binding in regions that differ between Pfal and human NMTs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>If these differences can be rationalised, ideally through obtaining co-crystal structures with Plasmodium NMT, even non-selective hits could be of potential value as starting points for medicinal chemistry programs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Despite a lower initial screening hit rate, we found four series of Ldon NMT inhibitors with good to excellent selectivity over all other NMTs in our panel. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>While this result was in line with our predictions for human and Pfal NMTs, the separation of Ldon and Tb activity was unexpected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>This result contrasts with those previously reported for another series of Tb NMT inhibitors, therefore suggesting that all of the series we have identified bind in a different region of the binding pocket [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>This observation will be tested through further structural studies with Leishmania NMT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>It also appears that Ldon NMT is more susceptible to potent inhibition, perhaps an indication that the peptide-binding site is smaller than for the other NMTs in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Based on the results we describe, it is also likely that high throughput screening of the Pfizer file against other NMT orthologues would have yielded further selective series. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>These results underline the benefit of high-throughput screening of a diverse compound collection to discover novel protozoan NMT inhibitors, as an alternative to a “piggy-backing” approach [19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>This early drug discovery collaboration was facilitated by grants from the Wellcome Trust and MRC, which demonstrates the power of such public private partnerships in bringing together the drug discovery expertise of pharmaceutical companies and the detailed target knowledge from academia to accelerate drug discovery for neglected tropical diseases. </plain></SENT>
