</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Vesico-ureteral reflux [VUR (MIM 193000)] is the retrograde passage of urine from the bladder into the upper urinary tract. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>It is one of the most commonly detected congenital anomalies and probably has a conservatively estimated prevalence of 1%. [1], [2] It has a primary and a secondary form: primary VUR is due to an incompetent valve mechanism at the uretero-vesical junction, while secondary VUR is due to a functional or anatomical urethral obstruction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>VUR is a developmental disorder, which may occur in isolation or as part of a Mendelian or other syndrome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The Winter-Baraitser Dysmorphology Database lists 68 syndromes with ‘urinary reflux’. [3] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Although most children grow out of the disorder without serious morbidity, a subset does develop long-term complications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In this group VUR results in renal damage, either as a result of ascending urinary tract infections (reflux nephropathy) or of renal hypo- or dysplasia, which is often associated with VUR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>As such, in these two groups VUR accounts for 7.4 – 9.6% and 8.8 – 13.8%, respectively, of end-stage renal disease in Dutch children. [4] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Clinical observations and the results of many studies support the notion that there is a heterogeneous genetic basis for VUR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The incidence of VUR is increased in first-degree relatives of patients [5]–[7] and there is 80% concordance between monozygotic twins. [8] In a subset of families, the segregation pattern suggests autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance. [9]–[11] Other inheritance patterns, including polygenic, have also been observed. [12]–[14] Linkage studies have revealed different loci linked to VUR, although most loci have not been convincingly replicated. [10], [11], [15]–[19] Work in knock-out mice has confirmed the importance of genetic factors in the etiology of VUR. [20] Evidence for a continuous distribution of anatomic parameters, like the length of the intravesical ureter and the position of ureteric budding from the mesonephric duct, associated with VUR suggests that these parameters are quantitative traits encoded by multiple genes. [20] In common complex diseases, common genetic variants are thought to be part of the genetic disease component. [21], [22] Because of their modest individual effect size, common variants are not detected by a linkage approach. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>To date, no major susceptibility genes have been identified for VUR. [10],[11],[15]–[17],[19],[20],[23] However, since embryonal ectopic ureteric budding has been proposed as a mechanism for the development of VUR, [24], [25] genes involved in this process are considered to be potential candidate genes for VUR susceptibility (see Schedl [60]: figure 3: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v8/n10/fig_tab/nrg2205_F3.html#figure-title">http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v8/n10/fig_tab/nrg2205_F3.html#figure-title</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In particular, ectopic or deficient ureteric budding can lead to a diverse spectrum of phenotypes known as “congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract” or CAKUT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>CAKUT include VUR, hypo-/dysplastic kidneys and duplex collecting systems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Variable combinations of these phenotypes are seen in sibships (both in mice and humans) suggesting that the same genetic variation is causally involved in the whole CAKUT spectrum. [25] For example, defects of the RET (ENSG00000165731) and GDNF (ENSG00000168621) genes have been shown to cause deficient ureteric budding with malformed or absent kidneys. [26], [27] ROBO2 (ENSG00000185008) regulates the expression of GDNF [28] and was shown to be mutated in a small number of VUR/CAKUT patients. [29] Genes involved in the RET/GDNF pathway are obvious functional candidate genes for VUR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Genes involved in syndromal VUR, like EYA1 in Branchiootorenal Syndrome (MIM 113650) and PAX2 in Papillorenal Syndrome (MIM 167409), are often also implicated in the ureteric budding pathway and thus attractive candidate genes as well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Hence, we hypothesize that common variants in genes in the ureteric budding pathway contribute to the genetic susceptibility for primary VUR. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>We describe the first genetic association study in VUR patients, targeted to a large set of candidate genes primarily involved in the ureteric budding pathway. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>A cohort of VUR patients was screened for association with tag SNPs covering 44 candidate genes (Table S1) that are related to ureteric budding function (Schedl [60]: figure 3: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v8/n10/fig_tab/nrg2205_F3.html#figure-title">http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v8/n10/fig_tab/nrg2205_F3.html#figure-title</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>No significant associations were detected in this exploratory, candidate pathway association study in the Dutch population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>The best results of the study show common genetic variants in GREM1, EYA1 and ROBO2 in the subgroup with isolated primary VUR and of genetic variants in EYA1 and UPK3A in the subgroup with duplex collecting systems. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Our study had several limitations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>There was 80% power to detect an effect size of &gt;1.57 (or a protective effect of &lt;0.64). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Either we did not detect a larger (&gt;1.57) effect (20% chance), or effects of genetic variants in ureteric budding genes are more moderate (&lt;1.57) and therefore not significantly detected by our study, or the selected SNPs are not associated with VUR in our cohort. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>The study was designed before it was fully known that the effect sizes of genetic variants in complex diseases are usually lower than 1.6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>But even today this would be a valid study to perform since VUR inheritance patterns most likely range from Mendelian to truely multifactorial, and variants with higher effect sizes are sometimes detected in association studies for complex diseases. [37] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>It was impossible to obtain a control cohort with phenotyped controls; not only would it have been infeasible to perform a renal ultrasound in well over 1000 adults, it would also be pointless, since most VUR patients (i.e. children) grow out of VUR once they become adults. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>We did incorporate the 1% phenocopy rate in our power calculation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, as was discussed by McCarthy et al, [38] in complex diseases with a prevalence of 5% or less, the increase in power gained by increasing the sample size of a population based control cohort is often larger than the increase in power gained by thoroughly phenotyping a smaller set of controls. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>As always, the moment of study design signifies a snapshot of current knowledge, that is swiftly outdated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>This means that some genes that are currently interesting CAKUT genes, like FGFR2, FRS2, [39], [40] [39], [40] ETV4 and ETV5 [41] [41] were not considered for inclusion. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>The null hypothesis (no association of common genetic variants in the genes in the ureteric budding pathway) cannot be discarded based on our results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Hence, our reported findings should be interpreted cautiously and warrant replication in other, preferably larger, cohorts. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Association studies such as this, in common complex diseases, are suited to detecting common genetic variants with modest individual effect sizes. [21], [22] Earlier studies have shown that rare pathogenic mutations in three of these genes cause human urinary tract malformations or syndromes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Mutations and microdeletions of EYA1 cause Branchiootorenal Syndrome (BOR, MIM 113650) [42] and branchiootorenal spectrum disorders. [43] Among other congenital anomalies, BOR is characterized by renal anomalies in 38.2% of mutation carriers. [44] These anomalies typically include renal agenesis, hypoplasia or dysplasia, but VUR is also part of the phenotypic spectrum. [43] ROBO2 was shown to be mutated in a small number of (familial) VUR/CAKUT patients. [23], [29], [45] Mutations in UPK3A are a cause for renal adysplasia, a phenotype within the CAKUT spectrum. [46], [47] Mouse models for all four genes show phenotypes reminiscent of VUR/CAKUT. [23], [48]–[50] It is known from other diseases that different risk variants with diverse effects in the same gene can contribute to both Mendelian (syndromal) and multifactorial phenotypes. [51] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Since VUR, both with and without a duplex collecting system, can occur within the same family, the phenotypes may partly be caused by the same underlying genetic factors, as previously discussed by Kelly et al. [18] For this reason we also included cases with a duplex collecting system in our study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, for the analyses, we also analyzed the two extreme phenotype subgroups (i.e. clear-cut primary VUR cases and cases with a duplex collecting system and VUR) separately. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>In one of the four genes (EYA1), the joint ORs in both groups showed a trend supporting our hypothesis of contribution of common genetic variants to the genetic susceptibility for VUR. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>The subgroup association analysis identified UPK3A as a plausible risk factor for the duplex collecting system phenotype alone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>On sequencing the complete coding region of UPK3A in this subgroup, we identified three inherited amino acid substitutions, which may represent susceptibility alleles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Mutations in UPK3A [46], [47] were not detected in VUR patients so far. [52]–[54] One, albeit weak, association between VUR and a missense polymorphism in UPK3A has been published. [53] Future studies will reveal whether mildly pathogenic mutations and/or common genetic variants in UPK3A contribute to the duplex collecting system subphenotype, or also to VUR, in general. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>The trends in GREM1 and ROBO2 in this study are mainly derived from the clear-cut primary VUR cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in one of the families in which a ROBO2 mutation was previously identified as cause of the phenotype, [23] duplex collecting systems were also part of the phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Our study only had power to detect association in the duplex collecting system subgroup with common variants with a relatively large effect size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>It is therefore possible that a milder effect in this subgroup from variants in ROBO2 remained undetected. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>It appears from the linkage disequilibrium (LD) plots in Figure S1a that the three SNPs in ROBO2 that reached the cut-off for stage two of our study, might represent two independent effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Two SNPs are part of an LD block so the likely risk factor may be a variant anywhere in that block. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>In EYA1 (Figure S1b), all four SNPs are part of the same LD block. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>The SNPs in UPK3A are not in LD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>The SNP (rs1057353) that shows a trend for association with the duplex collecting system phenotype is a non-synonymous coding SNP and part of an LD block, so again the likely causative locus may be anywhere in the block, or we may have picked up an effect of this specific SNP. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>As a by-product of their linkage study Cordell et al. recently performed an association scan for six candidate genes, five of which we also studied in our two cohorts. [19] Two of these genes (ROBO2 and UPK3A) were included in the top results in our Dutch cohort. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>None of the genes were significantly associated with VUR in Cordell et al.’s study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>They also tested their genome-wide linkage SNP set (∼140,000 SNPs) for association with VUR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>The SNPs with the most promising p-values were not located in genes related to the ureteric budding pathway; they were therefore not studied in our cohort. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Other SNPs in genes in the ureteric budding pathway were not reported, but since coverage may not have been adequate, we cannot rule out that these genes play a role in that study. [19] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>SNPs in three genes (TGFB1, GNB3 and VEGFA) were previously shown to be associated with VUR in other populations and therefore included in our study. [31]–[36] Only rs1800469 in TGFB1 showed a marginal trend towards association in our Dutch cases. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Implication of genes involved in the ureteric budding pathway in multifactorial, isolated primary VUR remains to be established. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Based on the large body of evidence from human and mouse studies (see references in Introduction and for Table S1), we believe there is also a role for these genes in the pathogenesis of isolated VUR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Association studies in larger cohorts will elucidate the role of common genetic variants with small effect sizes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, as shown for ROBO2, [23], [45] it may well be that rare as well as common genetic variants explain part of the heritability of VUR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Future targeted sequencing of these and newly identified genes and exome sequencing studies in well-characterized multiplex families as well as sporadic cases may shed light on this alternative hypothesis. [55], [56] It is also possible that common or rare genetic variants in as yet undiscovered genes in this or another pathway will prove to be key players in the development of VUR. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this was the first extensive association study of the ureteric budding pathway in VUR patients and controls and provides no conclusive evidence for association of common variants in genes in the ureteric budding pathway with VUR. </plain></SENT>
