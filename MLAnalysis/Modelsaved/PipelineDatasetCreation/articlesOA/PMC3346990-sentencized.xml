<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nuclear receptors (NRs) constitute a unique family of ligand-modulated transcription factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>NRs mediate cellular response to small lipophilic endogenous and exogenous ligands [1, 2] and are responsible for sensing a number of hormones, including steroid and thyroid hormones, and act as positive and negative regulators of the expression of specific genes [3–5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Therefore, NRs play a central role in many aspects of mammalian development, as well as lipid homeostasis, physiology, and metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>NRs make up one of the most abundant classes of transcriptional regulators in the body and have emerged as promising pharmaceutical targets. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Classically, NRs consist of several functional domains, that is, a variable N-terminal ligand-independent transactivation domain (which often exhibits a constitutive transcription activation function (AF-1)), a highly conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD) that contains two zinc fingers, a hinge domain (a variable linker region), and a multifunctional C-terminal domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the C-terminal domain includes the ligand binding (LBD), the dimerization interface, and the ligand-dependent transactivation domain AF-2 [1, 6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2 for nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 2; MIM number 604630, 601665) is a member of the mammalian NR superfamily, due to the presence of a putative ligand-binding domain (LBD) [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>SHP functions as a corepressor through heterodimeric interaction with a wide array of nuclear receptors and repressing their transcriptional activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>SHP achieves its goal via several members of the NR superfamily that are able to regulate SHP expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>However, SHP is also a unique and atypical NR because it lacks the classical DNA-binding domain (DBD), generally present in other NRs [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The NR0B family of NRs consists of 2 orphan receptors: SHP and DAX-1 (dosage-sensitive sex reversal adrenal hypoplasia congenita (AHC) critical region on the X chromosome, gene 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>DAX1 is a gene whose mutation causes the X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita [9] and is the only family member that lacks a conventional DBD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>DAX-1 (NR0B1) is therefore seen as the closest relative of SHP in the NR superfamily [10–12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Both SHP and DAX-1 appear to be specific to vertebrates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In this respect, no homologous genes have been found in Drosophila melanogaster or Caenorhabditis elegans [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Whereas SHP is different from other conventional NRs both structurally and functionally, it acts as a ligand-regulated receptor in metabolic pathways [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>SHP belongs to the orphan subfamily since there is no known ligand for this receptor, except for some retinoid-related molecules [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>SHP inhibits transcriptional activation by working on several other nuclear receptors, that is, directly modulating the activities of conventional nuclear receptors by acting as an inducible and tissue-specific corepressor [12, 15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The discovery of SHP dates back to 1996 [10]; since then, this orphan NR has been identified as a key transcriptional regulator of signaling pathways [8, 16] involving fundamental biological functions and metabolic processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Such processes include cholesterol, bile acid and fatty acid metabolism, glucose and energy homeostasis, and reproductive biology [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Experiments performed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of the human metaphase chromosome have shown that SHP is found at a single locus on chromosome 1 at position 1p36.1 and consists of two exons and a single intron spanning approximately 1.8 kb with 257 amino acids in humans [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In mice and rats, SHP resides on chromosomes 4 and 5, respectively, both consisting of 260 amino acids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>SHP expression is predominantly observed in the liver [10, 18], but it is also detected at lower levels in other tissues, including the pancreas, spleen, small intestine, colon, gallbladder, kidney, adrenal gland, ovary, lung, brainstem, cerebellum, heart, and thymus (Table 1) [19–21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The genomic structure and human SHP domain structure are depicted in Figure 1 [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>SHP is indeed able to repress the transcriptional activities of its target NRs and transcriptional regulators through two functional Leu-Xaa-Xaa-Leu-Leu- (LXXLL-) like motifs [22–24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Such motifs appear to be essential for the interaction with the (activation function 2) AF-2 domains of several sets of NRs [22, 23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The human SHP is enriched by another 12 amino acids [25–36], and this region between helix 6 and 7 is also involved in the repression of the transactivation of NRs [37]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>About half of all mammalian NRs and several transcriptional coregulators can interact with SHP [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Since SHP lacks DNA-binding domain, it exerts the inhibitory effects through protein-protein interaction [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>SHP expression seems to follow a circadian rhythm in the liver, involving the CLOCK-BMAL1 pathway and suggesting that some of the regulatory functions of SHP and deriving functions must be temporal [19, 20, 38]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Gene expression of SHP is regulated by several factors including NRs, transcription factors, and a number of additional conditions and substances, as extensively reported in Table 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Also, the central role of SHP is clear since this NR is able to act as a coregulator for wide range of targets, namely, NRs/transcription factors/transcriptional coregulators and few different molecules, as depicted in Table 3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>In general, SHP acts as a repressor of the transcriptional activity of the specific interacting partner (via LBD of the partner and NR boxes of SHP) [12, 39–43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>However, it is also demonstrated that SHP is able to upregulate gene transcription, as in the case of PPARα and PPARγ [44–46] and NF-κB [44]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Both N-terminal NR interaction domain and C-terminal domain of SHP are important for repression [47, 48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Overall, the SHP-mediated repression of target transcription factors occurs by at least three distinct transcriptional repression mechanisms (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>A first mechanism involves direct interference with the AF-2 coactivator domain of NRs (competition for coactivator binding, leading to the repression of NR-mediated transcriptional activity). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>This is the case for the inhibition of estrogen receptor α (ERα) and estrogen receptor β (ERβ) [49]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>A second mechanism for the SHP-mediated repression involves the recruitment of corepressors including direct interactions among mammalian homolog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptional corepressor Sin3p (mSin3A), human Brahma (Brm), SWItch/Sucrose NonFermentable (SWI/SNF) complexes leading to the repression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) [50]). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>A third mechanism of inhibition of SHP involves the direct interaction with the surface of NR or transcription factor, resulting in the blockade of DNA binding and the consequent inhibition of its transcriptional activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>This is the case for RAR-RXR heterodimers [10], PXR-RXR binding to DNA by SHP [1], interaction with hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF4), or Jun family of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor complex (JunD) [51, 52]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>All three mechanisms might occur sequentially or alternatively according to type of cells and promoters [12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Clearly, information on factors that increase or decrease SHP expression and that are regulated by SHP is essential for understanding the regulatory effects of this orphan NR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Few years of research have not been enough to identify a true ligand. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, it is suggested that targeting posttranslational modifications of SHP may be an effective therapeutic strategy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Selected groups of genes could be controlled to cure a vast range of metabolic and SHP-related diseases [53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Overall, the huge amount of information on SHP function is currently available, making this NR essential in a number of functions involving cholesterol and bile acid metabolism, lipogenesis, glucose metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, xenobiotic homeostasis/metabolism, and cell cycle. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>In particular, the ability of SHP in interacting with different metabolic signaling pathways including bile acids and lipid homeostasis, fat mass, adipocytes, and obesity will be reviewed here. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec></SecTag><sec id="sec2"><title><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Bile Acids and Lipid Homeostasis </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>The wide ability of SHP to target multiple genes in diverse signaling pathways points to the key role of SHP in various biological processes, including the metabolism of bile salts, glucose, and fatty acids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Both unique structure and functional properties account for the complexity of SHP signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Studies suggest that loss of SHP might positively affect cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis in pathophysiologically relevant conditions [54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Bile acids (BAs) are amphipatic cholesterol metabolites which are synthesized in the liver, secreted into bile, stored in the gallbladder, and secreted postprandially into the duodenum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>BAs are synthesized from cholesterol, and this pathway provides the elimination of excess cholesterol in the body [55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Moreover, BAs should be seen as physiological detergents which, in the small intestine, are essential for the absorption, transport, and distribution of lipophilic molecules, including dietary lipids, steroids, and lipid-soluble vitamins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>In the intestine, BAs undergo extensive metabolism by the intestinal microflora. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>A high efficient system is the enterohepatic circulation of BAs [55, 56], where more than 90–95% of BAs are returned to the liver from the terminal ileum via the portal vein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Thus, the concentration of BAs in serum, liver, and intestine is tightly regulated to prevent damage to enterohepatic tissues due to their strong detergent moiety [57–59]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>The major rate-limiting step in biosynthetic pathway of BAs in humans is initiated by cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the microsomal P450 liver enzyme, to produce two primary BAs, cholic acid, and chenodeoxycholic acid, essential in the overall balance of cholesterol homeostasis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Sterol 12α hydroxylase (CYP8B1) catalyzes the synthesis of cholic acid, a step which determines the cholic acid to CDCA ratio in the bile [60]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Secondary bile acids (deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid) and tertiary bile acids (ursodeoxycholic acid) in humans are produced following intestinal dehydroxylation of primary bile acids by intestinal bacteria [58, 61]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Regulation of BA biosynthesis is highly coordinated and is mediated by key NRs including the orphan receptor, liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH1; NR5A2), the hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α), SHP, and the bile acid receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR; NR1H4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Thus, the activation of FXR initiates a feedback regulatory loop via induction of SHP, which suppresses LRH-1- and HNF4α-dependent expression of the two major pathway enzymes cholesterol 7hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and sterol 12 hydroxylase (CYP8B1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>The BA feedback regulation primarily occurs since BAs act as transcriptional regulators for the expression of the gene encoding CYP7A1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Both cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid function as endogenous ligands for the nuclear bile acid receptor FXR [62]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>FXR expression is high in the intestine and liver, the two sites where BAs reach high concentrations to activate FXR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>The transcription by FXR includes heterodimerization with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) in the cytoplasm, translocation into the nucleus, and binding to DNA response elements in the regulatory regions of target genes [63]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>When the bind of BAs to FXR, SHP transcription is increased [60, 64, 65], this alteration leads to the inhibition of LRH-1 activity or HNF4α on the BA response elements (BAREs) of CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 promoters [64, 65]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>In this scenario, BA synthesis is downregulated by a precise feedback regulatory mechanism, which represents the major pathway under normal physiological conditions [64–66] (Figure 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>LRH1 is also a well-known activator of Shp gene transcription [64, 65], and this step leads to an autoregulatory loop of gene expression by SHP [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>This step also includes the G protein pathway suppressor 2 (GPS2) interacting with FXR, LRH-1, and HNF4α to regulate CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 expression in human hepatocytes [67] (Table 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>A critical role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis for CYP7A1 has been recently advocated in a model of in Cyp7a1-tg mice [68]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>The hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α (HNF1α), which haploinsufficiency causes the Maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3), also appears to modulate SHP expression via the FXR pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>In this respect, HNF1α (−/−) mice displayed a defect in bile acid transport, increased bile acid and liver cholesterol synthesis, and impaired HDL metabolism [69]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>A role for SHP in mediating the recruitment of mSin3A-Swi/Snf to the CYP7A1 promoter, with chromatin remodeling and gene repression, has been described. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>In HepG2 cells, Kemper et al. [50] have shown that bile acid treatment resulted in SHP-mediated recruitment of transcriptional coregulators mSin3A and Swi/Snf complex to the promoter, chromatin remodeling, and gene repression (Table 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>This is an additional mechanism involving transformation of nucleosome conformation for the repression by SHP of genes activated by various NRs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>In line with such results, increased synthesis and accumulation of BAs occurs in SHP (−/−) mice, due to the loss of SHP repression and consequent derepression of the rate-limiting CYP7A1 and cholesterol 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) (the rate-determining enzyme of the alternative but minor BA synthesis pathway) in the biosynthetic pathway [70–72]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Mechanisms independent of the FXR/SHP/LRH pathway might also exist, since BAs feeding to SHP (−/−) mice reduced the levels of CYP7A1 mRNA to similar levels of control mice [70, 71]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Such SHP-independent and alternative pathways include the protein kinase C/Jun N-terminal kinase (PKC/JNK) pathway [73], the FXR/FGFR4 (FGF receptor 4) pathway [57, 74], the cytokine/JNK pathway [75], the pregnane X receptor (PXR) mediated pathway [76], and the JNK/c-Jun signaling pathway [77]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Another study demonstrated, in SHP (−/−) mice on a background of 129 strain, the protection against hypercholesterolemia in three different models: an atherogenic diet, hypothyroidism, and SHP (−/−) mice intercrossed with LDLR (−/−) mice (to generate SHP/LDLR double (−/−) mice in a mixed 129-C57BL/6 background). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>When fed an atherogenic diet, the latter strain was almost completely resistant to diet-mediated increases in triglyceride, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol but had an increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol as compared with LDLR (−/−) mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Such results point to the protection against dyslipidemia following the inhibition of hepatic SHP expression, although no antagonist ligands have yet been identified for SHP [78]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>We have recently examined biliary lipid secretion and cholesterol gallstone formation in male SHP (−/−) and (+/+) mice before and during the feeding of a lithogenic diet for 56 days [79]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Deletion of the Shp gene significantly increased hepatic bile salt synthesis, and doubled the increase of biliary bile salt outputs in SHP (−/−) mice than in (+/+) mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>The intestinal bile acid pool size was significantly greater in SHP (−/−) mice than in (+/+) mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>These increased BAs are efficacious ligands of FXR and can stimulate the expression of intestinal fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15) in mice through the FXR signaling pathway, which is consistent with the expanded bile acid pool size in SHP (−/−) mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>At 14 days on the lithogenic diet, fasting gallbladder volume was significantly larger in SHP (+/+) mice than in (−/−) mice [80]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Indeed, FGF15/19 (mouse and human orthologs, resp.) is another FXR gene target in the intestine and appears to contribute to the fine tuning of bile acid synthesis in the liver. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Thus, a model for FXR-mediated repression of bile acid synthesis should also take into account the bile acid-mediated activation of intestinal FXR and FGF15 in the small intestine (while the FXR-SHP pathway is activated in the liver). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>According to the most plausible view, FGF15 acts as a hormone to signal between intestine and liver. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>The secreted FGF15 by the intestine circulates to the liver, likely through the portal circulation or lymph flow [81], and induces the activation of FGFR4 in the liver. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>As shown in Figure 3, the FGF15/FGFR4 pathway synergizes with SHP in vivo to repress CYP7A1 expression [57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>In humans, a similar mechanism should involve the FGF19. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Of note, activation of FXR transcription in the intestine protected the liver from cholestasis in mice by inducing FGF15 expression and reducing the hepatic pool of BA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>This suggests a potential approach to reverse cholestasis in patients [82]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Hepatic fatty acid homeostasis is also regulated by SHP since regulating these genes involves in fatty acid uptake, synthesis, and export [83–87]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>In a study exploring global gene expression profiling combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in transgenic mice constitutively expressing SHP in the liver, overexpression of SHP in the liver was associated with the depletion of the hepatic bile acid pool and a concomitant accumulation of triglycerides in the liver [84]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>By contrast, fat accumulation induced by a high-cholesterol or high-fat diet is prevented by the deletion of SHP [88, 89]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>The pleiotropic role of SHP can also be found in the case of nonalcoholic liver steatosis since OB/SHP double (−/−) mice (a model of severe obesity and insulin resistance) became resistant to liver steatosis and showed improved insulin sensitivity [86]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>Fat Mass, Adipocytes, and Obesity </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>SHP appears to play a central role in obesity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>Human obesity is considered a polygenic disorder characterized by partly known abnormal molecular mechanisms resulting in increased fat mass, with an imbalance between the energy acquired from nutrients that dissipated as heat (i.e., thermogenesis). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>In this respect, weight stability requires a balance between calories consumed and calories expended [91]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>In adipose tissue depots, two main types of adipocytes exist, that is, brown adipocytes and white adipocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>In several animal species, some adipose tissue sites mainly include brown adipocytes (BATs) and the other contains mainly white adipocytes (WATs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>BAT dissipates chemical energy to produce heat either as a defense against cold [92] or as energy expenditure to compensate food intake [93, 94]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>The unusual function of BAT might be better understood by considering that they share a common origin with myocytes [95, 96], and BAT was indeed considered something in between muscle and adipose tissue [95]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>BAT is deemed as the major site for sympathetic (adrenergic) mediated adaptive thermogenesis; this pathway involves the uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>WAT is mainly implicated in the regulation of lipid storage and catabolism but also in the synthesis and secretion of adipokines [97–100]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>While the percentage of young men with BAT is high, the activity of BAT is reduced in men who are overweight or obese [101]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>Thermogenesis unequivocally exists in both humans and animals, and BAT is the major site of thermogenesis which can be increased by environmental factors (i.e., adaptive thermogenesis). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>In both human and animal species, dietary composition, chronic cold exposure, and exercise may increase thermogenesis [102]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>As far as adipose tissue biology is concerned, SHP seems to play a distinct regulatory function in WAT, as compared with BAT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>A number of experiments have focused on animal models of obesity and subtle molecular changes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>SHP-deficient mice are protected against high-fat-diet-induced obesity [89]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ coactivator-1 (PGC-1) family members are multifunctional transcriptional coregulators. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>PGC-1 acts as a molecular switch in several metabolic pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>In particular, PGC-1α and PGC-1β regulate mitochondrial biogenesis, adaptive thermogenesis, fatty acid and glucose metabolism, fiber-type switching in skeletal muscle, peripheral circadian clock, and development of the heart [103]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>In particular, SHP functions as a negative regulator of energy production in BAT [89] because SHP is a negative regulator of PGC-1α expression in BAT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>In turn, PCG-1α is a coactivator of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) which plays a major role in energy dissipation as heat in multilocular BAT of different animal species and humans [104–106]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>Fat-specific (BAT) SHP-overexpressed transgenic mice had increased body weight and adiposity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Energy metabolism, however, was increased, and BAT cold exposure function was enhanced with activation of thermogenic genes and mitochondrial biogenesis (enhanced β1-AR gene expression and PGC1α). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Compared with wild-type mice on a high-fat diet, SHP overexpression was associated with enhanced diet-induced obesity phenotype with weight gain, increased adiposity, and severe glucose intolerance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>An additional feature of SHP transgenic mice was a decreased diet-induced adaptive thermogenesis, increased intake of food, and decreased physical activity [107]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>This leads to the conclusion that, although expressed at low levels in fat, activation of SHP in adipocytes has a strong effect on weight gain and diet-induced obesity [107]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Moreover, if mechanisms linked to energy metabolism and the development of obesity are considered, SHP has distinct roles in WAT and BAT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>As previously mentioned, while SHP deletion in obese leptin-deficient mice (ob/ob) prevented the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver and improved peripheral insulin sensitivity [86], SHP deletion did not overcome the severe obesity caused by leptin deficiency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>A significant protective effect from obesity by SHP deficiency was likely associated with the low basal level of SHP expressed in fat. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Adipogenesis appears to be influenced by SHP: when SHP was overexpressed in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, cell differentiation was inhibited, as well as the accumulation of neutral lipids within the cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Thus, SHP may act as a molecular switch governing adipogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>In particular, SHP appears to be a potent adipogenic suppressor, and preadipocytes are kept in an undifferentiated state through the inhibition of the adipogenic transcription factors and stimulators [108]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Further studies will address whether the loss of SHP function results in inhibition of lipid accumulation in adipocytes, similar to what is observed in hepatocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>In a future clinical setting, treatment of obesity might also include drugs able to mimic or stimulate the effects of SHP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the Shp gene have also been reported in patients with lipodystrophy carrying four different polymorphisms [109]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>SHP mutations may not be considered a common cause of severe obesity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>A number of important clinical studies have examined this issue (Table 4); however, Hung et al. [110] in UK examined the relationships between genetic variation in SHP and weight at birth, adiposity, and insulin levels in three different populations (the Genetics of Obesity Study) GOOS, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), and the Ely studies). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>In the 329 cases of severe early-onset obesity (GOOS study), two novel and rare missense mutations (R34G and R36G) were identified which might in part contribute to obesity in the probands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, two common polymorphisms, namely, G171A (12% of subjects with higher birth weight) and −195CTGAdel (16% of subjects with lower birth weight) were found. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>In the ALSPAC cohort of 1,079 children, the G171A variant was associated with increased body mass index and waist circumference together with higher insulin secretion 30 minutes after glucose load. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Thus, whereas mutations in the Shp gene cannot be seen as a common cause of severe human obesity, genetic variation in the Shp gene locus may influence birth weight and have effects on body size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>The effect might ultimately involve insulin secretion by the negative regulation between SHP and the hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α (HFN-4α), a transcription factor involved in differentiation and function of pancreatic β-cells [110]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>A possibility is that decreased SHP expression or function results in increased HFN-4α activity with a cascade of events, including fetal hyperinsulinemia, and increased birth weight. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>At a later stage, sustained hyperinsulinemia might be responsible of insulin resistance and obesity of the adult [110]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the Shp gene were also associated with influence on birth weight, mild obesity, and insulin levels in the study by Nishigori et al. on 274 Japanese subjects [111]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Mutations in several genes encoding transcription factors of the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) cascade are associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>MODY is a monogenic form of early-onset diabetes mellitus (defective insulin secretion with normal body weight), and SHP is deemed as a plausible candidate MODY gene; this is because SHP is able to inhibit the transcriptional activity of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α (HFN-4α), a key member of the MODY regulatory network. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Thus, further studies have looked for segregation of SHP mutations with MODY in a cohort of Japanese patients with early-onset diabetes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>In this context, variants in SHP appeared to cosegregate with increased body mass index in families, thus contributing to obesity among Japanese subjects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Also, increased risk of morbidity was observed in another study from Japan, examining patients with type 2 diabetes and SHP mutations [112]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Major differences, however, might exist in the prevalence and function of SHP variants in different populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Of note, the results from other Caucasian cohorts did not confirm the association between SHP mutation and obesity [113, 114]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Echwald et al. conducted an elegant study on the prevalence of SHP variants by single-strand conformational polymorphism and heteroduplex analysis among 750 Danish obese men with early-onset obesity [114]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>As control, a cohort of 795 nonobese control subjects was genotyped using PCR-RFLP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Functional analyses of the identified coding region variants were performed in both MIN6-m9 and HepG2 cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Five novel variants were identified (including 3 missense variants (c.100C&gt;G [p.R34G], c.278G&gt;A [p.G93D], and c.415C&gt;A [p.P139H]) and 2 silent variants (c.65C&gt;T [p.Y22Y] and c.339G&gt;A [p.P113P])). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>The previously reported [111] c.512G&gt;C [p.G171A] common polymorphism was identified; however, the prevalence of functional SHP variants associated with obesity was considerably lower among Danish subjects (1 out of 750 obese, none of control subjects), compared to the prevalence observed in Japan by Nishigori et al. [111]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Mitchell at al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>[113] investigated SHP variants in 1927 UK subjects according to type 2 diabetes, obesity, and birth weight. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Although reporting a raised body mass index among homozygous carriers of the 171A variant (&lt;1%), this polymorphism was unlikely to be associated with all three conditions in Caucasians. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the above-mentioned studies suggest that the 171A variant might contribute only to subsets of polygenic obesity. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Other Functions of SHP </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>The existence of multiple interactions of SHP with NRs, transcription factors and transcriptional cofactors (Tables 2 and 3) points to the pleiotropic and central role of SHP in the body. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>SHP has been hypothesized to act in glucose homeostasis via complex pathways involving the inhibition of glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in mammalian cells and the inhibition of PGC-1 gene, a coactivator of NRs important for gluconeogenic gene expression and the PGC-1-regulated phospho(enol)pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) promoter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Such steps underscore a physiologically relevant role for SHP in modulating hepatic glucocorticoid action [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Following the bile acid-induced induction, SHP inhibited a number of other pathways, including the HNF4α-mediated transactivation of the PEPCK and fructose biphosphate (FBP) promoters, as well as the transactivation of the glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) promoter mediated by Foxo1 [115]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>The interaction between SHP inhibitory function and the 3 isoforms (α, β, and γ) of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-3 (HNF4) points to the regulatory role of SHP on gluconeogenesis [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>A role for SHP in insulin secretion pathway has also been reported. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF-1α) is associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>This condition depends on impaired insulin secretory response in pancreatic beta cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Indeed, loss of HNF-1α function in HNF-1α (−/−) mice resulted in altered expression of genes involved in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, but also insulin synthesis, and beta-cell differentiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Pancreatic islets of HNF-1α (−/−) mice showed a distinctive reduction of SHP expression and a downregulation of the HNF4α gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Since SHP appears to repress its own transcriptional activation following heterodimerization with HNF4α, a feedback autoregulatory loop between SHP and HNF4α has been hypothesized [116]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Also, SHP likely functions as a negative regulator of pancreatic islet insulin secretion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>SHP (−/−) mice were characterized by hypoinsulinemia, increased glucose-dependent response of islets, increased peripheral insulin sensitivity, and increased glycogen stores [117]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>The role played by SHP in the regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis has also emerged in a number of additional experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>For example, the liver of SHP (−/−) mice showed increased glycogen stores [117], while hepatic Shp gene expression (induced by the antidiabetic biguanide drug metformin) was associated with inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Induction of SHP was achieved via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and associated with downregulation of essential gluconeogenic enzyme genes, that is, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) [118], and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1) [119]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>PGC-1 gene is a coactivator of NRs, and this step is relevant for gluconeogenic gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Yamagata et al. [119] showed that bile acid (chenodeoxycholic acid) was able to induce the downregulation of PGC-1 gene, and this mechanism involved forkhead transcription factors (Foxo1, Foxo3a, Foxo4) via a SHP-dependent manner. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Drug metabolism and detoxification might be regulated by SHP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>This is also the case for excess BAs: the pregnane X receptor (PXR) induces CYP3A and inhibits CYP7α, both involved in biochemical pathways leading to the conversion of cholesterol into primary BAs, whereas CYP3A is also involved in the detoxification of toxic secondary bile acid derivatives. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>SHP acts as a potent repressor of PXR transactivation, and this finding suggests that PXR can act on both bile acid synthesis and elimination detoxification [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Additional mechanisms involved in the SHP-dependent control of pathways of drug metabolism have been identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>The expression of genes involved with the metabolism of xenobiotics might be regulated by SHP in the spleen acting on (aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)/AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT)) AHR/ARNT heterodimers which, in turn, bind to xenobiotic response elements (XREs) at the level of specific DNA sequences [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>A number of genes involved in hormone and drug metabolism would be expressed (i.e., UGT16, ALDH3, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, etc.). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>SHP also appears to downregulate the constitutive-androstane-receptor- (CAR-) mediated CYP2B1 gene expression, induced by phenobarbital to form the CAR/RXR heterodimer which, in turn, binds to 2 DR-4 sites to form the phenobarbital responsive unit in the CYP2B gene [120] (Table 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>One role of SHP in steroidogenesis has been identified in the testes with influence on testosterone synthesis and germ cell differentiation [121] and in the intestine for glucocorticoid synthesis [122]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>A role for SHP in cell proliferation and apoptosis signaling is emerging. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Depending on the cell type, SHP seems to have both inhibitory and stimulatory effects on apoptosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>However, the manipulation of SHP through the synthetic ligands adamantyl-substituted retinoid-related (ARR) compounds 6-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl]-2-naphthalenecarboxylic acid (CD437/AHPN) and 4-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl]-3-chlorocinnamic acid (3-Cl-AHPC) induces apoptosis of a number of malignant cells (i.e., leukemia and breast carcinoma) both in vitro and in vivo [123, 124]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>The complex mechanism implies binding of ARR and 3-Cl-AHPC to SHP with formation of a corepressor complex containing Sin3A and nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR) which activate local control of mitochondrial function and apoptosis, with a limiting function on tumorigenesis [17, 123] (Table 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>SHP appears to be also involved in DNA methylation and acting as a tumor suppressor, at least in the human and mouse livers [125–127]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Whether manipulation of SHP will be helpful in the treatment of hepatic and other gastrointestinal cancers is still a matter of research. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>SHP appears to negatively regulate the expression of genes encoding inflammatory molecules. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Conclusions and Perspectives </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>A remarkable number of metabolic functions in the body appear to be regulated by the orphan unique NR, small heterodimer partner SHP, which targets a complex set of genes in multiple pathways as a transcriptional corepressor (Figure 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Pathways include fatty acid metabolism, glucose homeostasis, and drug-hormone detoxification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>When looking at complex mechanisms leading to some important lipidopathies, that is, obesity and liver steatosis, enlightening data about the regulatory function of SHP are provided by studies using Shp-deleted and Shp-overexpressed animal models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Most likely, a condition of Shp deficiency might counteract lipid accumulation and improve plasma lipoprotein profiles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Further studies are urgently needed to confirm that such an important metabolic regulatory mechanism of SHP is true and has high translational value. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>To date, however, no synthetic antagonists or agonists for SHP are available, and one should keep in mind that rather divergent and somewhat elusive data have been observed regarding the loss of SHP function in humans and rodents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Thus, careful examination of subtle SHP intrinsic functions is essential to dissect potential modulatory pathways of SHP for a variety of metabolic abnormalities but also in tumorigenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Moreover, identifying specific endogenous ligands and synthetic agonists of SHP will pave the way to for therapeutic intervention. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>The effect of synthetic ligands on SHP modulation in hepatocytes and adipocytes, for example, might represent therapeutic tools for the treatment of constituents of the metabolic syndrome, namely, hypercholesterolemia, overweight obesity, and liver steatosis. </plain></SENT>
