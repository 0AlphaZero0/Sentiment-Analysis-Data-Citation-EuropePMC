<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The data had been statistically processed earlier [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Another immediate task of this study was to identify SNP coordinates by comparing all readings mapped to a distinct genome region (SNP calling). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>SNP calling was carried out separately for GAII and SOLiD data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The allele number was 1, 824, 006 and 410, 383 SNPs, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The data from SOLiD were converted from the colorspace to FASTQ and combined with those from GAII, followed by the repetition of SNP calling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The total number of SNPs (2, 921, 724) exceeds the sum of SNPs identified in separate analyses of the data from each platform. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>This is indicative of the mutual supplementation of these two datasets in the coverage of genome regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>A comparison of allele coordinates and values was performed with the following genomes: Craig Venter [10], James Watson [11], and Huanming Yang [12], as well as genomes of a Korean [13], an African [14], and a European (CEU Trio Father NA12891 from the 1000 genomes project). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>The data are shown in Table 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive datasheet of coordinates and allele values of SNPs is shown on the site http://www.russiangenome.ru/. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>The figure summarizes the number of common and unique SNPs found in patient N’s genome and the genomes of other individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>We found no correlation between the resemblance of one or two equal SNP alleles (see Table 1, rows “one allele is the same” and “both alleles are the same”) and the distance between the nominal habitat of the corresponding person and Moscow, which is taken as the nominal habitat of Russians (Venter and Watson are considered Western Europeans). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>However, the Principal component analysis arranged individuals in accordance with the distance between their birthplaces (data not shown). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>No. in GenBank: NC_012920) [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these reads, an RCS was constructed and published at http://www.russiangenome.ru/. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>The mean coverage of the mitochondrial genome was 291. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>A comparison of this RCS with the reference one has shown that the mitochondrial genome of patient N belongs to the U5a haplogroup (Table 2), one of the most common in European Russia. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>The coincidence of the SNP allele rs2534636 of patient N with the ancestral allele confirms the haplogroup R1a1, because this polymorphism is considered to be a result of back mutation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>All collected contigs exceeding 100 nucleotides were divided into two groups: those giving an unequivocal search result in the BLAST program (Table 4) and those requiring additional analysis (see general statistics in Table 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>The nucleotide sequences obtained using the SOLiD platform were insignificant both in amount and summary length. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>In all likelihood, this is because of the impropriety of short 25-nucleotide sequences for the reconstruction of complex genomic texts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Among the contigs collected using the GAII sequencer, the most interesting are the regions with no homology with reference human genomes, as well as those strikingly similar to genomes of primates (which have a slight difference). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>We can (with some degree of probability) attribute the first group of sequences to possible errors in assembling de novo by ABySS; however, the second group of sequences apparently cannot be the assembling errors and are characteristic of patient N. </plain></SENT>
