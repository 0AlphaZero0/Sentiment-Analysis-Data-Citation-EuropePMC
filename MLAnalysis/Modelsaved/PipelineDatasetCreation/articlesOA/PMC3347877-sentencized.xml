</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are commonly found in cerebral T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of elderly people. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>They seem to be particularly common in depression [1] and dementia [2, 3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Etiologically, they have been associated with classic cardiovascular risk factors [2], including hypertension [4], and thus are considered to be a marker of cerebrovascular disease. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In previous studies of elderly people, the severity of WMH has been found to predict worsening of voiding, mobility and cognition [5], as well as incident depression and depressive symptoms [6, 7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The volume of WMH was associated with incident depression in a study of non-institutionalised elderly people [7], and severe deep white matter lesions predicted poor outcome in elderly patients with major depressive disorder [8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In subjects with dementia, frontal white matter lesions have been found to be associated with higher depression scores in cross-sectional studies [3, 9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>However, a subsequent study failed to identify an association between WMH and psychiatric or other clinical variables in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), using a visual scale [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Thus, the implications of WMH with regard to incidence and prognosis of depression in subjects with mild dementia are still unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>This is unfortunate, since depression is common in dementia [11], and is associated with poorer outcome in terms of cognitive ability [12], functioning [13], and quality of life [14]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to explore the relationship between WMH and the longitudinal course of depressive symptoms in patients with mild dementia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that prevalence, incidence and prognosis of depressive symptoms are related to the volume of WMH and frontal deep WMH in particular. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Such knowledge might enable a more accurate prognosis, but also increase our understanding of the underlying aetiologies of depression in dementia, and, most importantly, provide a strategy for potential prevention and treatment of depression in dementia. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>We have previously [15] reported that depression is more common in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) compared to AD, and that WMH are more severe in mild AD and DLB patients than in non-demented elderly, using a novel semi-automatic volumetric analysis technique (Ketil Oppedal, Alzheimer's Association International Conference 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>A secondary aim was, therefore, to explore the association between volumetrically assessed WMH and depression in patients with Lewy body dementia (LBD) and AD separately. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>From April 2007, we selectively recruited patients with DLB and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Additionally, three neurology outpatient clinics in the same area were contacted, and agreed to refer new dementia cases to one of the participating centres. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The patients and caregivers were first seen by the study clinician, who performed a structured clinical interview of demographic and clinical data. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>MADRS [22] is a clinical interview with 10 items, each scored from 0 to 6, and was completed by an experienced licensed geriatrician or psychiatrist, after a training procedure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Raters met biannually to ensure similar administration of the instruments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>A cutoff score of ≥7 was used to detect at least mild depression [23], and a cutoff of ≥15 for clinically significant depression [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>MADRS has been found to provide a good measure of depression relatively independent from dementia severity [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>A history of clinically relevant (i.e. needing therapy) depression was asked for in the interview. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Depression was assessed at baseline and at a follow-up evaluation 1 year later. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Based on the MADRS cutoff scores, depression status was classified as never depressed, incident depression, persistent depression or recovered. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>To explore the regional distribution of WMH throughout the brain, a region of interest (ROI) template in standard MNI space was used (Montreal Neurological Institute, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca">http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>This ROI template was transformed from MNI space to the image space (FLAIR) of each subject by use of the normalization routines in SPM5, and the volumes of WMH in each ROI were calculated. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>A threshold level of 1.2 was chosen, since it gave an overestimation of the lesion load in every subject. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>The main finding of this study was that the volume ratios of WMH were positively and independently correlated with depression at baseline. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the results suggest that having higher WMH volume ratios at baseline may be associated with a higher risk of having depression or an unfavourable course of depression at the 1-year follow-up. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="sec2_13"><title><text><SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Interpretation </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>The results of our study are consistent with some previous studies [3, 9], and similar findings have been reported also in non-demented elderly [7, 34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>However, other studies did not find such a relationship, although this was based on a combination of psychiatric symptoms rather than a specific measure of depression [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Thus, our findings support the hypothesis that WMH predispose elderly individuals, with or without dementia, to developing depression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>One possible mechanism is disruption of fibre tracts connecting cortical and subcortical structures involved in the regulation of mood [1]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>However, our hypothesis that the prognosis of depressive symptoms in persons with mild dementia is related to the volume of WMH, and frontal deep WMH in particular, was less robustly supported. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>One partial explanation could be the rather low total number of patients, and consequently a low number of patients having clinically significant depression in our study, resulting in limited possibilities for multivariable statistical analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Moreover, cerebrovascular disease is a chronic condition that may exert its major influence early in the course of dementia, and other factors, intrinsic and extrinsic, could be more important determinants of the course of depression at later stages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>These factors may include neurotransmitter changes [35], inflammation [36], physical comorbidity [37], environmental factors [38], treatment [39], and disability [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Of note, we recently found that worsening of depressive symptoms was associated with a more rapid cognitive decline, suggesting that the degenerative changes at this stage of the disease are the key determinants of depression in people with early AD and LBD [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Finally, the less-than-robust support for our hypothesis might be related to longitudinal changes in depression in elderly patients with dementia [40]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>The observed trend towards a differential relationship between WMH and depression in AD versus LBD is most likely due to differences in statistical power, due to the small number of LBD patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>We did, somewhat surprisingly, find almost no correlations or associations between Scheltens scores and depression variables. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>This is in contrast to findings in a previous study [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Notably, this previous study included persons with more advanced dementia (mean MMSE scores of 13.6–18.2) than our study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>This discrepancy could also be due to visual scoring methods, e.g. the Scheltens scale, being less sensitive than volumetric methods [41], despite the high correlations between the results of these methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Unlike volumetric methods, visual rating scales, such as the Scheltens scale, display ceiling effects and poor discrimination of absolute lesion volumes [41]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="sec2_14"><title><text><SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Strengths and Limitations </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Strengths of this study include the longitudinal design and the quantitative method for measuring WMH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Limitations include the relatively low number of cases, which limits the statistical power of the study, particularly for the LBD group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our sample was recruited from secondary care outpatient clinics, and may therefore not be representative of the general population with mild dementia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Thus, the generalisability of our findings may be limited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>The change in depression was relatively small, probably due to the relatively short study period, which also limits the statistical power to detect associations with the longitudinal course of depression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>A longer observation period might have increased the likelihood of finding an association between WMH and the course of depression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Another possible limitation is that depression was assessed using scale scores rather than using a structured psychiatric interview and diagnoses based on standardised criteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis in the majority of cases was clinical, and thus misdiagnosis cannot be excluded. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>However, standardised and validated scales were used, also to support the diagnosis of DLB, where the clinical diagnosis was confirmed in all 7 patients who came to autopsy [Dag Aarsland, pers. commun., 2011]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>We combined patients with DLB and PDD into one LBD group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Although the two syndromes differ in the temporal sequence of symptoms and in the relative severity of cortical amyloid pathology, we consider them sufficiently similar to be combined in a study of WMH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients were followed longitudinally, which also is likely to increase diagnostic accuracy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>We used two different measures of depression, one observer-based (MADRS) and one carer-based (NPId). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Stronger associations with WMH were found for MADRS, suggesting that this is a more sensitive measure of depression in mild dementia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Finally, since this was a naturalistic study, we could not control for possible treatment changes during the study period, which might influence the course of depression and thus mask a possible relationship between WMH and the course of depression. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="sec2_15"><title><text><SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Clinical Implications and Future Research </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>One implication of our findings is that prevention or reduction of WMH, if possible, could lessen the burden of depression and depressive symptoms in persons with mild dementia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>This might be accomplished by means of therapies directed against established risk factors for stroke and WMH, such as hypertension and diabetes [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Such preventive measures, which would at least have several other positive health effects, should probably be initiated in midlife [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>The importance of such potentially preventive strategies is increased in light of recent studies suggesting that antidepressants may not be effective for depressed patients with dementia [44]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Further studies of the mechanisms that determine the course of depression in people with mild dementia are clearly called for. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>These studies should be sufficiently powered and of longer duration, as well as including patients with non-AD dementias such as LBD and vascular dementia. </plain></SENT>
