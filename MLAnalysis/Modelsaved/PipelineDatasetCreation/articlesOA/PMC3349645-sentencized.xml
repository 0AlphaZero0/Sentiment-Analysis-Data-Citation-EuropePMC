<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the present study, EBV genome contained in a primary NPC tumor biopsy was amplified by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), and sequenced using next-generation (Illumina) and conventional dideoxy-DNA sequencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The EBV genome, designated HKNPC1 (Genbank accession number JQ009376) is a type 1 EBV of approximately 171.5 kb. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The virus appears to be a uniform strain in line with accepted monoclonal nature of EBV in NPC but is heterogeneous at 172 nucleotide positions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic analysis with the four published EBV strains, B95-8, AG876, GD1, and GD2, indicated HKNPC1 was more closely related to the Chinese NPC patient-derived strains, GD1 and GD2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>HKNPC1 contains 1,589 single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and 132 insertions or deletions (indels) in comparison to the reference EBV sequence (accession number NC007605). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When compared to AG876, a strain derived from Ghanaian Burkitt's lymphoma, we found 322 SNVs, of which 76 were non-synonymous SNVs and were shared amongst the Chinese GD1, GD2 and HKNPC1 isolates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We observed 88 non-synonymous SNVs shared only by HKNPC1 and GD2, the only other NPC tumor-derived strain reported thus far. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Non-synonymous SNVs were mainly found in the latent, tegument and glycoprotein genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The same point mutations were found in glycoprotein (BLLF1 and BALF4) genes of GD1, GD2 and HKNPC1 strains and might affect cell type specific binding. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous human gammaherpesvirus infecting more than 90% of the world's population and is associated with both non-malignant disease, such as infectious mononucleosis, as well as malignant diseases, such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), endemic Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, B- and T-cell lymphomas and rare cases of gastric carcinoma [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The EBV genome comprises approximately 170 kb and contains at least 86 open reading frames. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The virus genome contains a long unique region interspersed by four major internal repeats (IR1 to IR4) and terminal repeats (TR). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Nine latent proteins including Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1), EBNA2, EBNA3A, -3B, -3C, EBNA-LP and latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) and LMP2A, -2B are encoded by genes situated in the unique region of the genome [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Other open reading frames encode capsid proteins, transcription factors as well as lytic proteins of various functions [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In addition to protein-coding genes, EBV genome also encodes non-coding EBV RNAs, such as Epstein-Barr virus–encoded small RNA 1 (EBER1) and 2 (EBER2), BART-derived microRNAs (miRNAs-BARTs) and BHRF1 microRNAs (miRNAs-BHRF1) [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Four complete or partial EBV genomes, B95-8, AG876, GD1 and GD2, have been reported. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The prototypic EBV strain B95-8 is the first complete genome sequenced and was derived from an individual with infectious mononucleosis [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>A more representative type 1 EBV reference genome (Genbank accession: NC_007605) was constructed using B95-8 as the backbone while an 11-kb deleted segment was provided by Raji sequences [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>AG876 originated from a Ghanaian case of Burkitt's lymphoma and is the only complete type 2 EBV sequence available to date [7], [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>GD1 and GD2 are EBV genomes derived from NPC patients from the Guangdong province of southern China. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>GD1 was isolated from saliva of a NPC patient [9], while GD2 was isolated from an NPC tumor [10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The consistent association of undifferentiated NPC with EBV implies that EBV plays a causal role in NPC development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Type 1 &amp; 2 EBV have long been observed to display a characteristic geographical prevalence [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the incidence of NPC has a remarkable geographical pattern, as it is much more frequent in Southeast Asia, North Africa, and Alaska than in the rest of the world [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The concordance of geographical distribution of EBV strains and the endemic incidence of NPC have prompted studies to investigate whether distinct strains of EBV might contribute to disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>EBV strains have previously been characterized in NPC tumors using strain-specific markers in the EBER1 and -2, LMP1, BHRF1, BZLF1 and EBNA1 loci in samples from China, south Asia, and northern Africa [13]–[18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>These genes were chosen either because they are expressed in NPC, or they play an important role in the EBV infectious cycle. LMP1 deletions and point mutations were suggested to be associated with lymphoproliferative diseases [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The frequent association of an LMP1 deletion variant Asp335 with NPC in Hong Kong was also reported [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Similarly, evidence supports a role for selection of a del-LMP1 over the wt-LMP1 variants in NK/T-cell lymphoma in the same Hong Kong population [21]; a specific EBNA1 subtype (V-val), also showed preferential occurrence in NPC biopsies [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>These observations support the notion of pathogenic strains in NPC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>However, functional assays on seven LMP1 variants failed to show differences in vitro transformation assays or in observed signaling properties [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Despite these results, the continued predominance of China 1, an LMP1 variant observed in NPC tumor over other strains found in circulation [24] argued for the selection of contributory strains in tumorigenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Genetic variations in the small subsets of genes investigated thus far are not sufficient for unequivocal identification of all but a small number of EBV strains to assess their geographical distribution and precise association to disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>There is an unmet need for further whole genome sequencing analysis of EBV. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>GD1 was the EBV genome sequenced from saliva of a NPC patient using PCR amplification and sub-cloning followed by conventional dideoxy-based DNA sequencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>GD2 was the first EBV sequence determined by the so termed next-generation sequencing technology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Using the Illumina (Solexa) platform, the sequence of the GD2 genome was recently obtained from random shotgun sequencing and assembly of total DNA sequences derived from the primary NPC tumor [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>However, sequencing total cellular &amp; viral DNA in a sample is costly and inefficient due to the relatively small quantity of viral DNA present in the tumor sample, thereby limiting the generation of the high read depth necessary to make high confident base calls of the viral genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>One way in dealing with the problem is to use target enrichment technology to increase the relative amount of viral DNA [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Here we reported another approach of PCR enrichment (Amplicon Sequencing) followed by sequencing the amplified products on the Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx platform to determine the genome sequence of an EBV isolate from NPC tumor of a Chinese patient in Hong Kong. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>The EBV genome sequence was assembled with reference to wild type EBV and designated as HKNPC1 (Genbank accession number JQ009376). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic analysis was performed on HKNPC1 and the four EBV strains available in Genbank. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>We compared the distribution of synonymous and non-synonymous base differences in the four EBV strains and assessed their potential roles in pathogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Although geographic variations may account for many mutations detected, we identify a glycoprotein SNV as potential marker of epithelial viral strains, and mutations in Cp and Qp latent promoters to which may contribute to latent gene expression pattern in NPC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>We also identify variations in EBNA3B epitopes, which may alter CD8+ T cell recognition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Future elucidation of additional EBV genomes in NPC tumors and local wild type EBV strains is warranted to provide further insights relating geographical distribution to disease. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The non-repetitive regions of the HKNPC1 genome, represented by 60 overlapping amplicons, were generated using pairs of PCR primers targeting previously recognized regions of sequence conservation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>A total of 3,417,075 sequence reads of 76-base pair-end reads were generated resulting in 260 Mb of sequence data from the combined pool of amplicons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Sequence read that passed default quality control filters on the Illumina platform were aligned to EBV reference genome (accession number NC007605) sequence followed by BLAST procedure against nucleotide database to determine the sequence identity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>91.99% (3,143,389) of the reads can be mapped to the reference genome indicating the high specificity of the amplicon generation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>The aligned sequence covered 99.98% of the expected amplified regions of the EBV genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Only base positions with a read depth of at least 5 reads were used to tabulate the consensus sequence of HKNPC1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Enrichment of EBV sequence by PCR before Illumina DNA sequencing enabled a high average read depth of 1,688-fold across the targeted region with approximately 52% of the PCR-amplified regions of HKNPC1 having greater than 1,000-fold read depth coverage (Table 1, Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>We attempted to validate ambiguous positions with insufficient read depth (less than 5 reads) by dideoxy-based DNA sequencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>However, 153 nucleotide positions remained unvalidated and were marked as N in the genome sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>One copy of internal repeat 1 (IR1) and one copy of terminal repeat (TR) were sequenced by conventional dideoxy-based sequencing, whilst the copy numbers of IR1 and TR of reference EBV genome were adopted in our assembly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>The gaps in 3′ flanking region of IR-1, IR-2, and IR-4 (reference EBV coordinates 35,273–36,132; 38,194–40,615; and 139,950–143,125, respectively) were also represented by tracts of Ns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the present study represents a useful high-resolution draft comprising all the known coding and regulatory sequences but has not resolved all the repetitive regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>The HKNPC1 draft genome is approximately 171,549 bp with GC-content of 59.5%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>It was annotated using the information derived from the reference EBV sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>The high sequence depth allowed us to assess genetic heterogeneity within our isolate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>A position was defined to be homogeneous if the variant frequency is &gt; = 95% and a position to be heterogeneous if the variant frequency is between 20% and 94%, both homogenous and heterogeneous positions require read depth to be 5 or above While we could not completely rule out artifactual sequence alterations that might occur during amplicon generation or during Illumina sequencing, we identified a total of 172 potential heterogeneous nucleotide positions in HKNPC, of which 143 were located in repeat sequences throughout the genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>The remaining 29 heterogeneity positions were distributed within the coding sequences of the latent genes EBNA1, -2, -3A, and LMP1; the tegument protein genes, BPLF1, BOLF1 and BGLF1; other genes such as BVLF1, BFLF2 and BFRF3; and within the intergenic regions (Table S1). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Genotyping studies to date have focused on different regions of EBV, making comparisons across studies difficult, and limiting our ability to define the full spectrum of diversity within the EBV genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Many studies aimed to identify NPC-specific strains focused only on a limited number of genes expressed in NPC, predominantly EBNA1, LMP1, LMP2A, BZLF1, miR-BART, and EBER1 and -2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>We extended our analysis across other regions of the genome and identified a host of SNVs shared among the three NPC-associated strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>By only considering mutations common in HKNPC1, GD1 and GD2, false positives caused by sequencing errors can be minimized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Since it is known that latent genes are polymorphic, it is not surprisingly that we observed a concentration of non-synonymous SNVs among latent genes in our study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>We also observe a significant number of SNVs in the genes encoding the tegument proteins and the glycoproteins. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Studies of EBV's role in NPC pathogenesis were mainly restricted to genes expressed in NPC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>The role of other EBV life cycle genes in NPC has not been well studied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>One question related to the EBV infectious cycle is whether there is preferential entry of certain EBV strains into epithelial cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Such a mechanism may involve membrane glycoproteins, which are responsible for cell type specific binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>The GD2 and HKNPC1 strains were of epithelial origin, while B95-8 and AG876 were from Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that GD1 was not directly harvested from epithelial tissue of an NPC patient, it is reasonable to assume that GD1 is also an epithelial strain released from lymphoepithelial organ (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, e.g., tonsils) into saliva. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Non-synonymous mutations in glycoprotein genes BLLF1 (79,265 C&gt;G) and BALF4 (157,568 C&gt;T) were found common in HKNPC1, GD1 and GD2. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>However, the functional consequences of these mutations are not known. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the sequences of NPC-derived EBV genomes with those of lymphoid-derived EBV genomes of the same individuals or individuals of the same population may contribute to our understanding of the significance of these mutations. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Of interest, computer-based analysis suggested these non-immunogenic variant epitopes were under positive selection by the immune system [30]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, both mutations were found to be more prevalent in EBV strains harbored in NPC tumors than in peripheral blood mononuclear cells [32]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>We observed a number of heterogeneous nucleotide positions in HKNPC1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>The majority of these positions were found in different repeat regions of the EBV genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>These heterogeneous nucleotide positions could be caused by polymerase slippage in sequencing or arise during amplicon generation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>With our high sequencing depth, it is also possible that some of the observed sequence heterogeneity was contributed by low numbers of infiltrating lymphocytes in undifferentiated NPC or by actual heterogeneity of the viral population within the tumor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, low number of heterogeneous positions observed is consistent with the current view of monoclonal origin of EBV in NPC The possibility of a low level of spontaneous mutations occurring during the course of clonal expansion should be further investigated. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the present amplicon-based sequencing approach yielded mappable reads of more than 90%, thereby greatly increasing the efficiency and economy of next-generation sequencing technology. </plain></SENT>
