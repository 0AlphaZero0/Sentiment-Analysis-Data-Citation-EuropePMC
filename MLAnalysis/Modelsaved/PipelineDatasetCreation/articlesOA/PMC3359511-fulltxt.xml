In this work, we present the molecular analysis of two full-length cDNAs that encode asparagine synthetase in maritime pine (<italic>Pinus pinaster</italic> Ait.), <italic>PpAS1</italic>, and <italic>PpAS2</italic>. Phylogenetic analyses of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that both genes are class II AS, suggesting an ancient origin of these genes in plants. A comparative study of <italic>PpAS1</italic> and <italic>PpAS2</italic> gene expression profiles showed that <italic>PpAS1</italic> gene is highly regulated by developmental and environmental factors, while <italic>PpAS2</italic> is expressed constitutively. To determine the molecular mechanisms underpinning the differential expression of <italic>PpAS1</italic>, the promoter region of the gene was isolated and putative binding sites for MYB transcription factors were identified. Gel mobility shift assays showed that a MYB protein from <italic>Pinus taeda</italic> (PtMYB1) was able to interact with the promoter region of <italic>PpAS1</italic>. Furthermore, transient expression analyses in pine cells revealed a negative effect of PtMYB1 on <italic>PpAS1</italic> expression. The potential role of MYB factors in the transcriptional regulation of <italic>PpAS1</italic> in vascular cells is discussed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>conifers</kwd><kwd><italic>Pinus pinaster</italic></kwd><kwd>nitrogen metabolism</kwd><kwd>asparagine synthetase</kwd><kwd>MYB factors</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="10"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="46"/><page-count count="15"/><word-count count="8536"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Asparagine is an important amino acid in plants because it has a high ratio of N/C compared to other amino acids, making it an ideal nitrogen storage and transport compound (Lea et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2007</xref>). In relation to this feature, many important biological functions in plants have been described for asparagine such as nitrogen recycling during abiotic and biotic stresses or nitrogen mobilization and transport from source to sink tissues (Lea et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2007</xref>; Gaufichon et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2010</xref>). Asparagine is synthesized from aspartate and glutamine in the ATP-dependent reaction that is catalyzed by the enzyme asparagine synthetase (AS; EC 6.3.5.4). Given the substrates of this reaction, asparagine synthesis could divert the aspartate flux for aspartate kinase (AK; EC 2.7.2.4) and the glutamine flux generated by glutamine synthetase (GS; EC 6.3.1.2). Therefore, it is likely that the <italic>AS</italic>, <italic>AK</italic>, and <italic>GS</italic> genes are coordinately regulated. In fact, it was recently reported that the <italic>AK</italic> and <italic>AS</italic> genes are inversely regulated by bZIP transcription factors in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Ufaz et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2011</xref>).</p><p>In angiosperms, AS is encoded by a small family of genes which that are phylogenetically separated into two different classes, class I and class II (Gaufichon et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2010</xref>). The best characterized AS genes in plants belong to class I both in monocots such as rice (Nakano et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2000</xref>) and dicots such as tomato (Olea et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2004</xref>). Generally, AS genes appear to be regulated in a reciprocal manner: class I genes are negatively regulated by light or sugars, while class II genes are positively regulated by light (Chevalier et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">1996</xref>; Lam et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">1998</xref>; Gaufichon et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2010</xref>). However, one class II gene that is expressed ubiquitously, and is not regulated by these factors has been recently reported in Parra-Peralbo et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2009</xref>), Ca&#241;as et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2009</xref>).</p><p>Unlike many other plants, conifer trees have a very long life cycle in which the management of nitrogen compounds plays a crucial role in their survival (C&#225;novas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2007</xref>). Conifers also have a particularly active phenylpropanoid metabolism because large amounts of lignin are synthesized during wood formation, which also requires the efficient recycling of nitrogen (Cant&#243;n et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2005</xref>). Given these particularities, conifers are a good model for studying nitrogen metabolism and nitrogen recycling. Thus far, only one AS gene has been identified and characterized in pine (Ca&#241;as et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2006</xref>). This gene, <italic>PsAS1</italic>, is responsible for the high synthesis of asparagine at early stages of seedling development. Ca&#241;as et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2006</xref>) also showed that there is a strong correlation between the levels of <italic>PsAS1</italic> mRNA and asparagine during seedling development, suggesting that transcriptional control should be an important component of the overall regulation of asparagine biosynthesis at early stages of pine growth. Similar evidence has been found in other plants: for example in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, an &#8220;<italic>in silico</italic>&#8221; network analysis of genes that are differentially expressed during seed germination (Katari et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2010</xref>) predicted that <italic>ASN1</italic> and <italic>ASN2</italic> should be subject to strong transcriptional regulation. Currently, little is known about the molecular mechanisms responsible for this transcriptional control in conifers. However, the results of various investigations carried out in our laboratory (C&#225;novas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2007</xref>) suggested that the GS1b/AS pathway is involved in the remobilization of stored nitrogen and its channeling for the biosynthesis of nitrogen compounds during seedling development. It is also known that the transcription factors PtMYB1 and PtMYB4 regulate <italic>GS1b</italic> expression (G&#243;mez-Maldonado et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2004b</xref>). Given this background, we decided to characterize the <italic>AS</italic> gene family in maritime pine and to study whether MYB transcription factors are able to regulate AS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant growth</title><p>Maritime pine seeds (<italic>Pinus pinaster</italic> Ait.) were provided by Centro de Recursos Gen&#233;ticos Forestales &#8220;El Serranillo&#8221; (Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Medio Rural y Marino, Spain). Seeds were imbibed in distilled water for 24&#8201;h under continuous aeration and germinated in a plastic tray with vermiculite as a substrate. Seedlings were cultivated in a growth room at 20/24&#176;C and 50/70% relative humidity with a 16/8-h photoperiod and watered twice a week with distilled water. Thirty days after imbibition, seedlings were individually transferred to a 0.2-l pot with vermiculite as a support, and distilled water was replaced by a mineral nutrient solution containing 3&#8201;mM ammonium as described by Canales et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2010</xref>), unless otherwise specified.</p><p>Seedlings from 14 to 60&#8201;days after imbibition were grown under the same conditions described above and used for analyses of gene expression during the early development of maritime pine. For each assay, at least 20 individual plants were pooled and separate root, hypocotyl, and cotyledon samples were collected. All samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#8722;80&#176;C until processing. Samples from adult trees were collected as described in Canales et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2011a</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>RNA isolation, RACE, and cDNA cloning</title><p>Total RNA was isolated following the protocol described by Liao et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2004</xref>) with minor modifications. The same protocol was used to isolate RNA from seedlings and adult trees. Briefly, 100&#8201;mg of each sample was extracted with a 650-&#956;L of a preheated (65&#176;C) CTAB extraction buffer [3% (w/v) CTAB, 100&#8201;mM Tris pH 8, 2&#8201;M NaCl, 2% (w/v) PVP40, 30&#8201;mM EDTA] in a 1.5-mL tube. The samples were then mixed by inversion four to six times and incubated for 2&#8201;min at 65&#176;C in a water bath. A volume of 650&#8201;&#956;L of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1) was immediately added to each microcentrifuge tube, and the samples were centrifuged for 10&#8201;min at 15,000&#8201;&#215;&#8201;<italic>g</italic> at 4&#176;C. The supernatant was recovered, and a second chloroform extraction was performed. Then, a 3/7 volume of 10&#8201;M LiCl was added, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 30&#8201;min. RNA was pelleted after centrifugation at 25,000&#8201;&#215;&#8201;<italic>g</italic> for 25&#8201;min at 4&#176;C. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and finally resuspended in 25&#8201;&#956;l of sterilized distilled water. RNA concentration and purity were determined spectrophotometrically, and only samples with an A260/A280&#8201;nm ratio of 1.9&#8211;2.1 and an A260/A230&#8201;nm ratio of more than 1.7 were used for subsequent experiments. RNA quality was further confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis.</p><p>To clone the full-length cDNAs (FLcDNAs) of <italic>PpAS1</italic> and <italic>PpAS2</italic>, a 5&#8242; RACE PCR was performed using the FirstChoice RLM-RACE Kit (Ambion). The <italic>PpAS1</italic> 5&#8242; RACE oligonucleotides were designed based on a <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic> FLcDNA sequence (accession number AJ496567), and the <italic>PpAS2</italic> 5&#8242; RACE oligonucleotides were designed based on a <italic>Picea sitchensis</italic> FLcDNA (accession number ABR16560). PCR was performed with the high-fidelity Velocity DNA polymerase (Bioline, London, UK) in a MJ Mini Personal Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad Espa&#241;a, Madrid, Spain) with the following program: one cycle of 98&#176;C for 2&#8201;min followed by 35 cycles of 98&#176;C for 15&#8201;s, 60&#176;C for 30&#8201;s, and 72&#176;C for 15&#8201;s. The resulting blunt-end PCR products were cloned into pJET1.2 (Promega, Madison, USA) using a CloneJET PCR Cloning Kit (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) and sequenced with a CEQ 8000 Genetic Analysis System (Beckman Coulter, Madrid, Spain). The 5&#8242;-end sequences of these PCR products were used to design primers to amplify FLcDNAs of <italic>PpAS1</italic> and <italic>PpAS2</italic> by 3&#8242; RACE using the FirstChoice RLM-RACE Kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence analysis</title><p>Amino acid sequences deduced from the <italic>AS</italic> genes of gymnosperms and angiosperms were identified in the GenBank<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1"><sup>1</sup></xref> and Phytozome<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2"><sup>2</sup></xref> databases, respectively; these sequences were aligned using TCoffee software (Notredame et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2000</xref>). The resulting alignment was used to construct a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree with a JTT matrix model in Seaview 4.2 software (Gouy et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2010</xref>). The statistical support of branches was assessed by approximate likelihood-ratio test (aLRT), which is an alternative to non-parametric bootstrap estimation (Anisimova and Gascuel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2006</xref>). Jalview 2 software (Waterhouse et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2009</xref>) was used to edit the alignment.</p></sec><sec><title>Real-time quantitative PCR</title><p>RNA samples were treated with RQ1 RNase-Free DNase (Promega) to eliminate any traces of genomic DNA. cDNA synthesis was performed with the PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (Takara, Shiga, Japan) using total RNA as a template (500&#8201;ng) in the presence of oligo(dT) and random primers.</p><p>Real-time PCR was carried out on an Mx3000P thermal cycler (Stratagene, Madrid, Spain) with a SYBR Premix Ex Taq kit (Takara) under the following conditions: 95&#176;C for 30&#8201;s (1 cycle), 95&#176;C for 5&#8201;s, 60&#176;C for 10&#8201;s, and 72&#176;C for 15&#8201;s (40 cycles). After the final cycle, a melting curve analysis was performed over a temperature range of 60&#176;C to 95&#176;C in 0.5&#176;C increments in order to verify the reaction specificity. Ten nanogram of reverse transcribed cDNA was used as a template for each reaction.</p><p>The raw fluorescence data from each reaction was fitted to the MAK2 model, which requires no assumptions about the amplification efficiency of a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay (Boggy and Woolf, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2010</xref>). The initial target concentrations (<italic>D</italic><sub>0</sub> parameter) for each gene were deduced from the MAK2 model using the qpcR package for the R environment (Ritz and Spiess, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">2008</xref>) and normalized to the geometric mean of three reference genes (encoding actin, 40S ribosomal protein, and elongation factor-1-alpha).</p></sec><sec><title>Protein analysis</title><p>Protein extraction and western blot analysis were performed as described previously (Ca&#241;as et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2006</xref>). Tissue sectioning, fixation, and embedding were conducted as described by Canales et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2011b</xref>). AS and GS protein were revealed using specific antibodies (Cant&#243;n et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">1996</xref>; Ca&#241;as et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation of the <italic>PpAS1</italic> promoter region</title><p>Pine genomic DNA was isolated using the CTAB method (Doyle and Doyle, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">1987</xref>) and the Universal Genome Walker Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA) was used according the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions to isolate the <italic>PpAS1</italic> gene promoter region. The Advantage Genomic Polymerase mix (Clontech) was used as the DNA polymerase enzyme for the genome walking PCR reactions. A 1006-bp region of the <italic>PpAS1</italic> promoter was isolated via two successive rounds of genome walking. The first round yielded a fragment of 600&#8201;bp and the second round yielded a fragment of 400&#8201;bp. Finally, 100&#8201;ng of undigested genomic DNA was used in a single PCR reaction to obtain 1006&#8201;bp of the <italic>PpAS1</italic> promoter region. This PCR was carried out with the high-fidelity Velocity DNA polymerase (Bioline) in a MJ Mini Personal Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad) with the following program: one cycle of 98&#176;C for 2&#8201;min, 10 cycles of 98&#176;C for 15&#8201;s, 70&#176;C for 30&#8201;s (&#8722;1&#176;C per cycle), and 72&#176;C for 30&#8201;s, 25 cycles of 98&#176;C for 15&#8201;s, 60&#176;C for 30&#8201;s, and 72&#176;C for 30&#8201;s, and a final extension step of 72&#176;C for 5&#8201;min.

Each binding assay used 0.6&#8201;&#956;g of the purified MYB protein. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) conditions were essentially the same as those described by G&#243;mez-Maldonado et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2004b</xref>) to test the binding of the PtMYB1 and PpMYB8 proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). To evaluate the specificity of the sequences in the <italic>AS1</italic> promoter fragment involved in MYB1 binding, competition experiments were performed using the following AC fragments: ACbox1, ACbox2, and ACbox3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). For the competition experiments, increasing amounts of competitor were included in the assay. In the proteinase K assay, the proteins were treated with 3&#8201;&#956;g of proteinase K for 10&#8201;min, at 25&#176;C prior to the binding reaction. EMSA was carried out as previously described, except that the radiolabeled probe and the non-radiolabeled competitor were mixed and added simultaneously in the second step of the reaction. Each binding mixture (20&#8201;ml) contained 2&#8201;ml of 10&#215; binding buffer [100&#8201;mM 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol (TRIS) pH 7.6, 500&#8201;mM NaCl, 10&#8201;mM DTT, 10&#8201;mM EDTA, 50% glycerol], 2&#8201;&#956;g salmon sperm DNA, and the appropriate amount of competitor or proteinase K. The DNA&#8211;protein complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis on 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide, 2% glycerol gels run in 0.25&#215; TRIS&#8211;borate&#8211;EDTA (TBE) buffer at 130&#8201;V for 2&#8201;h at 4&#176;C.

Based on this result, we decided to conduct a thorough search for <italic>AS</italic> sequences in the GenBank nucleotide database using the <italic>P. sylvestris AS1</italic> cDNA sequence as a reference (AJ496567). Using this approach, we identified two different genes, ABR16980 and ABR16560, in the collection of FLcDNAs from the Sitka spruce (<italic>P. sitchensis</italic>; Ralph et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2008</xref>). The nucleotide sequence of <italic>P. sitchensis</italic> ABR16980 has a high sequence identity (92%) to the previously reported <italic>P. sylvestris</italic> AS1 cDNA, while <italic>P. sitchensis</italic> ABR16560 has a much lower identity (80%). Based on these data, we used RLM-RACE PCR to obtain the FLcDNAs for both putative <italic>AS</italic> genes in maritime pine (<italic>P. pinaster</italic>). First, we obtained the FLcDNA sequence for <italic>P. pinaster AS1</italic> (accession number HQ625490), which had a high identity (98%) to the <italic>P. sylvestris AS1</italic> previously reported by Ca&#241;as et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2006</xref>). The <italic>PpAS1</italic> FLcDNA sequence contained a 5&#8242; untranslated region of 104&#8201;bp, a coding region of 1782&#8201;bp, and a 3&#8242; untranslated region of 214&#8201;bp. The open reading frame (ORF) encodes a protein of 593 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 66.8&#8201;kDa. Using the strategy described above, we also obtained a 2269-bp FLcDNA encoding a putative novel conifer AS that we termed AS2 (accession number HM222940). The <italic>P. pinaster</italic> FLcDNA sequence for AS2 contained a 5&#8242; untranslated region of 193&#8201;bp, a coding region of 1773&#8201;bp, and a 3&#8242; untranslated region of 281&#8201;bp.

Whatever their number, plant <italic>AS</italic> genes have been phylogenetically grouped into two major classes: class I and class II (Gaufichon et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2010</xref>). In all angiosperms whose genomes have been completely sequenced, such as <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, <italic>P. trichocarpa</italic>, and <italic>Z. mays</italic>, there is at least one representative of each class. However, the data presented here support the existence of two <italic>AS</italic> genes in conifers, both of which are regarded as class II. This classification of the conifer genes is entirely consistent with the phylogenetic analysis carried out recently by Gaufichon et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2010</xref>). The phylogenetic classification of the conifer AS genes suggests that class II genes are more closely related to the ancestral <italic>AS</italic> gene, while class I genes emerged later during the evolution of angiosperms, prior to the separation between monocots and dicots. Because the pine genome has not yet been fully sequenced, we cannot rule out the presence of another <italic>AS</italic> gene(s) in the conifer genomes. However, this seems unlikely given that we could not identify more than two <italic>AS</italic> genes in the extensive collections of conifers ESTs in GenBank.</p><p>The comparative study of maritime pine AS genes indicated that <italic>PpAS1</italic> and <italic>PpAS2</italic> have distinct patterns of gene expression, suggesting that they encode for AS isoforms with different roles in asparagine biosynthesis. <italic>PpAS1</italic> expression is highly regulated during development and restricted mainly to the first weeks after seed germination, when pine seedlings need robust asparagine synthesis activity in the hypocotyl to reallocate the mobilized nitrogen stored in the seed megagametophytes (C&#225;novas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2007</xref>). Environmental factors, especially those related to stress, also regulate the expression of AS in plants (Olea et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2004</xref>; Herrera-Rodr&#237;guez et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2007</xref>). Here, both drought and continuous darkness dramatically increased <italic>PpAS1</italic> transcript levels, as did treatment with high nitrogen levels (either nitrate or ammonium). These results suggest that <italic>PpAS1</italic> expression is critical when a high rate of nitrogen assimilation and/or remobilization is required. Furthermore, the localization of AS protein in the vascular bundles also suggest a role of the enzyme in nitrogen transport as previously reported in rice and tomato (Nakano et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2000</xref>; Olea et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2004</xref>).</p><p>While <italic>PpAS1</italic> is mainly expressed at early stages of development, the expression of <italic>PpAS2</italic> remains constant at very different stages of development, suggesting that this gene may be involved in the production of asparagine for basal metabolism. The expression pattern of <italic>PpAS2</italic> was similar to the recently reported ubiquitous expression of the <italic>PvAS3</italic> gene in common bean (Parra-Peralbo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2009</xref>) and <italic>ZmAS1</italic> in maize (Ca&#241;as et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2009</xref>). So far, no <italic>AS</italic> gene has been reported as ubiquitously expressed in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. However, available microarray data indicate that <italic>ASN3</italic> transcript levels are stable in a variety of different developmental and environmental situations. In addition, based on the information present in the database of gene expression correlation ATTED-II (Obayashi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2009</xref>), <italic>ASN3</italic> expression correlates closely with numerous ribosomal proteins and genes related to protein synthesis. It seems likely, therefore, that plants require an AS isoform that is specific to the production of asparagine for protein synthesis, and PpAS2, PvAS3, ZmAS1, and AtASN3 appear to play this role in the maritime pine, common bean, maize, and Arabidopsis, respectively.</p><p>Here, we have shown that the <italic>PpAS1</italic> and <italic>PpAS2</italic> genes have very different expression profiles, and it is likely that there is a high degree of specialization within this small gene family in conifers. Functional specialization of related genes is a common feature in plants and has already been reported for other nitrogen metabolism genes, for example members of the glutamine synthetase gene family (Bernard and Habash, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2009</xref>; Castro-Rodr&#237;guez et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2011</xref>). This specialization is also evident in the <italic>Arabidopsis ASN1</italic> and <italic>ASN2</italic> genes, which are reciprocally regulated; the first is induced by darkness and during seed development, while the second is induced by light and is repressed during seed development (Wong et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2004</xref>; Katari et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2010</xref>).</p><p>The specific response of <italic>PpAS1</italic> to several environmental factors together with the restriction of its expression pattern to specific developmental stages, suggests that this gene is under strong and complex transcriptional regulation. Recently, it has been reported that genes subjected to rapid and variable regulation contain distinct types of core promoters (L&#243;pez-Maury et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2008</xref>). Therefore, we decided to isolate and characterize the <italic>PpAS1</italic> gene promoter to explore the mechanisms that may underpin its transcriptional regulation. The <italic>in silico</italic> analysis of this sequence revealed the presence of several <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements involved in the regulation by sugars, the Amy, and G boxes. Sugar repression is a common feature of <italic>AS</italic> genes in plants, and the regulatory elements that mediate this repression appear to be evolutionarily conserved (Winichayakul et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2004</xref>). The fact that <italic>PpAS1</italic> mRNA levels increase in plants adapted to darkness, a situation in which sugar levels are low, together with the presence of conserved <italic>cis</italic>-elements involved in sugar repression in the promoter region, suggest that the pine <italic>PpAS1</italic> gene may be also regulated by sugar availability.</p><p>The <italic>PpAS1</italic> promoter region also contained another group of <italic>cis</italic>-elements, AC boxes, which are putative targets for the binding of R2&#8211;R3 MYB transcription factors. G&#243;mez-Maldonado et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2004b</xref>) previously reported that PtMYB1 and PtMYB4 transcription factors are able to interact <italic>in vitro</italic> with the promoter of a <italic>GS</italic> gene that activates gene expression <italic>in vivo</italic> and they proposed that MYB proteins could act as transcriptional regulators of this key gene in nitrogen metabolism. AS catalyzes a glutamine-dependent chemical reaction, so there is a metabolic relationship between GS and AS enzymes. These observations led us to investigate whether MYB transcription factors could play a role in the transcriptional regulation of <italic>PpAS1</italic>. Our results indicate that PtMYB1 is able to bind the <italic>PpAS1</italic> promoter <italic>in vitro</italic> and that this interaction has a repressor effect on <italic>PpAS1</italic> transcription in pine cells. Although the functional significance of this interaction should be studied further using other approaches, such as gene silencing, the fact that PtMYB1, PpAS1, and GS1b are mainly localized to cells in the vascular bundles (Avila et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2001</xref>; G&#243;mez-Maldonado et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2004b</xref>; Ca&#241;as et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2006</xref>; this work) is consistent with the proposal that these genes may be co-regulated in pine.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">1996</xref>) suggested plants must recycle the ammonium produced during the lignin biosynthesis through the GS/GOGAT cycle to maintain the active biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids. Down-regulation of <italic>AS</italic> expression in lignified cells may be important to prevent the collapse of lignin biosynthesis during wood formation, because active synthesis of asparagine would divert the ammonium assimilated by the GS/GOGAT pathway, which needs to be directed toward arogenate synthesis to maintain the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first work reporting an interaction between MYB transcription factors and the regulatory region of an <italic>AS</italic> gene. However, the regulation of AS by MYB factors may also occur in other plants. In fact, there are many putative MYB binding sites in the promoter region of the <italic>ASN1</italic> gene<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3"><sup>3</sup></xref>, so it is possible that the MYB family of transcription factors could contribute to the transcriptional regulation of asparagine biosynthesis in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. AtMYB43, 20, and 42 are the closest homologs of PtMYB1 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Patzlaff et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2003</xref>). However, it is not possible to establish a clear functional correspondence between transcription factors in gymnosperms and angiosperms because these groups of plants diverged more than 300 million years ago. R2&#8211;R3 MYB families include hundreds of members in angiosperms (Feller et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2011</xref>). In contrast, the number of MYB transcription factors in pine databases is considerably lower than the average number reported in angiosperms. Furthermore, it appears that the total number of transcription factors is lower in conifers than in angiosperms for most of the families (C&#225;novas et al., unpublished data).</p><p>In summary, we have characterized two <italic>AS</italic> genes in the maritime pine, <italic>PpAS1</italic> and <italic>PpAS2</italic>, that exhibit differential expression patterns during development and in response to environmental factors. <italic>PpAS1</italic> expression is regulated during development and by environmental factors such as light/dark transitions and changes in the nitrogen source or water availability, whereas <italic>PpAS2</italic> is constitutively expressed at similar levels in pine seedlings and adult trees regardless of the environmental conditions. Therefore, we propose that <italic>PpAS2</italic> may be involved in the supply of asparagine for basal metabolism under non-stress conditions. In contrast, <italic>PpAS1</italic> expression is strongly regulated by these factors, indicating that it may be specialized for supplying asparagine in situations that produce a high metabolic demand for this amino acid. Therefore, these <italic>AS</italic> genes likely have complementary and essential roles in maritime pine nitrogen metabolism. We also provide the first evidence that <italic>PpAS1</italic> transcription regulation may be regulated by MYB transcription factors. Future research will be needed to clarify the importance of MYB proteins and other transcription factors in the regulation of asparagine biosynthesis in conifers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by a grant from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (BIO2009-07490) and by research funds from the Junta de Andaluc&#237;a (research group BIO-114).
