</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Asparagine is an important amino acid in plants because it has a high ratio of N/C compared to other amino acids, making it an ideal nitrogen storage and transport compound (Lea et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In relation to this feature, many important biological functions in plants have been described for asparagine such as nitrogen recycling during abiotic and biotic stresses or nitrogen mobilization and transport from source to sink tissues (Lea et al., 2007; Gaufichon et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Asparagine is synthesized from aspartate and glutamine in the ATP-dependent reaction that is catalyzed by the enzyme asparagine synthetase (AS; EC 6.3.5.4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Given the substrates of this reaction, asparagine synthesis could divert the aspartate flux for aspartate kinase (AK; EC 2.7.2.4) and the glutamine flux generated by glutamine synthetase (GS; EC 6.3.1.2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is likely that the AS, AK, and GS genes are coordinately regulated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In fact, it was recently reported that the AK and AS genes are inversely regulated by bZIP transcription factors in Arabidopsis (Ufaz et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In angiosperms, AS is encoded by a small family of genes which that are phylogenetically separated into two different classes, class I and class II (Gaufichon et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The best characterized AS genes in plants belong to class I both in monocots such as rice (Nakano et al., 2000) and dicots such as tomato (Olea et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Generally, AS genes appear to be regulated in a reciprocal manner: class I genes are negatively regulated by light or sugars, while class II genes are positively regulated by light (Chevalier et al., 1996; Lam et al., 1998; Gaufichon et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>However, one class II gene that is expressed ubiquitously, and is not regulated by these factors has been recently reported in Parra-Peralbo et al. (2009), Cañas et al. (2009). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Unlike many other plants, conifer trees have a very long life cycle in which the management of nitrogen compounds plays a crucial role in their survival (Cánovas et al., 1998, 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Conifers also have a particularly active phenylpropanoid metabolism because large amounts of lignin are synthesized during wood formation, which also requires the efficient recycling of nitrogen (Cantón et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Given these particularities, conifers are a good model for studying nitrogen metabolism and nitrogen recycling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Thus far, only one AS gene has been identified and characterized in pine (Cañas et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>This gene, PsAS1, is responsible for the high synthesis of asparagine at early stages of seedling development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Cañas et al. (2006) also showed that there is a strong correlation between the levels of PsAS1 mRNA and asparagine during seedling development, suggesting that transcriptional control should be an important component of the overall regulation of asparagine biosynthesis at early stages of pine growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Similar evidence has been found in other plants: for example in Arabidopsis, an “in silico” network analysis of genes that are differentially expressed during seed germination (Katari et al., 2010) predicted that ASN1 and ASN2 should be subject to strong transcriptional regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Currently, little is known about the molecular mechanisms responsible for this transcriptional control in conifers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>However, the results of various investigations carried out in our laboratory (Cánovas et al., 2007) suggested that the GS1b/AS pathway is involved in the remobilization of stored nitrogen and its channeling for the biosynthesis of nitrogen compounds during seedling development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>It is also known that the transcription factors PtMYB1 and PtMYB4 regulate GS1b expression (Gómez-Maldonado et al., 2004b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Given this background, we decided to characterize the AS gene family in maritime pine and to study whether MYB transcription factors are able to regulate AS. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>This classification of the conifer genes is entirely consistent with the phylogenetic analysis carried out recently by Gaufichon et al. (2010). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>However, this seems unlikely given that we could not identify more than two AS genes in the extensive collections of conifers ESTs in GenBank. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>The comparative study of maritime pine AS genes indicated that PpAS1 and PpAS2 have distinct patterns of gene expression, suggesting that they encode for AS isoforms with different roles in asparagine biosynthesis. PpAS1 expression is highly regulated during development and restricted mainly to the first weeks after seed germination, when pine seedlings need robust asparagine synthesis activity in the hypocotyl to reallocate the mobilized nitrogen stored in the seed megagametophytes (Cánovas et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Environmental factors, especially those related to stress, also regulate the expression of AS in plants (Olea et al., 2004; Herrera-Rodríguez et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Here, both drought and continuous darkness dramatically increased PpAS1 transcript levels, as did treatment with high nitrogen levels (either nitrate or ammonium). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that PpAS1 expression is critical when a high rate of nitrogen assimilation and/or remobilization is required. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the localization of AS protein in the vascular bundles also suggest a role of the enzyme in nitrogen transport as previously reported in rice and tomato (Nakano et al., 2000; Olea et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>While PpAS1 is mainly expressed at early stages of development, the expression of PpAS2 remains constant at very different stages of development, suggesting that this gene may be involved in the production of asparagine for basal metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>The expression pattern of PpAS2 was similar to the recently reported ubiquitous expression of the PvAS3 gene in common bean (Parra-Peralbo et al., 2009) and ZmAS1 in maize (Cañas et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>So far, no AS gene has been reported as ubiquitously expressed in Arabidopsis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>However, available microarray data indicate that ASN3 transcript levels are stable in a variety of different developmental and environmental situations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>In addition, based on the information present in the database of gene expression correlation ATTED-II (Obayashi et al., 2009), ASN3 expression correlates closely with numerous ribosomal proteins and genes related to protein synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>It seems likely, therefore, that plants require an AS isoform that is specific to the production of asparagine for protein synthesis, and PpAS2, PvAS3, ZmAS1, and AtASN3 appear to play this role in the maritime pine, common bean, maize, and Arabidopsis, respectively. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Here, we have shown that the PpAS1 and PpAS2 genes have very different expression profiles, and it is likely that there is a high degree of specialization within this small gene family in conifers. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>This specialization is also evident in the Arabidopsis ASN1 and ASN2 genes, which are reciprocally regulated; the first is induced by darkness and during seed development, while the second is induced by light and is repressed during seed development (Wong et al., 2004; Katari et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>The specific response of PpAS1 to several environmental factors together with the restriction of its expression pattern to specific developmental stages, suggests that this gene is under strong and complex transcriptional regulation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>The in silico analysis of this sequence revealed the presence of several cis-regulatory elements involved in the regulation by sugars, the Amy, and G boxes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Sugar repression is a common feature of AS genes in plants, and the regulatory elements that mediate this repression appear to be evolutionarily conserved (Winichayakul et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>The fact that PpAS1 mRNA levels increase in plants adapted to darkness, a situation in which sugar levels are low, together with the presence of conserved cis-elements involved in sugar repression in the promoter region, suggest that the pine PpAS1 gene may be also regulated by sugar availability. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>The PpAS1 promoter region also contained another group of cis-elements, AC boxes, which are putative targets for the binding of R2–R3 MYB transcription factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Gómez-Maldonado et al. (2004b) previously reported that PtMYB1 and PtMYB4 transcription factors are able to interact in vitro with the promoter of a GS gene that activates gene expression in vivo and they proposed that MYB proteins could act as transcriptional regulators of this key gene in nitrogen metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>AS catalyzes a glutamine-dependent chemical reaction, so there is a metabolic relationship between GS and AS enzymes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>These observations led us to investigate whether MYB transcription factors could play a role in the transcriptional regulation of PpAS1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that PtMYB1 is able to bind the PpAS1 promoter in vitro and that this interaction has a repressor effect on PpAS1 transcription in pine cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Although the functional significance of this interaction should be studied further using other approaches, such as gene silencing, the fact that PtMYB1, PpAS1, and GS1b are mainly localized to cells in the vascular bundles (Avila et al., 2001; Gómez-Maldonado et al., 2004b; Cañas et al., 2006; this work) is consistent with the proposal that these genes may be co-regulated in pine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>The work of van Heerden et al. (1996) suggested plants must recycle the ammonium produced during the lignin biosynthesis through the GS/GOGAT cycle to maintain the active biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Down-regulation of AS expression in lignified cells may be important to prevent the collapse of lignin biosynthesis during wood formation, because active synthesis of asparagine would divert the ammonium assimilated by the GS/GOGAT pathway, which needs to be directed toward arogenate synthesis to maintain the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first work reporting an interaction between MYB transcription factors and the regulatory region of an AS gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>However, the regulation of AS by MYB factors may also occur in other plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>In fact, there are many putative MYB binding sites in the promoter region of the ASN1 gene3, so it is possible that the MYB family of transcription factors could contribute to the transcriptional regulation of asparagine biosynthesis in Arabidopsis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>AtMYB43, 20, and 42 are the closest homologs of PtMYB1 in Arabidopsis (Patzlaff et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>However, it is not possible to establish a clear functional correspondence between transcription factors in gymnosperms and angiosperms because these groups of plants diverged more than 300 million years ago. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>R2–R3 MYB families include hundreds of members in angiosperms (Feller et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the number of MYB transcription factors in pine databases is considerably lower than the average number reported in angiosperms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it appears that the total number of transcription factors is lower in conifers than in angiosperms for most of the families (Cánovas et al., unpublished data). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>In summary, we have characterized two AS genes in the maritime pine, PpAS1 and PpAS2, that exhibit differential expression patterns during development and in response to environmental factors. PpAS1 expression is regulated during development and by environmental factors such as light/dark transitions and changes in the nitrogen source or water availability, whereas PpAS2 is constitutively expressed at similar levels in pine seedlings and adult trees regardless of the environmental conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we propose that PpAS2 may be involved in the supply of asparagine for basal metabolism under non-stress conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>In contrast, PpAS1 expression is strongly regulated by these factors, indicating that it may be specialized for supplying asparagine in situations that produce a high metabolic demand for this amino acid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these AS genes likely have complementary and essential roles in maritime pine nitrogen metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>We also provide the first evidence that PpAS1 transcription regulation may be regulated by MYB transcription factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Future research will be needed to clarify the importance of MYB proteins and other transcription factors in the regulation of asparagine biosynthesis in conifers. </plain></SENT>
