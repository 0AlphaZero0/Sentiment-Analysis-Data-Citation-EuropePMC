As with other forms of muscular dystrophy, adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene transfer is a particularly auspicious treatment strategy, however the size of the DYSF cDNA (6.5 kb) negates packaging into traditional AAV serotypes known to express well in muscle (i.e. rAAV1, 2, 6, 8, 9). Potential advantages of a full cDNA versus a mini-gene include: maintaining structural-functional protein domains, evading protein misfolding, and avoiding novel epitopes that could be immunogenic. AAV5 has demonstrated unique plasticity with regards to packaging capacity and recombination of virions containing homologous regions of cDNA inserts has been implicated in the generation of full-length transcripts. Herein we show for the first time <italic>in vivo</italic> that homologous recombination following AAV5.DYSF gene transfer leads to the production of full length transcript and protein. Moreover, gene transfer of full-length dysferlin protein in dysferlin deficient mice resulted in expression levels sufficient to correct functional deficits in the diaphragm and importantly in skeletal muscle membrane repair. Intravascular regional gene transfer through the femoral artery produced high levels of transduction and enabled targeting of specific muscle groups affected by the dysferlinopathies setting the stage for potential translation to clinical trials. We provide proof of principle that AAV5 mediated delivery of dysferlin is a highly promising strategy for treatment of dysferlinopathies and has far-reaching implications for the therapeutic delivery of other large genes.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mutations in the dysferlin gene cause allelic autosomal recessive disorders including limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B), Miyoshi myopathy <xref rid="pone.0039233-Bashir1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039233-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and distal anterior compartment myopathy <xref rid="pone.0039233-Illa1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039233-Seror1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039233-Rosales1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, collectively known as the dysferlinopathies.

Dysferlin is a 237 kDa protein composed of a C-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane domain and a longer cytoplasmic oriented hydrophilic region with multiple C2 domains with implications for calcium and phospholipid binding <xref rid="pone.0039233-Therrien1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Recent work has shown that loss of dysferlin compromises Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent membrane repair in skeletal muscle <xref rid="pone.0039233-Bansal1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039233-Lennon1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Dysferlin-null muscle fibers fail to exclude dye entry even in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> strongly suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent membrane repair requires dysferlin <xref rid="pone.0039233-Han1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. There is also evidence from LGMD2B patients that ultrastructural membrane defects are a present and contributing factor to disease pathology <xref rid="pone.0039233-Piccolo1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039233-Cenacchi1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The importance of this system is emphasized when considering that skeletal muscle is mechanically active and predisposed to injury; thus, a robust membrane resealing mechanism must be present. Absent or mutant dysferlin leads to impaired membrane repair and a cascade of events starting with muscle fiber necrosis resulting in muscle fiber loss and progressive limb weakness <xref rid="pone.0039233-Lennon1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039233-Han1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>Packaging limitations of AAV, estimated at &#8764;5 kb, present obstacles for gene replacement strategies requiring cDNA cassettes exceeding this size constraint <xref rid="pone.0039233-Dong1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039233-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039233-Hermonat1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Alternative methods to bypass packaging limits include miniaturizing genes and trans-splicing approaches. These tactics have often compromised function and often result in reduced levels of gene expression at standard dosing levels <xref rid="pone.0039233-Harper1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039233-Wells1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039233-Duan1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039233-Ghosh1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. A recent report suggests that the dysferlin gene can be delivered to muscle using a dual trans-splicing vector strategy with functional improvement of the defect in membrane repair <xref rid="pone.0039233-Lostal1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. A second study using AAV to deliver a naturally occurring minidysferlin protein also showed some improvement in the membrane repair defect <xref rid="pone.0039233-Krahn1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. A sentinel report indicating that AAV5 can package large transcripts up to 8.9 kb in size encouraged translational investigators to pursue gene replacement requiring inserts as large as the dysferlin gene <xref rid="pone.0039233-Lai1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039233-Allocca1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Subsequent studies showed the mechanism for AAV5 mediated delivery of genes &gt;5 kb was homologous recombination of 5&#8242; and 3&#8242; products of partially packaged virions rather than ability to package intact full size genomes <xref rid="pone.0039233-Dong2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039233-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In our own studies, we attempted to take advantage of the potential for AAV5 to deliver a dysferlin expression cassette of 7.7 kb in a single vector, including an optimized cDNA and muscle specific promoter to avoid off target effects. Our findings demonstrate highly favorable results with full restoration of dysferlin without compromise in function. In the diaphragm muscle of a mouse model of dysferlin deficiency, tetanic force was restored to normal and there was full resistance to fatigue. Importantly, the newly restored dysferlin fully repaired membrane defects in dysferlin deficient mice. In addition, rAAV5.DYSF was successfully delivered through isolated limb perfusion to the limb muscles preferentially affected in entities such as Miyoshi myopathy and distal anterior compartment myopathy. Even more proximal sites can potentially be transduced by vascular delivery as we have demonstrated in the non-human primate <xref rid="pone.0039233-RodinoKlapac2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Of particular note, consistent with recent observations, the full-length dysferlin product that restored these favorable results was mediated by recombination of homologous region of &#8764;1 kb present in 5&#8242; and 3&#8242; packaged vector genomes, <xref rid="pone.0039233-Lai1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039233-Dong2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039233-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Herein we present our findings that AAV5 delivery is a viable treatment modality for dysferlin gene replacement with far reaching implications for other monogenic disorders caused by mutations in large genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>rAAV5.dysferlin gene transfer vector</title><p>We constructed a human dysferlin cassette driven by the muscle specific MHCK7 promoter <xref rid="pone.0039233-Salva1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039233-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). A chimeric intron was added to augment RNA processing. The cassette (7.7 kb total) was packaged into an AAV2/5 vector using standard triple transfection and purified using iodixanol gradients and ion exchange chromatography. To test whether the full-length transgene was packaged or if homologous recombination was occurring, we performed alkaline electrophoresis and southern blot analysis on vector genomes purified from the vector preparation as previously described <xref rid="pone.0039233-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Two probes were designed, one within the 5&#8242; MHCK7 promoter and one located in the 3&#8242; end of dysferlin. The findings unequivocally demonstrated that packaging did not exceed &#8764;5.2 kb with either probe consistent with recent reports <xref rid="pone.0039233-Lai1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039233-Dong2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039233-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039233-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). AAV is known to package single strand genomes with 3&#8242; to 5&#8242; polarity into the pre-formed particle in an ATP dependent process starting at the 3&#8242; ITR terminus. This is consistent with a vector &#8220;breakpoint&#8221; within this region based on the Southern blot data demonstrating packaging of up to &#8764;5.2 kb in length starting at a 3&#8242; ITR termini. Despite these packaging constraints, full-length dysferlin protein was readily demonstrated in skeletal muscle consistent with a process of homologous recombination occurring within transduced myocytes to generate the full-length intact dysferlin gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039233-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0039233-Lai1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039233-Dong2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039233-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.

Challenges, however, for DYSF gene replacement relate to AAV packaging limits for genomes significantly larger than wild-type length (4.8 kb). Fortunately, the sentinel report of Alloca <italic>et al.</italic> brought enhanced packaging by AAV5 to light and gave new hope for expanding the capacity of AAV gene transfer for monogenic disorders of large genes with the potential to be carried to the bedside <xref rid="pone.0039233-Allocca1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In their studies, efficient packaging, transduction, and expression of an 8.9 kb cassette of a large inherited gene causing blindness implied the ability to overcome the hurdle of a 5 kb size limitation for AAV for replacement therapy. Our current study along with three others <xref rid="pone.0039233-Lai1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039233-Dong2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039233-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> have demonstrated that homologous recombination of partially packaged genomes is the mechanism responsible for the generation of full-length transcripts rather than oversized packaging of the whole genome. Regardless, AAV5 does exhibit enhanced plasticity regarding packaging constraints which is likely contributing to its ability to mediate production of full-length transcripts in muscle following homologous recombination <xref rid="pone.0039233-Allocca1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. With regard to neuromuscular diseases, the findings provided a new perspective for conditions caused by mutations of large genes. DMD is the most common severe childhood muscular dystrophy and would seem to benefit from expression of the larger transcripts than mini- and micro-dystrophins that only partially restore physiologic function in the mdx mouse <xref rid="pone.0039233-RodinoKlapac1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039233-Harper1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Less common disorders, such as titin deficiency causing LGMD2J, and variants of congenital muscular dystrophy such as phenotypes caused by LARGE gene mutations would also benefit from expression of the full length protein <xref rid="pone.0039233-Barresi1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039233-Bushby1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039233-Longman1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Because of the success of Alloca <italic>et al.</italic>, it was our intent to take advantage of the transduction capabilities of AAV5 for skeletal muscle <xref rid="pone.0039233-Allocca1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. We targeted the dysferlin gene because of its relative frequency amongst the LGMDs <xref rid="pone.0039233-Rosales1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039233-Moore1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Our findings are supportive of the unique properties of AAV5 to express a 6.5 kb cDNA producing full length protein but the mechanism for expression of the dysferlin gene pointed in a different direction than reported for the series of retinal genes protecting against blindness <xref rid="pone.0039233-Allocca1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Our studies confirmed that AAV5 followed traditional packaging limits for DYSF because analysis of packaged virions was consistent with a packaging limitation of &#8764;5 kb. Thus, AAV5 virions transducing muscle fibers contained partial dysferlin vector genomes that mapped to both the 5&#8242; and 3&#8242; ends of the expression cassette and produced an intact expression cassette likely through homologous recombination upon reaching the nucleus <xref rid="pone.0039233-Lai1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039233-Dong2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039233-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. This enabled translation of the full length 237 kDa protein demonstrated by western blots following gene transfer. The findings were equally robust following intramuscular and intravascular delivery, and the validity of the newly expressed protein was confirmed by its full restoration of physiologic function in the diaphragm and membrane repair capabilities in skeletal muscle.</p><p>Of particular importance, the potential for DYSF gene replacement has also been demonstrated by Lostal <italic>et al.</italic> with their comparable findings demonstrating expression of full-length dysferlin <xref rid="pone.0039233-Lostal1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. These researchers used a dual vector strategy permitting the dysferlin cDNA to be split at the exon 28/29 junction and cloned it into two independent AAV vectors carrying the appropriate splicing sequences. Their work tested the efficiency of dual packaging into AAV2/1 by intramuscular injection of both vectors into a dysferlin-deficient mouse and a novel strategy using systemic delivery of dual vector administration of both rAAV2/1 and rAAV2/9. Overall, both IM and systemic vascular delivery via the tail vein of dysferlin-deficient mice showed improvement of muscle pathology. Their study also noted an improvement in membrane repair in the FDB that did not reach WT control levels. By systemic delivery they found low levels of transduction (1&#8211;4%) which is a current limitation of the dual vector approach. In a clinical setting, higher levels of gene expression may be required to achieve a clinically meaningful outcome. Lostal <italic>et al</italic> suggested that 30% levels of dysferlin may be needed (26).</p><p>An additional report by Krahn <italic>et al.</italic> described a human minidysferlin protein that was identified in a patient with late-onset moderate dysferlinopathy <xref rid="pone.0039233-Krahn1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The 73 kDa protein lacks the consensus dysferlin N-terminus but maintains the wild-type C-terminus including the last two C2 domains and transmembrane domain. The authors packaged this minidysferlin cDNA in a cassette containing a C5.C12 promoter and delivered it to A/J dysferlin deficient mice using AAV2/1 and AAV2/9. Expression of the protein was confirmed in the TA and found to localize primarily to the cytoplasm of muscle fibers and to a lesser extent in the sarcolemma. An examination of function revealed that the minidysferlin led to partial improvement in the membrane repair deficits accompanying the dysferlin-null FDB muscle fibers <xref rid="pone.0039233-Krahn1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>Our studies demonstrate clinical applicability for AAV5.DYSF gene transfer for dysferlin deficiency. There are several advantages to using AAV5 to deliver the full-length dysferlin cDNA. One particular advantage is the ability to deliver the entire cassette with one vector, significantly reducing viral load compared to the dual vector strategy. This is especially important with regards to translation in terms of feasibility of vector production and limiting capsid exposure for patients. A second advantage relates to full-length protein versus a miniature version. Although mini-genes are desirable for practicality of standard AAV delivery, there is a compromise in protein function <xref rid="pone.0039233-Krahn1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and the potential for novel epitopes that may be immunogenic when delivered to patients <xref rid="pone.0039233-Mendell1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. One potential concern with AAV5.dysferlin delivery is the presence of non-recombined vector genome fragments; however we showed only one mRNA and protein species was present in transduced muscle. As with any other naturally occurring truncated transcript that could be produced; elimination would occur by nonsense mediated decay. An informal discussion with the FDA (Rodino-Klapac and Mendell personal communication) defined a potential path for a dysferlin clinical gene therapy trial assuming no problems were encountered in the toxicology/biodistribution studies done with the same rigor as other approved AAV vectors <xref rid="pone.0039233-Mendell1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039233-Mendell2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039233-Mendell3" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that AAV5.dysferlin delivery is a very promising therapeutic approach that could restore functional deficits in dysferlinopathy patients. Specific muscle groups could be targeted by intramuscular delivery for dysferlin phenotypes that include Miyoshi myopathy and distal anterior compartment myopathy. In addition, based on our experience using fluoroscopy guided vascular delivery studies in the non-human primate we can thread the intravascular catheter to the take off point of specific vessels <sup>9</sup>. This opens up clinical pathways for gene delivery to particular muscle groups relevant to either LGMD2B or Miyoshi myopathy including quadriceps and hamstring muscles, and the anterior or the posterior compartments of the lower limb.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Dysferlin gene construction</title><p>The full-length human dysferlin cDNA was used for all gene transfer studies.

A circular area (diameter, 5 &#181;m) on the edge of the sarcolemma was irradiated at 20% power for 5 s. Images were captured 5 s prior to injury and every 5 s after injury until 3 min post irradiation. For every image, the fluorescence intensity surrounding the site of damage was analyzed (ImageJ). At least 25 fibers were evaluated for each condition (2-way analysis of variance, P&lt;0.05).</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Vascular delivery</title><p>Eight adult dysferlin deficient mice (4&#8211;6 weeks of age) were perfused with 10<sup>12</sup> vg rAAV5.DYSF in 100 &#181;L of normal saline as described <xref rid="pone.0039233-RodinoKlapac1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Briefly, mice were anesthetized and the femoral bundle was visualized via a small incision proximal to the mid-thigh. Blood flow through the femoral artery was controlled by catheter placement using a customized heat pulled polypropylene 10 (PE-10) catheter placed into the femoral artery. Prior to vector administration, the arterial catheter was flushed (pre-flush) with 100 &#181;l sterile normal saline. Immediately prior to vector administration all blood flow to the extremity was impeded (isolated limb perfusion &#8211; ILP) by tightening the ligature at the mid-thigh. rAAV5.DYSF was perfused through the femoral artery in 100 &#181;l of sterile Tris buffered saline administered at a rate of approximately 2 &#181;l per second (over 60&#8211;80 seconds). After 10 minutes of maintained vascular occlusion, 100 &#181;l of normal saline was administered to the arterial catheter (again at about 2 &#181;l per second) as a post-flush and the tourniquet was then released. The wound was flushed with sterile normal saline and closed with a 6-0 proline suture.</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Immunostaining for dysferlin was performed on all transduced tissue to assess efficacy of gene transfer. Tissue sections were incubated with dysferlin rabbit anti-human monoclonal (Lifespan Biosciences, Inc., Cat #LS-C138735) antibody to detect dysferlin at a dilution of 1&#8758;100 in block (20% goat serum, 0.1% triton X-100 in PBS) applied for 1 hour at 25&#176;C, in a wet chamber. Sections were washed with PBS 3&#215;20 minutes, reblocked, and then incubated for 30 minutes at 25&#176;C with an Alexa 568 goat anti rabbit antibody at a dilution of 1&#8758;300 (Molecular Probes). Sections were washed in PBS for 3&#215;20 minutes and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Images were captured with a Zeiss Axioskop2 Plus Microscope and AxioCam MRC5 camera. Four random 20&#215; images (each field with an average of 150 muscle fibers) were captured per muscle and the number of fibers with dysferlin staining was counted and expressed as percent of total number of fibers.</p></sec><sec id="s4k"><title>Morphometrics</title><p>Centralized nuclei counts were performed on sections of TA muscles stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) from AAV5.DYSF treated Dysf<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> animals.

Four random 20&#215; fields of 12 &#181;m sections for each muscle were captured and the number of fibers with central nuclei counted and expressed as a percentage of the total number of fibers.</p></sec><sec id="s4l"><title>Western Blot Analysis</title><p>The TA was isolated from both the treated and contralateral limbs. From each muscle, fresh frozen serial tissue sections were taken for both immunohistochemistry and for western blot analysis. Muscle samples harvested from rAAV5.DYSF and control groups were compared with wild-type mice for levels of vector-mediated dysferlin compared to endogenous dysferlin. Protein (25 &#181;g) extracted from treated and control samples was separated by SDS-PAGE (3&#8211;8% Novex NuPAGE gradient gels, Invitrogen), blotted on PVDF membrane and probed with dysferlin rabbit anti-human monoclonal (Lifespan Biosciences, Inc.) primary antibody at a dilution of 1&#8758;1000, NCL-Hamlet (Novocastra) primary antibody at a dilution of 1&#8758;1,000 or actin antibody (NCL-MSA) at a dilution of 1&#8758;6,000 followed by horseradish-peroxidase labeled goat anti-mouse IgG or hoseradish-peroxidase labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1&#8758;5,000, Millipore). Immunoreactive bands were detected with ECL Plus detection system (GE Healthcare) and signal captured on Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham).</p></sec><sec id="s4m"><title>Force generation and protection from eccentric contractions in EDL</title><p>SJL-Dysf, A/J, and 129-Dysf<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> animals along with control animals C57/BL10, A/HeJ, and 129S1/SvImJ (8 per group) were assessed for physiological deficits in the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle at 24 weeks (when histopathological features are present) as previously described <xref rid="pone.0039233-RodinoKlapac1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039233-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Mice were euthanized and the EDL was removed, the tendons sutured, and bathed in oxygenated circulating Krebs-Henseleit solution at 30&#176;C in an organ bath. For the procedure, one end of the muscle was tied to a force transducer and the other to a high-speed linear servo-controlled motor. The muscle was mounted in the set-up at slack length with a resting tension of 1 g for 10 minutes without electrical stimulation. Stimulation was delivered via two parallel platinum-iridium electrodes on either side of the muscle. Muscles were adjusted to optimum length (L0), defined as the length for maximal twitch and subjected to an isometric tetanus of 150 Hz. Following a 5 minute rest period, muscles were subjected to an eccentric contraction protocol consisting of a series of 10 isometric 700 ms tetani, at 2 minute intervals, with a 5% lengthening of the muscles (0.5 fiber length per second for duration of 200 ms) when maximal force had developed at 500 ms. After the tetanus ended (at t&#8202;=&#8202;700 ms), the muscle was brought back to initial length (at the same speed as the stretch), allowing for full relaxation to the initial length. For comparative purposes, all force measurements are expressed per unit cross-sectional area (normalized isometric force or tension: mN/mm<sup>2</sup>). Cross-sectional area (CSA) is calculated using the following equation, CSA&#8202;=&#8202;(muscle mass in g)/[(optimal fiber length in cm)&#215;(muscle density in g/cm<sup>3</sup>)], where muscle density is 1.06 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4n"><title>Diaphragm Tetanic Contraction and Muscle Fatigue Methods</title><p>As a second approach, the diaphragm will be tested as a target for a therapeutic outcome measure.

Mice were euthanized and the diaphragm was dissected with rib attachments and central tendon intact, and placed in K-H buffer at 37 C as previously described <xref rid="pone.0039233-RafaelFortney1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039233-Beastrom1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. A 1&#8211;2 mm wide section (with length from rib to tendon) of diaphragm was isolated, and attached to a force transducer. The diaphragm strip was looped around a basket assembly attached to the transducer (the rib cartilage serves as the anchor), and the tendon was pierced by a pin. The muscle was stretched to optimal length for measurement of twitch contractions, and then allowed to rest for 10 minutes before initiation of the tetanic protocol. The protocol consisted of a series of eight tetanic contractions occurring at 2 minute intervals, each with duration of 500 ms. The force was recorded for each stimulus, and normalized to account for muscle width and length. The muscle was rested for 5 minutes before starting the muscle fatigue protocol. This protocol measures the force exerted by the muscle when stimulated every second for 90 seconds (500 ms tetanus at 100 Hz). Following the muscle fatigue protocol, the muscle strip was removed from the apparatus, the rib cartilage removed and weighed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0039233.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
