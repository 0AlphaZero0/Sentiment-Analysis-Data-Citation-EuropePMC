<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As with other forms of muscular dystrophy, adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene transfer is a particularly auspicious treatment strategy, however the size of the DYSF cDNA (6.5 kb) negates packaging into traditional AAV serotypes known to express well in muscle (i.e. rAAV1, 2, 6, 8, 9). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the dysferlin gene cause allelic autosomal recessive disorders including limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B), Miyoshi myopathy [1], [2] and distal anterior compartment myopathy [3], [4], [5], collectively known as the dysferlinopathies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A less common phenotype of dysferlin deficiency presents with rigid spine syndrome [1], [2], [3], [4], [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Typically patients present in their early twenties with slowly progressive weakness and high serum creatine kinase (CK) [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Approximately one-third of patients become wheelchair-dependent within 15 years of onset. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Clinically the heart is only mildly affected in one third of cases [8] and cognitive function is spared. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The phenotypic variants with a relatively restricted distribution of muscle weakness set the stage for potential regional vascular gene replacement therapy that could impact quality of life for this disorder [9], [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Single nucleotide changes [11], [12], the typical DYSF gene mutation, also favors success in gene transfer serving to protect the transgene product from immunorejection. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The dysferlin gene is large, with 55 exons so far identified spanning at least 150 kb of genomic DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>These exons predict a cDNA of approximately 6.5 kb and a protein of 2,088 amino acids [1], [2], [11], [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Dysferlin is a 237 kDa protein composed of a C-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane domain and a longer cytoplasmic oriented hydrophilic region with multiple C2 domains with implications for calcium and phospholipid binding [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Recent work has shown that loss of dysferlin compromises Ca2+-dependent membrane repair in skeletal muscle [15], [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Dysferlin-null muscle fibers fail to exclude dye entry even in the presence of Ca2+ strongly suggesting that Ca2+-dependent membrane repair requires dysferlin [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>There is also evidence from LGMD2B patients that ultrastructural membrane defects are a present and contributing factor to disease pathology [18], [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The importance of this system is emphasized when considering that skeletal muscle is mechanically active and predisposed to injury; thus, a robust membrane resealing mechanism must be present. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Absent or mutant dysferlin leads to impaired membrane repair and a cascade of events starting with muscle fiber necrosis resulting in muscle fiber loss and progressive limb weakness [16], [17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Packaging limitations of AAV, estimated at ∼5 kb, present obstacles for gene replacement strategies requiring cDNA cassettes exceeding this size constraint [20], [21], [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Alternative methods to bypass packaging limits include miniaturizing genes and trans-splicing approaches. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>These tactics have often compromised function and often result in reduced levels of gene expression at standard dosing levels [23], [24], [25], [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>A recent report suggests that the dysferlin gene can be delivered to muscle using a dual trans-splicing vector strategy with functional improvement of the defect in membrane repair [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>A second study using AAV to deliver a naturally occurring minidysferlin protein also showed some improvement in the membrane repair defect [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>A sentinel report indicating that AAV5 can package large transcripts up to 8.9 kb in size encouraged translational investigators to pursue gene replacement requiring inserts as large as the dysferlin gene [29], [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Subsequent studies showed the mechanism for AAV5 mediated delivery of genes &gt;5 kb was homologous recombination of 5′ and 3′ products of partially packaged virions rather than ability to package intact full size genomes [31], [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>In our own studies, we attempted to take advantage of the potential for AAV5 to deliver a dysferlin expression cassette of 7.7 kb in a single vector, including an optimized cDNA and muscle specific promoter to avoid off target effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrate highly favorable results with full restoration of dysferlin without compromise in function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In the diaphragm muscle of a mouse model of dysferlin deficiency, tetanic force was restored to normal and there was full resistance to fatigue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the newly restored dysferlin fully repaired membrane defects in dysferlin deficient mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>In addition, rAAV5.DYSF was successfully delivered through isolated limb perfusion to the limb muscles preferentially affected in entities such as Miyoshi myopathy and distal anterior compartment myopathy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Even more proximal sites can potentially be transduced by vascular delivery as we have demonstrated in the non-human primate [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Of particular note, consistent with recent observations, the full-length dysferlin product that restored these favorable results was mediated by recombination of homologous region of ∼1 kb present in 5′ and 3′ packaged vector genomes, [29], [31], [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Herein we present our findings that AAV5 delivery is a viable treatment modality for dysferlin gene replacement with far reaching implications for other monogenic disorders caused by mutations in large genes. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>A chimeric intron was added to augment RNA processing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The cassette (7.7 kb total) was packaged into an AAV2/5 vector using standard triple transfection and purified using iodixanol gradients and ion exchange chromatography. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>To test whether the full-length transgene was packaged or if homologous recombination was occurring, we performed alkaline electrophoresis and southern blot analysis on vector genomes purified from the vector preparation as previously described [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Two probes were designed, one within the 5′ MHCK7 promoter and one located in the 3′ end of dysferlin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>The findings unequivocally demonstrated that packaging did not exceed ∼5.2 kb with either probe consistent with recent reports [29], [31], [32] (Fig. 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>AAV is known to package single strand genomes with 3′ to 5′ polarity into the pre-formed particle in an ATP dependent process starting at the 3′ ITR terminus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with a vector “breakpoint” within this region based on the Southern blot data demonstrating packaging of up to ∼5.2 kb in length starting at a 3′ ITR termini. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Despite these packaging constraints, full-length dysferlin protein was readily demonstrated in skeletal muscle consistent with a process of homologous recombination occurring within transduced myocytes to generate the full-length intact dysferlin gene (Fig. 2C) [29], [31], [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Using electron microscopy, AAV5 virions had normal morphology, providing further evidence that the genomes packaged did not exceed capacity (Fig. 1C). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>AAV-mediated gene delivery remains a potential treatment option for some patients with muscular dystrophy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Challenges, however, for DYSF gene replacement relate to AAV packaging limits for genomes significantly larger than wild-type length (4.8 kb). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Fortunately, the sentinel report of Alloca et al. brought enhanced packaging by AAV5 to light and gave new hope for expanding the capacity of AAV gene transfer for monogenic disorders of large genes with the potential to be carried to the bedside [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>In their studies, efficient packaging, transduction, and expression of an 8.9 kb cassette of a large inherited gene causing blindness implied the ability to overcome the hurdle of a 5 kb size limitation for AAV for replacement therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Our current study along with three others [29], [31], [32] have demonstrated that homologous recombination of partially packaged genomes is the mechanism responsible for the generation of full-length transcripts rather than oversized packaging of the whole genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Regardless, AAV5 does exhibit enhanced plasticity regarding packaging constraints which is likely contributing to its ability to mediate production of full-length transcripts in muscle following homologous recombination [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>With regard to neuromuscular diseases, the findings provided a new perspective for conditions caused by mutations of large genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>DMD is the most common severe childhood muscular dystrophy and would seem to benefit from expression of the larger transcripts than mini- and micro-dystrophins that only partially restore physiologic function in the mdx mouse [9], [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Less common disorders, such as titin deficiency causing LGMD2J, and variants of congenital muscular dystrophy such as phenotypes caused by LARGE gene mutations would also benefit from expression of the full length protein [37], [38], [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Because of the success of Alloca et al., it was our intent to take advantage of the transduction capabilities of AAV5 for skeletal muscle [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>We targeted the dysferlin gene because of its relative frequency amongst the LGMDs [5], [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Our findings are supportive of the unique properties of AAV5 to express a 6.5 kb cDNA producing full length protein but the mechanism for expression of the dysferlin gene pointed in a different direction than reported for the series of retinal genes protecting against blindness [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Our studies confirmed that AAV5 followed traditional packaging limits for DYSF because analysis of packaged virions was consistent with a packaging limitation of ∼5 kb. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Thus, AAV5 virions transducing muscle fibers contained partial dysferlin vector genomes that mapped to both the 5′ and 3′ ends of the expression cassette and produced an intact expression cassette likely through homologous recombination upon reaching the nucleus [29], [31], [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>This enabled translation of the full length 237 kDa protein demonstrated by western blots following gene transfer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>The findings were equally robust following intramuscular and intravascular delivery, and the validity of the newly expressed protein was confirmed by its full restoration of physiologic function in the diaphragm and membrane repair capabilities in skeletal muscle. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Of particular importance, the potential for DYSF gene replacement has also been demonstrated by Lostal et al. with their comparable findings demonstrating expression of full-length dysferlin [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>These researchers used a dual vector strategy permitting the dysferlin cDNA to be split at the exon 28/29 junction and cloned it into two independent AAV vectors carrying the appropriate splicing sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Their work tested the efficiency of dual packaging into AAV2/1 by intramuscular injection of both vectors into a dysferlin-deficient mouse and a novel strategy using systemic delivery of dual vector administration of both rAAV2/1 and rAAV2/9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Overall, both IM and systemic vascular delivery via the tail vein of dysferlin-deficient mice showed improvement of muscle pathology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Their study also noted an improvement in membrane repair in the FDB that did not reach WT control levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>By systemic delivery they found low levels of transduction (1–4%) which is a current limitation of the dual vector approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>In a clinical setting, higher levels of gene expression may be required to achieve a clinically meaningful outcome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Lostal et al suggested that 30% levels of dysferlin may be needed (26). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>An additional report by Krahn et al. described a human minidysferlin protein that was identified in a patient with late-onset moderate dysferlinopathy [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>The 73 kDa protein lacks the consensus dysferlin N-terminus but maintains the wild-type C-terminus including the last two C2 domains and transmembrane domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>The authors packaged this minidysferlin cDNA in a cassette containing a C5.C12 promoter and delivered it to A/J dysferlin deficient mice using AAV2/1 and AAV2/9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Expression of the protein was confirmed in the TA and found to localize primarily to the cytoplasm of muscle fibers and to a lesser extent in the sarcolemma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>An examination of function revealed that the minidysferlin led to partial improvement in the membrane repair deficits accompanying the dysferlin-null FDB muscle fibers [28]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Our studies demonstrate clinical applicability for AAV5.DYSF gene transfer for dysferlin deficiency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>There are several advantages to using AAV5 to deliver the full-length dysferlin cDNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>One particular advantage is the ability to deliver the entire cassette with one vector, significantly reducing viral load compared to the dual vector strategy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>This is especially important with regards to translation in terms of feasibility of vector production and limiting capsid exposure for patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>A second advantage relates to full-length protein versus a miniature version. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Although mini-genes are desirable for practicality of standard AAV delivery, there is a compromise in protein function [28] and the potential for novel epitopes that may be immunogenic when delivered to patients [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>One potential concern with AAV5.dysferlin delivery is the presence of non-recombined vector genome fragments; however we showed only one mRNA and protein species was present in transduced muscle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>As with any other naturally occurring truncated transcript that could be produced; elimination would occur by nonsense mediated decay. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>An informal discussion with the FDA (Rodino-Klapac and Mendell personal communication) defined a potential path for a dysferlin clinical gene therapy trial assuming no problems were encountered in the toxicology/biodistribution studies done with the same rigor as other approved AAV vectors [41], [42], [43]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we have shown that AAV5.dysferlin delivery is a very promising therapeutic approach that could restore functional deficits in dysferlinopathy patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Specific muscle groups could be targeted by intramuscular delivery for dysferlin phenotypes that include Miyoshi myopathy and distal anterior compartment myopathy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>In addition, based on our experience using fluoroscopy guided vascular delivery studies in the non-human primate we can thread the intravascular catheter to the take off point of specific vessels 9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>This opens up clinical pathways for gene delivery to particular muscle groups relevant to either LGMD2B or Miyoshi myopathy including quadriceps and hamstring muscles, and the anterior or the posterior compartments of the lower limb. </plain></SENT>
