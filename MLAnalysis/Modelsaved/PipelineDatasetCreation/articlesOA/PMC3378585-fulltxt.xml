Because the safflower has a large and complex genome, the development of its genomic resources has been delayed. Second-generation Illumina sequencing is now an efficient route for generating an enormous volume of sequences that can represent a large number of genes and their expression levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>To investigate the genes and pathways that might control flavonoids and other secondary metabolites in the safflower, we used Illumina sequencing to perform a <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of the safflower tubular flower tissue transcriptome. We obtained a total of 4.69 Gb in clean nucleotides comprising 52,119,104 clean sequencing reads, 195,320 contigs, and 120,778 unigenes. Based on similarity searches with known proteins, we annotated 70,342 of the unigenes (about 58% of the identified unigenes) with cut-off E-values of 10<sup>&#8722;5</sup>. In total, 21,943 of the safflower unigenes were found to have COG classifications, and BLAST2GO assigned 26,332 of the unigenes to 1,754 GO term annotations. In addition, we assigned 30,203 of the unigenes to 121 KEGG pathways. When we focused on genes identified as contributing to flavonoid biosynthesis and the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, which are important pathways that control flower and seed quality, respectively, we found that these genes were fairly well conserved in the safflower genome compared to those of other plants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Our study provides abundant genomic data for <italic>Carthamus tinctorius</italic> L. and offers comprehensive sequence resources for studying the safflower.

The safflower plant yields a variety of products, including the numerous secondary metabolites of its flowers and the unsaturated fatty acids in its seeds, many of which are very beneficial to human health. Although the safflower is a minor crop, it is one of the oldest crops in human history, and it is cultivated worldwide; in 2007, safflower cultivation accounted for &#8764; 795,118 ha across the globe <xref rid="pone.0038653-Gecgel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Traditionally, this crop was grown for its flowers, which were a source of yellow and red dyes for clothing and food. Safflower oil first was first used in the paint industry, but due to its health benefits, it is now produced commercially for cooking oil and other uses <xref rid="pone.0038653-Koyama1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038653-Storlien1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038653-Melancon1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038653-Tabrett1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>In plants, primary metabolites are organic compounds that are directly involved in normal growth, development and reproduction. In contrast, secondary metabolites often play important roles in defending the plant against herbivores and diseases. The flavonoids are a large group of secondary metabolites that humans have long used for medicines <xref rid="pone.0038653-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038653-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, toning, and other purposes. Safflower flavonoid extracts have been clinically used for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease in China <xref rid="pone.0038653-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038653-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and Japan for centuries. The safflower is a native plant whose flowers have long been processed into a Chinese herbal medicine called <italic>Chuanhonghua</italic> in China Jianyang country. In China, safflower is mainly cultivated for the medicinal properties of its flower tissues. To date, &#8764; 50 secondary metabolites have been identified in safflower flower extracts; most of them are generalized flavonoids, a class of modulators that mediate bifunctional interactions at vicinal ATP- and steroid-binding sites <xref rid="pone.0038653-Conseil1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. These include carthamone, safflor yellow A, hydroxysafflor yellow A, 6-hydroxykaempferol, 6-hydroxykaempferol-3-o-&#946;-D-glucoside, kaempferol <xref rid="pone.0038653-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038653-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038653-Fan1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and others. The abundance of flavonoids as secondary metabolites makes the safflower a good model for investigating flavonoid biosynthesis in plants, and the related genes and pathways. This should provide a better understanding of the genes responsible for regulating natural products, and could help us improve the use of these natural products for human health.</p><p>In recent years, researchers have focused on examining the genetic diversity of the safflower. For example, Pahlavani <italic>et al</italic>. reported on the inheritance of flower color and spininess <xref rid="pone.0038653-Pahlavani1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, while Chapman <italic>et al</italic>. reported on the DNA sequence diversity and origins of the cultivated safflower, along with its development and polymorphisms, and the cross-taxon utility of EST-SSR markers <xref rid="pone.0038653-Chapman1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038653-Chapman2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038653-Chapman3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. More recently, Li <italic>et al</italic>. found that there are at least 236 known microRNAs (miRNAs) expressed in the safflower, 100 of which are conserved across plants <xref rid="pone.0038653-Li3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. To date, however, the safflower genome has not been fully sequenced, and relatively little is known about its encoded genes. As of October 2011, only 567 nucleotide sequences, 41,588 expressed sequence tags (ESTs), 162 proteins and 0 genes from <italic>Carthamus tinctorius</italic> had been deposited in the NCBI&#8217;s GenBank database.</p><p>EST sequencing has traditionally been the core technology used for the discovery of reference transcripts. However, it has some inherent limitations, such as low throughput, high cost and a long experimental cycle. In recent years, researchers have developed a high-throughput sequencing technology called Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) <xref rid="pone.0038653-Patel1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Various platforms utilize NGS, such as the Illumina Genome Analyzer, the Roche/454 Genome Sequencer FLX Instrument, and the ABI SOLiD System; these have proven to be powerful and cost-effective tools for advanced research in many areas, including genome sequencing, genome re-sequencing, miRNA expression profiling, DNA methylation analysis, and especially the <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome sequencing of non-model organisms <xref rid="pone.0038653-Mardis1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038653-Morozova1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. This method of transcriptome analysis is fast and simple because it does not require bacterial cloning of the cDNAs. Instead, direct cDNA sequencing generates an extraordinary depth of short reads. It is a more comprehensive and efficient way to measure transcriptome composition, obtain RNA expression patterns, and discover new genes. In addition, this approach is very sensitive, and thus allows the detection of low-abundance transcripts. Recent transcriptomic studies on <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0038653-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, mouse <xref rid="pone.0038653-Franco1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, and human <xref rid="pone.0038653-Hafner1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> cells have demonstrated that this approach is well-suited for surveying the complexity of eukaryotic transcriptomes by <italic>de novo</italic> assembly.</p><p>In this study, we used NGS technology to survey the poly (A) + transcriptome of <italic>Carthamus tinctorius</italic> L. flower tissues. The coverage of the transcriptome was &#8764; 4.7 Gb of clean nucleotides, and thus comprehensive enough to discover all known genes and major metabolic pathways in this transcriptome. This dataset will serve as a public information platform for gene expression, genomics, and functional genomics in <italic>Carthamus tinctorius</italic> L. The assembled and annotated transcriptome sequences provide a valuable resource for identifying most of the genes expressed in the safflower.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Flower Transcriptome Sequencing Output and <italic>de novo</italic> Assembly</title><p>To comprehensively cover the safflower flower transcriptome, total RNA was extracted from the tubular tissues of red/orange and white flowers.

The KEGG pathway database contains information on networks of intracellular molecular interactions, and their organism-specific variations <xref rid="pone.0038653-Kanehisa1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. To identify the biological pathways in the safflower, we mapped the annotated sequences to the reference canonical pathways contained in the KEGG database. In total, we assigned 30,203 unigenes to 121 KEGG pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038653.s001">File S1</xref>). The most highly represented category was &#8220;metabolic pathways,&#8221; with 6,948 members. The &#8220;biosynthesis of secondary metabolites&#8221; and &#8220;plant-pathogen interaction&#8221; pathways were also well represented, with 3,598 members and 2,348 members, respectively. Many genes corresponded to pathways involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, including &#8220;flavonoid biosynthesis&#8221; (274 genes), &#8220;flavone and flavonol biosynthesis&#8221; (114 genes), &#8220;isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis&#8221; (77 genes), &#8220;tropane, piperidine and pyridine alkaloid biosynthesis&#8221; (72 genes), &#8220;glucosinolate biosynthesis&#8221; (60 genes), &#8220;synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies&#8221; (35 genes), &#8220;indole alkaloid biosynthesis&#8221; (22 genes), &#8220;anthocyanin biosynthesis&#8221; (20 genes), and &#8220;betalain biosynthesis&#8221; (4 genes). Plants often produce secondary metabolites for pathogen defense, so it is unsurprising that 2,348 unigenes were mapped to pathways involved in plant-pathogen interactions, such as &#8220;phagosomes&#8221; (422) and &#8220;natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity&#8221; (126). In addition, many genes were related to &#8220;fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism&#8221;; these pathways included &#8220;alpha-linolenic acid metabolism&#8221; (268), &#8220;biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids&#8221; (216), &#8220;fatty acid metabolism&#8221; (204), &#8220;fatty acid biosynthesis&#8221; (143), &#8220;linoleic acid metabolism&#8221; (105) and &#8220;arachidonic acid metabolism&#8221; (48). Finally, some genes also distributed to the plant hormone biosynthesis pathways, including &#8220;zeatin biosynthesis&#8221; (361) and &#8220;brassinosteroid biosynthesis&#8221; (28).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Analysis of Flavonoid Biosynthesis-related Pathways and Genes in the Safflower</title><p>The flavonoids include flavanone, flavones, flavonols, quinochalcone and their derivatives. Because the pharmacological effects of safflower flavonoids, we focused on the related genes in this study. In the safflower, quinochalcone is the product of a chalcone, which is oxidized in the A ring and then substituted by glucoses in one or more positions to achieve the final structure. In our annotated safflower flower tissue transcriptome datasets, we identified multiple unigenes encoding enzymes involved in known flavonoid biosynthesis pathways. Their sequencing depth was more than 10-fold coverages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038653-g004">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038653.s002">File S2</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0038653-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0038653.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Predicted flavonoid biosynthetic pathway-related genes and products in the safflower flower.</title><p>The pathways leading to the biosynthesis of different flavonoids.

At the beginning of this process, one molecule of 4-coumaroyl-CoA and three molecules of Malonyl-CoA are catalyzed by the polyketide synthase, chalcone synthase (CHS, EC 2.3.1.74, in KEGG database), into 4,2&#8242;,4&#8242;,6&#8242;-tetrahydroxychalcone. CHS is the first committed enzyme in this pathway. Five safflower unigenes and two hypothetical unigenes were identified as CHIs; four of them were more than 1000 bp in length. The intermediate, 4,2&#8242;,4&#8242;,6&#8242;-tetrahydroxychalcone, is key for the biosynthesis of both quinochalcones and flavonoids; it may be hydroxylated and glycosylated, leading to the production of carthamone (in red flowers) and hydroxysafflor yellow A. Hydroxysafflor yellow A, which was first identified in 1993 by Meselhy <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="pone.0038653-Meselhy1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, is the main component of the red/orange color of their flowers, and it is the most widely studied chemical in the safflower. Previous studies have shown that hydroxysafflor yellow A has the following properties: it can enhance the survival of vascular endothelial cells under hypoxia <xref rid="pone.0038653-Ji1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>; it can protect against LPS-induced acute lung injury, which is thought to be associated with the inhibition of p38 MAPK, the activation of NF-kappaB p65, and changes in inflammatory cytokine expression <xref rid="pone.0038653-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>; it might be a promising antifibrotic agent in chronic liver disease <xref rid="pone.0038653-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>; it can significantly inhibit the neuronal damage induced by exposure to glutamate and sodium cyanide (NaCN) in cultured fetal cortical cells <xref rid="pone.0038653-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>; it can protect against mitochondrial injuries in rat cortexes induced by cerebral ischemia <xref rid="pone.0038653-Tian1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>; and it can protect human umbilical vein endothelial cells from hypoxia-induced injuries by inhibiting apoptosis and cell cycle arrest <xref rid="pone.0038653-Ji2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. As a substrate, hydroxysafflor yellow A can be catalyzed to carthamin and safflor yellow A. One study showed that injection of safflor yellow A is a safe and effective treatment for coronary heart disease angina pectoris (CHD-AP) with Xin-blood stagnation syndrome (XBSS) <xref rid="pone.0038653-Zhang3" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The enzymes responsible for catalyzing 4,2&#8242;,4&#8242;,6&#8242;-tetrahydroxychalcone to quinochalcones are not well understood at this time, so they were not assessed in the present study.</p><p>Subsequently, chalcone isomerase (CHI; EC 5.5.1.6) catalyzes 4,2&#8242;,4&#8242;,6&#8242;-tetrahydroxychalcone into naringenin. Four CHI unigenes were identified in the safflower, showing high unique-mapped-reads. In one branch of the biosynthetic pathway in the safflower, naringenin can be hydroxylated at the 6 position and glycosylated at the 5 position to produce 5,6,7,4-tetrahydroxyflavanone-5-O-&#946; -D-glucoside (neocarthamin), or it may be hydroxylated and glycosylated at the 6 and 7 positions to produce 5,6,7,4&#8242;-tetrahydroxyflavanone-6,7-di-O-&#946; -D-glucoside. The more highly conserved pathway in plants is for naringenin to be catalyzed by flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H, also called naringenin 3-dioxygenase; EC 1.14.11.9) into dihydrokaempferol, which is a very important intermediate product. We identified six naringenin 3-dioxygenases in the safflower.</p><p>Dihydrokaempferol can be converted by flavonol synthase (FLS; EC 1.14.11.23) to kaempferol. Eight FLS unigenes were identified in the safflower. Kaempferol can be hydroxylated at its 6 position and then glycosylated by flavonol 3-O-glucosyltransferase (3GT; EC 2.4.1.91) to 6-hydroxykaempferol-3-O- &#946;-D-glucoside or 6-hydroxykaempferol-3,6-di-O-&#946; -D-glucoside. Only one 3GT unigene was identified in the safflower (Unigene7139_safflower; 1,815 bp). Kaempferol can be converted by 3GT to produce kaempferol-3-O- &#946;-D-glucoside, which can then be converted to kaempferol-3-O- &#946;-rutinoside by flavonol-3-O-glucoside L-rhamnosyltransferase (3GRT; EC 2.4.1.159). In our study, kaempferol-3-O- &#946;-rutinoside was commonly found in the white flower tissues. One 3GRT unigene was identified in the safflower flower (Unigene59018_safflower).</p><p>Kaempferol can also be converted to quercetin by flavonoid 3&#8242;-hydroxylase (F3&#8242;H, also called flavonoid 3&#8242;-monooxygenase; EC 1.14.13.21) or flavonoid 3&#8242;, 5&#8242;-hydroxylase (F3&#8242;5&#8242;H; EC 1.14.13.88) by adding a hydroxyl to the 3&#8242; position of ring B. F3&#8242;H was found to be the largest family of safflower flavonoid biosynthesis enzymes, comprising 39 members ranging from 165 bp to 1,456 bp. In contrast, only three F3&#8242;5&#8242;H unigenes were identified. In the next step of this pathway, 3GT can catalyze quercetin to quercetin-3-O- &#946;-D-glucoside. As an optional pathway, dihydrokaempferol can be converted to dihydroquercetin by F3&#8242;5&#8242;H or F3&#8242;H, and then dihydroquercetin can be deoxidized to leucoanthocyanidin by dihydroflavonol-4-reductase (DFR; EC 1.1.1.219). Three DFR unigenes were identified in the safflower flower. Finally, leucoanthocyanidin can be catalyzed to catechin by leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR; EC 1.17.1.3). The LAR family was the second largest family identified in this pathway; 10 members were found in the safflower, ranging from 202 bp to 1,382 bp.</p><p>Although we searched for flavone synthase (FNS) genes in the transcriptome sequencing data of the safflower, we did not identify any such genes in this study. We also failed to find any anthocyanidine-encoding genes; however, we did identify four anthocyanidin synthase (ANS, also called leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase)-encoding genes, suggesting that the genes encoding other anthocyanidine-related products may exist but have not yet been identified in the flower.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>qRT-PCR Analysis of the Flavonoid Synthesis Related Genes in the Safflower</title><p>To confirm that the unigenes from sequencing and computational analysis were indeed expressed and also to analyze the difference of gene expression profile between red and white color flowers, twelve unigenes related to the ten families of safflower flavonoid synthesis were chosen for qRT-PCR analysis. In the qRT-PCR analysis, to get more information, we used four flower materials including of flowering day2 and day4 of both white and red flowers for further compare instead of day1 and day3 of flowering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038653-g005">Figure 5</xref>, the ratios were resulted from the comparing analysis of each gene to 28S, unigene82078).</p><fig id="pone-0038653-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0038653.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>qRT-PCR analysis of 12 flavonoid biosynthetic pathway-related candidate unigenes in white and red flowers.</title><p>W2, flowering day 2 of the white flower; W4, flowering day 4 of the white flower; R2, flowering day 2 of the red flower; R4, flowering day 4 of the red flower.

Among them, the CHS gene (unigene96945) showed very high expression in the red flowers with the ratios of 174.16 and 84.5 on flowering day2 and day4 individually; comparing to the ratios in the red flower, this gene showed much lower expression in the white flowers with ratios of 9.85 and 11.08 on flowering day2 and day4 separately. This result indicated that CHS gene (unigene96945) is very important for safflower flavonoid synthesis. The similar expression profile can be observed when considering the two detected CHI genes (unigene16741 and unigene27082); they showed much higher expression in the red flower than in the white flower, especially the unigene27082 with ratios of 32.0 and 41.64. For the two F3H genes (unigene45665 and unigene4561), they showed a relatively medium expression in the two color flowers. The F3&#8242;H gene (unigene104057) also showed very high expression on flowering day2 of the red flower with ratio of 95.01, suggesting that at the early stage of flowering (day2), hydroxylation is an important modification for the red flower flavonoid synthesis. Similar expression profiles can also be observed in the genes of FLS (unigene29190), DFR (unigene98353) and 3GT (unigene71390). On the contrary, the F3&#8242;5&#8242;H gene (unigene2547) showed higher expression in the later stage of flowering (day4) than in the early stage of flowering (day2) in both white and red flowers. Among all of the twelve genes, only the LAR gene (unigene25256) showed much higher expression in the white flowers with ratios of 13.09 and 8.17 on day2 and day4 individually comparing to the ratios of 0.30 and 0.22 on day2 and day4 in the red flowers, indicating that as a substrate much more leucoanthocyandin is produced in the white flower than in the red flower.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>High-throughput mRNA sequencing technology is especially suitable for gene expression profiling in non-model organisms that lack genomic sequence data. Prior to this study, most sequencing efforts in the safflower were based on EST sequencing; very few tags had been reported in public databases and little genetic or genomic information was available. Here, we used RNA-Seq technology to profile the safflower flower transcriptome on the Illumina HiSeq&#8482; 2000 platform, obtained 4.6 Gb of coverage with 52,119,104 clean sequencing reads, and identified a total of 120,778 unigenes from <italic>de novo</italic> assembly. Among them, 70,342 unigenes were successfully annotated (about 58% of the assembled unigenes), suggesting their relatively conserved functions. We assessed not only the gene or protein names and descriptions, but also their putative conserved domains, gene ontology terms, and potential metabolic pathways. This work will certainly improve our understanding of the processes involved in regulating the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and the development of safflower flower tissues. Compared with previous transcriptomic studies in other plants, such as <italic>Acacia auriculiformis</italic>, <italic>Acacia mangium</italic>

<xref rid="pone.0038653-Haoda1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, we herein report more contigs and unigenes, suggesting that the safflower contains very abundant gene resources. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt using Illumina paired-end sequencing technology for the <italic>de novo</italic> sequencing and assembly (without a reference genome) of the safflower flower transcriptome. We believe our data will provide important new insights and facilitate further studies of safflower genes and their functions.</p><p>In terms of medicinal and pharmaceutical use, the properties of the safflower flower largely depend on its flavonoid profile. Since gaining new insight into the biosynthesis and transcriptional regulation of flavonoids in the safflower should accelerate the engineering of this pathway in the future, we focused on the flavonoid biosynthesis genes identified in the present work. Almost all of the genes for the main flavonoid biosynthesis pathway were identified (except for the flavone synthesis gene), indicating that this pathway was rather well conserved in the safflower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038653-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038653.s003">File S3</xref>). Many of these genes appeared to form multi-gene families, implying that the genome of the safflower, like those of many other higher plants, went through one or more rounds of genome duplication during its evolution. However, the actual flavonoid pigments of plants are highly diverse in structure and color, reflecting the diversity of plants and their metabolic pathways. Indeed, the safflower is likely to possess some unique, yet-unidentified flavonoid-related molecules. Therefore, we further surveyed other genes that might be involved in the various branch or terminal pathways of flavonoid biosynthesis. KEGG predictions allowed us to identify an additional 227 genes that also contributed to generalized flavonoid biosynthesis, including members of the CYP family (electron carrier/heme binding/iron ion binding/monooxygenase/oxygen binding), the O-methyltransferase, O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase family, and the glycosyltransferase family, which are involved in uniquely modifying the flavonoid skeleton to yield the final products (the other related genes are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038653.s003">File S3</xref>).</p><p>The safflower is a multipurpose crop, but its main use worldwide is as an oil crop. Its main seed oil components are linoleic acid (71&#8211;75%), oleic acid (16&#8211;20%), palmitic acid (6&#8211;8%) and stearic acid (2&#8211;3%) <xref rid="pone.0038653-Gecgel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, most of which are unsaturated fatty acids. Safflower petals also contain alpha linolenic acid (15&#8211;19%), palmitic acids (14&#8211;16%), gamma linolenic acid (2&#8211;3%), and decanoic and dodecanoic acids (2&#8211;5%) <xref rid="pone.0038653-Srinivas1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Safflower linoleic acid may be beneficial for weight loss and/or glycemic control for type-2 diabetes <xref rid="pone.0038653-Norris1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, while dietary supplementation with safflower oil and olive oil was shown to rescue aberrant embryonic arachidonic acid and nitric oxide metabolism and prevent embryopathy in diabetic rats <xref rid="pone.0038653-Higa1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. In our sequencing of transcripts from 1&#8211;3d flowers, we identified 149 genes that distributed to the &#8220;biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids&#8221; category (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038653.s004">File S4</xref>; sequencing depth &gt;10). These were mainly fatty acid desaturases, including stearoyl-ACP desaturase, which was cloned in 1992 by Knutzon <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="pone.0038653-Knutzon1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, along with FAD2, FAD3, FAD5A, FAD6, FAD7 and FAD8 <xref rid="pone.0038653-Arondel1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038653-Okuley1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038653-Gibson1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. The expression of these gene products during this flowering stage suggests that the unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis pathway is rather well conserved in the safflower with respect to Arabidopsis, Rape and Cabbage. Although we only identified one oil biosynthesis gene in safflower flowers, namely that encoding stearoyl-ACP desaturase, our data may facilitate the future study of other related genes.</p><p>In conclusion, this sequence collection represents the first major genomic resource for the safflower, <italic>Carthamus tinctorius</italic> L. Using Illumina sequencing technology, we surveyed the flower transcriptome of the safflower, assembled 120,778 unigenes and annotated 70,342 of these unigenes. These findings provided comprehensive coverage, suggesting that we identified almost of the all known genes from the major metabolic pathways operating in the safflower flower. Our KEGG prediction results suggest that the flavonoid biosynthesis and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis pathway-related genes are rather well conserved in the safflower. Overall, we identified more than 200 pathways as being represented in the safflower whole-flower transcriptome. Further analysis of these pathway-related genes will improve our understanding of the safflower&#8217;s unique and common features. This study again demonstrates that Illumina sequencing technology may be applied as a rapid and cost-effective method for <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome analysis of non-model plants for which genomic information is unavailable.
