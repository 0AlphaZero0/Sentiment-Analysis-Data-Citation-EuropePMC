By using a combination of cell sorting by flow cytometry, whole genome amplification (WGA), and 454 pyrosequencing, we obtained metagenomic data for two natural picophytoplankton populations from the coastal upwelling waters off central Chile. About 60% of the reads of each sample could be mapped to the genome of <italic>Bathycoccus</italic> strain from the Mediterranean Sea (RCC1105), representing a total of 9 Mbp (sample T142) and 13 Mbp (sample T149) of non-redundant <italic>Bathycoccus</italic> genome sequences. WGA did not amplify all regions uniformly, resulting in unequal coverage along a given chromosome and between chromosomes. The identity at the DNA level between the metagenomes and the cultured genome was very high (96.3% identical bases for the three larger chromosomes over a 360 kbp alignment).

Until now, only a small number of these organisms have been brought into culture <xref rid="pone.0039648-Vaulot1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, in particular members of the Chlorophyta (prasinophytes and Mamiellophyceae). Most of our knowledge about key groups and about diversity within these groups is based upon the genetic analysis of the 18S rRNA gene in marine samples. In many cases however, sequences obtained using classical approaches (universal primers applied to filtered samples) are dominated by heterotrophic eukaryote groups such as marine alveolates or stramenopiles. In order to focus on photosynthetic groups, three major approaches have been used: (1) cloning/sequencing of filtered samples of plastid genes such as 16S rRNA <xref rid="pone.0039648-Fuller1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039648-McDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> or <italic>psbA</italic>

These different approaches, despite sometimes providing conflicting images of the small eukaryote community <xref rid="pone.0039648-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, have converged towards establishing that a few groups appear to dominate open-ocean, meso- and oligo-trophic waters: Prymnesiophyceae, Chrysophyceae, Pelagophyceae, and two clades of prasinophytes (VII and IX) <xref rid="pone.0039648-Jardillier1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039648-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039648-Cuvelier1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039648-Viprey1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039648-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In these waters, many of the dominant clades within these groups have very few or no cultured representatives, and no information is available on their morphology and physiology. In contrast, in temperate coastal as well as arctic pelagic waters, the small photosynthetic eukaryote community is dominated by Mamiellophyceae <xref rid="pone.0039648-Not1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039648-OKelly1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039648-Lovejoy1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, a group of small green algae for which the three major genera <italic>Bathycoccus</italic>, <italic>Micromonas</italic>, and <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> are easily isolated in culture.

Obtaining genomic information from uncultivated populations would allow exploring their physiological adaptation and could provide clues for their isolation.</p><p>In the last decade, metagenomics approaches have been developed for marine microbial communities <xref rid="pone.0039648-Venter1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. These approaches revealed the existence and ubiquity of processes such as photo-heterotrophy among bacteria <xref rid="pone.0039648-Bj1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. However, until very recently metagenomics have not been applied to eukaryotic populations. The first reason is that filtered samples that are used in general for metagenomic studies are dominated by prokaryotic sequences <xref rid="pone.0039648-Piganeau1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Second, eukaryote genomes can be very large with many repeated genes, such that metagenomic data carry little information <xref rid="pone.0039648-Massana1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. One approach, proposed a few years ago for prokaryotes <xref rid="pone.0039648-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, has been gaining popularity lately. It consists in the coupling flow cytometry sorting, which permits to obtain specific cellular groups based on their size and pigment content, with Whole Genome Amplification (WGA), which allows obtaining enough material for genome sequencing with next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies such as 454 pyrosequencing. This approach allowed, for example, reconstructing the genome of UCYN-A, a group of small nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria <xref rid="pone.0039648-Tripp1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Recent work demonstrated that this strategy is applicable to small eukaryotes, both autotrophic <xref rid="pone.0039648-Cuvelier1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039648-Lepre1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039648-Monier1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and heterotrophic <xref rid="pone.0039648-Heywood1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. This strategy allowed for example Yoon et al. <xref rid="pone.0039648-Yoon1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> to retrieve genomic information on a group of uncultivated eukaryotes, the picobiliphytes <xref rid="pone.0039648-Not2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p>In the present paper, we report metagenomic data from two natural picoplankton populations sampled in the Pacific upwelling off the Chile coast.

As previously reported <xref rid="pone.0039648-Lepre1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039648-Shi2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, 18S rRNA gene clone libraries for these samples were dominated by members of the Mamiellophyceae, a novel class of small green algae previously classified within Prasinophyceae <xref rid="pone.0039648-Marin1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Among these, <italic>Micromonas</italic> and <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> dominated in sample T142, while <italic>Bathycoccus</italic> and <italic>Micromonas</italic> dominated in T149. In T149, sequences from Chrysophyceae and parasitic Syndiniales (Alveolata) were also recovered.

Each MDA amplified sample was sequenced on a 454 machine (half run) yielding about 670,000 reads, each with an average length &#8764;420 bp. Reads were assembled into contigs using either the default 454 assembler (Newbler) or the Geneious assembler after trimming to remove low quality ends (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Material and Methods</xref>). The former assembler yielded less contigs than the latter (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0039648-t001">Table 1</xref>) including fewer long contigs (&gt;500 bp). Most of the following analyses have been done on the contigs generated by Geneious with the exception of the metabolic gene analyses (see below), which were performed early with Newbler contigs.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0039648-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0039648.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Summary of metagenomic sequences and assemblies for eastern South Pacific picoeukaryote samples T142 and T149.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0039648-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0039648.t001"/></alternatives></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Taxonomic Composition of the Metagenomic Sequences</title><p>In order to determine the taxonomic composition of the assemblage from which the metagenomic sequences originated, we began by searching for SSU rRNA gene within contigs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039648.s005">Table S1</xref>). Although the number of contigs harbouring SSU rRNA genes was slightly higher in sample T149 than T142, their phylogenetic composition was very similar. In both samples, we found nuclear 18S rRNA gene signature for <italic>Bathycoccus</italic> (99.9% identity) but not for other Mamiellophyceae. In contrast, we found plastid and mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene signatures for two other Mamiellophyceae, <italic>Micromonas</italic> and <italic>Ostreococcus</italic>. The only other eukaryotic signatures came from a Chrysophyceae (plastid) in T142 and from a Dictyochophyceae in T149. Although eukaryotes were targeted during flow cytometry sorting, we also found several 16S rRNA genes from bacteria in both samples. All bacterial signatures were affiliated to clades that are typical of the marine environment, in particular the alpha-proteobacteria <italic>Candidatus</italic> Pelagibacter and <italic>Roseobacter</italic>, as well as several Sargasso Sea clades (SAR) <xref rid="pone.0039648-Giovannoni1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p><p>In a second step, we subjected both contigs and reads to a global BLASTN search against GenBank and analyzed the results with MEGAN, which provides, when possible, a taxonomic affiliation for each sequence using the Last Common Ancestor (LCA) algorithm <xref rid="pone.0039648-Huson1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The two samples T142 and T149 had very similar composition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039648.s006">Table S2</xref>). Slightly more than 30% of the reads were affiliated to eukaryotes with a small fraction (6% of total) corresponding to Mamiellophyceae, especially <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> (4% of total) and <italic>Micromonas</italic> (slightly more than 1% of total). It should be noted that while we clearly identified <italic>Bathycoccus</italic> as a key eukaryote in both samples based on rRNA analysis, the number of reads attributed to this genus by BLASTN analysis was small because the genome of <italic>Bathycoccus</italic> was not available in public databases at the time of this analysis. The contribution of other eukaryotic groups expected to be encountered within picoeukaryotes <xref rid="pone.0039648-Vaulot1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> such as stramenopiles, haptophytes, or alveolates was small, which is in part explained by the low number of sequenced genomes available for these groups. About 8% of the reads were affiliated to bacteria especially Proteobacteria such as <italic>Candidatus</italic> Pelagibacter (SAR11), confirming the results from the rRNA gene analysis. Very few reads were attributed to Archaea or viruses. The majority of reads (&#8764;60%) could not be affiliated to any taxon either because they had no hits in GenBank or because the LCA of their hits was unresolved (for example, if the best hits consist of a mixture of eukaryotic and bacterial sequences, the LCA will be &#8216;cellular organism&#8217;). MEGAN analysis of Geneious contigs provided similar results, with an increased fraction of contigs, when compared to reads, attributed to bacteria (18%), and therefore fewer contigs with unknown affiliation (50% <italic>vs.</italic> 60% for reads).</p><p>Key problems with the public databases are the over-representation of irrelevant sequences and the absence of relevant sequences. Analysis of the SSU rRNA gene both in clone libraries (see above) and in contigs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039648.s005">Table S1</xref>) suggested that <italic>Bathycoccus</italic> was the dominant eukaryote in both samples. At the time of this analysis, we gained access to the genome sequence of a <italic>Bathycoccus prasinos</italic> strain (RCC1105) isolated from the Mediterranean Sea <xref rid="pone.0039648-Moreau1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, which was not yet publicly available then, but has been deposited to Genbank since (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Material and Methods</xref>). In order to estimate the fractions of contigs that could belong to <italic>Bathycoccus</italic>, we constructed a protein database including proteins from nuclear genomes of <italic>Bathycoccus</italic> RCC1105 and unicellular eukaryotes (Mamiellophyceae, diatoms, haptophytes, pelagophytes, fungi), mitochondria and plastid genomes from selected eukaryotes, genomes from typical marine archaea and bacteria such as that of the bacterium <italic>Candidatus</italic> Pelagibacter, unicellular cyanobacteria or <italic>Thermococcus</italic>, as well as a few eukaryotic virus genomes. Contigs were searched with BLASTX against this database and results were filtered using an algorithm specifically designed to extract Mamiellophyceae sequences using fine-tuned identity and coverage thresholds for each orthologous protein sequence (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Material and Methods</xref>). Again, results were similar for both samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039648.s007">Table S3</xref>). On average for the two samples, 31.5% of the contigs could be attributed to <italic>Bathycoccus</italic>, 0.45% to <italic>Micromonas</italic> and 0.36% to <italic>Ostreococcus.</italic> This corresponded to 69.8, 0.10, and 0.12% of the reads, respectively, indicating that <italic>Bathycoccus</italic> contigs had a higher coverage than contigs belonging to other organisms. About 4.7% of contigs (5.0% of reads) could be assigned to Mamiellophyceae without a clear relationship to any of the three genera. Very few contigs could be attributed to the other eukaryotic genomes available. Among prokaryotes, only <italic>Candidatus</italic> Pelagibacter strain HTCC1062 genome recruited a significant number of contigs, in agreement with the MEGAN and rRNA gene analyses reported above. A few contigs (5 for T142 and 17 for T149) could be assigned to available large double stranded Mamiellophyceae viruses <xref rid="pone.0039648-Moreau2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.</p><p>The predicted protein sequences from T142 and T149 contigs attributed to <italic>Bathycoccus</italic> had an average amino-acid identity of 96.0 and 95.9%, respectively, with those from the <italic>Bathycoccus</italic> sequenced genome. This amino-acid identity is an overestimate because our taxonomic affiliation only retains genes with greater than 80% amino-acid identity (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The detailed assignment of contigs to individual <italic>Bathycoccus</italic> chromosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039648.s008">Table S4</xref>) demonstrated some differences between the coverage of each chromosome. Specific chromosomes such as the outlier chromosomes 14 and 19 <xref rid="pone.0039648-Moreau1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> or the chloroplast genome had a lower coverage.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Assembly of T142 and T149 Reads Against the <italic>Bathycoccus</italic> RCC1105 Genome</title><p>Since BLASTX analysis revealed that a large fraction of the contigs could be recruited to <italic>Bathycoccus</italic> RCC1105 genome, a direct assembly of reads was performed against the sequenced <italic>Bathycoccus</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0039648-t002">Table 2</xref>). Direct assembly was coherent with contigs assignment through BLASTX (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039648.s008">Table S4</xref>). There was a good correlation between the numbers of reads recruited by both approaches with a slightly higher number of reads (about 3%) for the latter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039648.s001">Figure S1</xref>). This was expected because direct assembly relies on nucleotide identities and is therefore more stringent. Direct assembly provides detailed information on the genome coverage. On average, while coverage depth (i.e., the average number of reads covering a given base from the reference chromosome) was around 10&#215; and similar between both samples, the coverage fraction (i.e., the fraction of the reference genome covered by at least one read) was higher in T149 (88%) than in T142 (62%). Both coverage depth and coverage fraction varied widely among chromosomes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0039648-t002">Table 2</xref>), the two indices being somehow related since chromosomes with a higher coverage fraction had also generally a larger coverage depth. While in general individual chromosomes followed the general trend with sample T149 having a better coverage than T142, for some chromosomes such as 2 or 7, average coverage depth was higher for T142. In fact, coverage fraction and depth appeared much more variable for T142 than for T149 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039648-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). A weak relationship was observed between nuclear chromosome coverage and GC content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039648-g001">Figure 1A</xref>; Spearman correlation, T142: &#961;&#8202;=&#8202;0.40 p&#8202;=&#8202;0.04; T149 &#961;&#8202;=&#8202;0.57, p&#8202;=&#8202;0.004). In particular, the two <italic>Bathycoccus</italic> outlier chromosomes 14 and 19 and the chloroplast genome that have lower GC content <xref rid="pone.0039648-Moreau1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> had low coverage fraction and low coverage depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039648-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Surprisingly, the mitochondrial genome had a very good coverage despite its low GC content. When looking at the detail of coverage depth along each chromosome, the situation appeared much more complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039648-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Coverage appeared very unequal and varied between the two samples. Some regions, for example the one located between positions 765 and 780 kbp on chromosome 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039648-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), were well-covered in both samples but most other high coverage regions were present in only one of the samples. In general, no correlation was detected between coverage and GC content along a given chromosome (data not shown). However, for the big outlier chromosome 14 which can be divided into regions of different base composition, two (at the beginning and very end) with the standard GC content at 47% and one in the middle with a lower GC content at 39%, the latter region had a low coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039648-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="pone-0039648-t002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0039648.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Assignment of reads from samples T142 and T149 to individual chromosomes of <italic>B. prasinos</italic> RCC1105 using Geneious Assembler (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details).</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0039648-t002-2" xlink:href="pone.0039648.t002"/></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><label/><p>The numeration of chromosomes is provided both for the draft version of the genome (used in this work) and for the final version of the genome <xref rid="pone.0039648-Moreau1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig id="pone-0039648-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0039648.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Assembly of metagenomic reads obtained from flow cytometry sorted picoeukaryote samples T142 and T149 from the Chile upwelling to <italic>Bathycoccus prasinos</italic> RCC1105 genome.</title><p>(A) Relationship between average coverage fraction (expressed as % of the length of the chromosome covered by at least one read) and GC content for samples T142 and T149 for the 21 draft nuclear chromosomes of <italic>B. prasinos</italic> RCC1105 as well as the mitochondrion and plastid genomes.

These studies relied on the physical separation of eukaryotic cells from the dominant bacteria by flow cytometry sorting, whole genome amplification, and next generation sequencing. We used the same strategy on two samples from the coastal upwelling off Chile obtained during the 2004 BIOSOPE cruise from which photosynthetic picoeukaryotes were sorted. Following Cuvelier et al. <xref rid="pone.0039648-Cuvelier1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and Monier et al. <xref rid="pone.0039648-Monier1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, but in contrast to Yoon et al. <xref rid="pone.0039648-Yoon1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, we sorted large cell populations and not single cells.

Our initial assumption was that genotypic diversity would be low in our samples, that genomes of the targeted organisms will be rather small (typically 20 Mbp), and that we would be able to reconstruct long contigs. However, the use of two different <italic>de novo</italic> assembly programs (Newbler and Geneious) yielded maximum contig lengths around 40 kbp (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0039648-t001">Table 1</xref>), quite similar to those obtained by Cuvelier et al. <xref rid="pone.0039648-Cuvelier1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, shorter than those obtained by Monier et al. <xref rid="pone.0039648-Monier1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, but longer than those reported by Yoon et al. <xref rid="pone.0039648-Yoon1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p>Assigning reads and contigs to sequenced genomes is much less straightforward for eukaryotes than for prokaryotes because of the paucity of unicellular eukaryote genomes available. This is particularly true for marine photosynthetic microalgae, for which less than 15 genomes have been sequenced. In a first step, we used SSU rRNA genes for which a very large database is available <xref rid="pone.0039648-Pruesse1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> in order to determine the phylogenetic composition of the sequenced community. This indicated that Mamiellophyceae, in particular <italic>Bathycoccus</italic>, were present in the amplified sample as previously shown by the construction of 18S rRNA gene clone libraries from the same samples <xref rid="pone.0039648-Lepre1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The three Mamiellophyceae genera <italic>Bathycoccus</italic>, <italic>Micromonas</italic>, and <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> have been shown to be important in coastal areas <xref rid="pone.0039648-Not1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. More specifically, the presence of <italic>Bathycoccus</italic> in the upwelling zone is coherent with the recent observation that this genus makes on average 47% of photosynthetic picoeukaryote carbon in this region with maxima up to 78% in autumn, at the same period of the year than our samples <xref rid="pone.0039648-ColladoFabri1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. The two other eukaryote SSU rRNA signatures (Dictyochophyceae, Chrysophyceae) correspond to groups often present within picoeukaryote communities from the eastern South Pacific <xref rid="pone.0039648-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The presence of marine bacteria SSU rRNA signatures, in particular of <italic>Candidatus</italic> Pelagibacter, could be explained either by the fact that bacteria may be sorted in the same drop than photosynthetic cells (we did not fluorescently label bacteria to exclude them), or by the fact that some of the photosynthetic picoeukaryotes maybe mixotrophs and may have ingested bacteria <xref rid="pone.0039648-Zubkov1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039648-FriasLopez1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.</p><p>The use of BLASTN to assign either reads or contigs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039648.s006">Table S2</xref>) against publicly available sequences yielded a very large number of &#8220;unknown&#8221; sequences (around 60% for reads and 50% for contigs). This analysis confirmed however the dominance of eukaryotic compared to prokaryotic sequences, as expected, and among the former the importance of the green lineage. Still, very few sequences could be assigned at the genus level. The construction of a data set including the <italic>Bathycoccus</italic> genome <xref rid="pone.0039648-Moreau1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, and the use of a BLASTX-based algorithm, revealed that 70% of the reads assembled into contigs could be assigned to <italic>Bathycoccus</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039648.s007">Table S3</xref>). This illustrates the difficulty to assign eukaryotic metagenomic data in the absence of closely related reference genomes. Even the presence in the public databases of genomes for representatives of the closely related genera <italic>Micromonas</italic> and <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> did not allow recruitment of <italic>Bathycoccus</italic>-related sequences.</p><p>The prevalence of <italic>Bathycoccus</italic> sequences allowed performing a direct assembly of the reads from the two Pacific samples to the genome sequence of the Mediterranean strain RCC1105 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0039648-t002">Table 2</xref>). This confirmed that a large fraction of the reads could be assigned to <italic>Bathycoccus</italic> and there was an excellent correlation between the number of reads that could be assigned directly to <italic>Bathycoccus</italic> chromosomes and those assigned after contig assembly and BLASTX analysis of the contigs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039648.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Direct assembly revealed however that coverage was extremely uneven across and between chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039648-g002">Figure 2</xref>). For example, on Chromosome 2, some bases where covered with a depth in excess of x1,000. Such uneven coverage is very likely to be due to intrinsic characteristics of the MDA process and has been clearly illustrated on <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0039648-Rodrigue1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. By amplifying seven single cells and sequencing the amplified DNA with two different technologies (454 and Illumina), the authors observed very unequal coverage. The coverage was not depending on the sequencing technology for a given cell, but differed randomly between cells. In our case, we did not find any relationship between coverage variation along a given chromosome and GC content, a factor often invoked to explain these variations, probably because GC content variation within most chromosomes is low. One exception is the big outlier chromosome 14, which is made of three parts, the middle one having a 10% lower GC content and exhibiting a very low coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039648-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This low coverage could also be due to a higher genetic variation in this region exemplified by the fact that this chromosome lacks co-linearity with the other Mamiellophyceae outlier chromosomes <xref rid="pone.0039648-Moreau1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. When considering average coverage for each chromosome and average GC content, there appears to be a clear relation both in terms of coverage depth and coverage fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039648-g001">Figure 1</xref>). One interesting exception is the mitochondrion which had a good coverage despite its low GC content. Previous analyses of picoeukaryotic sequences from the Sargasso Sea metagenome revealed a higher prevalence of chloroplast and mitochondrial sequences relative to nuclear sequences in <italic>Ostreococcus</italic>, suggesting that both organelle genomes are present in multiple copies per cell <xref rid="pone.0039648-Piganeau2" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. This higher coverage could also be due to genome conformation, since it has been reported that circular genomes are better amplified by MDA than linear ones <xref rid="pone.0039648-Schoenfeld1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. However genome conformation and/or multiple genome copy number should also have induced a good coverage of the chloroplast genome, which is not the case in our dataset.</p><p>The <italic>Bathycoccus</italic> Mediterranean culture genome and the two Chile metagenomes that originate from opposite sides of the Earth appear very closely related, with an average nucleotide identity up to 98% at the individual gene level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039648.s009">Table S5</xref>). A more extensive comparison of the three genomes made by aligning the cultured genomes and the assembly consensus for the first three chromosomes revealed an average of 96.3% of identical sites in regions with high coverage (in excess of 10&#215; for both samples, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0039648-t003">Table 3</xref>). Non-coding regions displayed a lower number of identical sites (88.5%, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0039648-t003">Table 3</xref>) than the coding regions, as expected due to lower constraints in the non-coding regions <xref rid="pone.0039648-Piganeau3" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. There were no significant differences between the three chromosomes examined. Samples T142 and T149 shared more identical sites between them than either of them with RCC1105. However, differences remained small. Conservation between these three genomes is much higher than, for example, between the genomes of <italic>O. tauri</italic> and <italic>O. &#8216;lucimarinus&#8217;</italic>, for which average amino-acid identity is only 88% when using our BLASTX-based algorithm to affiliate <italic>O. &#8216;lucimarinus&#8217;</italic> sequences (random 1,000 bp sequences) to <italic>O. tauri</italic> genome taken as a reference. In fact, it is possible that all three genomes correspond to the same biological species, since an analysis of the full rRNA operon revealed nearly identical sequences in the ITS2 region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039648.s002">Figure S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039648.s011">Table S7</xref>) and identical sequences in the ITS2 have been shown to correspond in general to reproductive compatibility <xref rid="pone.0039648-Coleman1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. In our data, genotype variability in the ITS2 region occurs outside of helix 3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039648.s011">Table S7</xref>), therefore outside the region where differences are clearly associated with reproductive incompatibility in many species <xref rid="pone.0039648-Coleman1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. However, several studies on multiple genes or complete genomes have shown that sequence identity is just one of the hallmarks of reproductive isolation and speciation, because chromosomal translocation or duplication may hamper species compatibility whilst most sequences remain identical <xref rid="pone.0039648-Coyne1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>.</p><p>Despite the high level of sequence identity between these three genomes, several genotypes appear to be present within each of the Chile upwelling populations. This is clearly seen in the detailed analysis of the rRNA operon. The SSU rRNA intron that is present in the cultured RCC1105 genome was absent from the two contig consensus sequences obtained for the upwelling samples T142 and T149 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039648.s002">Figure S2</xref>). However one read from sample T149 matched nearly perfectly the RCC 1105 intron while all other T149 reads from this region presented no intron signature. This suggests the presence of two genotypes in this sample, one dominant not possessing the intron, the other containing it. Another putative intron was found near the end of the LSU rRNA gene. This intron was present in a fraction of the reads for sample T142. The other T142 reads matched perfectly RCC 1105, which lacks this intron. In sample T149, one read out of 16 also matched the putative LSU intron (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039648.s003">Figure S3</xref>). This again suggests the existence of at least two genotypes in these two samples, one with the LSU intron, one without.

Amino acid identity with the reference <italic>Bathycoccus</italic> RCC1105 genome was much lower (84.4%) than for our metagenomes (96.0 and 95.9%, for T142 and T149, respectively), despite the fact that the SSU rRNA sequence of the DCM metagenome is 100% identical to that of RCC1105 (but it lacks the intron).

Briefly, one &#181;L of DNA (corresponding to 3&#8211;5 ng of DNA) was used as the template in the MDA reaction. Reactions were carried out in 50 &#181;L volumes. Reaction buffer (29 &#181;L), water (9.5 &#181;L), and 1 &#181;L of Phi29 DNA polymerase were added to 10.5 &#181;L of template (corresponding to 1 &#181;L of DNA, 2.5 &#181;L of phosphate-buffered saline, 3.5 &#181;L of an alkaline solution and 3.5 &#181;L of neutralization buffer) and incubated at 30&#176;C for 16 h. A final incubation at 65&#176;C for 5 min inactivated the Phi29 DNA polymerase. Twelve separate reactions were performed and then pooled together for both T142 and T149 samples in order to reach the 10 &#181;g of DNA required for 454 sequencing. The amplified products were then purified and concentrated using a Microcon YM- 100 column (Millipore, Molsheim, France). After WGA, 5 &#181;L of the amplified product was run on an agarose gel (1%) in order to estimate amplification efficiency. DNA was also quantified in the final reaction volume (before and after purification/concentration) with Quanti-iTTM PicoGreen dsDNA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), as described previously <xref rid="pone.0039648-Lepre1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Sequencing</title><p>About 10 &#181;g of DNA amplified were fragmented by nebulisation.

First, we used a reference protein database (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039648.s013">Table S9</xref>) containing gene annotations from 11 genomes of photosynthetic unicellular eukaryotes (targeted by this study), 2 non-photosynthetic eukaryotes, 7 marine bacteria and 8 viruses of planktonic eukaryotes. In particular, we included the genome of <italic>Bathycoccus</italic>, which was not yet publicly available at the time of this analysis <xref rid="pone.0039648-Moreau1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Translation from each contig was compared against the protein database using BLASTX <xref rid="pone.0039648-Altschul1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. The local alignments provided by BLAST were merged into one non-redundant global alignment for each contig and its Best BLAST Hit (BBH), checking which position of the contig was covered in a local alignment with its BBH.</p><p>We pre-computed the identity (frequency of matching sites over the alignment), <italic>I</italic>, and alignment length, <italic>L</italic>, (number of sites present in the global alignment) between all Mamiellophyceae genes and between Prasinovirus genes. For each protein having an orthologous gene, we identified minimum identity percent <italic>I<sub>min</sub></italic> and coverage length <italic>L<sub>min</sub></italic> within the genus or within the class. For specific genes, i.e. genes present in only one genome, we set up a minimum of 80% identity over 50 amino acids.</p><p>For example, the <italic>O. &#8216;lucimarinus&#8217;</italic> EF1-alpha gene has a 76% amino-acid identity over a 476 amino-acids alignment within the genus <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> and a 48% identity over a 434 amino-acid alignment within Mamiellophyceae. We would thus assign a contig to the genus <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> if it matched <italic>O. &#8216;lucimarinus&#8217;</italic> EF1-alpha gene with an identity greater than 76% and an alignment length greater than the observed alignment length. If either the identity or the alignment lengths were smaller than these thresholds, but still larger than the thresholds within Mamiellophyceae, we would assign this contig to Mamiellophyceae. If a contig did not match any gene with pre-computed thresholds, it was assigned to the taxonomic affiliation of its BBH using a minimum identity threshold of 80% over 50 amino-acids. The corresponding C codes are available upon request from ET (Toulza, in prep).</p><p>The sensitivity of our approach was tested by estimating the taxonomic affiliation of random samples of the nuclear genome of <italic>O. &#8216;lucimarinus&#8217;</italic> using a Mamiellophyceae protein database and a pre-computed identity and threshold matrix without this species. As expected, our approach significantly lowered the rate of false positive taxonomic affiliation from 25.1% to 2.1% for 500 bp sequences and decreases with sequence length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039648.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Gene Specific Similarity between the Three Genomes</title><p>For specific groups of genes that are important for phytoplankton metabolism (photosynthesis, vitamin and pigment synthesis, cell cycle) we examined the similarity between the genome of the cultured <italic>Bathycoccus</italic> strain and the metagenomes T142 and T149. A list of 153 genes was defined from the <italic>Bathycoccus</italic> RCC1105 genome by using the sequences of orthologous genes from the previously published <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> and <italic>Micromonas</italic> genomes, as baits for BLASTN search against the <italic>Bathycoccus</italic> genome. After proper identification, each <italic>Bathycoccus</italic> gene was used as a BLASTN query against a subset of T142 and T149 Newbler contigs previously allocated to the <italic>Bathycoccus</italic> genome using the BLASTX approach (see above). This subset was used in order to focus only in similarities against <italic>Bathycoccus</italic> genome.

We discarded all regions from the alignment for which either T142 or T149 had a genome coverage below 10&#215; based on the annotation made by Geneious.
