</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Small photosynthetic eukaryotes &lt;3 µm in size [1] play an important role in marine ecosystems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In many oceanic regions, they may account for a large fraction of the biomass [2], [3] as well as of the primary production [4], [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Until now, only a small number of these organisms have been brought into culture [1], in particular members of the Chlorophyta (prasinophytes and Mamiellophyceae). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Most of our knowledge about key groups and about diversity within these groups is based upon the genetic analysis of the 18S rRNA gene in marine samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In many cases however, sequences obtained using classical approaches (universal primers applied to filtered samples) are dominated by heterotrophic eukaryote groups such as marine alveolates or stramenopiles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In order to focus on photosynthetic groups, three major approaches have been used: (1) cloning/sequencing of filtered samples of plastid genes such as 16S rRNA [6], [7] or psbA [8], coding for the D1 protein of the reaction center, (2) cloning/sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene of chlorophyll containing populations sorted by flow cytometry [9], [10], (3) direct detection of photosynthetic taxa by FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization) probes or quantitative PCR [11], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>These different approaches, despite sometimes providing conflicting images of the small eukaryote community [9], have converged towards establishing that a few groups appear to dominate open-ocean, meso- and oligo-trophic waters: Prymnesiophyceae, Chrysophyceae, Pelagophyceae, and two clades of prasinophytes (VII and IX) [5], [9], [10], [13], [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In these waters, many of the dominant clades within these groups have very few or no cultured representatives, and no information is available on their morphology and physiology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in temperate coastal as well as arctic pelagic waters, the small photosynthetic eukaryote community is dominated by Mamiellophyceae [11], [15], [16], a group of small green algae for which the three major genera Bathycoccus, Micromonas, and Ostreococcus are easily isolated in culture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>These three genera have also been found to bloom sporadically in open ocean waters [17], [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The availability of cultures has allowed sequencing of their genomes [19], [20], providing key information on the genetic basis of their niche differentiation [21], [22] and fostering further analysis of metabolic pathways, mechanisms of genome evolution and life cycle of these organisms [23]–[25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Obtaining genomic information from uncultivated populations would allow exploring their physiological adaptation and could provide clues for their isolation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In the last decade, metagenomics approaches have been developed for marine microbial communities [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>These approaches revealed the existence and ubiquity of processes such as photo-heterotrophy among bacteria [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>However, until very recently metagenomics have not been applied to eukaryotic populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The first reason is that filtered samples that are used in general for metagenomic studies are dominated by prokaryotic sequences [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Second, eukaryote genomes can be very large with many repeated genes, such that metagenomic data carry little information [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>One approach, proposed a few years ago for prokaryotes [30], has been gaining popularity lately. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>It consists in the coupling flow cytometry sorting, which permits to obtain specific cellular groups based on their size and pigment content, with Whole Genome Amplification (WGA), which allows obtaining enough material for genome sequencing with next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies such as 454 pyrosequencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>This approach allowed, for example, reconstructing the genome of UCYN-A, a group of small nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Recent work demonstrated that this strategy is applicable to small eukaryotes, both autotrophic [10], [32], [33] and heterotrophic [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>This strategy allowed for example Yoon et al. [35] to retrieve genomic information on a group of uncultivated eukaryotes, the picobiliphytes [36]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>In the present paper, we report metagenomic data from two natural picoplankton populations sampled in the Pacific upwelling off the Chile coast. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The data are dominated by Bathycoccus sequences, which display high identity to the recently sequenced genome of a Mediterranean strain [37]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Photosynthetic picoeukaryotes from two samples collected in the nutrient-rich coastal upwelling waters off central Chile (samples T142 and T149 corresponding to 5 and 30 m depth, respectively, Table 1) were sorted by flow cytometry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>As previously reported [32], [38], 18S rRNA gene clone libraries for these samples were dominated by members of the Mamiellophyceae, a novel class of small green algae previously classified within Prasinophyceae [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Among these, Micromonas and Ostreococcus dominated in sample T142, while Bathycoccus and Micromonas dominated in T149. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>In T149, sequences from Chrysophyceae and parasitic Syndiniales (Alveolata) were also recovered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The DNA from these samples was amplified by multiple displacement amplification (MDA). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>18S rRNA gene clone libraries performed after MDA contained only Bathycoccus sequences, with the exception of one Acantharea sequence in T149 [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Each MDA amplified sample was sequenced on a 454 machine (half run) yielding about 670,000 reads, each with an average length ∼420 bp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Reads were assembled into contigs using either the default 454 assembler (Newbler) or the Geneious assembler after trimming to remove low quality ends (see Material and Methods). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The former assembler yielded less contigs than the latter (Table 1) including fewer long contigs (&gt;500 bp). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Most of the following analyses have been done on the contigs generated by Geneious with the exception of the metabolic gene analyses (see below), which were performed early with Newbler contigs. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>In order to determine the taxonomic composition of the assemblage from which the metagenomic sequences originated, we began by searching for SSU rRNA gene within contigs (Table S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Although the number of contigs harbouring SSU rRNA genes was slightly higher in sample T149 than T142, their phylogenetic composition was very similar. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>In both samples, we found nuclear 18S rRNA gene signature for Bathycoccus (99.9% identity) but not for other Mamiellophyceae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>In contrast, we found plastid and mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene signatures for two other Mamiellophyceae, Micromonas and Ostreococcus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The only other eukaryotic signatures came from a Chrysophyceae (plastid) in T142 and from a Dictyochophyceae in T149. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Although eukaryotes were targeted during flow cytometry sorting, we also found several 16S rRNA genes from bacteria in both samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>All bacterial signatures were affiliated to clades that are typical of the marine environment, in particular the alpha-proteobacteria Candidatus Pelagibacter and Roseobacter, as well as several Sargasso Sea clades (SAR) [40]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>In a second step, we subjected both contigs and reads to a global BLASTN search against GenBank and analyzed the results with MEGAN, which provides, when possible, a taxonomic affiliation for each sequence using the Last Common Ancestor (LCA) algorithm [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>The two samples T142 and T149 had very similar composition (Table S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Slightly more than 30% of the reads were affiliated to eukaryotes with a small fraction (6% of total) corresponding to Mamiellophyceae, especially Ostreococcus (4% of total) and Micromonas (slightly more than 1% of total). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>It should be noted that while we clearly identified Bathycoccus as a key eukaryote in both samples based on rRNA analysis, the number of reads attributed to this genus by BLASTN analysis was small because the genome of Bathycoccus was not available in public databases at the time of this analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The contribution of other eukaryotic groups expected to be encountered within picoeukaryotes [1] such as stramenopiles, haptophytes, or alveolates was small, which is in part explained by the low number of sequenced genomes available for these groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>About 8% of the reads were affiliated to bacteria especially Proteobacteria such as Candidatus Pelagibacter (SAR11), confirming the results from the rRNA gene analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Very few reads were attributed to Archaea or viruses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>The majority of reads (∼60%) could not be affiliated to any taxon either because they had no hits in GenBank or because the LCA of their hits was unresolved (for example, if the best hits consist of a mixture of eukaryotic and bacterial sequences, the LCA will be ‘cellular organism’). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>MEGAN analysis of Geneious contigs provided similar results, with an increased fraction of contigs, when compared to reads, attributed to bacteria (18%), and therefore fewer contigs with unknown affiliation (50% vs. 60% for reads). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Key problems with the public databases are the over-representation of irrelevant sequences and the absence of relevant sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the SSU rRNA gene both in clone libraries (see above) and in contigs (Table S1) suggested that Bathycoccus was the dominant eukaryote in both samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>At the time of this analysis, we gained access to the genome sequence of a Bathycoccus prasinos strain (RCC1105) isolated from the Mediterranean Sea [37], which was not yet publicly available then, but has been deposited to Genbank since (see Material and Methods). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>In order to estimate the fractions of contigs that could belong to Bathycoccus, we constructed a protein database including proteins from nuclear genomes of Bathycoccus RCC1105 and unicellular eukaryotes (Mamiellophyceae, diatoms, haptophytes, pelagophytes, fungi), mitochondria and plastid genomes from selected eukaryotes, genomes from typical marine archaea and bacteria such as that of the bacterium Candidatus Pelagibacter, unicellular cyanobacteria or Thermococcus, as well as a few eukaryotic virus genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Contigs were searched with BLASTX against this database and results were filtered using an algorithm specifically designed to extract Mamiellophyceae sequences using fine-tuned identity and coverage thresholds for each orthologous protein sequence (see Material and Methods). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Again, results were similar for both samples (Table S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>On average for the two samples, 31.5% of the contigs could be attributed to Bathycoccus, 0.45% to Micromonas and 0.36% to Ostreococcus. This corresponded to 69.8, 0.10, and 0.12% of the reads, respectively, indicating that Bathycoccus contigs had a higher coverage than contigs belonging to other organisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>About 4.7% of contigs (5.0% of reads) could be assigned to Mamiellophyceae without a clear relationship to any of the three genera. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Very few contigs could be attributed to the other eukaryotic genomes available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Among prokaryotes, only Candidatus Pelagibacter strain HTCC1062 genome recruited a significant number of contigs, in agreement with the MEGAN and rRNA gene analyses reported above. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>A few contigs (5 for T142 and 17 for T149) could be assigned to available large double stranded Mamiellophyceae viruses [42]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>The predicted protein sequences from T142 and T149 contigs attributed to Bathycoccus had an average amino-acid identity of 96.0 and 95.9%, respectively, with those from the Bathycoccus sequenced genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>This amino-acid identity is an overestimate because our taxonomic affiliation only retains genes with greater than 80% amino-acid identity (see Materials and Methods). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>The detailed assignment of contigs to individual Bathycoccus chromosomes (Table S4) demonstrated some differences between the coverage of each chromosome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Specific chromosomes such as the outlier chromosomes 14 and 19 [37] or the chloroplast genome had a lower coverage. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title><text><SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Assembly of T142 and T149 Reads Against the Bathycoccus RCC1105 Genome </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Since BLASTX analysis revealed that a large fraction of the contigs could be recruited to Bathycoccus RCC1105 genome, a direct assembly of reads was performed against the sequenced Bathycoccus genome (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Direct assembly was coherent with contigs assignment through BLASTX (Table S4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>There was a good correlation between the numbers of reads recruited by both approaches with a slightly higher number of reads (about 3%) for the latter (Figure S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>This was expected because direct assembly relies on nucleotide identities and is therefore more stringent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Direct assembly provides detailed information on the genome coverage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>On average, while coverage depth (i.e., the average number of reads covering a given base from the reference chromosome) was around 10× and similar between both samples, the coverage fraction (i.e., the fraction of the reference genome covered by at least one read) was higher in T149 (88%) than in T142 (62%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Both coverage depth and coverage fraction varied widely among chromosomes (Table 2), the two indices being somehow related since chromosomes with a higher coverage fraction had also generally a larger coverage depth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>While in general individual chromosomes followed the general trend with sample T149 having a better coverage than T142, for some chromosomes such as 2 or 7, average coverage depth was higher for T142. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>In fact, coverage fraction and depth appeared much more variable for T142 than for T149 (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>A weak relationship was observed between nuclear chromosome coverage and GC content (Figure 1A; Spearman correlation, T142: ρ = 0.40 p = 0.04; T149 ρ = 0.57, p = 0.004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>In particular, the two Bathycoccus outlier chromosomes 14 and 19 and the chloroplast genome that have lower GC content [37] had low coverage fraction and low coverage depth (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the mitochondrial genome had a very good coverage despite its low GC content. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>When looking at the detail of coverage depth along each chromosome, the situation appeared much more complex (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Coverage appeared very unequal and varied between the two samples. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Until recently, most metagenomic studies have focused on prokaryotes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>However in the last year, three papers have reported application of metagenomics to marine eukaryotes [10], [33], [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>These studies relied on the physical separation of eukaryotic cells from the dominant bacteria by flow cytometry sorting, whole genome amplification, and next generation sequencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>We used the same strategy on two samples from the coastal upwelling off Chile obtained during the 2004 BIOSOPE cruise from which photosynthetic picoeukaryotes were sorted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Following Cuvelier et al. [10] and Monier et al. [33], but in contrast to Yoon et al. [35], we sorted large cell populations and not single cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Therefore the DNA, although obtained from cells that were homogeneous in terms of size and pigment content, corresponded to an assemblage of species and genotypes as demonstrated by previous analyses of rRNA genes on the same samples [9], [38]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>The DNA amplified by MDA from sorted cells [32] proved to be suitable for 454 sequencing, giving a number of reads adding up to more than 550 Mbp for the two samples (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Our initial assumption was that genotypic diversity would be low in our samples, that genomes of the targeted organisms will be rather small (typically 20 Mbp), and that we would be able to reconstruct long contigs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>However, the use of two different de novo assembly programs (Newbler and Geneious) yielded maximum contig lengths around 40 kbp (Table 1), quite similar to those obtained by Cuvelier et al. [10], shorter than those obtained by Monier et al. [33], but longer than those reported by Yoon et al. [35]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Assigning reads and contigs to sequenced genomes is much less straightforward for eukaryotes than for prokaryotes because of the paucity of unicellular eukaryote genomes available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>This is particularly true for marine photosynthetic microalgae, for which less than 15 genomes have been sequenced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>In a first step, we used SSU rRNA genes for which a very large database is available [43] in order to determine the phylogenetic composition of the sequenced community. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>This indicated that Mamiellophyceae, in particular Bathycoccus, were present in the amplified sample as previously shown by the construction of 18S rRNA gene clone libraries from the same samples [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>The three Mamiellophyceae genera Bathycoccus, Micromonas, and Ostreococcus have been shown to be important in coastal areas [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>More specifically, the presence of Bathycoccus in the upwelling zone is coherent with the recent observation that this genus makes on average 47% of photosynthetic picoeukaryote carbon in this region with maxima up to 78% in autumn, at the same period of the year than our samples [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>The two other eukaryote SSU rRNA signatures (Dictyochophyceae, Chrysophyceae) correspond to groups often present within picoeukaryote communities from the eastern South Pacific [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>The presence of marine bacteria SSU rRNA signatures, in particular of Candidatus Pelagibacter, could be explained either by the fact that bacteria may be sorted in the same drop than photosynthetic cells (we did not fluorescently label bacteria to exclude them), or by the fact that some of the photosynthetic picoeukaryotes maybe mixotrophs and may have ingested bacteria [45], [46]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>The use of BLASTN to assign either reads or contigs (Table S2) against publicly available sequences yielded a very large number of “unknown” sequences (around 60% for reads and 50% for contigs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>This analysis confirmed however the dominance of eukaryotic compared to prokaryotic sequences, as expected, and among the former the importance of the green lineage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Still, very few sequences could be assigned at the genus level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>The construction of a data set including the Bathycoccus genome [37], and the use of a BLASTX-based algorithm, revealed that 70% of the reads assembled into contigs could be assigned to Bathycoccus (Table S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>This illustrates the difficulty to assign eukaryotic metagenomic data in the absence of closely related reference genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Even the presence in the public databases of genomes for representatives of the closely related genera Micromonas and Ostreococcus did not allow recruitment of Bathycoccus-related sequences. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of Bathycoccus sequences allowed performing a direct assembly of the reads from the two Pacific samples to the genome sequence of the Mediterranean strain RCC1105 (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>This confirmed that a large fraction of the reads could be assigned to Bathycoccus and there was an excellent correlation between the number of reads that could be assigned directly to Bathycoccus chromosomes and those assigned after contig assembly and BLASTX analysis of the contigs (Figure S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Direct assembly revealed however that coverage was extremely uneven across and between chromosomes (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>For example, on Chromosome 2, some bases where covered with a depth in excess of x1,000. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Such uneven coverage is very likely to be due to intrinsic characteristics of the MDA process and has been clearly illustrated on Prochlorococcus [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>By amplifying seven single cells and sequencing the amplified DNA with two different technologies (454 and Illumina), the authors observed very unequal coverage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>The coverage was not depending on the sequencing technology for a given cell, but differed randomly between cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>In our case, we did not find any relationship between coverage variation along a given chromosome and GC content, a factor often invoked to explain these variations, probably because GC content variation within most chromosomes is low. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>One exception is the big outlier chromosome 14, which is made of three parts, the middle one having a 10% lower GC content and exhibiting a very low coverage (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>This low coverage could also be due to a higher genetic variation in this region exemplified by the fact that this chromosome lacks co-linearity with the other Mamiellophyceae outlier chromosomes [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>When considering average coverage for each chromosome and average GC content, there appears to be a clear relation both in terms of coverage depth and coverage fraction (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>One interesting exception is the mitochondrion which had a good coverage despite its low GC content. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Previous analyses of picoeukaryotic sequences from the Sargasso Sea metagenome revealed a higher prevalence of chloroplast and mitochondrial sequences relative to nuclear sequences in Ostreococcus, suggesting that both organelle genomes are present in multiple copies per cell [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>This higher coverage could also be due to genome conformation, since it has been reported that circular genomes are better amplified by MDA than linear ones [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>However genome conformation and/or multiple genome copy number should also have induced a good coverage of the chloroplast genome, which is not the case in our dataset. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>The Bathycoccus Mediterranean culture genome and the two Chile metagenomes that originate from opposite sides of the Earth appear very closely related, with an average nucleotide identity up to 98% at the individual gene level (Table S5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>A more extensive comparison of the three genomes made by aligning the cultured genomes and the assembly consensus for the first three chromosomes revealed an average of 96.3% of identical sites in regions with high coverage (in excess of 10× for both samples, Table 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Non-coding regions displayed a lower number of identical sites (88.5%, Table 3) than the coding regions, as expected due to lower constraints in the non-coding regions [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the three chromosomes examined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Samples T142 and T149 shared more identical sites between them than either of them with RCC1105. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>However, differences remained small. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Conservation between these three genomes is much higher than, for example, between the genomes of O. tauri and O. ‘lucimarinus’, for which average amino-acid identity is only 88% when using our BLASTX-based algorithm to affiliate O. ‘lucimarinus’ sequences (random 1,000 bp sequences) to O. tauri genome taken as a reference. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>In fact, it is possible that all three genomes correspond to the same biological species, since an analysis of the full rRNA operon revealed nearly identical sequences in the ITS2 region (Figure S2, Table S7) and identical sequences in the ITS2 have been shown to correspond in general to reproductive compatibility [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>In our data, genotype variability in the ITS2 region occurs outside of helix 3 (Table S7), therefore outside the region where differences are clearly associated with reproductive incompatibility in many species [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>However, several studies on multiple genes or complete genomes have shown that sequence identity is just one of the hallmarks of reproductive isolation and speciation, because chromosomal translocation or duplication may hamper species compatibility whilst most sequences remain identical [52]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Despite the high level of sequence identity between these three genomes, several genotypes appear to be present within each of the Chile upwelling populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>This is clearly seen in the detailed analysis of the rRNA operon. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>The SSU rRNA intron that is present in the cultured RCC1105 genome was absent from the two contig consensus sequences obtained for the upwelling samples T142 and T149 (Figure S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>However one read from sample T149 matched nearly perfectly the RCC 1105 intron while all other T149 reads from this region presented no intron signature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>This suggests the presence of two genotypes in this sample, one dominant not possessing the intron, the other containing it. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Another putative intron was found near the end of the LSU rRNA gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>This intron was present in a fraction of the reads for sample T142. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>The other T142 reads matched perfectly RCC 1105, which lacks this intron. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>In sample T149, one read out of 16 also matched the putative LSU intron (Figure S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>This again suggests the existence of at least two genotypes in these two samples, one with the LSU intron, one without. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Analysis of specific genome regions that have a good coverage for both samples (Figure 3, Table S6) provided further evidence for the existence of two to three genotypes per sample. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Individual genotypes were usually present in both samples, but, in some cases, genotypes from the two samples were completely different (Table S6). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Monier et al. [33] have very recently reported the construction of a Bathycoccus metagenome (GenBank accession AFUW01000001:AFUW01000185) from flow cytometry sorted cells collected at the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) in the tropical Atlantic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>We compared, using our custom BLASTX-based algorithm (see Materials and Methods), the DCM metagenome and the RCC1105 genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Amino acid identity with the reference Bathycoccus RCC1105 genome was much lower (84.4%) than for our metagenomes (96.0 and 95.9%, for T142 and T149, respectively), despite the fact that the SSU rRNA sequence of the DCM metagenome is 100% identical to that of RCC1105 (but it lacks the intron). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>This raises the intriguing possibility that the Bathycoccus genus could contain different ecotypes, some adapted to coastal waters, the others to pelagic/deep waters, in a manner similar to its sister genera Ostreococcus [53] and Micromonas [54]. </plain></SENT>
