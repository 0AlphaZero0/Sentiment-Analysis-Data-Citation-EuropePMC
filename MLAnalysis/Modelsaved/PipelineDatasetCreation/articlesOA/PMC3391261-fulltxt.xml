We analyzed the transaminase reaction mechanisms of this protein with pyridoxal-5&#8242;-phosphate (PLP), KYN and &#945;-ketoglutaric acid (2OG) or oxaloacetic acid (OXA). 2OG significantly inhibited KAT activities in kinetic analyses, suggesting that a KYNA biosynthesis is allosterically regulated by 2OG. Its inhibitions evidently were unlocked by KYN. 2OG and KYN functioned as an inhibitor and activator in response to changes in the concentrations of KYN and 2OG, respectively. The affinities of one subunit for PLP or 2OG were different from that of the other subunit, as confirmed by spectrophotometry and isothermal titration calorimetry, suggesting that the difference of affinities between subunits might play a role in regulations of the KAT reaction. Moreover, we identified two active and allosteric sites in the crystal structure of PhKAT-2OG complexes. The crystal structure of PhKAT in complex with four 2OGs demonstrates that two 2OGs in allosteric sites are effector molecules which inhibit the KYNA productions. Thus, the combined data lead to the conclusion that PhKAT probably is regulated by allosteric control machineries, with 2OG as the allosteric inhibitor.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Kynurenine-oxoglutarate transaminase (EC 2.6.1.7), also known as kynurenine (KYN) aminotransferase (KAT) <xref rid="pone.0040307-Tobes1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, is a dimeric enzyme containing 2 covalently-bound pyridoxal-5&#8242;-phosphates (PLP) as cofactor moieties and is the last enzyme in the kynurenic acid (KYNA) biosynthetic pathway. Kynurenic acid (KYNA) is biosynthesized as a product of the normal metabolism of the amino acid <sc>l</sc>-tryptophan and via a KYN intermediate; KYNA is synthesized via the transamination of KYN in the presence of KAT. KYNA is sequentially biosynthesized from <sc>l</sc>-KYN via a 4-(2-aminophenyl)-2,4-dioxobutanoate (4AD) intermediate by KAT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040307.s001">Fig. S1</xref>).

Although this protein was previously designated PhKAT-II, it is simply designated PhKAT in this study because other homologs that are highly conserved relative to PhKAT are absent from the genome. In <italic>P. horikoshii</italic> OT3, although the genes that are involved in the biosynthesis of KYN from <sc>l</sc>-tryptophan are unidentifiable in the genome, PhKAT that catalyzes the formation of KYNA and a human kynureninase homolog related to the biosynthetic pathway from KYN to NAD are present in the genome <xref rid="pone.0040307-Kawarabayasi1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040307-Kawarabayasi2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This suggests that the KYNA pathway is probably present in <italic>P. horikoshii</italic>. However, the physiological functions of KYNA in this hyperthermophilic archaeon remain unclear. Therefore, we characterized the KYNA biosynthesis abilities of PhKAT to clarify its biochemical function.</p><p>To understand the action mechanisms of PhKAT and compare them with those of their counterparts in humans, other mammals, yeasts, <italic>Aedes</italic>, and protozoan parasites, we characterized the reactions catalyzed by this enzyme. We also analyzed the interaction between PhKAT, PLP cofactor, and 2OG substrate by using spectrophotometric technique and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). ITC results indicate that PhKAT and PLP and/or 2OG interact with a high affinity. The enzyme kinetic analyses revealed that PhKAT is an allosteric enzyme and that transaminated acceptors for PhKAT are 2OG and oxaloacetic acid (OXA). Furthermore, in the crystal structure of PhKAT complexed with an allosteric effector, 2OG was bound to PhKAT at a rate of 4 molecules per protein. Two 2OG molecules were identified in the binding pocket of PhKAT other than a pocket constructed for active sites. This demonstrates that 2OG is an allosteric effector necessary for the regulation of KYNA biosynthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Expression and Purification of PhKAT</title><p>

This result indicates that KYN functions as an activator for KYNA production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040307.s005">Fig. S5B</xref>). In fact, the acceleration and recovery of KYNA synthesized velocities were observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040307-g004">Figure 4A and B</xref>. The results indicate that KYN as an activator probably unlocks the inhibiting action of 2OG for PhKAT. The &#945;-KBA and &#945;-KMB keto-acid analogs were able to support the KAT reaction. H-values were greater than 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040307.s010">Table S2</xref> and Equation S3). H-values for &#945;-KBA, and &#945;-KMB were 1.79 and 3.57 under 100 &#181;M KYN, respectively. The results show that PhKAT is an allosteric enzyme characterized by positive cooperativity and ligands for PhKAT are 2 and 4 molecules, respectively. However, &#945;-KMB does not bind with PhKAT at 4 molecules due to that a molar ratio discords between PhKAT and &#945;-KMB. It might indicate that <italic>K</italic>

The velocities of KYNA synthesis by PhKAT at first contact of &#945;-KMB accelerated to around &#8220;<italic>V</italic>

The result indicates the conformation changes of PhKAT from R state to T state in conjunction with binding of &#945;-KMB to a first binding site of PhKAT. The velocity changes at 0.4 &#181;M in &#945;-KBA are smaller than &#945;-KMB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040307-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). This might indicate that PhKAT is the R&#8217; state which is an intermediate position between R state and T state. Thus, KYN as an activator might be able to bind with PhKAT when is T state. OXA was able to support the KAT reaction and allostery including allosteric inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040307-g004">Fig. 4E, F and G</xref>). However, the allosteric inhibitions were cause by only binding of OXA with a first allosteric site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040307-g004">Fig. 4E and F</xref>). This result supports that PhKAT has been regulated by 2OG. <italic>V</italic>
<sub>max</sub>s supported by OXA were lower than 2OG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040307-g004">Fig. 4E and F</xref>). These results may indicate that a KYNA synthesis has been driven by 2OG. Although results showed the binding of third and fourth KYNs to PhKAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040307-g004">Fig. 4E and F</xref>), the recovery from an inhibition by an OXA which binds with one allosteric site was not observed at 100 &#181;M KYN condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040307-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>). Additionally, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040307-g004">figure 4G</xref> indicates that KYN activates PhKAT, as with 2OG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040307-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). The results indicated the conformation changes of PhKAT from R state to T state in conjunction with binding of OXA to the first binding site of PhKAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040307-g004">Fig. 4H</xref>). The affinity for OXA at 1 &#181;M was higher than 2OG in 50 &#181;M KYN conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040307-g004">Fig. 4H</xref> left hand) and that was lower than 2OG in 100 &#181;M KYN conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040307-g004">Fig. 4H</xref> right hand). Affinities for 2OG at low concentrations (&#8764;0.08 &#181;M) were higher than OXA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040307-g004">Fig. 4H</xref>). Affinities for OXA at 0.02 &#181;M concentrations were a 50 &#181;M KYN condition higher than a 100 &#181;M KYN condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040307-g004">Fig. 4G</xref>). These indicate that PhKAT changes the nature of transaminated acceptors in conjunction with changes in concentration of KYN and that a KYNA biosynthesis is driven by 2OG and/or OXA at low concentration. The combined results suggest that the transaminase reaction of PhKAT is specifically regulated by 2OG as an allosteric effector, and that a carboxyl group of C5 in 2OG performs the important role for allosteric inhibitions. Furthermore, the length of keto acids probably relate to the cooperation with KYN as an activator and binding to two allosteric sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040307-g004">Fig. 4I</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0040307-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0040307.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Kinetics of the KAT reaction with 2 substrates.</title><p>The KAT-catalyzed reaction from KYN to KYNA was determined by monitoring the change in absorption at 332 nm.

The PhKAT-PLP complex precipitated when mixed with 2OG (data not shown). The binding powers of 2OG may be too much for PhKAT. Therefore, the molar ratios between its complex and 2OG might be out of alignment.

This suggests that although the amino-acid sequence of PhKAT is quite different from that of HuKAT II, the metabolic conversion of KYN to KYNA is conserved. Consistent with this, the crystal structures of the PhKAT&#8211;PLP complex and PhKAT&#8211;PLP&#8211;2OG triple complex, which forms a necessary bio-functional complex that catalyzes the formation of KYNA from KYN, are similar to those of HuKAT II <xref rid="pone.0040307-Rossi2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040307-Han3" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040307-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). The proposed mechanism of the KYNA synthesis reaction from KYN in conjunction with 2OG and/or OXA is depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040307.s008">Figure S8</xref>.</p><p>However, not all aspects of KYNA synthesis are conserved; one factor that is highly variable between different groups of organisms is the source of transaminating acceptor equivalents. The specificity of transaminated acceptors among various organisms is not fairly high for KAT enzymes. Therefore, to determine an authentic substrate as acceptors, and/or allosteric effector for PhKAT, we probed the interaction between 2OG and a KAT protein using ITC. The results show that 2OG binds PhKAT with high specificity and affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040307-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). This scheme strongly indicates that the KYNA biosynthesis pathway may be linked with the 2OG biosynthetic pathway. In fact, <italic>P. horikoshii</italic> possesses the pathway.</p><p>Another important feature of PhKAT is regulated by its dependence on changes in the concentration of 2OG. To assess whether the proteins of <italic>P. horikoshii</italic>, humans, or other mammals are biochemically conserved, we determined the substrate requirements for the <italic>P. horikoshii</italic> enzyme. The results show that PhKAT activity for converting KYN to KYNA is supported by 2OG and OXA molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040307-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Moreover, the results show that PhKAT activity is regulated by allosteric control by 2OG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040307-g004">Fig. 4A and B</xref>). Our studies state that <italic>in vivo</italic>, KAT activities are accelerated when 2OG and/or OXA concentrations are low and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040307-g004">Fig. 4A, B, E and F</xref>). The high thermostabilities of murine KAT families were recently reported <xref rid="pone.0040307-Han4" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Therefore, this implicitly indicates that the regulation systems of PhKAT might be evolutionarily conserved between hyperthermophilic archaea and mammals including humans.Some factors that affect enzymatic activity are electrostatic and hydrophobic substrate interactions, overall dipole moments of enzymes, certain aromatic groups in the KYNA biosynthesis pathway, and the relative orientation and distance between prosthetic groups in the complex. The interactions between PLP cofactor, 2OG, OXA and KYN substrates, and KAT mainly occur as a result of electrostatic interactions. The present study elucidates the binding mechanisms of substrates, cofactors, and PhKAT using spectrophotometry and ITC. The substrate, cofactor, and PhKAT complexes were formed in the reaction, suggesting the existence of cooperation between KAT and KYN and/or 2OG. The regulation of cooperative and binding mechanisms was discovered through the conversion activity of KYNA and the formation of substrate, cofactor, and PhKAT complexes. With coexisting substrates, the binding affinities of 2OG for PLP&#8211;KAT complexes change to decrease or increase. It should be possible to determine the binding affinity of the KYNA conversion reaction in real time.</p><p>We revealed the characteristic features of KAT from a hyperthermophilic archaeon, <italic>P. horikoshii</italic>, using enzyme analysis. In this study, we identified PhKAT as an allosteric enzyme regulated by 2OG in cooperation with KYN. The results indicate that the conversion reaction from KYN to KYNA by PhKAT is regulated depending on the concentration of 2OG as a transamination acceptor. In addition, KYN may be an activator for PhKAT in order to unlock an inhibiting action by 2OG. 2OG and OXA may function as efficient transamination acceptors for KAT in <italic>P. horikoshii</italic> OT3 because it exhibits high affinities for PhKAT as detected by kinetics and/or ITC. In addition, PhKAT exhibits a high affinity for PLP. These findings indicate that high affinities may be required for KAT protein functioning in extreme environments hotter than 100&#176;C.</p><p>To obtain more knowledge about the function of KAT and evidence to support our findings that the crystal structure of PhKAT in complex with an allosteric effector (2OG) is very important, we decided to investigate the complex formation between PhKAT and 2OG. For this purpose, we cocrystallized both intact PhKAT and 2OG molecules, which are required for enzymatic regulation <italic>in vivo</italic>, and acquired a bio-functional complex. The results are in complete agreement with our investigation, demonstrating that 2OG as a substrate is critical as the rate-limiting factor in the KYNA biosynthetic pathway.</p><p>Finally, we suggest that the KAT protein from <italic>P. horikoshii</italic> OT3 may be evolutionarily conserved and related to human KATs localized in the brain. The enzymatic molecular mechanisms for the conversion reaction from KYN to KYNA by PhKAT remain unclear. Therefore, we solved the crystal structures of the PhKAT complexed with KYN or PLP to understand the differences in the enzymatic reaction mechanisms between human KATs and PhKAT in greater detail <xref rid="pone.0040307-Rossi2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040307-Han3" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040307-Rossi3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The present study clearly demonstrates that 2OG is an allosteric inhibitor that binds the allosteric sites of PhKAT. We propose that 2OG as a substrate regulates the KYNA biosynthesis of PhKAT <italic>in vivo</italic> and that PhKAT shares a function of 2OG and has 4 pockets with different binding affinities for 2OG. Thus, the allosteric sites of KAT may be a novel drug target for the regulation of KYNA production.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Reagents</title><p>Pyridoxal phosphate (Wako), <sc>l</sc>-kynurenine (SIGMA), kynurenic acid (SIGMA), 2-oxoglutaric acid (2OG; Wako), oxaloacetic acid (OXA; Wako), 2-ketobutyric acid (&#945;-KBA; ALDRICH), and &#945;-keto-&#947;-(methylthio) butyric acid (&#945;-KMB; SIGMA) preparations were used as a cofactor, and substrates and/or standards; agar and organic nutrients for Luria&#8211;Bertani (LB) medium (Difco) were purchased.
