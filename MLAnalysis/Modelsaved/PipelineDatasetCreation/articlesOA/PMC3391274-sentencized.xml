<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primary mouse endothelial cells have traditionally proven difficult to culture and as a consequence, few assays have been developed to dissect gene function and signal transduction pathways in these cells ex vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Having established methodology for the purification, short-term culture and transfection of primary blood (BEC) and lymphatic (LEC) vascular endothelial cells isolated from embryonic mouse skin, we sought to optimise robust assays able to measure embryonic LEC proliferation, migration and three-dimensional tube forming ability in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the course of developing these assays using the pro-lymphangiogenic growth factors FGF2 and VEGF-C, we identified previously unrecognised roles for FGFR1 signalling in lymphangiogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The small molecule FGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor SU5402, but not inhibitors of VEGFR-2 (SU5416) or VEGFR-3 (MAZ51), inhibited FGF2 mediated LEC proliferation, demonstrating that FGF2 promotes proliferation directly via FGF receptors and independently of VEGF receptors in primary embryonic LEC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further investigation revealed that FGFR1 was by far the predominant FGF receptor expressed by primary embryonic LEC and correspondingly, siRNA-mediated FGFR1 knockdown abrogated FGF2 mediated LEC proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>While FGF2 potently promoted LEC proliferation and migration, three dimensional tube formation assays revealed that VEGF-C primarily promoted LEC sprouting and elongation, illustrating that FGF2 and VEGF-C play distinct, cooperative roles in lymphatic vascular morphogenesis. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The cellular processes underpinning the growth and development of lymphatic vessels (lymphangiogenesis) include proliferation, migration, adhesion and lumen formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>All of these events need to be precisely orchestrated in order to build a lymphatic vascular network able to function optimally to maintain tissue fluid homeostasis, coordinate immune cell trafficking and absorb lipids from the digestive tract. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Aberrant lymphangiogenesis is associated with a spectrum of human disorders including vascular malformations, lymphoedema, inflammatory diseases and cancer [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Deciphering the genes and signalling pathways that control lymphangiogenesis is crucial in order to uncover targets to which new therapeutics able to combat these diseases can be designed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>While the study of lymphangiogenesis in vivo using animal models including the mouse, frog and fish has yielded invaluable information regarding the genetic pathways important for lymphatic vascular development [1], [2], the dearth of established assays to manipulate primary lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) isolated from mouse tissue in culture has restricted our ability to dissect lymphangiogenic signalling pathways ex vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Models established to study lymphangiogenesis in vitro include the culture of LEC isolated from bovine [3], [4], canine [5], human [5], rat [6] and ovine [7] collecting mesenteric lymphatic vessels or thoracic duct, and the culture of LEC isolated from adult mouse [8] or human skin [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Approaches to yield greater numbers of cells for analysis have included the culture of immortalised LEC from human [10], [11] or mouse lymphangiomas [12], [13], the introduction of telomerase to human LEC [14] and the isolation of SV40 large T antigen immortalised LEC from the thoracic duct of rats [15] and from various organs of mice [16], [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Conditions that promote the differentiation of LEC from embryonic stem cells have also been established [18], [19], [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Three dimensional models employed to study sprouting lymphangiogenesis in vitro include the culture of small segments of rat [21] or mouse [22] thoracic duct in collagen gels, culture of human LEC subjected to flow in collagen [23] or fibrin gels [24] and the culture of beads coated with human LEC or LEC spheroids in fibrin gels [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Each of these approaches has limitations; very small numbers of primary cells can be purified from collecting lymphatic vessels, there is considerable heterogeneity in the endothelial cells that line large collecting vessels compared to lymphatic capillaries, and immortalisation and extended culture alters the molecular properties and identity of LEC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Moreover, while the culture of primary human LEC over several passages has been feasible, the culture of primary mouse LEC has been challenging. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>We sought to optimise methodology for the isolation and short-term culture of primary embryonic mouse LEC in order to establish lymphangiogenesis assays able to: 1. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>By comparison, primary dermal BEC were smaller, more spindle shaped, tended to grow in tube-like structures and grew more slowly than LEC (Figure 2d–f). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>These features mirror the morphology of lymphatic and blood vascular capillaries in embryonic skin; lymphatic capillaries are of a much larger calibre than their blood vascular counterparts (Figure S1a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining for proteins characteristic of lymphatic and blood vascular capillaries in primary embryonic LEC and BEC following 3 days in culture confirmed the highly pure nature of isolated primary LEC and BEC (Figure 2, Figure S2). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>VEGF-C potently promoted LEC sprouting and elongation, rather than proliferation (Figure 5b); VEGF-C induced tubes contained substantially more branchpoints than FGF2-induced tubes, (Figure 5e), while vessel diameter was significantly lower (Figure 5d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>In combination, FGF2 and VEGF-C promoted proliferation and sprouting, resulting in the development of large, interconnected lymphatic vascular tubes (Figure 5b, d, e). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Substantially more nuclear FGFR1 was observed in LEC grown in complete media containing FGF2, corresponding to elevated LEC proliferation under these conditions (Figure 6b). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>We next set out to investigate the requirement for FGFR1 in FGF2-mediated proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Due to the reported inhibition of FGFR3 by SU5402 [38], we sought to specifically ablate FGFR1 activity using siRNA to knockdown FGFR1 levels in primary LEC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>Transfection of primary embryonic dermal LEC with Fgfr1, but not control siRNA, reduced Fgfr1 mRNA levels by ∼70% (Figure 6c) within 48 h of transfection.

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Though primary mouse endothelial cells have traditionally proven difficult to culture, we have developed robust methodology for the measurement of primary embryonic mouse LEC proliferation, migration and three-dimensional tube forming ability in response to pro-lymphangiogenic stimuli in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we have utilised these techniques to demonstrate that FGF2 potently promotes LEC proliferation, migration and tube formation and that these activities rely on signal transduction via FGFR1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Our ability to dissect FGF signalling in a cell autonomous manner has revealed that FGF2 promotes LEC proliferation independently of VEGF receptors and moreover, that FGF2 and VEGF-C play distinct roles in lymphatic vascular morphogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>The assays we have developed fill a longstanding gap in the field and provide the opportunity to rapidly and precisely determine gene function and delineate signalling pathway activity in primary embryonic LEC isolated from both wild-type and genetically modified mice ex vivo. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>While long recognised as a pro-lymphangiogenic factor, the mechanisms by which FGF2 acts on LEC have, to date, been poorly understood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>In contrast to previous work suggesting that FGF2 promotes lymphangiogenesis indirectly, via increasing VEGF-C and VEGF-D production and VEGFR-3 signalling [31], [32], our assays revealed that FGF2 potently promotes the proliferation of primary embryonic mouse LEC directly, via FGFR1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Though our studies focussed on embryonic mouse LEC, previous work has shown that FGF2 stimulates the proliferation and migration of postnatal bovine, human and rat LEC in vitro [4], [15], [36] and promotes lymphangiogenesis when ectopically introduced to adult mouse tissues in vivo [31], [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these data, we predict that primary adult mouse LEC would also be responsive to FGF2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Whether FGF2 primarily activates Ras/MAPK, Plcγ/Ca2+ or PI3K/Akt pathways (the 3 major pathways activated by FGF signalling [39]) in primary embryonic mouse LEC downstream of FGFR1 remains to be established. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Our assays revealed distinct effects of FGF2 and VEGF-C in cellular functions important for lymphangiogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>While FGF2 potently promoted LEC proliferation, VEGF-C primarily promoted cell sprouting and together, these growth factors cooperatively induced the formation of lymphatic vascular tubes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>The effect of the small molecule inhibitor of VEGFR-3, MAZ51, on the morphology of primary LEC in a three dimensional environment confirmed that signalling via VEGFR-3 is particularly important for LEC sprouting and elongation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data demonstrate that the assays we have developed are useful tools with which to dissect pro-lymphangiogenic signalling pathways in primary embryonic mouse LEC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Further elucidating the downstream effectors of FGFR1 and VEGFR-3 signalling pathways that are responsible for LEC proliferation versus sprouting will provide important new insights into how morphogenetic events important for lymphangiogenesis are regulated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our data pave the way for future experiments to characterise the interplay between FGF and VEGF signalling pathways in primary lymphatic endothelial cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Our discovery that FGFR1 is the predominant FGF receptor in primary, non-cultured embryonic mouse LEC and that FGFR1 receptor levels are substantially higher in LEC than BEC, provides an explanation for the potent stimulation of LEC proliferation by FGF2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our finding that embryonic LEC proliferation is dependent on FGFR1 provides an explanation for the observation that knockdown of FGFR3, identified as a gene induced in response to ectopic Prox1 expression in BEC, does not completely block FGF2 stimulated proliferation of human LEC [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Further evidence of a predominantly pro-proliferative role for FGFR1 in LEC was provided by our finding that in response to the addition of growth media containing FGF2, FGFR1 accumulated in the nucleus of LEC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Nuclear translocation of FGFR1 has previously been shown to correlate with transcriptional activation and cell proliferation [37], [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Defining the proteins that interact with nuclear FGFR1, together with the transcriptional targets of FGFR1 in primary LEC will no doubt shed further light on the mechanisms by which FGFR1 activation promotes LEC proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>The early embryonic lethality of Fgfr1−/− mice [41], [42] has, to date, precluded analysis of the role of this receptor in blood and lymphatic vascular development, though the recent generation of Fgfr1flox/flox mice [43], together with blood and lymphatic vascular specific Cre lines, now enable this question to be addressed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Our data provide compelling evidence in support of a crucial role for FGF signalling in lymphangiogenesis and pave the way for further analysis of FGFR1 function in developmental and disease stimulated lymphangiogenesis in vivo. </plain></SENT>
