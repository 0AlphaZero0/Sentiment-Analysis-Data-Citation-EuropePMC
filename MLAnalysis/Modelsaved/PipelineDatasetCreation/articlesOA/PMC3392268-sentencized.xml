<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We used a gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass-spectrometry-based metabolomics platform to evaluate global effects of simvastatin on intermediary metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Analyses were conducted in 148 participants in the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics study who were profiled pre and six weeks post treatment with 40 mg/day simvastatin: 100 randomly selected from the full range of the LDL-C response distribution and 24 each from the top and bottom 10% of this distribution (“good” and “poor” responders, respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The metabolic signature of drug exposure in the full range of responders included essential amino acids, lauric acid (p&lt;0.0055, q&lt;0.055), and alpha-tocopherol (p&lt;0.0003, q&lt;0.017). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Statins are HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are used to reduce LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and, thereby, to reduce CVD risk [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>However, this class of drugs exhibits a broad spectrum of biological effects that may impact on CVD risk, including improvement of endothelial function by upregulation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), decrease in proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and macrophages, reduction of platelet activity, stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques, and antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In addition several clinically significant side effects have been documented, including myopathy and increased risk for developing Type II diabetes mellitus [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Multiple intervention trials with statin drugs have demonstrated a reduction in relative risk for both CVD and stroke. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, residual CVD risk remains high and LDL-C response varies greatly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Variation in response to statins can be affected by genetic and environmental influences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Several genetic polymorphisms that contribute to variability in the LDL-C response to statins have been identified [4], but only a small proportion of the variance has been explained by these factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Additional variables affecting response to statins include diet [5], level of immune response [6], environmental conditions, and drug interactions [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Simvastatin is administered as an inactive precursor drug that is activated by endogenous biotransformation pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>There is increasing interest in the role of gut bacteria in the metabolism of drugs [8], and recent data suggest that secondary bile acids produced by gut microbiome contribute to variation of LDL lowering response to simvastatin [9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Inter-individual variation in response to statins, and the fact that LDL cholesterol and other biomarkers are not sufficient to predict clinical benefit or side effects, suggest that more reliable biomarkers are needed for identifying the sub-populations that may achieve the most benefit from statin use and those that might be at risk for developing side effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Metabolomics provides powerful tools for mapping pathways implicated in disease and in response to drug treatment [10], [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Sophisticated metabolomic analytical platforms and informatics tools have been developed that have made it possible to define initial signatures for several diseases [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Metabolomic “signatures” present in patients who do and do not respond to drug therapy, i.e., signatures that reflect the drug response phenotype, could lead to mechanistic hypotheses that would provide insight into the underlying basis for individual variation in response to drugs such as antidepressants and statins [18], [19], [20]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Previously, using a targeted lipidomics platform, we found that baseline cholesterol ester and phospholipid metabolites were correlated with LDL-C response to treatment in individuals selected from the upper and lower tails of the LDL-C response distribution in the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics (CAP) study [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>C-reactive protein (CRP) response to therapy correlated with baseline plasmalogens, lipids that are involved in inflammation, indicating that distinct metabolic changes are correlated with LDL-C and CRP response to statins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Using a second targeted metabolomics platform in participants from this study, secondary bile acids produced by the gut microbiome were found to be implicated in response to simvastatin [9]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>In this study a mass spectrometry-based metabolomics platform (GC-TOF) that detects small molecules below 550 Da in a broad spectrum of chemical classes and metabolic pathways was used to map global metabolic effects of simvastatin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>An untargeted metabolomics approach can yield many unrelated findings; but the dataset reported here has some striking patterns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>In broadly sampled full range responders, we have detected an increase in amino acids, specifically essential amino acids and their degradation products. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>An increase in dibasic amino acids was correlated with response to simvastatin, again not a random set of amino acids, but specifically those transported by the cystinuria and arginine transporters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>In poor responders we detected a decrease in plasma fructose, glucose and sugar acids that was not seen in good responders. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>This combination of findings may suggest a distinct pattern of energy usage between poor responders and the broader spectrum of response phenotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Poor responders could also be separated from good responders using an OPLS-DA model of baseline metabolites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>Together these findings suggest that metabolomics analysis might be developed for defining a population unlikely to benefit from statin use sufficient to warrant risk of the spectrum of side-effects. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>A more detailed analysis of the GC-TOF data reveals changes in a diverse set of compounds, some anticipated and some unexpected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>The expected changes included decreased free cholesterol in individuals selected from both the full range of LDL-C response (Table 1) and those selected from the 10% tail of good responders (Table S2), but not from the poor response tail (Table 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>The very strong correlation of cholesterol with alpha and gamma tocopherol (vitamin E) may reflect the close relationship between tocopherols and cholesterol metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>In addition to their antioxidant effects, alpha tocopherol modulates LDL receptor concentrations, and reduces CD36 receptor and ABC1 transporter expression [22], [23], [24], [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Simvastatin has been shown previously to reduce alpha-tocopherol levels in plasma following both short-term [26] and long-term exposure [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>In studies where simvastatin treatment was augmented with alpha-tocopherol, increased lowering of total and LDL cholesterol was observed [28], indicating that lower alpha-tocopherol levels are not mediating the LDL-C reductions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that simvastatin treatment increases the capacity of LDL particles to transport lipid soluble antioxidants [27] and oxygenated and hydrocarbon carotenoids [29], suggesting that the statin-induced reductions in total plasma levels of tocopherol which we observed are accompanied by increased tocopherol content of LDL particles, and hence the net result may contribute to greater resistance of these particles to oxidative stress, and hence to reduced atherogenic potential. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Additional pleiotropic effects of simvastatin might include an up regulation of triacylglycerol lipase activity (EC# 3.1.1.3, LIPC) [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>This might explain the increase in plasma levels of glycerol that we detect in our analysis (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>The increase in creatinine and modulation of several amino acids with simvastatin treatment (Table 1) was associated with strong correlations among those metabolites (Figure 1) suggesting that a common metabolic pathway was affected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>We have also observed that levels of shikimic acid, an enterobacteria-derived precursor of aromatic- and indole-containing amino acids, are also altered by statin treatment in the good responders (Table S2). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Pseudouridine, the C-glycoside isomer of the RNA nucleotide uridine, is present in essentially all ribosomal RNAs and seems to be affected by simvastatin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>In humans pseudouridine synthase converts uridine to pseudouridine, which is a dead-end metabolite and generally excreted in urine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>An increased level of pseudouridine suggests a decrease in the rate of excretion, but together with a reduced level of uridine, a more likely scenario is an increase in the activity of pseudouridine synthase. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>The inter-correlated changes in several amino acids and their degradation products and the correlation between changes in these amino acids and LDL-C change (Figure 2) point to possibly important functions of amino acids in simvastatin mechanism of action. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate a statin-induced change in amino acid degradation or transport. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Our pathway analysis indicates that metabolites that changed in the full range participants in response to simvastatin (Table 1) were enriched for the pathway class amino acid degradation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>In the full range participants, metabolites that correlate with LDL-C response to simvastatin (Table 2) included dibasic amino acids that are substrates for the cystinuria-related transporter, potentially indicating changes in transport. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>In addition, the changes in citrulline and ornithine suggest an increased flux through the urea cycle (Figure 2, Table 2) again pointing to a change in amino acid degradation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Since simvastatin treatment either has no effect or can improve kidney function [31], [32], [33] it is unlikely that the changes in amino acids were due to renal dysfunction. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>The previously published identification of amino acid metabolism as a marker of changes in cholesterol metabolism is consistent with the development of peptide biomarkers of cardiovascular disease [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>In addition, amino acids have been identified as predictors of the risk of developing diabetes and possibly contributing to changes in insulin sensitivity [16], [35]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>The metabolite most significantly different between good and poor responders at baseline was the purine metabolite xanthine, which is implicated in oxidative stress cascades (Table 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Xanthine is the final breakdown product of purine nucleotides and the immediate precursor of uric acid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Xanthine is the substrate of xanthine oxidase, which produces hydrogen peroxide and hence is implicated in mechanisms of oxidative stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Since free radicals are known to decouple NOS enzymatic activity, a lower basal level of xanthine and purine degradation may yield an environment for more robust NOS signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Xanthine oxidase inhibitors are an emerging treatment for cardiac ischemia [36], [37] and xanthine oxidase has been considered as a therapeutic target for cardiovascular disease [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Together, these results suggest that we have identified a metabolite related to oxidative stress that is robustly correlated to LDL response to simvastatin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, recent results indicate that hyperuricemia resulting from increased purine degradation attenuates NO production by inhibiting arginine transport at the NOS associated CAT-1 transporter [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>It has not escaped our attention that statin effects on arginine transport function may contribute to therapeutic effects on endothelial function by increasing NOS activity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Recent studies employing ex vivo cultures of intestinal bacteria to metabolize simvastatin have revealed a degradation of drug, producing a series of metabolites including and similar to 2-hydroxyvaleric acid (2-hydroxypentanoic acid) [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>We detected 2-hydroxyvaleric acid as a significantly decreased metabolite following in vivo treatment with simvastatin (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Since this metabolite is present in simvastatin naïve samples and is decreased by simvastatin treatment, it is possible that simvastatin, or a metabolite of simvastatin, inhibits an enzyme that produces 2-hydroxyvaleric acid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Conversely, low basal levels of 2-hydroxyvaleric acid exhibit a highly significant correlation to LDL-C reduction in good and poor responders (Table 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>This suggests lower activity of a promiscuous enzyme that produces 2-hydroxyvaleric acid, and perhaps metabolizes simvastatin, might also result in lower rates of simvastatin degradation and differential pharmacokinetics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>This observation, as well as those described for shikimic acid above, suggests that variation in gut microbiome activity can contribute to mechanism of variation in response to simvastatin (Table S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>An influence of gut micoflora on simvastatin response was also suggested by our recent finding that several secondary bile acids derived from microbial metabolism are predictive of LDL-C response to simvastatin in the CAP study [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>This suggests that genetic, gut microbiome and environmental interactions might all contribute to mechanism of variation of response to simvastatin. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>While we consider this study a discovery project to validate the experimental paradigm and elucidate pleiotropic features, the sample size is commensurate with other metabolomics studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>However, larger studies will be necessary to validate clinical utility–which will ideally define pre-treatment metabolic signatures that are predictive of efficacy of simvastatin as well as other statins in reducing clinical cardiovascular events, as well as those that can identify individuals most likely to experience adverse effects of treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Further, by assessing such markers, the design of future clinical trials can be improved by excluding individuals who are least likely to derive clinical benefit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>The observation that people selected from the ends (best and worst responders) are biochemically distinct suggests that metabolomics might be a powerful tool for sub classification of individuals as an important step in streamlining clinical trials and personalizing treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Finally, the application of both mass spectrometry and lipidomics platforms in the CAP study has demonstrated the value of this approach in mapping global metabolic effects of simvastatin and in highlighting the pathways that may modulate variation in its clinical efficacy and in its multiple biological effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>We have undertaken this systems biology approach to define pharmacometabolomic changes to generate hypotheses of pleiotropic mechanisms mediating simvastatin effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that functional studies are warranted into the interaction of simvastatin with endogenous and enterobiome metabolites at bile and amino acid transporters. </plain></SENT>
