</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The idea of generating a logo from aligned sets of sequences was introduced in 1990 by Schneider and Stephens (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The intention of a sequence logo is to concentrate into a single plot the general consensus, the order of predominance of residues at every position, the relative frequencies of every residue at every position, the amount of information present at every position and significant locations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This logo is then able to present all of the relevant information to the viewer in a fast and concise manner. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Several webservers exist to generate sequence logos from MSA’s (2–5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>All these servers suffer from different limitations in the handling sequence redundancy and low number of observations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, all public sequence logo servers, with the exception of the Icelogo (4) and two-sample logo (5) methods, focus on displaying the position-specific enrichment of amino acids, discarding the equally valuable information related to amino acid depletion. Seq2logo aims at resolving these issues allowing the user to include sequence weighting to correct for data redundancy, pseudo counts to correct for low number of observations (6–8) and five different logotype representations each capturing different aspects related to amino acid enrichment and depletion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In addition to the usual Shannon logo (9), Seq2Logo includes the option to create Kullback–Leibler (KL) (10) logos where the depleted (under-represented) amino acids are represented on the negative y-axis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Besides the conventional KL logo, Seq2Logo can also display a weighted KL logo, where the relative height of each amino acid is proportional to the log-odds ratio and a probability weighted KL logo, where the relative height of each amino acid is proportional to the product of the probability and log-odds ratio. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Finally, inspired by the work of Fujii et al. (11), Seq2Logo also includes an option to visualize PSSM (position-specific scoring matrix) logos, where the height of a bar is given by the sum of the absolute value of the PSSM weight matrix values and the height of a given amino acids is proportional to the absolute value of the weight matrix score. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In particular, the weighted KL logo provides a visual and highly intuitive representation of both amino acid enrichment and depletion in for instance receptor binding motifs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Besides allowing input in the format of peptides and MSAs, the Seq2Logo server accepts inputs such as Blast sequence profiles, providing easy access for non-expert end-users to characterize and identify functionally conserved/variable amino acids in any given protein of interest. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Seq2Logo implements two strategies to improve the accuracy of the estimated sequence logo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The first strategy is sequence weighting which corrects for data redundancy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The second strategy is pseudo counts which correct for a low number of observations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Sequence weighting is implemented as described in (6,8) and pseudo counts as described in (7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>For details, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks469/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link>. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In a sequence logo, the height of the bar is equal to the information content at each amino acid position. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The information content is calculated using the relation , where pa and qa are the observed probability (calculated from the data) and background probability, respectively, of the amino acid a. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>If an equiprobable background amino acid distribution is applied, a conventional Shannon sequence logo is displayed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>If a background amino acid distribution reflecting the prevalence of the different amino acids is applied, a Kullback–Leibler sequence logo is displayed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The choice of the Kullback–Leibler logotype in Seq2Logo not only provides correction for the uneven distribution of amino acids, but also expresses the depleted amino acids (where pa &lt; qa) on the negative side of the y-axis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>This enables the user to quickly identify enriched and depleted (under-represented) amino acids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>To enhance the identification and information of the depleted amino acids, Seq2Logo includes another logotype called weighted Kullback–Leibler. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>This logo type presents each individual amino acid proportional to its relative log-odds score [log2(pa/qa)]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Another logotype is included called probability weighted Kullback–Leibler, where the relative height of each individual amino acid is proportional to pa · log2(pa/qa). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Finally, Seq2Logo includes an option to display PSSM-logos (11), where the height of a bar is equal to the sum of the absolute value of the PSSM weight matrix values and the height of each amino acid is proportional to the absolute value of the weight matrix score (with negative values displayed on the negative y-axis). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The first and the most important part is submission (Figure 1, left panel). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Here, the user can upload or paste in the input data in addition to specifying the logotype (Shannon, Kullback–Leibler, Weighted Kullback–Leibler, probability weighted Kullback–Leibler or PSSM-logo) and conditions for handling the input data (sequence weighting and pseudo counts). Seq2Logo can read sequence data in the following formats: Fasta, ClustalW, Raw peptide sequences and Weight/Blast matrix (for details on each format refer to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks469/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The detection of the format happens automatically through the identification of key elements from each format. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In the submission part, the user further specifies which output files should be created. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>In the graphical layout (Figure 1, right panel), the user can customize the graphical layout of the logo plot. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Page size sets the resolution of the image and stacks per line and lines per page determine how the logo should look. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>One of the distinct powers of Seq2Logo is its ability to deal with data redundancy and low number of observations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, no other public sequence logo servers share this ability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>In Figure 3, the cruciality of these features for the generation of accurate sequence logos describing a binding motif is illustrated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The figure displays Shannon sequence logos generated by Seq2Logo, using different option to improve the accuracy, as well as sequence logos generated by Weblogo (2) and EnoLOGOS (3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>When comparing the logos calculated from the small sample data set with the logo obtained from the larger data set, it is apparent that the inclusion of sequence weighting and pseudo counts have a significant positive impact on the overall accuracy of the binding motif description.

<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>All logos except the right logo in the lower row were calculated from a set of 13 artificial peptide sequences proposed to bind HLA-A*02:01 (see Figure 1). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>The other distinct feature of Seq2Logo compared to most other public sequence logo server is the display of depleted amino acids on the negative y-axis in Kullback–Leibler logos. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Most sequence logo servers display the relative height of the different amino acids in a manner proportional to their frequency, thus displaying only the position-specific enrichment of amino acids, discarding the equally valuable information related to amino acid depletion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>To improve on this issue, Seq2Logo includes a series of distinct logotypes (see Figure 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>In addition to the usual Shannon logo, Seq2Logo includes the option to create Kullback–Leibler (KL) logos where depleted amino acids are represented on the negative y-axis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Besides the conventional KL logo, Seq2Logo can also display a weighted KL logo, where the relative height of each amino acid is proportional to the log-odds ratio and a probability weighted KL logo, where the relative height of each amino acid is proportional to the product of the probability and log-odds ratio. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>In particular, the weighted KL logo provides a visual and highly intuitive representation of both amino acid enrichment and depletion in for instance receptor binding motifs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Besides these information-based logotypes, Seq2Logo offers the possibility of displaying PSSM-logos calculated either from a log-odds weight matrix derived by Seq2Logo from a multiple sequence alignment or from a user-defined PSSM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>In the PSSM-logo, the height of the bar and amino acid at each position is proportional to the absolute value of the PSSM weight matrix values. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>This logotype is particularly powerful when illustrating depletion of a small set of amino acids form otherwise variable positions in a sequence motif. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>One such example is N-linked glycosylation sites that are known to have the motif N-X-S/T where X can be any amino acid but P. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Visualizing this motif as an information-based sequence logo will not capture the depletion of P at the position between N and S/T as all amino acids except P are found at this position, hence making the overall information content very small. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, visualizing the motif as a PSSM-logo, the strong depletion of P at the position between N and S/T becomes apparent (see Figure 5). Figure 4.The different logotype representations covered by Seq2Logo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Sequence logos generated from at set of 13 artificial peptide sequences proposed to bind HLA-A*02:01 (see Figure 1). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>A powerful way to characterize sequence conservation/variation within a protein family is by use of sequence profiles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Such sequence profiles can be obtained using Psi-Blast (7). Seq2Logo accepts input of such sequence profile in the Blast profile format allowing easy access for non-expert end-users to characterize and identify functionally conserved/variable amino acids in any given protein of interest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Blast sequence profile can be generated either in-house using a command like ‘blastpgp −d db −e 0.00001 −j 4 −Q blastprofile −i fasta −o out’, where db is the sequence database used to search by Blast, −e defines the e-value cut-off for significant hits, −j defines the number of Psi-blast iterations, −i is the input file in FASTA format, −Q is the output file for the blast profile (the file to be used by Seq2Logo to visualized the sequence profile) and −o is the file for the blast output. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Sequence logos provide a powerful way to visualize amino acid preferences in a receptor binding motif, as well as sequence conservation/variation and the location of functionally essential residues in multiple sequence alignments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Accurate estimation of a sequence motif is often compromised by data redundancy and low number of observations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Inappropriate handling of these issues can lead to inaccurate estimation of the sequence motif and subsequent poor sequence logo representation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the majority of sequence logo webservers have a poor visualization of the information related to amino acid depletion since they focus on displaying the position-specific enrichment of amino acids. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Here, we have proposed a novel sequence logo generator, Seq2Logo that aims at addressing these shortcomings and allow non-expert end-users, via an easy to use web-interface, to generate accurate sequence logos from protein sequence data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that Seq2Logo can deal with sequence redundancy and low number of observations in a manner superior to that of other public available sequence logo generators like Weblogo and ENOlogos. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Besides the conventional Shannon sequence logo, Seq2Logo also incorporates distinct logotypes where depleted amino acids are displayed on the negative y-axis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>These logotypes offer a unique possibility for Seq2Logo to display for instance receptor-binding motifs in a format that highlights both favored and disfavored amino acids at the different positions in the motif. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>A sequence profile is a powerful way to capture position-specific information about sequence conservation/variation within a protein family. Seq2Logo accepts sequence profiles in the Blast format as input and can in a very simple and intuitive manner be used in combination with Blast as a tool to visualize sequence profiles and identify functionally conserved/variable amino acids in any given protein of interest. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Finally, to allow other servers dealing with multiple sequence alignments and binding motifs to directly cooperate with Seq2Logo and benefit from its improved features, the server includes a form-handler that enables communication with Seq2Logo via a simple html form. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>This feature has allowed for a simple and effective improvement to two of our own webservers NNAlign (14) and Blast2logo (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.cbs.dtu.dk/biotools/Blast2logo">www.cbs.dtu.dk/biotools/Blast2logo</ext-link> (14 May 2012, date last accessed)), and we believe this to be an additional feature that will become very useful for other webserver developers within the field of for instance receptor-binding motif characterization. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>In its current form, Seq2Logo can only handle amino acid input data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>The reason for this limitation is that most of its unique features like pseudo count estimates from Blosum substitution matrices and sequence weighting of are specific for amino acid data. </plain></SENT>
