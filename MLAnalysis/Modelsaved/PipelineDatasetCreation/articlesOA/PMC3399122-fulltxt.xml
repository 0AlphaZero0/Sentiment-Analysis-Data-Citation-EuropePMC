Homologs of its eight canonical subunits &#8211; Sec3, Sec5, Sec6, Sec8, Sec10, Sec15, Exo70, and Exo84 &#8211; were found also in higher plants and confirmed to form complexes <italic>in vivo</italic>, and to participate in cell growth including polarized expansion of pollen tubes and root hairs. Here we present results of a phylogenetic study of land plant exocyst subunits encoded by a selection of completely sequenced genomes representing a variety of plant, mostly angiosperm, lineages. According to their evolution histories, plant exocyst subunits can be divided into several groups. The core subunits Sec6, Sec8, and Sec10, together with Sec3 and Sec5, underwent few, if any fixed duplications in the tracheophytes (though they did amplify in the moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic>), while others form larger families, with the number of paralogs ranging typically from two to eight per genome (Sec15, Exo84) to several dozens per genome (Exo70). Most of the diversity, which can be in some cases traced down to the origins of land plants, can be attributed to the peripheral subunits Exo84 and, in particular, Exo70. As predicted previously, early land plants (including possibly also the Rhyniophytes) encoded three ancestral Exo70 paralogs which further diversified in the course of land plant evolution. Our results imply that plants do not have a single &#8220;Exocyst complex&#8221; &#8211; instead, they appear to possess a diversity of exocyst variants unparalleled among other organisms studied so far. This feature might perhaps be directly related to the demands of building and maintenance of the complicated and spatially diverse structures of the endomembranes and cell surfaces in multicellular land plants.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>exocyst</kwd><kwd>phylogeny</kwd><kwd>land plants</kwd><kwd>co-evolution</kwd><kwd>gene duplication</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="60"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="9052"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Exocyst, or the Sec6/8 complex, is an evolutionarily conserved heterooligomeric protein complex, generally believed to function especially in the last stage of exocytosis &#8211; i.e., vesicle tethering, preceding fusion of trans-Golgi network-derived vesicles with the plasmalemma, although additional, also mostly vesicle trafficking-related, exocyst roles have been described (reviewed, e.g., in He and Guo, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2009</xref>; Zhang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">2010</xref>; Heider and Munson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2012</xref>). The eight canonical exocyst subunits, Sec3, Sec5, Sec6, Sec8, Sec10, Sec15, Exo70, and Exo84, were originally identified in yeast (TerBush et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">1996</xref>; Guo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">1999</xref>). Subsequently, their homologs were found also in metazoans (Guo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">1997</xref>; Kee et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">1997</xref>) and higher plants (Eli&#225;&#353; et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2003</xref>). Angiosperm exocyst subunits form complexes <italic>in vivo</italic> (H&#225;la et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2008</xref>), and participate in exocytosis- or vesicle trafficking-dependent processes, such as cell growth including both tip growth and diffuse surface expansion (Cole et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2005</xref>; Wen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">2005</xref>; Synek et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2006</xref>; H&#225;la et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2008</xref>), cell division (Fendrych et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2010</xref>), delivery of materials to the periplasm and cell wall (Wang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">2010</xref>), biogenesis of specialized cell wall structures such as the myxosperm seed coat (Kulich et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2010</xref>), pathogen response (Pe&#269;enkov&#225; et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2011</xref>), and mycorrhiza (Genre et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2012</xref>). The Exo70 subunit has been also previously implicated in the pollen-stigma interaction in <italic>Brassica</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Samuel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2009</xref>), though its specific role remains controversial (Kitashiba et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2011</xref>) and the observed phenotypes may be rather due to a generalized secretion defect affecting stigma function (Synek et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2006</xref>).</p><p>Exocyst belongs, together with related COG, GARP, and DSL1 complexes, to the large, evolutionarily ancient family of eukaryotic quatrefoil vesicle tethering complexes (Whyte and Munro, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2002</xref>; Koumandou et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2007</xref>). Structural studies (recently reviewed by Hertzog and Chavrier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2011</xref>) and theoretical sequence-based modeling revealed common structural elements involving rod-like helical bundles in all eight subunits, and a model of exocyst architecture based on aggregation of these bundles has been proposed (Munson and Novick, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2006</xref>; Croteau et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2009</xref>). Electron microscopy observations consistent with this model have been made also in the case of the putative plant exocyst (Segu&#237;-Simmaro et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2004</xref>). Bundled Sec6, Sec8, Sec10 subunits probably form a core of the complex. At least in the yeast model, Sec6 also participates in its anchoring to the target membrane, and the remaining, more peripherally located subunits mediate interactions with membrane vesicles destined for delivery (as in the case of Sec15, interacting with the vesicle-borne Sec4 GTPase), with the target membrane and associated small GTPases of the Rho family (Sec3 and Exo70), and possibly with other structural or regulatory proteins (Songer and Munson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2009</xref>). The Exo70 subunit, which can bind to phosphoinositides, is crucial for targeting the complex to the destination membrane also in metazoans (He et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2007</xref>). Exo84 is also required for proper localization of the exocyst in yeast (Zhang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">2005</xref>). Surprisingly, the function of these subunits is not restricted to participation in exocytosis, as Exo70 and Exo84 subunits also participate in pre-mRNA splicing (Awashi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2001</xref>; Dellago et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2011</xref>).</p><p>While exocyst subunits are encoded by a single gene in yeast or at most a few paralogs in metazoans, a puzzling number of plant isoforms has been identified in particular for the Exo70 subunit, which is encoded by 23 distinct loci in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (Eli&#225;&#353; et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2003</xref>; Synek et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2006</xref>). Some other subunits are also encoded by duplicated or triplicated (as in case of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> Exo84) loci. However, the only published phylogenetic studies of the plant exocyst so far are devoted solely to the Exo70 subunit (Eli&#225;&#353; et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2003</xref>; Synek et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2006</xref>) or restricted to a very limited species selection (Chong et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2010</xref>). With growing number of sequenced genomes, and increasing quality of genomic sequence annotations, a broader coverage of plant lineages can now be achieved. Here we present the results of a phylogenetic analysis of the canonical exocyst subunits encoded by 10 land plant genomes representing dicot and monocot angiosperms, a lycophyte (<italic>Selaginella moellendorffii</italic>) and a moss (<italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic>), and propose an evolutionary scenario consistent with our results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Identification of exocyst subunit sequences</title><p>The collection of exocyst subunit sequences has been assembled by exhaustive mining of multiple data sources.

To gain insight also into the asterid lineage, we attempted to find the exocyst subunits in the publicly available tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicon</italic>) genome and cDNA sequences, which, however, did not yet cover the complete genome at the time of analysis. In particular, we found no sequences corresponding to Sec5 and Sec8.

Among the remaining subunits, we could upon closer inspection distinguish genuine single-copy or low copy subunits that were never present in more than two versions in the vascular plants (this was the case for Sec3, Sec5, Sec6, Sec8, and Sec10), and intermediate size gene families with more than two and less than eight paralogs in at least one of the species (Sec15 and Exo84). We shall further discuss these three groups separately.</p></sec><sec><title>Low copy subunits: Sec3, Sec5, Sec6, Sec8, and Sec10</title><p>The first group of subunits includes Sec3 (in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> encoded by two genes in tandem &#8211; AtSEC3A/At1g47550/Arath1_Sec3 and AtSEC3B/At1g47560/Arath2_Sec3), Sec5 (again two <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genes &#8211; AtSEC5A/At1g76850/Arath1_Sec5 and AtSEC5B/At1g21170/Arath2_Sec5), Sec6, Sec8, and Sec10 (all encoded by single genes in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> &#8211; AtSEC6/At1g71820/Arath_Sec6, AtSEC8/At3g10380/Arath_Sec8 and AtSEC10/At5g12370/Arath_Sec10 &#8211; but see comments on possible Sec10 duplication below). Though these subunits are single-copy in some species, each of them is duplicated in at least one angiosperm genome, and all but Sec6 are triplicated in <italic>P. patens</italic>, showing that there is no strict functional requirement on keeping only a single protein version in cells. In fact, multiple splicing variants have been proposed for most <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> subunits in the recent genome annotation (Lamesch et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2012</xref>).</p><p>Tandem duplications affecting angiosperm exocyst genes are apparently not restricted to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Sec3. The <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genomic assembly might be problematic in the area around Sec10, since inspection of available GenBank sequences suggests a possible tandem duplication of the Sec10 locus differing by a couple of silent mutations and variant non-coding ends. The duplicated gene appears to be transcribed (see GenBank cDNAs AF479280.1 and AK318699.1 which are in good mutual agreement but differ from the reference genome sequence, though they encode an identical protein). Also in tomato, we found a single possibly functional Sec10 locus and three closely related pseudogenes with multiple stop codons, two of them in tandem (the pseudogenes are not included in the phylogeny; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Supplementary Material</xref> for accession numbers).</p><p>As a rule, protein sequences of the low copy subunits consist of a single well-defined domain, are well conserved along the whole length (exceptions will be discussed below) and their phylogenetic trees (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) exhibit striking overall mutual similarity. Within the angiosperms, all gene duplications except monocot Sec3 appear to be relatively recent, resulting in within-species paralogs that share at least 80% of identical amino acids in the most distant pair of the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> Sec5 paralogs. Duplicated paralogs cannot be matched among genomes more distant than the two rice varieties, or the two <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> species. The only exception from this pattern of apparently late gene duplications is the Sec3 subunit that has obviously split into two paralogous lineages early in the evolution of monocots or at least grasses.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Unrooted maximum likelihood (ML) phylograms of the low copy Exocyst subunits</bold>.

Notably, one of the ancient Sec3 branches (the clade &#8220;monocot 1&#8221; in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) has considerably diverged from the cluster of dicot sequences and the remaining monocot clade, suggesting a possible release of selection pressure followed by neo- or subfunctionalization. Compared to the degree of conservation found in the angiosperms, the <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> paralogs exhibit major within-genome differences, with the most distant paralogs Phypa1_Sec10 and Phypa3_Sec10 sharing only 51% of identical amino acids.</p><p>Two sequences deviate from the standard overall conserved domain structure of the relevant low copy subunits and can be perhaps viewed as &#8220;structural outliers&#8221; of their corresponding gene families. In the case of the <italic>A. lyrata</italic> Sec3 paralog Araly2_Sec3, the <sc>n</sc>-terminal part of the conserved domain is replaced by a domain related to a family of RING box/E3 ligases, encoded by a single-exon and flanked at least from one side by a sequence related to Copia-like retroelements, suggesting a very recent retrotransposition-mediated gene fusion. However, this domain combination appears to be unique in the whole of GenBank, and there are no ESTs documenting that this gene is expressed <italic>in planta</italic>; therefore, its functionality and biological significance remains problematic.</p><p>The second structural outlier is the <italic>P. patens</italic> Sec10 paralog Phypa2_Sec10, noticed in our previous study (Grunt et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2008</xref>) because of its unique combination of a N-terminally located Sec10 domain with the formin-specific FH2 domain at the <sc>c</sc>-end of the protein (see sequence Phypa5 in Grunt et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2008</xref>). An alternative splicing prediction separates these two domains into two distinct proteins (a short version corresponding to standard Sec10 is included in our phylogeny). The combination of Sec10 and FH2 domains is again unique in GenBank. However, there is a partial cDNA of the formin end (GenBank BY987890.1) indicating gene expression in the moss, albeit it is unclear which splice variants are biologically relevant.</p></sec><sec><title>Intermediate size families: Sec15 and Exo84</title><p>The second group of subunits consists of two gene families, Sec15 (with two <italic>A. thaliana</italic> paralogs &#8211; AtSEC15A/At3g56640/Arath1_Sec15 and AtSEC15B/At4g02350/Arath2_Sec15) and Exo84 (with three paralogs in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> &#8211; AtEXO84a/At5g49830/Arath2_Exo84, AtEXO84b, At1g10385/Arath3_Exo84, and AtEXO84c/At1g10180/Arath1_Exo84). In other studied genomes, Sec15 is encoded by two to five subunits (except <italic>S. moellendorffii</italic>, where only a single protein was found) and Exo84 by three to eight (again except <italic>S. moellendorffii</italic> with only two genes). In both cases the highest number was found in <italic>P. trichocarpa</italic>, and the final poplar subunit count may be even higher, since there is cDNA evidence of additional transcripts encoding proteins identical to the Sec15 paralogs included in our analysis but differing in their non-translated ends, reminiscent of the situation in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> Sec10 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Supplementary Material</xref>).</p><p>Phylogenetic trees of both families indicate that at least a part of the observed diversity is ancient, and can be traced back at least to the origins of angiosperms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Both gene families can be split into two branches in seed plants, with multiple additional within-branch amplifications. In Sec15, most of these later amplification events (generating two clusters of poplar genes in both branches and a pair of rice genes in the B branch) appear to be fairly recent, reminiscent of those detected for low copy subunits. However, a duplication of the A subunit apparently occurred early in the monocot lineage (no later than at the emergence of grasses), resulting in two monocot- or grass-specific subfamilies, A1 and A2.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Unrooted maximum likelihood (ML) phylograms of Sec15 and Exo84</bold>.

Clearly defined A and B branches (named according to the corresponding <italic>A. thaliana</italic> subunits) were found only in the dicots, while related monocot sequences form a rather compact cluster, probably closer to the A branch than to B. The dicot A and B branches and the monocot cluster will be further referred to as the A/B clade (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Monocot A/B sequences also bear traces of early gene duplication preceding the radiation of grasses, but clearly distinct from the event that produced the A and B branches and followed by little actual sequence divergence (the rice A/B sequences OrysaJ1_Exo84 and OrysaJ2_Exo84 share 78% of identical amino acids). Besides of the A/B clade, a second ancient branch (the C clade) is shared by all examined angiosperms and contains, as a rule, products of single-copy genes with exception of an apparently recent cluster of three poplar sequences. Two mutually related dicot outliers (the CX sequences) are apparently related to the C clade, and proteins similar to them have been predicted also in <italic>Ricinus communis</italic> (GenBank XM_002526525.1) and <italic>Glycine max</italic> (GenBank XM_003541318.1). A genomic DNA sequence fragment from <italic>V. vinifera</italic> (GenBank AM443616.2) contains patches of a possible ORF similar to the CX sequences in an area annotated as non-coding. While the grapevine genome annotation may require updating, it is also possible that these patches are vestiges of a lost gene that may have had a wider distribution.</p><p>In contrast to the angiosperms, the lycophyte and moss Sec15 sequences exhibit only minimum diversification, while Exo84 underwent duplication in <italic>S. moellendorffii</italic> and extensive amplification, producing seven rather diversified paralogs, in <italic>P. patens</italic>. While the branching order is not reliable in the non-angiosperm sequences, the resulting tree does not exclude the possibility that the two major Exo84 clades might have appeared already at the base of the vascular plants.</p><p>Compared to the low copy subunits, Sec15 and Exo84 sequences exhibit greater diversity, with <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> AtSec15A and AtSec15B sharing 48%, AtExo84A and AtExo84B 59%, and AtExo84B and AtExo84C only 34% of identical amino acids. Nevertheless, the angiosperm branches of the phylogram appear to be rather compact, and the only conspicuously diversified poplar Exo84B paralog, Potri8_Exo84, may not be expressed, as we could not find any corresponding ESTs.</p><p>All sequences from each family can be aligned reliably along the whole length, with only three exceptions. The predicted rice Sec15 paralogs OrysaJ3_Sec15 and OrysaI4_Sec15 are missing a C-terminal part of the characteristic Sec15 domain and have instead an unrelated sequence. No homologs with such a gene organization have been found in GenBank, and there are no ESTs matching these genes. Together with the long distance from the rest of B clade Sec15 sequences, indicating relaxed selection, this suggest that these <italic>O. sativa</italic> Sec15 outliers may actually correspond to a pseudogene that has arisen not long before the separation of the <italic>japonica</italic> and <italic>indica</italic> varieties and that is now in the process of decay. The third structural outlier, Potri1_Exo84, one of the outlier CX sequences with a long C-terminal extension, also lacks cDNA or EST support, and it is thus not clear if it is expressed at all.</p></sec><sec><title>The enormous diversity of Exo70 paralogs</title><p>The large Exo70 family consists of 23 paralogs in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, representing eight previously identified clades (Synek et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2006</xref>): AtExo70A1/At5g03540/ArathA1_Exo70, AtExo70A2/At5g52340/ArathA2_Exo70, and AtExo70A3/At5g52350/ArathA3_Exo70 in clade A, AtExo70B1/At5g58430/ArathB1_Exo70 and AtExo70B2/At1g07000/ArathB2_Exo70 in clade B, AtExo70C1/At5g13150/ArathC1_Exo70 and AtExo70C2/At5g13990/ArathC2_Exo70 in clade C, AtExo70D1/At1g72470/ArathD1_Exo70, AtExo70D2/At1g54090/ArathD2_Exo70, and AtExo70D3/At3g14090/ArathD3_Exo70 in clade D, AtExo70E1/At3g29400/ArathE1_Exo70 and AtExo70E2/At5g61010/ArathE2_Exo70 in clade E, AtExo70F1/At5g50380/ArathF1_Exo70 in clade F, AtExo70G1/At4g31540/ArathG1_Exo70 and AtExo70G2/At1g51640/ArathG2_Exo70 in clade G, and eight paralogs &#8211; AtExo70H1/At3g55150/ArathH1_Exo70, AtExo70H2/At2g39380/ArathH2_Exo70, AtExo70H3/At3g09530/ArathH3_Exo70, AtExo70H4/At3g09520/ArathH4_Exo70, AtExo70H5/At2g28640/ArathH5_Exo70, AtExo70H6/At1g07725/ArathH6_Exo70, AtExo70H7/At5g59730/ArathH7_Exo70, and AtExo70H8/At2g28650/ArathH8_Exo70 &#8211; in clade H.

We have used only the well-aligned portion to construct a phylogram (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) that essentially corroborates the previous reports but brings some additional new insights. Our analysis confirms the existence of three major Exo70 lineages Exo70.1, Exo70.2, and Exo70.3 that contain both angiosperm and &#8220;lower plant&#8221; sequences, as well as the nine clades (A&#8211;I) with members of both monocot and dicot origin (Synek et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2006</xref>). The clade I, restricted only to some angiosperms (it is, e.g., missing in both <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> species), clusters within a branch that includes the compact angiosperm G clade and a group of moss sequences, but none from <italic>Selaginella</italic>, suggesting loss in the lycophyte lineage.

Apparently, a single family of Exo70 subunits underwent major expansion in both monocots and dicots. Reverse transcription might have contributed to gene amplification in case of the abundant dicot H clade with a large proportion of single-exon genes (Synek et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2006</xref>; Chong et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2010</xref>), but not in case of the monocot FX with a large proportion of multi-exon genes (Chong et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2010</xref>). Somewhat surprisingly, a very distant paralog OrysaFX8_Exo84, which clusters within the F branch but outside the genuine FX clade, is supported by a full-length cDNA (GenBank AK109785.1) and there are even two closely related ESTs from <italic>Lolium perenne</italic> (GenBank GR511301.1) and <italic>L. temulentum</italic> (GenBank DT673816.1), indicating that this outlier is functional and possibly specific for some grasses.</p><p>Duplicated genes tend to be rapidly eliminated by natural selection if they bring no advantage in terms of fitness. Question thus arises why there are so many Exo70 varieties maintained across large evolutionary distances. One possibility would be sub- or neofunctionalization of the conserved Exo70 domain itself. We have thus examined representative <italic>A. thaliana</italic> Exo70 sequences for traces of positive (diversifying) selection by estimation of the residue-specific ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous mutation rates (<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>s</sub>). For this analysis, we chose two sequence collection &#8211; eight representatives of the main clades (AtExo70A1, AtExo70B1, AtExo70C1, AtExo70D1, AtExo70E1, AtExo70F1, AtExo70G1, and AtExo70H1) to identify markers of selection generating or enhancing between-clade differences, and eight representatives of the H clade (AtExo70H1, AtExo70H2, AtExo70H3, AtExo70H4, AtExo70H5, AtExo70H6, AtExo70H7, and AtExo70H8) to find traces of selection favoring within-clade differences. However, in both cases there was only evidence of purifying selection throughout the length of the sequence, but no positive selection, and we thus conclude that differences within the conserved part of the Exo70 subunits are not likely to play a decisive part in determining the function of the individual paralogs.</p><p>Functional diversification, however, may be due to the variable N-terminal sequences. We thus examined these regions in more detail and uncovered two sequence motifs conserved in many, but not all, Exo70 paralogs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Distribution of these motifs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Supplementary Material</xref>) suggests that they are ancestral, and that they have been lost or eroded in some of the sequences. Motif 2 is present in most, if not all members of all stable Exo70 clades with exception of FX, and also in the members of the &#8220;basal non-angiosperm group,&#8221; i.e., in the sequences of lower plant origin with unclear mutual relationships that belong to the Exo70.2 supergroup. The more N-terminally located motif 1 was found in most members of the basal non-angiosperm group and of the A, E, and G/I clades. It is present also in members of the F branch except FX, and also except the distant F outlier OrysaFX8_Exo70. This suggests that Motif 1 is also ancestral but was lost in some angiosperm clades within the Exo70.2 supergroup. The presence of the conserved motifs indicates that the variable Exo70 N-termini have largely evolved through a process of mutations and selection rather than domain-shuffling, although this does not have to be the rule in all cases (especially the origin of the diverse and mutually largely unrelated N-termini of the FX proteins remains unclear).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Alignment of representative examples of the N-terminal conserved motifs found within the variable N-terminal part of Exo70 sequences</bold>.

Our previous works (Eli&#225;&#353; et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2003</xref>; Synek et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2006</xref>) have focused only on the most abundant subunit, Exo70, and the only previous phylogenetic study addressing all the eight canonical exocyst subunits in plants (Chong et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2010</xref>) was based on only four species &#8211; <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, rice and poplar as the representatives of angiosperms, and the moss <italic>P. patens</italic>, allowing only a limited possibility of generalization. We have included a broader and more representative collection of genomes, including a moss (<italic>P. patens</italic>), a lycophyte, i.e., a non-seed vascular plant (<italic>S. moellendorffii</italic>), and eight angiosperms (unfortunately, there is, to date, no sufficiently well-covered gymnosperm genome for an exhaustive search). The angiosperms are represented by five dicotyledonous and three grass species covering a rather broad range of diversity (see the simplified scheme of plant evolution in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Among dicots, the closest are the two <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> species (<italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>A. lyrata</italic>) that have separated approximately five millions of years ago (Koch et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2000</xref>). Poplar (<italic>P. trichocarpa</italic>) is included as somewhat more distant representative of the rosid clade, grapevine (<italic>V. vinifera</italic>) as a basal rosid, and several members of the genus <italic>Solanum</italic> (where, unfortunately, no genome is annotated well enough to provide data for all subunits) are representing the asterids. The coverage of the monocot clade is narrower, as all the available genomes belong to grasses. Thus, although we propose some possible monocot-specific features of the exocyst family in this paper on the basis of data from three grass species (<italic>O. sativa</italic>, <italic>S. bicolor</italic>, and <italic>B. distachyon</italic>), we do not know at present if such features are present also in non-grass monocots.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>A possible scenario of exocyst evolution in the context of land plant evolution and the history of genome duplications</bold>.

Our list, however, may not be complete especially in case of the <italic>Solanum</italic> sp. sequences, where genomic annotation is still under development, and some loci may have been missed. It is not surprising that our inventory yielded novel genes especially in the Exo70 family in addition to those reported previously for <italic>P. trichocarpa</italic> and <italic>O. sativa</italic> (Chong et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2010</xref>). On the other hand, in the absence of gene expression data and experimental observations, distinction between functional genes and pseudogenes may be somewhat blurry, especially in case of the extensive Exo70 family, containing numerous single-exon members that apparently underwent reverse transcription at some point in the course of their evolution (Synek et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2006</xref>). Thus, the determined numbers of subunits might still somewhat change in the future, even in well-characterized models (see the possible undocumented duplication of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Sec10 locus). Also allelic diversity in heterozygous diploids may have resulted in identification of extraneous loci in particular in the case of <italic>S. moellendorffii</italic>, where most genes appear to have two closely related paralogs, albeit this species is believed to be one of the few plants without a recent history of whole-genome duplications (Jiao et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2011</xref>).</p><p>We have found that a subgroup of exocyst subunits, corresponding to the previously proposed core of the complex (Munson and Novick, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2006</xref>; Croteau et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2009</xref>), underwent little or no amplification in the vascular plants, though even these subunits have amplified to a some extent in non-seed plants. These low copy subunits, in particular Sec6, Sec8, and Sec10, but to a somewhat lesser extent also Sec5 and Sec3, exhibit evolutionary trees that are not only topologically similar but also obviously correlated in terms of branch length, which is consistent with co-evolution driven by the requirement of maintaining mutual compatibility of closely interacting complex subunits (Juan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2008</xref>; Lovell and Robertson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2010</xref>). The remaining subunits Sec15, Exo84, and in particular Exo70, exhibit greater diversity consistent with their function on the periphery of the complex, providing an interface to a variety of interactors that may be specific to particular lineages or even to particular paralogs.</p><p>Whole-genome duplications have played an important part in the evolution of land plants (Van de Peer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">2009</xref>; Jiao et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2011</xref>). They also provided an obvious source of &#8220;raw materials&#8221; for evolution of divergent paralog families of the exocyst subunits. We were able to pinpoint several of the proposed ancient genome duplication or polyploidization events in a widely accepted scenario of land plant evolution (Soltis et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2008</xref>; Van de Peer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">2009</xref>; Jiao et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2011</xref>; Woodhouse et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">2011</xref>) as possible sources of distinct exocyst subunit clades especially in the Sec15 and Exo84 families (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). However, it has to be stressed that not every gene duplication coincident with a genome duplication must be a result of that duplication. For instance, the tandem duplication of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> Sec3 appears to be a local event, while equally distant <italic>A. thaliana</italic> Sec5 paralogs are obviously a product of a whole-genome duplication (see data from Woodhouse et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">2011</xref>).</p><p>The greatest part of the putative exocyst diversity is due to the extremely amplified Exo70 subunit that apparently existed in at least three paralogs already in the common ancestor of land plants including Rhyniophytes, and diversified into seven clades prior to the separation of the monocot and dicot lineages (Synek et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2006</xref>). Reverse transcription may have contributed to early amplification of some clades, which contain mostly single-exon genes, among them also the dicot clade H that has expanded into an extensive family of paralogs. No such expansion, however, took place in the monocots, which have only a few H-type Exo70s. Instead, a branch of the multi-exon F family has amplified and diversified substantially, producing the monocot-specific FX clade.</p><p>While there is considerable sequence divergence among the Exo70 paralogs, we found no evidence of positive selection operating across their conserved part. An obvious source of functional diversity, however, would be the variable sequences at both ends of the Exo70 subunits. A possible participation of C-terminal motifs in differential binding to membrane phosphoinositides has been already proposed (&#381;&#225;rsk&#253;&#253; et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">2009</xref>). Here we have uncovered two obviously ancestral N-terminal motifs that document that the N-terminal segments, though highly diversified, have evolved from a common ancestor at least in most of the sequences, without contribution of major domain-shuffling events. Nevertheless, they have possibly built up enough diversity to mediate interactions with a variety of cellular components, ensuring thus the apparently required functional diversification.</p><p>Assuming that the alternative paralogs of exocyst subunits are co-expressed, and that they can freely combine into complexes (which is by no means guaranteed), literally hundreds of distinct exocysts may exist within plant cells. Were the subunit combinations unrestricted (i.e., each Sec15 paralog working with each Exo84 and each Exo70), <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> would be capable of producing 552 distinct exocyst variants, and rice stunning 1128 variants. Alternative splicing may provide an additional source of exocyst diversity. Even in metazoans, an array of Exo70 splicing variants was uncovered, dependent on cell type and age of the tissue (Dellago et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2011</xref>). It is therefore possible that also in animals hidden multiplicity of exocysts may exist depending on the splice-isoforms of Exo70 (and possibly also other subunits). On the other hand, the actual numbers of plant exocyst varieties are undoubtedly much lower than the numbers of possible subunit combinations, since not all paralogs are co-expressed, and some may be expressed only under special circumstances or not at all. Nevertheless, we cannot avoid asking what is the biological relevance (or selective advantage) of such a profusion of exocyst varieties.</p><p>One possible reason may be the need to maintain and manage a variety of qualitatively distinct membranes &#8211; not only of intracellular compartments, but also within the cell cortex whose lateral mobility is restricted by the cell wall. Distinct exocyst variants in the same cell, defined especially by different &#8220;landmarking&#8221; Exo70 subunits, may participate in delimiting specific plasmalemma domains (&#8220;activated cortical domains&#8221;) engaging in distinctly regulated membrane turnover. Together with the underlying cytoplasm (in particular the connected recycling endosomes defined by distinct Rab11 paralogs), the activated cortical domains form larger functional units (recycling domains) that may play a central part in the control of different cortical or endomembrane domains of the many-sided plant cells (see detailed discussion in &#381;&#225;rsk&#253;&#253; et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">2009</xref>; &#381;&#225;rsk&#253;&#253; and Potock&#253;, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">2010</xref>). Another possibility is functional separation of the diverse complexes in time and/or in tissue or organ space through controlled gene expression of subunit variants optimized for a particular set of circumstances (e.g., specific cell differentiation stages, tissues, or environmental conditions). Participation of Exo84B in the establishment of mycorrhiza (Genre et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2012</xref>) and, in particular, of distinct Exo70 variants in pathogen response (Pe&#269;enkov&#225; et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2011</xref>) shows that this indeed appears to be the case. Remarkably, one of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Exo70 paralogs involved in pathogen response is member of the H clade, expanded specifically in the dicots, and it is thus tempting to speculate about a possible analogous role of the even more diversified monocot FX clade.</p><p>In summary, both our data and recent experimental observations show that plants do not have &#8220;an exocyst complex,&#8221; but an enormous variety of diverse exocyst complexes, and that this feature is at least as old as the land plants. Unraveling its functional significance will continue to provide interesting challenges for the plant cell biology of the near future.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s2"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p>The Supplementary Material for this article can be found online at <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Traffic_and_Transport/abstract/31437">http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Traffic_and_Transport/abstract/31437</uri></p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><label>Cvrckova_S1.xls</label><caption><p>List of the 392 exocyst subunit sequences analyzed, including database accession numbers, phylogenetic classification and domain composition (Microsoft Excel file).</p></caption><media xlink:href="31437_Cvrckova_DataSheet1.XLS" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM2"><label>Cvrckova_S2.zip</label><caption><p>Protein sequences and alignments used for phylogenetic analyses (compressed Zip file containing protein sequences in text format &#8211; *.txt and alignment sequences in FASTA format &#8211; *.fst).</p></caption><media xlink:href="31437_Cvrckova_DataSheet2.ZIP" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="x-zip-compressed"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work has been supported by the European Community 7th Framework Programme (FP7/2007&#8211;2013) Grant No. 238640 PLANTORIGINS, the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic (P305/11/1629), the Ministry of Education of the Czech Republic (MSM 0021620858), and the Charles University in Prague (SVV 265203/2012).</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup><uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://string-db.org/">http://string-db.org/</uri></p></fn><fn id="fn2"><p><sup>2</sup><uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.phytozome.net/">http://www.phytozome.net/</uri></p></fn><fn id="fn3"><p><sup>3</sup><uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/">http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/</uri></p></fn><fn id="fn4"><p><sup>4</sup><uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://solgenomics.net/">http://solgenomics.net/</uri></p></fn><fn id="fn5"><p><sup>5</sup><uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://potatogenomics.plantbiology.msu.edu/">http://potatogenomics.plantbiology.msu.edu/</uri></p></fn><fn id="fn6"><p><sup>6</sup><uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.arabidopsis.org">http://www.arabidopsis.org</uri></p></fn><fn id="fn7"><p><sup>7</sup><uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.cosmoss.org/">http://www.cosmoss.org/</uri></p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anisimova</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Gascuel</surname><given-names>O.</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2006</year>). <article-title>Approximate likelihood ratio test for branchs: a fast, accurate and powerful alternative</article-title>. <source>Syst.
