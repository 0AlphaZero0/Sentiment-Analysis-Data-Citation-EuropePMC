</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Rho family GTPases are molecular switches that cycle between inactive, GDP-bound and active, GTP-bound states [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>RhoGEFs catalyze the exchange of bound GDP for GTP on Rho GTPases rendering them biologically active to signal to downstream effectors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The largest family of RhoGEFs in humans, with 68 human members, is the Dbl family of proteins [2], [3], which is characterized by a tandem catalytic Dbl homology (DH) and regulatory pleckstrin homology (PH) domain cassette responsible for accelerating the intrinsic nucleotide exchange activity of one or more members of the Rho family small GTPases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Together with DOCK family RhoGEFs, there are over 80 RhoGEFs that can act on 12 out of 20 Rho GTPases (8 Rho GTPases are predicted or verified to be constitutively activated and regulated by RhoGEF-independent mechanisms) [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This apparent signaling redundancy is perhaps most striking for activators of RhoA, where at least 24 RhoGEFs have been documented for this single Rho GTPase [2], [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Beyond the DH-PH cassette, Dbl family proteins are highly divergent and possess other interaction motifs or catalytic domains that account for the distinct mechanisms by which the activity of Dbl family RhoGEFs is regulated [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>For example, the Dbl family RhoGEF, GEF-H1 is sequestered by microtubules through the C-terminal region of GEF-H1 and its release off the microtubular lattice promotes the spatial activation of RhoA and changes in the actin cytoskeleton essential for cellular migration [5]–[7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Another Dbl family RhoGEF, Ect2 is sequestered in the nucleus during interphase and is released during mitosis to bind the centralspindlin complex to promote spatio-temporal activation of RhoA and formation of the actin-rich contractile ring that is essential for cytokinesis [8]–[10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Thus, each RhoGEF can integrate distinct stimulus-dependent, spatio-temporally restricted Rho GTPase activation which leads to a rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton essential for a variety of cellular processes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In this report, we show that the RhoGEF, TEM4/ARHGEF17 [11], displays a subcellular localization unique amongst RhoGEF family members as it was associated with actin stress fibers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>We found that TEM4 binds actin directly through a novel actin binding domain (ABD) within the N-terminus, and the TEM4 ABD is essential for TEM4 localization to the actin cytoskeleton and the in vivo activity. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>TEM4 possesses an actin binding domain (ABD) within the N-terminus (residues 81–135) that binds F-actin with high affinity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Our extensive analysis of the ABD using primary sequence analysis and secondary structure prediction algorithms failed to identify similarity to any known ABDs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>A novel actin binding domain was previously reported in two other RhoGEFs, PDZ-RhoGEF and frabin [37], [38] and L/IIxxFE motif within these proteins was essential for binding to F-actin [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, despite the lack of the overall sequence homology, TEM4 contains an LSxxFD motif within the N-terminus of the ABD; however, our studies suggest that the C-terminal residues are the most critical for TEM4 binding to F-actin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Regardless of the lack of primary sequence homology between the TEM4 ABD and known actin binding proteins, secondary structure prediction analysis suggests the presence of several helices (Fig. 3B) as common amongst ABDs [29]–[31], [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Finally, the ABD-containing region is absent from the two closely-related TEM4 family members, ARHGEF10 and ARHGEF10L/GrinchGEF [41], [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we demonstrate that TEM4 contains a novel ABD and future studies are needed to characterize how TEM4 may affect actin filament dynamics. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Exogenous, GFP- or HA-tagged TEM4 readily decorated the entire length of actin stress fibers in HUVECs and endogenous TEM4 immunoprecipitates with F-actin. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Both of these scenarios would result in pools of active TEM4 localized in the areas undergoing actin polymerization where activation of Rho GTPases would be the most desirable to promote further cytoskeleton rearrangements. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Rho family GTPases are key regulators of actin cytoskeleton dynamics and proteins of Rho subfamily (RhoA, B, C) promote the formation of actin stress fibers [47]–[49] that are essential for a diversity of cellular processes, including cell shape, polarity, migration, cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions [47], [50], [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>We have observed increased Rho GTPase activation and actin rearrangement in cells expressing WT and not the actin binding-deficient, R130D mutant of TEM4 (Fig. 6). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Future studies will determine if TEM4 promotes spatial activation of distinct effector pathways downstream of Rho GTPases and the mechanism of the preferential engagement of these pathways. </plain></SENT>
