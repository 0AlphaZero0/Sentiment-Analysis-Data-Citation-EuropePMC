</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cellulose, one of the most abundant renewable biopolymer, is a linear insoluble polysaccharide of β-D-glucose (~100 to 20,000 residues) joined by β-1,4-glucosidic bond. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As a major component of plant cell wall, cellulose degradation provides several benefits considered from environmental and bio-energy issues [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Decomposition of plant litter is also an important process to release nutrients into the soil [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In nature, cellulose can be hydrolysed by enzymatic means, the enzymes mainly being derived from a wide range of microbes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Cellulase enzymes are generally composed of a multienzyme system [4] including cellobiohydrolase (CBH, E.C. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>3.2.1.91), endo-1,4-β-glucanase (EG, E.C. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>3.2.1.4), and β-glucosidase (BGL, E.C. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>3.2.1.21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The CBH and EG enzymes function cooperatively and synergistically, and depolymerise cellulose to cellobiose and oligosaccharides. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The BGL enzyme then converts these small molecules to glucose [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The CBH enzymes are known as the key component of cellulase system that display an exo-type of digesting biopolymers, and the major product of their action on cellulose is cellobiose [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Based on amino acid sequence similarity, the CBH enzymes can be grouped into glycoside hydrolase families: GH6, GH7, and GH48 [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Of these, only the GH7 type is thought to be exclusively of fungal origin and this family includes the CBHI and EGI enzymes from both ascomycetes and basidiomycetes [8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Several fungi can utilize cellulose as an energy source by secreting a complex of cellulase enzymes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>These enzymes are of great interest considered from the viewpoint of industrial and environmental application [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The fungal CBH in particular is of great interest as potent cellulolytic fungi are capable of producing two different forms of the CBH enzymes: CBHI and CBHII [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>It should be noted however that the CBHI is the principal component of the cellulase enzymes as reported in Trichoderma reesei [9] and in Volvariella volvacea [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Considered a key role of fungi in degrading plant biomass in ecosystems, a programme was initiated to investigate the nature of the cellulolytic system with an emphasis on the CBHI of some basidiomycetes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we report the presence of a gene encoding the cellobiohydrolase enzyme from Auricularia fuscosuccinea, Pleurotus giganteus, P. eryngii, P. ostreatus, and P. sajor-caju. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Class I cellobiohydrolases (also known as CBHI or family 7 glycosyl hydrolases) are the principal enzymes of the cellulase complexes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>In this work, we aimed to extend previous knowledge which has described the presence of the cbhI gene in mushrooms [10, 15-17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Initially, the genomic DNA samples were extracted from the mushroom mycelia (Fig. 1) and thus used as template for PCR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>It was found that a partial sequence of the cbhI genes (~750 bp) were amplified successfully using the IB and IC primers (Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>These amplified DNA fragments were then subcloned into the plasmid pGEM-T. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>It was confirmed, by a PCR method, that the cbhI gene was successfully cloned (data not shown) and these amplicons were subjected to nucleotide sequencing. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Each DNA sequence obtained was subsequently submitted as a query in a BLASTN search of the GenBank database. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>This homology search was performed resulting that all DNA sequences were closely related to those of the cbhI gene family of either P. ostreatus or F. velutipes (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The similarity of these mushroom cbhI genes was determined using the Clustal W software. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Based on this analysis, their similarity was very high ranging from 71 to 99% (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>The translation of these cbhI genes (excluding introns) into the CBHI proteins was also performed using the Translate tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://web.expasy.org/translate/">http://web.expasy.org/translate/</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>The analysis revealed five putative amino acid sequences similar to the cellobiosidase of P. ostreatus sp. 'Florida' and the cellobiohydrolase of Phanerochaete chrysosporium (see Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>It is evident that these mushroom CBHI proteins showed high homology with the enzymes belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 7 [8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>There are several studies on fungal cellulolytic systems but these are limited to a few key species such as Trichoderma reseei and P. chrysosporium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>The cellulase activity has also been reported in some mushrooms including Agaricus bisporus [18], Lentinula edodes [15], and V. volvacea [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Our data provide additional information on the presence of the cbhI genes in several mushrooms including the recently recollected species P. giganteus [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>It should be also noted that there were several forms of the cbhI genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>For example, the cbhI gene of P. ostreatus MG03 (in this study) was distinct although it showed high homology to the cbhI-II of P. ostreatus sp. 'Florida' (96.9%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>This finding is in agreement with previous work in which multiple forms of the cbhI gene have been reported [20, 21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>This is possibly due to a combination of alleic variation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>However, the existence of different forms of the cbhI gene may be advantageous considered from their ability in protein expression when exposed to different environmental conditions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>In summary, we successfully cloned the genes encoding the CBHI proteins from five mushrooms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>This present work was undertaken with an expectation that future research will be explored including the expression of the cbhI gene as well as the factors affecting the CBHI activity. </plain></SENT>
