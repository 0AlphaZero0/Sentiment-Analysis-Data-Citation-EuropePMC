Before September 18<sup>th</sup> the number of CHIK fever cases remained relatively low in the Xincun community; from September 19<sup>th</sup> onwards, the number of cases increased drastically, with an outbreak peak on October 4<sup>th</sup>. Cases were distributed across nine small village groups in the Xincun community, with an attack rate of 0&#8211;12% at the village level. The household attack rates ranged between 20% and 100%. No significant difference was found in the attack rate between males and females. There was a significant difference in the attack rate in different age groups (chi-square&#8202;=&#8202;18.35, p&#8202;=&#8202;0.005); highest in patients aged 60 years or older and the lowest in patients aged under 10. The major clinical characteristics of patients are fever (100%), joint pain (79%) and rash (54%). Phylogenetic analysis of the E1 gene on the five earliest confirmed cases showed that the strains of CHIKV isolated from their sera were highly homologous (up to 99%) with isogeneic strains isolated in Thailand in 2009. After control measures were taken, including killing adult mosquitoes and cleaning breeding habitats of <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, the Breteau index and Mosq-ovitrap index decreased rapidly, and the outbreak ended on October 29.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion/Significance</title><p>The infection source of the outbreak was imported.

First isolated in Tanzania in 1952 <xref rid="pone.0042830-Vazeille1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, CHIKV is most commonly transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito. Recently, CHIK fever has become extensively prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions such as Asia, Africa, and Indian Ocean islands, and is an increasingly serious public health problem <xref rid="pone.0042830-Powers1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Dongguan City, between East longitude 113&#176;31&#8242; to 114&#176;15&#8242; and North latitude 22&#176;39&#8242; to 23&#176;09&#8242;, is located in the central south of Guangdong province on the east coast of the Pearl River Estuary, with a modest subtropical monsoon climate and an annual average temperature of 23.6 degree Celsius. The land area of Dongguan is 2,465 square kilometers, and the permanent population is 8,220,237. It consists of four districts and 28 towns. In the past decade, the major mosquito-borne diseases in Dongguan City have been dengue fever and malaria. Cases of malaria are all sporadic, with <italic>Anopheles sinensis</italic> and <italic>Anopheles anthropophagus</italic> being the major transmission vectors. Dengue fever cases are most commonly sporadic imported cases, with <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> being the only transmission vector.</p><p>The first imported sporadic case of the disease in China was reported in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province, in 1987, where the virus strain was isolated from the patient's blood <xref rid="pone.0042830-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Since then, all cases of CHIK fever in China have been imported, and no local case had been reported prior to the Dongguan outbreak <xref rid="pone.0042830-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The first documented community-based outbreak of CHIK fever in China was declared in the Xincun community of Wanjiang district in Dongguan city of Guangdong province (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042830-g001">Figure 1</xref>) on October 2, 2010.</p><fig id="pone-0042830-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0042830.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Location of the epidemic site of the CHIK fever outbreak at Xincun community.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0042830.g001"/></fig><p>After the Xincun outbreak was confirmed, the Dongguan Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), together with the Guangdong Provincial CDC and China CDC, conducted an epidemiological investigation and made suggestions for controlling the epidemic situation. The results of this investigation may be helpful in better understanding the epidemiological characteristics of this emerging infectious disease, and the control measures taken in the outbreak may be used as a reference for other regions dealing with CHIK fever epidemics in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study site</title><p>The Xincun community is a rural-urban fringe area surrounded by water on three sides. The area contains several still-water rivers, with 13 closely connected, small village groups under its jurisdiction. The total area of this rural-urban fringe is about 3.5 km<sup>2</sup>, with a population of about 11,000.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Data sources</title><p>All cases were investigated by a purpose-designed epidemiological survey form.

A suspected case was defined as a possible instance of CHIK fever in any person who met all of the following conditions: 1) living in Xincun community, Wanjiang District, Dongguan; 2) experienced sudden fever (body temperature &gt;38 degrees Celsius) with at least one symptom of the disease, such as joint pain, rash or petechiae, and musculoskeletal pain since September 1, 2010; 3) did not undergo any confirmation test, or results of confirmation tests for both CHIKV nucleic acid and CHIKV IgM were found to be negative. A confirmed case was an instance of CHIK fever in any person 1) matching the above conditions, and 2) and whose blood tested positive for CHIKV nucleic acid and/or CHIKV IgM.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Detection of CHIKV nucleic acid and CHIKV IgM</title><p>All investigations, sample collections, and tests in this study were conducted after obtaining informed consent from case-patients and approval from the Science and Ethics Committee of the Dongguan Municipal CDC.</p><p>A 5 mL sample of venous blood was collected from CHIK fever case-patients. Tests for CHIKV nucleic acid and for CHIKV IgM were simultaneously conducted on serum samples collected from patients within 7 days of onset of symptoms. CHIKV IgM tests were also made on serum samples collected from cases-patients discovered during the retrospective investigation. Sera were tested for CHIKV nucleic acid by real-time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR kit (Shanghai ZJ Bio-Tech Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China (Batch no., 20101001-1; Expiry date, October 6, 2011; ABI 7500 fluorescence quantitative PCR). Analysis sensitivity was 1&#215;10<sup>3</sup> copies/mL, with CT&#8804;30 considered as positive, 30&lt;CT&lt;35 as suspicious and CT&#8805;35 as negative. The positive and negative controls of RT-PCR detection were provided by CHIKV RT-PCR kit. The negative controls were DEPC-H2O, and the positive controls contain high concentrations of target DNA (1&#215;10<sup>7</sup> copies/ml).CHIKV-specific antibodies were detected using an indirect immunofluorescence test (IIFT) (EUROIMMUN., L&#252;beck, Germany). In short, rheumatic factor was pre-adsorbed with EUROSORB reagent for the detection of IgM. The samples diluted 1&#8758;10, and 25 &#181;L were applied to the reaction fields of the BIOCHIPs, which were then incubated for 1 h. For antibody detection, anti-human IgM antibodies labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) were used. The positive and negative controls were provided by EUROIMMUN anti-CHIKV IIFT kit. The positive controls were human antibodies against CHIKV (IgM), and the negative controls were human antibodies negative against CHIKV. After the test finished, the samples were judged as negative if no reaction at 1&#8758;10 diluted samples. The samples were positive if specific fluorescence pattern could be seen at 1&#8758;10 diluted samples.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Gene sequence analysis</title><p>The five earliest confirmed cases were selected for phylogenetic analysis of the <italic>E1</italic> gene.

Delayed reporting was observed in the Xincun outbreak. The number of cases of CHIK fever increased greatly from September 19, 2010; however, it was not until September 30 that the Dongguan Municipal CDC received reports of the outbreak. The center started an investigation on October 1, and the outbreak was confirmed at 1:00 AM on October 2. The delay in reporting may have led to the subsequent spread of cases throughout the Xincun community and made the task of controlling the outbreak more difficult. This suggests that it is necessary to improve the training of primary care medical staff to increase their ability to detect and report emerging infectious diseases.</p><p>In India during the CHIK fever epidemic of December 2005 to April 2006 the attack rate was reported as high as 45% in some regions <xref rid="pone.0042830-World1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and during the epidemic on Reunion Island of France, 2005&#8211;2006, the overall attack rate was 35% <xref rid="pone.0042830-Renault1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In the Xincun outbreak, the attack rate was not as high as those two epidemics, which may be attributed to the relatively earlier discovery of the epidemic as well as the effective enforcement of control measures.</p><p>Where the epidemic occurred for the first time in other countries, no difference was found in the attack rate between the sexes and among different age groups <xref rid="pone.0042830-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However, in regions with reoccurrence of the CHIK epidemic, females and adults were usually found to have a higher attack rate <xref rid="pone.0042830-Renault1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042830-Kaur1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In the Xincun outbreak, again, no difference was found in the attack rate between the sexes. People who spent much of their time at home were probably more at risk of mosquito-borne disease, particularly during periods of mosquito activity during the day, which may explain the differences in attack rates by age and occupation in the Xincun outbreak.</p><p>None of the patients or their family members had traveled to Southeast Asia or Africa. The Xincun outbreak was considered a local outbreak of CHIK fever caused by an imported case, although the source is unclear. This conclusion is supported by the following. First, no local epidemic of CHIK fever had previously been reported in China. Second, there were articles that reported that some CHIK fever patients appeared to be asymptomatically infected but could transmit the disease <xref rid="pone.0042830-Moro1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042830-Manimunda1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Third, many people travel between Dongguan, Africa and Southeast Asia. According to data from the Exit and Entry Administration Department, 13,000 people entered Dongguan from Southeast Asia and Africa in 2009, and almost 60,000 Dongguan residents visited these regions. Fourth, gene sequence analysis and genetic relatedness of strains from Xincun with Thai CHIKV of confirmed cases also supports that the outbreak was caused by an imported case or vector.</p><p>Dongguan is an area of frequent external contacts, with high population density and material flows, and it is located in the sub-tropical zone. These are the main reasons contributing to the outbreak of CHIK fever. The surveillance on vector conducted by Dongguan Municipal CDC in the past ten years showed that <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> has being the only <italic>Aedes</italic> in Dongguan city. So, it was concluded that <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> was a probable vector causing the outbreak. After control measures were taken, the density of <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> decreased quickly, while temperatures in the region maintained at 24&#8211;30 degree Celsius suggesting that control measures, and not a temperature drop, were responsible for effectively decreasing the density of <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> and controlling the epidemic.</p><p>No criteria for defining the end of a CHIK fever epidemic outbreak could be found in the literature. In the report of 2 cases of locally transmitted CHIK fever that occurred in southeastern France, Grandadam M uses the observation of no occurrence of any new case 45 days after the onset of the last case as the criterion for determining epidemic termination <xref rid="pone.0042830-Grandadam1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In this study, the following criteria were used to determine the endpoint of this particular epidemic outbreak: no new cases 19 days since the onset of the last case and the local BI and MOI remaining below 5 for over 2 consecutive weeks <xref rid="pone.0042830-Xianzhao1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Vertical transmission of CHIKV in infected <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes could lead to rapidly increased numbers of mosquito vectors carrying the virus and is the main reason for the rapid spread of the epidemic. In addition, mosquito eggs are very hardy in the external environment and can even survive through the winter <xref rid="pone.0042830-Pialoux1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. This might be a reason why CHIKV becomes endemic to many regions after the first outbreak. It will be worth observing whether CHIK fever becomes endemic to Dongguan.</p><p>It was reported that after 7&#8211;8 years of absence, re-emergence of a CHIK outbreak could occur unpredictably: for example, Africa in 1999 and 2000 in the Congo <xref rid="pone.0042830-MuyembeTamfum1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and Asia in 2001 in Java <xref rid="pone.0042830-Laras1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Therefore, it is very important to reinforce surveillance of CHIK in order to detect any epidemic early and take timely control measures.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the staff from the Anti-Epidemic Department, Clinical Laboratory, and Insecticide Department who are affiliated with the Dongguan Municipal CDC.
