<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found in the attack rate between males and females. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in the attack rate in different age groups (chi-square = 18.35, p = 0.005); highest in patients aged 60 years or older and the lowest in patients aged under 10. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The major clinical characteristics of patients are fever (100%), joint pain (79%) and rash (54%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic analysis of the E1 gene on the five earliest confirmed cases showed that the strains of CHIKV isolated from their sera were highly homologous (up to 99%) with isogeneic strains isolated in Thailand in 2009. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>After control measures were taken, including killing adult mosquitoes and cleaning breeding habitats of Aedes mosquitoes, the Breteau index and Mosq-ovitrap index decreased rapidly, and the outbreak ended on October 29. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>CHIK fever is a viral disease mainly characterized by fever, rash, and severe joint pain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>First isolated in Tanzania in 1952 [1], CHIKV is most commonly transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Recently, CHIK fever has become extensively prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions such as Asia, Africa, and Indian Ocean islands, and is an increasingly serious public health problem [2]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Dongguan City, between East longitude 113°31′ to 114°15′ and North latitude 22°39′ to 23°09′, is located in the central south of Guangdong province on the east coast of the Pearl River Estuary, with a modest subtropical monsoon climate and an annual average temperature of 23.6 degree Celsius. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In the past decade, the major mosquito-borne diseases in Dongguan City have been dengue fever and malaria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Cases of malaria are all sporadic, with Anopheles sinensis and Anopheles anthropophagus being the major transmission vectors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Dengue fever cases are most commonly sporadic imported cases, with Aedes albopictus being the only transmission vector. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The first imported sporadic case of the disease in China was reported in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province, in 1987, where the virus strain was isolated from the patient's blood [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Since then, all cases of CHIK fever in China have been imported, and no local case had been reported prior to the Dongguan outbreak [4]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>No cases of CHIK fever had been reported in Dongguan before the Xincun outbreak, and only sporadic imported cases have been reported in Yunnan Province and the city of Guangzhou [3], [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>Delayed reporting was observed in the Xincun outbreak. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>The number of cases of CHIK fever increased greatly from September 19, 2010; however, it was not until September 30 that the Dongguan Municipal CDC received reports of the outbreak. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>The center started an investigation on October 1, and the outbreak was confirmed at 1:00 AM on October 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>The delay in reporting may have led to the subsequent spread of cases throughout the Xincun community and made the task of controlling the outbreak more difficult. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>This suggests that it is necessary to improve the training of primary care medical staff to increase their ability to detect and report emerging infectious diseases. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>In India during the CHIK fever epidemic of December 2005 to April 2006 the attack rate was reported as high as 45% in some regions [9] and during the epidemic on Reunion Island of France, 2005–2006, the overall attack rate was 35% [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>In the Xincun outbreak, the attack rate was not as high as those two epidemics, which may be attributed to the relatively earlier discovery of the epidemic as well as the effective enforcement of control measures. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Where the epidemic occurred for the first time in other countries, no difference was found in the attack rate between the sexes and among different age groups [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>However, in regions with reoccurrence of the CHIK epidemic, females and adults were usually found to have a higher attack rate [10], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>In the Xincun outbreak, again, no difference was found in the attack rate between the sexes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>People who spent much of their time at home were probably more at risk of mosquito-borne disease, particularly during periods of mosquito activity during the day, which may explain the differences in attack rates by age and occupation in the Xincun outbreak. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>None of the patients or their family members had traveled to Southeast Asia or Africa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>The Xincun outbreak was considered a local outbreak of CHIK fever caused by an imported case, although the source is unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>This conclusion is supported by the following. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>First, no local epidemic of CHIK fever had previously been reported in China. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Second, there were articles that reported that some CHIK fever patients appeared to be asymptomatically infected but could transmit the disease [13], [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Third, many people travel between Dongguan, Africa and Southeast Asia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>According to data from the Exit and Entry Administration Department, 13,000 people entered Dongguan from Southeast Asia and Africa in 2009, and almost 60,000 Dongguan residents visited these regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Fourth, gene sequence analysis and genetic relatedness of strains from Xincun with Thai CHIKV of confirmed cases also supports that the outbreak was caused by an imported case or vector. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Dongguan is an area of frequent external contacts, with high population density and material flows, and it is located in the sub-tropical zone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>These are the main reasons contributing to the outbreak of CHIK fever. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>The surveillance on vector conducted by Dongguan Municipal CDC in the past ten years showed that Aedes albopictus has being the only Aedes in Dongguan city. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>So, it was concluded that Aedes albopictus was a probable vector causing the outbreak. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>After control measures were taken, the density of Aedes albopictus decreased quickly, while temperatures in the region maintained at 24–30 degree Celsius suggesting that control measures, and not a temperature drop, were responsible for effectively decreasing the density of Aedes albopictus and controlling the epidemic. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>No criteria for defining the end of a CHIK fever epidemic outbreak could be found in the literature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>In the report of 2 cases of locally transmitted CHIK fever that occurred in southeastern France, Grandadam M uses the observation of no occurrence of any new case 45 days after the onset of the last case as the criterion for determining epidemic termination [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>In this study, the following criteria were used to determine the endpoint of this particular epidemic outbreak: no new cases 19 days since the onset of the last case and the local BI and MOI remaining below 5 for over 2 consecutive weeks [16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Vertical transmission of CHIKV in infected Aedes mosquitoes could lead to rapidly increased numbers of mosquito vectors carrying the virus and is the main reason for the rapid spread of the epidemic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>In addition, mosquito eggs are very hardy in the external environment and can even survive through the winter [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>This might be a reason why CHIKV becomes endemic to many regions after the first outbreak. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>It will be worth observing whether CHIK fever becomes endemic to Dongguan. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>It was reported that after 7–8 years of absence, re-emergence of a CHIK outbreak could occur unpredictably: for example, Africa in 1999 and 2000 in the Congo [18] and Asia in 2001 in Java [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is very important to reinforce surveillance of CHIK in order to detect any epidemic early and take timely control measures. </plain></SENT>
