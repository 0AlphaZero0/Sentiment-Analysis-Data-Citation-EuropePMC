We investigated the genetic mechanism that controls mtDNA levels using genome-wide linkage analyses in families from the Genetic Analysis of Idiopathic Thrombophilia Project (GAIT). We measure mtDNA levels by quantitative real-time PCR in 386 subjects from 21 extended Spanish families. A variance component linkage method using 485 microsatellites was conducted to evaluate linkage and to detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) involved in the control of mtDNA levels. The heritalibility of mtDNA levels was 0.33 (p&#8202;=&#8202;1.82e-05). We identified a QTL on Chromosome 2 (LOD&#8202;=&#8202;2.21) using all of the subjects, independently on their sex. When females and males were analysed separately, three QTLs were identified. Females showed the same QTL on Chromosome 2 (LOD&#8202;=&#8202;3.09), indicating that the QTL identified in the analysis using all of the subjects was a strong female QTL, and another one on Chromosome 3 (LOD&#8202;=&#8202;2.67), whereas in males a QTL was identified on Chromosome 1 (LOD&#8202;=&#8202;2.81). These QTLs were fine-mapped to find associations with mtDNA levels. The most significant SNP association was for the rs10888838 on Chromosome 1 in males. This SNP mapped to the gene <italic>MRPL37</italic>, involved in mitochondrial protein translation. The rs2140855 on Chromosome 2 showed association in the analysis using all of the subjects. It was near the gene <italic>CMPK2</italic>, which encodes a mitochondrial enzyme of the salvage pathway of deoxyribonucleotide synthesis. Our results provide evidence of a sex-specific genetic mechanism for the control of mtDNA levels and provide a framework to identify new genes that influence mtDNA levels.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the &#8216;Instituto de Salud Carlos III-Fondo de Investigaci&#243;n Sanitaria&#8217; [PI-11/00184, PI-08/0420, PI-08/0756, RECAVA-RD06/0014]; the &#8216;Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci&#243;n&#8217; [SAF2008/01859]; and the &#8216;Ag&#232;ncia de Gesti&#243; d'ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca&#8217; [SGR 2009-1240].

It is inherited exclusively through the maternal line. Human mtDNA consist of one circular double-stranded DNA molecule of 16569 bp, which presents different characteristics compared with the nuclear genome. It is about 0.5&#8211;1% of the total DNA human cell content. A variable number of mtDNA molecules are located within the mitochondrial matrix, attached to the inner mitochondrial membrane near the oxidative phosphorilation (OXPHOS) system. The mitochondrial genome encodes few, but essential proteins of the OXPHOS system (13 polypeptides, 22 tRNA and 2 rRNA). Then, any defect of mtDNA can lead finally to mitochondrial dysfunction and energetic cell impairment. Thus, mitochondria play a pivotal role in cell life and death in almost all eukaryotic cells, as they are vital organelles involved in cellular energy production and apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0042711-Kushnareva1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. However, most of the mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the nuclear DNA and synthesized into the cytoplasm, from which they are imported to mitochondria. Consequently, the mitochondrial biogenesis depends on the coordinated expression of both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes.</p><p>Mitochondria are considered the major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mtDNA is one of the main targets of oxidative stress. During the last years, a large number of clinical disorders have been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction where oxidative stress was the main pathophysiologic underlying mechanism. In addition, sequence variation in mtDNA contributes to the risk of disease and it has been associated with serious human disorders <xref rid="pone.0042711-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042711-Czarnecka1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042711-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Also, sequence variation of the mtDNA may be linked to functional differences and thereby lead to different oxidative phenotypes <xref rid="pone.0042711-MorenoLoshuertos1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Interestingly, the variation of appropriate mtDNA levels has been linked also to a variety of common disorders <xref rid="pone.0042711-Song1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042711-Weng1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042711-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In addition, it has been reported that altered mtDNA levels correlates with malignancy <xref rid="pone.0042711-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042711-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042711-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and even with prognosis <xref rid="pone.0042711-Yamada1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042711-Yu2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Moreover, there are several reports that attempt to establish mtDNA quantity as an oxidative stress biomarker to predict the risk for cancer <xref rid="pone.0042711-Hosgood1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042711-Lan1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>Some of the mitochondria-associated disorders include obesity, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, sepsis, ischemia/reperfusion injury as well as the physiologic process of ageing <xref rid="pone.0042711-Burhans1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042711-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042711-Wallace1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In addition, there is also increasing evidence supporting that oxidative stress plays a key role in the development of cardiovascular diseases and atherosclerosis <xref rid="pone.0042711-Madamanchi1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042711-Bonomini1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042711-Gutierrez1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. As a consequence, there is a growing interest in describing the mechanisms that regulate the mitochondrial biogenesis. Particularly, much effort is being put towards increasing our knowledge about the maintenance of the mitochondrial genome, since both the integrity and quantity of mtDNA are critical for maintaining mitochondrial respiratory capacity to reach the ATP levels necessary for cell viability.</p><p>Despite the identification of a number of nuclear DNA-encoded trans-acting factors that regulate mitochondrial biogenesis, the exact biological mechanisms responsible for the control of mtDNA levels are unknown. The aim of our study was to identify genes that influence the variation of mtDNA levels and to determine if sex modulates the genetic mechanism that controls these levels. For this purpose, we conducted genome-wide linkage analyses in families from the Genetic Analysis of Idiopathic Thrombophilia Project (GAIT). In addition, we fine-maped the genetic determinants detected by the linkage analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects</title><p>Our study included 386 subjects belonging to 21 Spanish families from the GAIT Project.

Thrombophilia was defined as recurrent thrombotic episodes (at least one of which was spontaneous) a single spontaneous thrombotic event with a first-degree relative also affected, or early-onset thrombosis (&#8804;45 years). The proband's thrombophilia was considered idiopathic when all known biological causes of thrombophilia (i.e. Protein S and Protein C deficiencies, antithrombin deficiency, activated protein C resistance, plasminogen deficiency) at the time of recruitment were excluded.

One significant linkage signal was detected on Chromosome 2 (LOD score&#8202;=&#8202;3.09; p&#8202;=&#8202;8.11e-05), at the same genomic region (2p25.3-2p25.1) that the signal previously detected in the analysis with the subjects of both sexes. This signal defined a QTL for mtDNA levels that comprises a region between 3137230 bp and 8605209 bp on Chromosome 2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0042711-t002">Table 2</xref>). Another linkage region was detected in females on the short arm of Chromosome 3 (3p) with a LOD score of 2.67 (p&#8202;=&#8202;2.27e-04) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042711-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

Interestingly, the results from the linkage analysis performed in males only differed from those obtained in females.

A perfectly orchestrated interaction between both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes is essential for mitochondrial biogenesis. In particular, the coordinated expression of many proteins in an extremely complex scenario is required for mtDNA maintenance. Nevertheless, we are still far from identifying all of the factors involved in this process as well as the mechanisms involved in the control of mtDNA levels <xref rid="pone.0042711-Moraes1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. The identification of an increasing number of human diseases associated with altered levels of mtDNA has stimulated investigations of the mechanisms and factors involved in the regulation of this trait. In addition, mtDNA levels vary among subjects of different ages and among different tissues within the same individual. These levels are largely influenced by genetic factors, with a heritability (h<sup>2</sup>) ranging between 33% and 65% in different studies <xref rid="pone.0042711-Xing1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042711-Curran1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Curran et al. <xref rid="pone.0042711-Curran1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> reported a QTL for mtDNA levels on Chromosome 10 (LOD&#8202;=&#8202;3.83) in 1,259 Mexican American subjects from 42 extended families of the Sant Antonio Family Heart Study (SAFHS). They suggested the <italic>mitochondrial transcription factor A</italic> (<italic>TFAM</italic>) and the <italic>translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane 23</italic> (<italic>TIMM23</italic>) as candidate genes involved in mitochondrial processing for the control of mtDNA levels. In agreement with theses studies, we estimated the h<sup>2</sup> of mtDNA levels in the Spanish population in 33%. This indicates a substantial genetic component in regulating mtDNA levels and guarantees success in the search for genes that influence this quantitative trait.</p><p>The present study aimed to conduct sex-specific genome-wide linkage analyses in a mtDNA-related trait. Accordingly, in our initial linkage scan carried using all of the subjects we found a suggestive linkage signal on Chromosome 2 (LOD&#8202;=&#8202;2.21; p&#8202;=&#8202;7.09e-04). Unlike Curran et al., we did not detect a linkage signal on Chromosome 10. However, when we performed further linkage analyses with subjects according to their sex, we found a strong significant QTL on Chromosome 2 (LOD&#8202;=&#8202;3.09; p&#8202;=&#8202;8.11e-05) and a suggestive QTL on Chromosome 3 (LOD&#8202;=&#8202;2.67; p&#8202;=&#8202;2.27e-04) only in females. Notably, the significant linkage signal from females on Chromosome 2 was at the same region as was the suggestive linkage signal previously detected in the analysis performed using all of the subjects. Interestingly, this genomic region on Chromosome 2 showed no linkage in the analysis performed with males. This demonstrates that the linkage signal detected in the first analysis was the result of the great influence that genes exert over mtDNA levels only in females. In addition, the linkage analysis performed with males only showed a suggestive QTL on Chromosome 1 (LOD&#8202;=&#8202;2.81; p&#8202;=&#8202;1.57e-04). Fine-mapping of these linkage regions revealed significant SNP associations with mtDNA levels. The most significant association was found for the rs10888838 in the linkage region on Chromosome 1 observed in males. This SNP mapped in the <italic>MRPL37</italic> gene, which encodes a component of the mitoribosome involved in the synthesis of key proteins of the OXPHOS system. We noted that this gene was detected exclusively in males through two distinct statistical approaches, such as linkage and association. This combined genetic convergence supports our sex-specific family-based studies to find genes that may differently control quantitative traits of complex diseases according to sex. In addition, these results reinforce the hypothesis that <italic>MRLP37</italic> may contribute to the variation of mtDNA levels only in males. In this sense, functional variants in <italic>MRLP37</italic> having an effect on mtDNA levels needs to be confirmed. The identification of these polymorphisms would be clinically relevant, since it has been reported that a defect in any component of the mitochondrial protein-synthesis machinery might compromise normal mitochondrial function and contribute to disease <xref rid="pone.0042711-Jacobs1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. On the other hand, fine-mapping of the female-specific linkage region on Chromosome 2 showed a significant association of the rs2140855 with mtDNA levels. However, this SNP association reached significance only in the analysis using all of the subjects. The rs2140855 is intergenic and located &#8764;170 Kbp downstream of the gene <italic>RNF144</italic> and &#8764;380 Kbp downstream of the gene <italic>CMPK2. RNF144</italic> encodes an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, involved in proteolysis and little information exists with regard this gene and its involvement in disease. However, <italic>CMPK2</italic> deserves special attention, since it is directly related with the mtDNA biology. <italic>CMPK2</italic> encodes a novel mitochondrial kinase that participates in the salvage pathway of deoxyribonucleotide synthesis into the organelle <xref rid="pone.0042711-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. <italic>CMPK2</italic> also may be involved in the activation of several pyrimidine nucleoside analogs that are widely used as antiviral and anticancer agents, and can cause mtDNA depletion after long term therapy <xref rid="pone.0042711-Dalakas1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. In addition, mutations in other enzymes of the salvage pathway that are involved in the maintenance of balanced mitochondrial dNTP pools cause severe mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromes <xref rid="pone.0042711-Marti1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042711-Freisinger1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Unfortunately, our genotyping method did not cover the genomic region in <italic>CMPK2</italic>, so no SNP data were available. Nevertheless, the rs2056634 and rs11682769 also reached significance for the association with the phenotype. Interestingly, they were also located around <italic>RNF144</italic> and <italic>CMPK2</italic>. This suggests the existence of a genetic variant in or around this locus that influences the quantity of mtDNA. In keeping with this, 4 SNPs (rs2609101, rs2564023, rs1880800 and rs7571496) are in or around <italic>FLJ41046</italic>, at a distance of &#8764;700 Kbp upstream of the gene <italic>CMPK2</italic>. With all the above-mentioned, <italic>CMPK2</italic> emerged as a strong candidate gene in the QTL on Chromosome 2 for the control of mtDNA levels. However, we can not rule out other potential candidates genes in this region until functional studies are performed. In addition, the rs813779 and rs2305491 located around <italic>SOX11</italic> and in <italic>TSSC1</italic>, respectively, also were significant in the fine-mapping of the female-specific QTL on Chromosome 2. Notably, <italic>TSSC1</italic> is &#8764;200 Kbp upstream of the <italic>RNASEH1</italic> gene. <italic>RNASEH1</italic> is also a potential candidate gene in this region. It encodes an endonuclease that specifically degrades the RNA of RNA-DNA hybrids, and it may exert a key function during mtDNA replication <xref rid="pone.0042711-Cerritelli1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Although all these SNPs are located in the female-specific QTL, it seems that the association with the phenotype occurs when all of the subjects are considered together, but not when males and females are analyzed separately. This observation could be explained by the fact that linkage and association analyses detect different types of genetic variants. In particular, this significant linkage signal could be due to a rare variant present in a group of subjects in these extended pedigrees, whereas the same sample does not provide enough power to detect the effect of the same variant by association. Finally, in the QTL region on Chromosome 3 observed in females, three SNPs showed significant association with mtDNA levels. These polymorphisms were rs2731943 in <italic>VENTXP7</italic>, rs7635386 in <italic>SATB1</italic> and rs161196 in <italic>ZNF659</italic>. <italic>SATB1</italic> encodes a DNA-binding protein involved in transcription regulation, as well as in chromatin organization and nuclear architecture during apoptosis. <italic>VENTXP7</italic> is a non-coding protein gene that is a member of the Vent homeobox gene family. <italic>ZNF659</italic> encodes a nuclear protein involved in nuclear acid binding and zinc ion binding at the transcription level. Although the biological function of these three genes is not directly associated with mtDNA biology, this area deserves further attention given that the linkage and association signals at the same genetic region were significant. Moreover, despite <italic>ZNF659</italic> is located in a female-specific QTL, the rs161196 in this gene showed significant association with mtDNA levels only in the analysis using all of the subjects.</p><p>In support of our findings, we detected two haplotypes in the QTL regions on Chromosome 2 and Chromosome 3 in females. These haplotypes have a significant positive effect on mtDNA levels in females only (see File S1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0042711.s001">Figure S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0042711.s002">Figure S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0042711.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p><p>Our results emphasize the usefulness of linkage maps in extended pedigrees to detect sex-specific genomic regions for complex traits. This agrees with publications that suggest a strong influence of sex on the susceptibility to common complex diseases in humans <xref rid="pone.0042711-Weiss1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Accordingly, the genetic architecture differs significantly among subjects according to their sex for a large number of quantitative phenotypes <xref rid="pone.0042711-Seda1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. This is consistent with data from other studies of sex-specific heritabilities of common disease-associated quantitative phenotypes such as the case of six sex-specific obesity-related traits in the Chinese population <xref rid="pone.0042711-Chiu1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> and a set of polymorphisms that influence plasma fibrinogen concentration in a sex-specific manner <xref rid="pone.0042711-Carter1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>.</p><p>It is important to note that despite the sex-specific genetic architecture found in our study, our results show no significant differences in mtDNA levels between males and females. In fact, sex-specific regulation of mtDNA levels does not necessarily imply different quantity of mtDNA between the two sexes. However, if there were significant variations in mtDNA levels between sexes there would be the need for sex-specific mechanisms controlling mtDNA quantity. Accordingly, and in support of our findings, the study of Curran et al. revealed a significant decrease in mtDNA content in males with respect to females in the Caucasian population <xref rid="pone.0042711-Curran1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. In addition, a case-control study including patients affected by renal cell carcinoma reported lower mtDNA content in lymphocytes in males than in females in both cases and controls <xref rid="pone.0042711-Xing1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Furthermore, other mitochondrial parameters also showed differences between male and female rats for various tissues, thus supporting the existence of sex-specific mechanisms in the control of mitochondrial biogenesis <xref rid="pone.0042711-Guevara1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042711-Colom1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. This agrees with epidemiological data, that reveal less prevalence of some chronic and neurodegenerative diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage in human females (i.e. Parkinson disease). Accordingly, the mitochondrial effects of estrogens may play a role in breast cancer, cardiovascular function, and neuroprotection <xref rid="pone.0042711-GavrilovaJordan1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Moreover, there is evidence that sex hormones modulate the expression and the activity of proteins that control mitochondrial biogenesis <xref rid="pone.0042711-Mattingly1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042711-Klinge1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Thus, estrogens regulate the expression of a number of nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded genes, which are involved in the control of the OXPHOS system. Also, mitochondria are an important target for the action of estrogens <xref rid="pone.0042711-Psarra1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Accordingly, it is currently well-established that estrogens have direct and indirect effects on mitochondrial activity and biogenesis, but the mechanisms mediating these effects remain to be clarified <xref rid="pone.0042711-Simpkins1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Recently, it has been shown that estrogens ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction in cybrid cells carrying the mtDNA mutation that cause Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) and may be responsible for the high prevalence of LHON disease in males <xref rid="pone.0042711-Giordano1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Interestingly, these cybrids were able to increase mtDNA levels after treatment with 17&#946;-estradiol. Consistently with these data, the significant effect of the use of oral contraceptives on mtDNA levels in our sample could be indicative of the control of steroid hormones on mtDNA levels.</p><p>Given the growing number of common diseases that are associated with altered mtDNA levels, it has become necessary to investigate the mechanisms that control the quantity of mtDNA in humans. To our knowledge, the present work is the first genome-wide study in extended pedigrees providing data for the existence of sex-specific linkage and association in the control of mtDNA levels. Our results showed a clear sex-specific genetic architecture that may regulate the variation of mtDNA levels in subjects from the GAIT Project. In addition, we provide extensive information regarding potential candidate genes that could modulate mtDNA levels. Our findings may contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms that control mtDNA maintenance. However, these results should be confirmed and extended. Particularly, functional analyses are essential.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0042711.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>

This haplotype corresponds to the alleles 241/204/114 for these markers, respectively; and it was significantly associated with higher levels of mtDNA exclusively in female subjects.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0042711.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0042711.s003"><label>Figure S3</label><caption><p>
