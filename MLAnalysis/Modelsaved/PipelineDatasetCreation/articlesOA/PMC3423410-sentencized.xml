</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Mitochondria are the only cellular organelles (apart from the nucleus) that contain a genome, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>It is inherited exclusively through the maternal line. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Human mtDNA consist of one circular double-stranded DNA molecule of 16569 bp, which presents different characteristics compared with the nuclear genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>It is about 0.5–1% of the total DNA human cell content. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>A variable number of mtDNA molecules are located within the mitochondrial matrix, attached to the inner mitochondrial membrane near the oxidative phosphorilation (OXPHOS) system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The mitochondrial genome encodes few, but essential proteins of the OXPHOS system (13 polypeptides, 22 tRNA and 2 rRNA). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Then, any defect of mtDNA can lead finally to mitochondrial dysfunction and energetic cell impairment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Thus, mitochondria play a pivotal role in cell life and death in almost all eukaryotic cells, as they are vital organelles involved in cellular energy production and apoptosis [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>However, most of the mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the nuclear DNA and synthesized into the cytoplasm, from which they are imported to mitochondria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the mitochondrial biogenesis depends on the coordinated expression of both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Mitochondria are considered the major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mtDNA is one of the main targets of oxidative stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>During the last years, a large number of clinical disorders have been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction where oxidative stress was the main pathophysiologic underlying mechanism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In addition, sequence variation in mtDNA contributes to the risk of disease and it has been associated with serious human disorders [2], [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Also, sequence variation of the mtDNA may be linked to functional differences and thereby lead to different oxidative phenotypes [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the variation of appropriate mtDNA levels has been linked also to a variety of common disorders [6], [7], [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>In addition, it has been reported that altered mtDNA levels correlates with malignancy [9], [10], [11] and even with prognosis [12], [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there are several reports that attempt to establish mtDNA quantity as an oxidative stress biomarker to predict the risk for cancer [14], [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Some of the mitochondria-associated disorders include obesity, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, sepsis, ischemia/reperfusion injury as well as the physiologic process of ageing [16], [17], [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In addition, there is also increasing evidence supporting that oxidative stress plays a key role in the development of cardiovascular diseases and atherosclerosis [19], [20], [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, there is a growing interest in describing the mechanisms that regulate the mitochondrial biogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Particularly, much effort is being put towards increasing our knowledge about the maintenance of the mitochondrial genome, since both the integrity and quantity of mtDNA are critical for maintaining mitochondrial respiratory capacity to reach the ATP levels necessary for cell viability. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Despite the identification of a number of nuclear DNA-encoded trans-acting factors that regulate mitochondrial biogenesis, the exact biological mechanisms responsible for the control of mtDNA levels are unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to identify genes that influence the variation of mtDNA levels and to determine if sex modulates the genetic mechanism that controls these levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, we conducted genome-wide linkage analyses in families from the Genetic Analysis of Idiopathic Thrombophilia Project (GAIT). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>In addition, we fine-maped the genetic determinants detected by the linkage analyses. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>A standard multipoint variance component linkage method was used to assess linkage between autosomal markers and mtDNA levels using the Sequential Oligogenic Linkage Analysis Routines (SOLAR) v. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>4.0 software package [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>Age, sex, smoking behaviour, oral contraceptives use and the household effect were included in the variance component framework as linear predictors of the phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Previous studies suggested that such a method might be vulnerable to deviations from multivariate normality and particularly to high levels of kurtosis in the trait's distribution, giving inflated logarithm of odds (LOD) scores [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Levels of mtDNA in the GAIT sample exhibited a kurtosis of 0.57, which does not affect the distribution of LOD scores. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Thus, the standard nominal p-values for LOD scores are appropiate for mtDNA linkage screen [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Moreover, as 12 of the GAIT families were ascertained through thrombophilic probands, all analyses included an ascertainment correction achieved by conditioning the likelihood of these pedigrees on the likelihoods of their respective probands [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Finally, to control the multiple testing effect, genome-wide p-values were calculated using the method of Feingold et al. [34]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>In addition, mtDNA levels vary among subjects of different ages and among different tissues within the same individual. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>These levels are largely influenced by genetic factors, with a heritability (h2) ranging between 33% and 65% in different studies [38], [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Curran et al. [39] reported a QTL for mtDNA levels on Chromosome 10 (LOD = 3.83) in 1,259 Mexican American subjects from 42 extended families of the Sant Antonio Family Heart Study (SAFHS). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, in our initial linkage scan carried using all of the subjects we found a suggestive linkage signal on Chromosome 2 (LOD = 2.21; p = 7.09e-04). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Unlike Curran et al., we did not detect a linkage signal on Chromosome 10. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Notably, the significant linkage signal from females on Chromosome 2 was at the same region as was the suggestive linkage signal previously detected in the analysis performed using all of the subjects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, this genomic region on Chromosome 2 showed no linkage in the analysis performed with males. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>This demonstrates that the linkage signal detected in the first analysis was the result of the great influence that genes exert over mtDNA levels only in females. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>In addition, the linkage analysis performed with males only showed a suggestive QTL on Chromosome 1 (LOD = 2.81; p = 1.57e-04). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Fine-mapping of these linkage regions revealed significant SNP associations with mtDNA levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>The most significant association was found for the rs10888838 in the linkage region on Chromosome 1 observed in males. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>This SNP mapped in the MRPL37 gene, which encodes a component of the mitoribosome involved in the synthesis of key proteins of the OXPHOS system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>We noted that this gene was detected exclusively in males through two distinct statistical approaches, such as linkage and association. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>This combined genetic convergence supports our sex-specific family-based studies to find genes that may differently control quantitative traits of complex diseases according to sex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>In addition, these results reinforce the hypothesis that MRLP37 may contribute to the variation of mtDNA levels only in males. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>In this sense, functional variants in MRLP37 having an effect on mtDNA levels needs to be confirmed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>The identification of these polymorphisms would be clinically relevant, since it has been reported that a defect in any component of the mitochondrial protein-synthesis machinery might compromise normal mitochondrial function and contribute to disease [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, fine-mapping of the female-specific linkage region on Chromosome 2 showed a significant association of the rs2140855 with mtDNA levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>However, this SNP association reached significance only in the analysis using all of the subjects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>The rs2140855 is intergenic and located ∼170 Kbp downstream of the gene RNF144 and ∼380 Kbp downstream of the gene CMPK2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>RNF144 encodes an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, involved in proteolysis and little information exists with regard this gene and its involvement in disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>However, CMPK2 deserves special attention, since it is directly related with the mtDNA biology. CMPK2 encodes a novel mitochondrial kinase that participates in the salvage pathway of deoxyribonucleotide synthesis into the organelle [41].

<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>In addition, mutations in other enzymes of the salvage pathway that are involved in the maintenance of balanced mitochondrial dNTP pools cause severe mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromes [43], [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, our genotyping method did not cover the genomic region in CMPK2, so no SNP data were available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the rs2056634 and rs11682769 also reached significance for the association with the phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, they were also located around RNF144 and CMPK2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>This suggests the existence of a genetic variant in or around this locus that influences the quantity of mtDNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>In keeping with this, 4 SNPs (rs2609101, rs2564023, rs1880800 and rs7571496) are in or around FLJ41046, at a distance of ∼700 Kbp upstream of the gene CMPK2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>With all the above-mentioned, CMPK2 emerged as a strong candidate gene in the QTL on Chromosome 2 for the control of mtDNA levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>However, we can not rule out other potential candidates genes in this region until functional studies are performed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>In addition, the rs813779 and rs2305491 located around SOX11 and in TSSC1, respectively, also were significant in the fine-mapping of the female-specific QTL on Chromosome 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Notably, TSSC1 is ∼200 Kbp upstream of the RNASEH1 gene. RNASEH1 is also a potential candidate gene in this region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>It encodes an endonuclease that specifically degrades the RNA of RNA-DNA hybrids, and it may exert a key function during mtDNA replication [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Although all these SNPs are located in the female-specific QTL, it seems that the association with the phenotype occurs when all of the subjects are considered together, but not when males and females are analyzed separately. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>This observation could be explained by the fact that linkage and association analyses detect different types of genetic variants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>In particular, this significant linkage signal could be due to a rare variant present in a group of subjects in these extended pedigrees, whereas the same sample does not provide enough power to detect the effect of the same variant by association. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Finally, in the QTL region on Chromosome 3 observed in females, three SNPs showed significant association with mtDNA levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>These polymorphisms were rs2731943 in VENTXP7, rs7635386 in SATB1 and rs161196 in ZNF659. SATB1 encodes a DNA-binding protein involved in transcription regulation, as well as in chromatin organization and nuclear architecture during apoptosis. VENTXP7 is a non-coding protein gene that is a member of the Vent homeobox gene family. ZNF659 encodes a nuclear protein involved in nuclear acid binding and zinc ion binding at the transcription level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Although the biological function of these three genes is not directly associated with mtDNA biology, this area deserves further attention given that the linkage and association signals at the same genetic region were significant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Moreover, despite ZNF659 is located in a female-specific QTL, the rs161196 in this gene showed significant association with mtDNA levels only in the analysis using all of the subjects. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>In support of our findings, we detected two haplotypes in the QTL regions on Chromosome 2 and Chromosome 3 in females. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>These haplotypes have a significant positive effect on mtDNA levels in females only (see File S1, Figure S1, Figure S2 and Figure S3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>Our results emphasize the usefulness of linkage maps in extended pedigrees to detect sex-specific genomic regions for complex traits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>This agrees with publications that suggest a strong influence of sex on the susceptibility to common complex diseases in humans [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the genetic architecture differs significantly among subjects according to their sex for a large number of quantitative phenotypes [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with data from other studies of sex-specific heritabilities of common disease-associated quantitative phenotypes such as the case of six sex-specific obesity-related traits in the Chinese population [48] and a set of polymorphisms that influence plasma fibrinogen concentration in a sex-specific manner [49]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>It is important to note that despite the sex-specific genetic architecture found in our study, our results show no significant differences in mtDNA levels between males and females. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>In fact, sex-specific regulation of mtDNA levels does not necessarily imply different quantity of mtDNA between the two sexes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>However, if there were significant variations in mtDNA levels between sexes there would be the need for sex-specific mechanisms controlling mtDNA quantity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, and in support of our findings, the study of Curran et al. revealed a significant decrease in mtDNA content in males with respect to females in the Caucasian population [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>In addition, a case-control study including patients affected by renal cell carcinoma reported lower mtDNA content in lymphocytes in males than in females in both cases and controls [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, other mitochondrial parameters also showed differences between male and female rats for various tissues, thus supporting the existence of sex-specific mechanisms in the control of mitochondrial biogenesis [50], [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>This agrees with epidemiological data, that reveal less prevalence of some chronic and neurodegenerative diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage in human females (i.e. Parkinson disease). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the mitochondrial effects of estrogens may play a role in breast cancer, cardiovascular function, and neuroprotection [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there is evidence that sex hormones modulate the expression and the activity of proteins that control mitochondrial biogenesis [53], [54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Thus, estrogens regulate the expression of a number of nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded genes, which are involved in the control of the OXPHOS system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>Also, mitochondria are an important target for the action of estrogens [55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, it is currently well-established that estrogens have direct and indirect effects on mitochondrial activity and biogenesis, but the mechanisms mediating these effects remain to be clarified [56]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has been shown that estrogens ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction in cybrid cells carrying the mtDNA mutation that cause Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) and may be responsible for the high prevalence of LHON disease in males [57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, these cybrids were able to increase mtDNA levels after treatment with 17β-estradiol. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Consistently with these data, the significant effect of the use of oral contraceptives on mtDNA levels in our sample could be indicative of the control of steroid hormones on mtDNA levels. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Given the growing number of common diseases that are associated with altered mtDNA levels, it has become necessary to investigate the mechanisms that control the quantity of mtDNA in humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, the present work is the first genome-wide study in extended pedigrees providing data for the existence of sex-specific linkage and association in the control of mtDNA levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Our results showed a clear sex-specific genetic architecture that may regulate the variation of mtDNA levels in subjects from the GAIT Project. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>In addition, we provide extensive information regarding potential candidate genes that could modulate mtDNA levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Our findings may contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms that control mtDNA maintenance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>However, these results should be confirmed and extended. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Particularly, functional analyses are essential. </plain></SENT>
