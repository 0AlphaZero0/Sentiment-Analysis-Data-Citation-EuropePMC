</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Filamentous basidiomycetes are uncommon causes of human disease and remain poorly characterized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most frequently reported clinically important filamentous basidiomycete is Schizophyllum commune [1]. S. commune is a ubiquitous fungus growing on a variety of trees and decaying wood [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although S. commune has rather rarely been reported to cause human diseases, it has been described as the cause of a growing number of human respiratory infections, including mucoid impaction of bronchi, allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis, bronchial asthma, and allergic fungal sinusitis (AFS) [3-6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The morphological identification of S. commune as a basidiomycete fungus is particularly difficult in the case of monokaryotic isolates, which are devoid of spicules or clamp connections, unlike dikaryotic isolates [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Because several clinical strains of S. commune fail to exhibit morphological characteristics typical of the dikaryotic phase of the fungus [8], a failure of identification in the clinical microbiology laboratory may result in decreased frequency of isolation of this fungus from clinical specimens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We encountered a rare case of AFS due to S. commune, which was identified with the aid of gene sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and D1/D2 regions of the 26S ribosomal DNA. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>AFS is a noninvasive form of fungal rhinosinusitis with an incidence of 6-9% of all rhinosinusitis cases requiring surgery [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Careful diagnosis of AFS is needed with a review of surgical and histopathological findings and culture results [10-12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Our patient had nasal polyposis, elevated serum total IgE, and CT findings characteristic of AFS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of AFS in our case was made by histopathological and cultural findings of surgical specimens obtained from the frontal recess. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>AFS has been associated with several different fungi but rarely with S. commune [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>At the time of this report, only 25 cases of AFS have been reported worldwide [14-24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, most cases of S. commune have been reported in Japan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>This might be attributed to its greater awareness rather than to any geographical factors [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Because the distinct features of AFS due to S. commune have not been described, S. commune is easily confused with Aspergillus species because the presentation of infection and histopathological findings are similar [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>In our case, the sequence-based identification of the fungal isolate from allergic mucin revealed S. commune as the causative agent of AFS. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>S. commune, like most basidiomycete fungi, have dikaryotic (binucleate condition) or monokaryotic stages in their life cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Dikaryotic isolates of S. commune can be easily identified by the presence of spicules and clamp connections on hyphae and the basidiocarp (mushroom), which are distinctive features of this organism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>However, several strains of basidiomycete fungus isolated from human specimens fail to exhibit the macroscopic and microscopic morphological characteristics of the dikaryotic phase [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>The isolate from our patient did not exhibit these features; therefore, it appeared to be monokaryotic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Because monokaryotic isolates of S. commune are difficult to identify, techniques such as mating (vegetative compatibility) tests or gene sequencing may be required to identify S. commune [2-4, 14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Some investigators have demonstrated the presence of this fungus by using the mating test, which dikaryotized the monokaryotic strain and could result in a fruiting body. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>However, the mating test is not easy to perform in a conventional laboratory and may require prolonged time for identification of the pathogen in most cases [3, 4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Instead, a few studies have shown that gene sequencing is an attractive method to identify this fungus [2, 14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Our study also showed that gene sequencing of the ITS region and D1/D2 regions of the 26S ribosomal DNA was very helpful for accurate identification of this fungus. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>In fact, given the excellent specificity of this technique, gene sequencing has been recognized as the gold standard for fungal identification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>However, for accurate identification of rare molds such as S. commune, morphological findings and molecular data should be compared to ensure consistency [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Although our case isolate did not show distinctive features of S. commune, it showed some characteristic features that were indicative of S. commune, as follows: (a) it grew well at 37℃; (b) it was susceptible to cycloheximide (400 µg/mL); and (c) it had a tart and pronounced odor, as reported previously [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Additionally, this fungus was easy to culture on media commonly used in clinical laboratories and formed rapidly growing, woolly colonies with septate hyaline, branching hyphae of 2 widths. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we suggest that the combination of these morphological findings and sequencing results is the most useful and practical way to identify non-sporulating S. commune. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The accurate identification of medically important fungi remains a fundamentally important activity in the clinical microbiology laboratory. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>In many cases, morphology-based methods can be used to identify filamentous fungi [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>However, if the isolate displays atypical morphology, fails to sporulate, or requires lengthy incubation or incubation on specialized media not available in the laboratory, the isolate may be a candidate for molecular identification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Accurate identification of fungi is important to determine etiology of a disease, detect novel agents of a disease, predict intrinsic resistance to antifungal agents, and detect clusters of nosocomial infection among hospitalized patients [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>In the case of S. commune, some clinical isolates lack typical morphological features and fail to sporulate, and the fungus is often identified as "Mycelia Sterilia" or misidentified as an ascomycete. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Our study showed the value of gene sequencing, with the aid of some mycological features, for accurate identification of non-sporulating S. commune to determine etiology of the disease. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>It is important to know the allergenic mold in guiding therapy such as antifungal therapy or postsurgical immunotherapy to reduce recidivism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Oral itraconazole and topical steroid were administered achieving significant improvement in AFS by S. commune [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Some studies showed that immunotherapy can reduce the reliance on systemic and topical steroids and that patients with AFS show a better prognostic response to allergen immunotherapy [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Although it is well recognized that allergen immunotherapy is helpful in allergic rhinitis, immunotherapy is not widely performed in AFS [28, 29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>This might be attributed to the difficulty in identifying the causative agent of AFS in every case [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Current serological tests including MAST and Uni-CAP only screen for common allergens such as Aspergillus, Penicillium, Cladosporium, and Alternaria, but are insufficient to identify uncommon allergens such as S. commune. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Therefore, further work in identifying the agents of AFS may help in developing allergen immunotherapy of AFS due to uncommon fungi. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>In summary, our case demonstrates that S. commune is a human pathogen that causes AFS, and may be the first such case in Korea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Notably, our isolate appeared to be monokaryotic, sterile, and lacked clamps and spicules, suggesting that the limited isolation of this species from clinical specimens may reflect, in part, the difficulty in its identification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>In addition, the present case indicates that gene sequencing can be an important diagnostic tool to identify S. commune, particularly if the non-sporulating hyaline mold is fast growing at 37℃, fails to grow on a medium with cycloheximide, and produces a tart and disagreeable smell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Moreover, clinicians should include this fungus in the differential causative allergens of AFS, and laboratories should develop the ability to identify non-sporulating isolates of S. commune in line with the recent increasing tendency for infections caused by this fungus. </plain></SENT>
