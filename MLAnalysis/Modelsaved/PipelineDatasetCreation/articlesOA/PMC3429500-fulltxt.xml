While the number of known <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice miRNAs is continuously increasing, information regarding miRNAs from woody plants such as citrus remains limited. Solexa sequencing was performed at different developmental stages on both an early flowering mutant of trifoliate orange (precocious trifoliate orange, <italic>Poncirus trifoliata</italic> L. Raf.) and its wild-type in this study, resulting in the obtainment of 141 known miRNAs belonging to 99 families and 75 novel miRNAs in four libraries. A total of 317 potential target genes were predicted based on the 51 novel miRNAs families, GO and KEGG annotation revealed that high ranked miRNA-target genes are those implicated in diverse cellular processes in plants, including development, transcription, protein degradation and cross adaptation. To characterize those miRNAs expressed at the juvenile and adult development stages of the mutant and its wild-type, further analysis on the expression profiles of several miRNAs through real-time PCR was performed. The results revealed that most miRNAs were down-regulated at adult stage compared with juvenile stage for both the mutant and its wild-type. These results indicate that both conserved and novel miRNAs may play important roles in citrus growth and development, stress responses and other physiological processes.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported financially by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant Nos. 30971973, 30921002, 31071777, 31130046, and 31101528), the 863 Project of China (2011AA100205) and the International Foundation for Science No C/5148-1.

Based on the difference of biogenesis and action, small RNAs can be divided into microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) at a broad level <xref rid="pone.0043760-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. MiRNAs were small, non-coding RNAs generated from single-stranded precursors with hairpin structures, while siRNAs were generated from double-strand RNA precursors <xref rid="pone.0043760-Carrington1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.

Since the first identification of <italic>lin4</italic> in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0043760-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, a total of 21,643 miRNAs were identified from 168 species. More recently, a growing number of new miRNAs in plants have also been identified. To date, more than 5500 genes encoding miRNAs have been annotated in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, rice and other plant species, belonging to 250 miRNA families (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mirbase.org/">http://www.mirbase.org/</ext-link>, miRBase Release 18.0).</p><p>Identification of comprehensive sets of miRNAs and other small RNAs in different plant species was a critical step to facilitate our understanding of regulatory mechanisms or networks for target genes <xref rid="pone.0043760-Bartel2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Three major approaches have been used for miRNA discovery in plants: forward genetics, computational prediction of conserved miRNAs by searching for homologous sequences using ESTs and genomic sequences as well as traditional Sanger sequencing of the small RNA library <xref rid="pone.0043760-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Only a few miRNAs have been identified by forward genetic studies <xref rid="pone.0043760-Baker1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, the computation-based approach is mostly limited to the discovery of conserved miRNAs and was difficult to predict species-specific miRNAs; the small-scale traditional sequencing approach identifies mainly conserved miRNA, because newly evolved and species-specific miRNAs were often accumulated at a lower level and often missing from the datasets derived <xref rid="pone.0043760-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The recently developed deep sequencing methods provided a rapid way to identify and profile small RNA populations in different plants, mutants, tissues, and at different stages of development <xref rid="pone.0043760-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This strategy has been successfully applied to both model plants <xref rid="pone.0043760-Rajagopalan1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043760-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and non-model plants <xref rid="pone.0043760-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043760-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, and revealed that some miRNA families were well-conserved across plant species, suggesting that the regulatory role of many miRNAs may be universal in plants. Using the deep sequencing method revealed many species-specific miRNAs and provided the genomic landscape of miRNAs.</p><p>MiRNAs were first identified as regulators of the juvenile-to-adult transition in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0043760-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Recent studies indicated that miRNAs and other endogenous miRNAs also regulated developmental transitions in plants. Several miRNAs, such as miR156 and miR172, have been shown to affect flowering time when over-expressed in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0043760-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043760-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Over-expression of miR156 prolongs the expression of juvenile vegetative traits and delays flowering in both <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and maize <xref rid="pone.0043760-Chuck1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, whereas over-expression of miR172 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accelerates flowering <xref rid="pone.0043760-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. MiR172 exhibits a similar temporal expression pattern in maize, where it targets <italic>Glossy15</italic> (<italic>Gl15</italic>), a gene required for the expression of juvenile epidermal traits <xref rid="pone.0043760-Lauter1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. However, woody plants and many annual plants show characteristic variation as they progress from a juvenile to a mature stage, a process known as phase change. Annual plants complete their life cycle in one year and initiate flowering only once, whereas most woody plants including most fruit crops have a long juvenile period, during which no reproductive development occurs. How perennials woody plants undergo a long silence juvenile stage followed by repeated vegetative growth and flowering has been extensively studied in transcriptional study. However, whether or how miRNAs repress woody plants flowering before transition has not been elucidated in post-transcriptional and translational regulator.</p><p>Citrus is one of the most important fruit crops in the world. Citrus fruit is produced commercially for fresh fruit, juice, raisins, and transformed into high value-added products such as wines and spirits <xref rid="pone.0043760-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Flowering is an essential stage for fruit production, and thus it is important to understand the genetic mechanisms underlying the flowering event for genetic improvement. In 1976, a spontaneous mutant derived from <italic>Poncirus trifoliata</italic> (L.) Raf with short juvenile phase, namely, precocious trifoliate orange (MT), was found in Yichang, Hubei province, China. Compared with 6 to 8 years of the wild-type trifoliate orange (WT), almost all of the seedlings germinated from the MT only have 1 to 2 years&#8217; juvenile period, and 20% seedlings even flowered in the year after germination. The MT seedlings can flower 2&#8211;3 times per year while the WT only once per year <xref rid="pone.0043760-Liang1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. So the MT was speculated to be a direct variant of the WT, which is an ideal material for studying floral induction and flowering molecular mechanism. Thereafter, transcriptional study including cDNA macroarray in combination with suppression subtraction hybridization was used to investigate gene expression changes in the MT, and a total of 368 differentially expressed genes were detected <xref rid="pone.0043760-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Meanwhile, comparative proteomic analyses were performed between the MT and its WT. And the proteomic data, when considered in combination with transcriptional data, suggest that post-transcriptional regulations are involved in shaping the early flowering trait of the MT (Zhang et al., unpublished data). However, it remains largely unknown what kind of post-transcriptional mechanism was involved in the MT.</p><p>The study of miRNAs in citrus has been reported <xref rid="pone.0043760-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043760-Song1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. However, in comparison with other woody plants such as <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> and <italic>populus</italic>, the number of citrus miRNAs identified so far is still quite small. The deep sequencing study is well suited for the discovery of species-specific miRNAs expressed at low abundance. Therefore, we describe here Solexa sequencing and analysis of small RNA transcriptome from the MT and its WT. Several million miRNAs were produced from four libraries for two genotypes. A total of 216 miRNAs, known and novel, were identified based on either sequence homology or the secondary structure of their precursors. The annotation of the potential targets of differential miRNAs indicated that highly ranked genes those that are required in biological processes. Our studies not only significantly increase the number of miRNAs in citrus, but also provide useful information for miRNAs that regulate citrus growth and development processes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Plant Materials</title><p>Precocious trifoliate orange and its wild-type samples were collected in the experiment fields of the National Citrus Breeding Center at Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China (30&#176;28&#8242; N, 114&#176;21&#8242; E, 30). The seeds of the MT and its WT were planted in 20-cm pots containing a potting mix of a commercial medium (PeiLei, China) and perlite at a ratio of 3&#8758;1 for 2 months in a greenhouse at 25&#176;C with 16 h light/8 h dark. The juvenile potted seedlings were then transplanted and grown under field conditions. These juvenile trees were watered regularly with nutrient solution. Shoot meristems of the juvenile MT trees and its WT were collected in June. Lateral buds of spring shoot (in citrus, there are three flushes during the growing season, and the spring flush is the most important one for growth and flower formation, these buds develop to a spring shoot in the next year) of the MT and its WT trees were collected after self-pruning in April next year (the shoot tip has just started to fall, which occurs in mid-April). In addition, to analyze the fluctuation of miRNA expression and its relationship to flower development, the spring shoots at three distinct phases (15 days before self-pruning, during self-pruning, and 20 days after self-pruning) were collected from two-year-old trees of both the MT and its WT. All materials were collected from three individual plants and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#8211;80&#176;C until analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Small RNA Library Construction and Sequencing</title><p>Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen, USA).

Briefly, after PAGE purification of small RNA molecules (18&#8211;30 bases) and ligation of a pair of Solexa adaptors to their 5' and 3' ends, the small RNA molecules were amplified using the adaptor primers for 17 cycles and fragments of around 90 bp (small RNA + adaptors) were isolated from agarose gels. The purified DNA was used directly for cluster generation and sequencing analysis using the Illumina Genome Analyzer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The image files generated by the sequencer were then processed to produce digital-quality data.

Duplicated sequences were eliminated from the initial dataset to produce a non-redundant set of unique sequences, hereafter referred to as sequence reads. After trimming the ligated adaptor sequences, identical sequences were counted as their expression abundances. We clustered the remaining reads based on sequence similarity and the dominant reads were analyzed as follows: the reads were analyzed by BLAST against citrus genome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phytozome.net/clementine.php">http://www.phytozome.net/clementine.php</ext-link>) to discard rRNA, tRNA and snRNA.

Sequences in our libraries with identical or with three or fewer mismatches to currently known miRNAs from other plant species were regarded as potential conserved miRNAs.

Briefly, the primers for miRNAs and <italic>&#946;-actin</italic> were diluted in the SYBER GREEN PCR Master Mix (PE Applied Biosystems) and 20 &#181;l of the reaction mix was added to each well.

After miRNA-induced cleavage, only the 3&#8242; fragment of the target mRNA possesses a poly (A) tail. When poly (T) adapters are used to prime reverse transcription, only the 3&#8242; end of the cleaved mRNA should be copied into cDNA. Intact mRNA molecules will be copied in their entirety. Previous studies of mRNAs with miRNA target sites suggested that the 5&#8242; region of RNA (upstream) of the cleavage site was less stable than the 3&#8242; region (downstream) of the cleavage site <xref rid="pone.0043760-Llave1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0043760-Luo1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. One can generally expect the RT-PCR product from the upstream region to be present at levels no greater than the downstream region because reverse transcription with poly (T) adapters would not generate cDNA beyond a cleaved site.

For each potential mRNA target, three sets of primers were designed to amplify three different regions: a 5&#8242; region and a 3&#8242; region, and a middle region. The middle region includes the target site. The reverse transcription of the miRNA-cleaved mRNA will not generate a cDNA beyond the cleaved site. The same protocols described above for the quantitative RT-PCR of miRNA were used for RA-PCR.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Sequencing the Small RNA Library Using Solexa Sequencing</title><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that the flowering development of precocious trifoliate orange was a highly complex and integrated set of developmental processes coordinated by the action of hundreds of genes <xref rid="pone.0043760-Zhang3" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.

Since most of the small RNAs with known functions are 20&#8211;24 nt long, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043760-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, the majority of small RNAs were 20&#8211;24 nt in four libraries, which is within the typical size range for Dicer-derived products and in agreement with most of the previous results <xref rid="pone.0043760-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043760-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043760-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Although the total numbers of reads in four RNA libraries were similar, the size distribution of reads was substantially different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043760-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). For example, 6,737,837 (35.81% of clean reads from the MT1 library) sequences were canonical 21 nt small RNAs with the most abundant small RNAs.

Among these sequences, the number of 24 nt sequences was significantly greater than shorter or longer sequences in the WT2 library, the 24 nt reads showed the highest redundancies (37.51%). The 24 nt reads constitute 35.89% and 32.72% in WT1 and MT2 library, while they only account for 31.07% in the MT1 library.

Another fraction (approximately 50%) was predominantly derived from un-annotated or repeated sequences. Large portions of annotated small RNAs were mainly non-coding RNAs.

Cytological observation revealed that the floral buds in the two-year-old MT initiated their differentiation immediately after self-pruning on spring shoots. In two-year-old WT, the spring shoots, which do not form floral buds, begin to produce vegetative buds after self-pruning. Thus, the self-pruning appears to be a demarcation point for the meristem to initiate leaf bud or floral bud development. To understand the role of miRNAs in the floral transition, the dynamic expression of above twelve miRNAs during self-pruning was monitored by real-time PCR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043760-g008">Figure 8</xref>, miR156 expression was markedly down-regulated during the floral transition and miR172 increased to higher levels after the lateral buds were differentiated (20 days after self-pruning) in the flowering-competent shoots (spring shoots of the MT). However, in the flowering incompetent shoot (spring shoots of the WT), miR156 and miR172 were expressed in inverse patterns during self-pruning compared with the prior stage. The dynamic expression of miR156 and miR172 in flowering-competent and -incompetent shoots suggested that they were involved in the floral transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043760-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Of the other miRNAs, the Novel34 and Novel38 expression patterns were similar to that of miR156 and miR172, indicating that they may perform a similar role during the flowering process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043760-g008">Figure 8</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, miR396-targeted <italic>AtGRF</italic> transcription factors were required for coordination of cell division and differentiation during leaf development, In MT tissue, they showed high transcript levels at the undetermined stage (from before self-pruning to during self-pruning), the amount decreased at the floral bud initiation stage. However, compared with the levels in MT tissue, the miR396 was also detected and present at low levels in the WT tissue, followed by increasing a high level of expression at the floral bud initiation stage. A similar trend of changes in transcript level was seen in Novel28, Novel56 and Novel68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043760-g008">Figure 8</xref>). One possible explanation for this observation is that these miRNAs may play a similar role in inducing early flowering in precocious trifoliate orange.</p><fig id="pone-0043760-g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0043760.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>The expression pattern of conserved and novel miRNAs during self pruning.</title><p>The relative quantities of 12 miRNAs during floral transition in spring shoots of both the MT and the WT were investigated by real-time PCR. <italic>&#946;-actin</italic> was used as a housekeeping control.

Although many studies have demonstrated that plant miRNAs function as important regulators in environmental stress tolerance, more reports indicated that plant miRNAs were also involved in development and morphogenesis processes. Deep sequencing of the small RNA transcriptome yields an incredible amount of data, from which we can not only determine known miRNAs, but also successfully explore novel miRNAs with high accuracy and efficiency. Several studies have reported on miRNAs from other economically important tree crops by deep sequencing. More recently, deep sequencing was used to analyze a sRNA library generated from <italic>Poncirus trifoliata</italic> flowers and fruit. Sixty-three sequences of 42 highly conserved miRNA families and 10 novel miRNAs were identified based on citrus EST database <xref rid="pone.0043760-Song2" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Likewise, Xu et al. (2010) constructed sRNA libraries from fruit of a red flesh bud sport and its wild type in sweet orange. Deep sequencing identified 85 known miRNAs (48 families) and 12 novel miRNAs <xref rid="pone.0043760-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Several sequencings of small RNA libraries from different grapevine cultivars or tissues have been also reported in recent years <xref rid="pone.0043760-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043760-Pantaleo1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. For example, Pantaleo et al. (2010) used deep sequencing, computational and molecular methods to identify, profile, and describe 40 known miRNA families and 21 novel miRNA candidates in grapevine tissues <xref rid="pone.0043760-Pantaleo1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>; Wang et al (2012) identified 72 new potential miRNAs and 34 known but non-conserved miRNAs by deep sequencing of short RNAs from Amur grape flowers and fruits <xref rid="pone.0043760-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. In a separate study, a total of 130 conserved grapevine miRNA belonging to 28 miRNA families were validated, other 80 unconserved miRNAs including 72 novel potential and 8 known but unconserved ones were found by deep sequencing <xref rid="pone.0043760-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. However, there was a relatively large number of citrus miRNAs compared with grapevine. On the other hand, the number of miRNA was significantly fewer based on EST database than genome-wide analysis by deep sequencing. Thus, the recent release of the genome sequence will dramatically enhance the efficiency of discover new miRNAs in citrus. In this study, the use of Solexa sequencing technology was efficient to identify 216 known and novel miRNAs of trifoliate orange base on citrus genome. These miRNAs were identified from four different libraries from precursors with stem-loop secondary structures that also map to the citrus genome. They were detected from the MT and WT libraries and were characterized as following: detected for the first time, already detected in some plant species, conserved in citrus, or a variant of a known miRNA (isoform). From these analyses, we found 75 novel miRNAs that had not been detected before, 36 families that had already been detected in <italic>Citrus sinensis</italic>, 67 trifoliate orange-specific miRNAs and 24 conserved miRNAs in other plants. Previous studies validated the conserved miRNAs based on homology to known miRNAs in miRBase. However, as opposed to some studies that only blast the candidate to the known miRNA mature sequence, our identifications were determined by precursor sequence folding and verification of the genuine hairpin structures.</p><p>Both miRNAs and miRNA*s are generated from step-loop hairpin structures. It has been widely accepted that after processing from precursors, the functional strand of the short double-stranded RNA duplex will be retained as miRNAs, whereas their complementary miRNA* sequences will be quickly degraded <xref rid="pone.0043760-Khvorova1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. MiRNAs are stable and participate in translational repression or cleavage of mRNA by binding or anchoring to the coding region of mRNA sequences <xref rid="pone.0043760-Bartel2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Khvorova et al inferred from the considerably low abundance of miRNA*s that these strands are typically destroyed when released from pre-miRNA stem <xref rid="pone.0043760-Khvorova1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Therefore, in most cases, the abundance of miRNAs is much higher than that of their corresponding miRNA*s. In this study, the low expression levels of miRNA*s sequences, such as csi-miR162*, csi-miR166e*, and csi-miR172a*, further support the miRNA synthesis hypothesis. The correlation between miRNA*s and its flexible expression may reveal its particular regulated function. Csi-miR482* may be involved in regulating phase transition. Two arms of a single hairpin, giving rise to RNA function isolation by different sequences, may associate with distinct biological activities.</p><p>Some highly conserved miRNA families such as miR156/157, miR167 and miR172 families were sequenced more than ten thousands or even one hundred thousands times. These highly conserved miRNAs may represent a relationship between evolutionary conservation and expression abundance <xref rid="pone.0043760-Glazov1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. The other way around, some miRNA families that are less conserved or even species-specific have very low abundance in two genotypes. From an evolutionary view, these miRNAs play a role in establishing and maintaining phenotypic diversity between different groups of organisms <xref rid="pone.0043760-Glazov1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043760-Yao1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. It is plausible that the conserved miRNAs are responsible for control of the basic cellular and developmental pathways common to most eukaryotes whereas the non-conserved miRNAs are involved in regulation of the species-specific pathways and functions <xref rid="pone.0043760-Glazov1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. In addition to the identification of conserved miRNAs, 75 novel miRNAs were also identified. Only one member was identified in each species-specific miRNA family and the read number for each novel miRNA was much lower than that for the conserved miRNAs except Novel56. The low abundance of novel miRNAs might suggest that they in their turn play rather specific roles in response to a particular growth condition or a particular developmental stage <xref rid="pone.0043760-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. In addition, deep sequencing technologies in combination with bioinformatics analysis enabled us to profile the miRNA expression patterns for further miRNA functional insights, and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms and diverse physiological pathways. Second, comparing miRNA expression profiles at different developmental stages, we found significant differences in miRNA regulation patterns, with 22 conserved miRNAs altered expression patterns between the MT and its WT at juvenile and adult stage. All almost trifoliate orange-specific miRNAs (including known and novel miRNAs) had low read counts comparison with conserved miRNAs in this study, there was no significant difference on miRNAs profile between the MT and the WT for most miRNAs. There was one possible explanation why only a small number of miRNAs showed significant differences in two genotypes. Because the MT and its WT have nearly the same morphology except flowering habit <xref rid="pone.0043760-Liang1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, molecular evaluation on DNA level using a number of AFLP markers produced no polymorphism between the MT and its WT, indicating an isogenic background between them <xref rid="pone.0043760-Pang1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. Thus, we believed that a small number of miRNAs or specific flowering-related genes from the MT (these miRNAs and genes may be key regulators controlling flowering by activating or repressing numerous flowering related genes) may be control the early flowering process. The differentially expressed miRNAs obtained can serve as a basis for further identification of the regulation roles of phase transition in citrus.</p><p>More recent studies have demonstrated that miRNAs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, rice and other plant species target transcripts encoding proteins involved in diverse physiological processes <xref rid="pone.0043760-Moor1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, among which a set of miRNAs predominantly targeted transcription factors. Many known transcription and post-transcriptional regulatory genes were found in our library, and some known transcription factors related to flowering regulation were also found, including NAC domain transcription factor, ring zinc finger, squamosa promoter binding protein, and MYB transcription factor. NAC domain proteins were a class of transcription factors known to control multiple processes in plants, including the development of flower organ primordium <xref rid="pone.0043760-Sablowski1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref> and flowering time <xref rid="pone.0043760-Yoo1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Many (putative) zinc-finger transcription factors have also been implicated in flower development <xref rid="pone.0043760-Takeda1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, flowering time <xref rid="pone.0043760-Chen4" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, and light-regulated morphogenesis <xref rid="pone.0043760-McNellis1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. Other target genes include those encoding o-fucosyltransferase family protein, disease resistance protein family, FAR1-related sequence, LRR and NB-ARC domains-containing disease resistance protein and protein of unknown function, suggesting that trifoliate orange miRNAs were involved in a broad range of physiological functions. It would be an interesting area to identify the functions of these predicted target genes in trifoliate orange. In addition, it was hypothesized that a complementary site in the coding region of an mRNA may lead to the cleavage of the target, whereas target sites located in 3 UTRs might attenuate translation (Bartel, 2004). Consistent with this view, trifoliate orange miRNAs that target ORFs have largely been shown to be involved in the cleavage of target mRNAs. A signature of an mRNA with a target site cleaved by a miRNA-guided process was a decrease in the RT-PCR amplification of any fragment that contained a region which was upstream of the target site <xref rid="pone.0043760-Oh1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. <italic>NAC4</italic> and <italic>SPL6</italic> mRNA may be the potential targets for Novel29 and Novel56 by RA-PCR approach, respectively. The RA-PCR technique for monitoring miRNA-guided cleavage of mRNAs had an advantage of including control reactions in the same experiment. However, RA-PCR also may produce uncertainties in data interpretation as a result of the presence of additional primer-binding sites, self-priming caused by RNA secondary structures, or unusual patterns of mRNA degradation <xref rid="pone.0043760-Haddad1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>.</p><p>Plant miRNAs have been reported as involving in morphology and flowering time <xref rid="pone.0043760-Stone1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043760-Cardon1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. Are miRNAs the regulators in those processes? Although extensive experimentation would be needed to answer this question, at least the identity of the possibly novel miRNAs in this paper gives some potential gene targets for further investigation of the molecular basis of the regulation of growth and development in trifoliate orange. For example, molecular genetic analyses of vegetative phase change in maize and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> have since revealed that miR156 plays a particularly important role in this transition <xref rid="pone.0043760-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043760-Wu3" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043760-Wang3" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>, miR156 is expressed at very high levels during the juvenile phase and declines in abundance during vegetative phase change. Constitutive expression of miR156 prolongs the expression of juvenile traits, whereas loss of miR156 activity eliminates these traits, demonstrating that miR156 is both necessary and sufficient for the juvenile phase <xref rid="pone.0043760-Stone1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043760-Cardon1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. MiR172 has also been implicated in the regulation of flowering time and floral organ identity in both maize and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0043760-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043760-Lauter1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Aukerman et al (2003) demonstrated that miR172 causes early flowering and disrupts the specification of floral organ identity when over-expressed in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0043760-Aukerman1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. More recently, Song et al. (2010a) analyzed miR172 and miR156 from trifoliate orange by RACE and verified their expression patterns. Expression profiles of miRNAs indicated that the regulation mechanisms of these miRNAs were conserved in citrus. Previous studies have shown that miR156 decreases during phase development in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0043760-Wu2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, whereas miR172 increases <xref rid="pone.0043760-Aukerman1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043760-Jung1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. In this study, to understand the role of miRNAs in the floral transition, the dynamic expression of twelve miRNAs during phase change and self-pruning process was monitored by real-time PCR. The fluctuation in miR156 and miR172 expression was quite significant compared with other miRNAs. Meanwhile, miR156 and miR172 were expressed in inverse patterns, consistent with previous reports on the two miRNAs. These results suggested that miR156 and miR172 not only serves as a master regulator of vegetative phase change, but as a molecular marker for this process. In addition, Wang et al. (2011) also elucidated the role of miR156 to decide the age of branch at different position and make sure the mature branch to produce the fruits <xref rid="pone.0043760-Wang4" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. It reveals that self-pruning and aging of branch were both important processes for the floral initiation in tree and may share some similar regulatory mechanism among them.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study detected a large number of small RNA sequences that were characterized as novel and as already known citrus miRNAs. Our current study introduces an accurate and efficient approach for miRNA discovery and will aid the identification of many miRNAs in other species. We grouped some of these unique sequences into 75 novel miRNAs and further classified several of new members in known families or as new loci in citrus genome. We present an expression profile of these miRNAs at phase transition from vegetative growth to generative growth, highlighting negative correlation between miRNA and target mRNA accumulation. More importantly, based on our analysis of the small RNA expression levels in juvenile and adult development stage, we believe that some miRNAs that regulate the expression of protein coding genes in the two phases must be involved in the process of phase changes. Future investigations should use supplementary experimental approaches to verify the targets and to understand the complex gene regulatory network of these miRNAs. It is possible that we could provide insight into the phase changes and find new approaches to understanding of the regulatory mechanisms for citrus flowering development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0043760.s001"><label>Supporting Information S1</label><caption><p>
