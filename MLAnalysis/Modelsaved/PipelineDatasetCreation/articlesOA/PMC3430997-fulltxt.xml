Here, the effect of UVR-induced cell damage and the associated signalling and repair mechanisms by which cells are able to survive was studied in <italic>Dunaliella tertiolecta</italic>. UVR did not cause cell death, as shown by the absence of SYTOX Green-positive labelling cells. Ultrastructure analysis by transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that the cells were alive but were subjected to morphological changes such as starch accumulation, chromatin disaggregation, and chloroplast degradation. This behaviour paralleled a decrease in <italic>F</italic>

<sub>m</sub> and the formation of cyclobutane&#8211;pyrimidine dimers, showing a 10-fold increase at the end of the time course. There was a high accumulation of the repressor of transcriptional gene silencing (ROS1), as well as the cell proliferation nuclear antigen (PCNA) in UVR-treated cells, revealing activation of DNA repair mechanisms. The degree of phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38-like mitogen-activated protein kinases was higher in UVR-exposed cells; however, the opposite occurred with the phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). This confirmed that both JNK and p38 need to be phosphorylated to trigger the stress response, as well as the fact that cell division is arrested when an ERK is dephosphorylated. In parallel, both DEVDase and WEHDase caspase-like enzymatic activities were active even though the cells were not dead, suggesting that these proteases must be considered within a wider frame of stress proteins, rather than specifically being involved in cell death in these organisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>caspase-like enzymes</kwd><kwd>Dunaliella tertiolecta</kwd><kwd>cell death</kwd><kwd>cell survival</kwd><kwd>cellular proliferation nuclear antigen</kwd><kwd>cyclobutane&#8211;pyrimidine photodimers</kwd><kwd>DNA damage and repair</kwd><kwd>repressor of transcriptional gene silencing (ROS1)</kwd><kwd>mitogen-activated protein kinases</kwd><kwd>ultraviolet radiation</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Research on the environmental effects of UV radiation (UVR) in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems has been widely fostered since the discovery of the ozone layer depletion over Antarctica, namely the &#8216;ozone hole&#8217;. Such research was initially focused on UVB radiation (280&#8211;315nm). However, it soon became known that many of the effects of solar UVR were also caused by wavelengths corresponding to the UVA range (315&#8211;400nm) that were not affected by fluctuations in the stratospheric ozone. Therefore, it was obvious that natural levels of incident UVR (i.e. in the absence of ozone reduction) were enough to cause significant negative effects on the biota.</p><p content-type="indent">The deleterious effects of UVR on aquatic systems are due mainly to the decrease in the carbon uptake capacity of primary producers and to DNA damage. Aquatic ecosystems absorb a similar amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide as terrestrial ecosystems and produce half of the biomass of our planet. Both UVA and UVB reduce carbon incorporation rates of marine phytoplankton by modifying photosystem II (PSII) efficiency or the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">H&#228;der <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). A reduction in the performance of these targets decreases the ability of the cells to photosynthesize, thereby hampering the carboxylation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0061">Raven, 2011</xref>). In addition, UVR effects on DNA include the generation of several photoproducts that affect replication and transcription of the DNA, causing mutations and/or cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0044">Lo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). The two major classes of mutagenic DNA lesions induced by UVR are cyclobutane&#8211;pyrimidine photodimers (CPDs) and the 6-4 photoproducts (6-4PPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0077">Van de Poll <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). UVR also stimulates base substitutions, as well as duplications and deletions in the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0083">Yoon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). CPDs such as TT, CC and TC dimers may arrest cell-cycle progression by inhibiting cell division due to the obstruction of <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of cellular components required for cell growth and maintenance. DNA damage caused by exposure to UVR also induces the production of reactive oxygen species, which are one of the primary causes of DNA degradation in most aquatic organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0040">Lesser, 2006</xref>). Consequently, growth is reduced or even arrested, driving the whole population into massive death, as described previously for natural phytoplankton communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0042">Llabr&#233;s and Agust&#237;, 2006</xref>). Survival of the cells is based on the balance between damage induction rate and damage removal rate. Damage will accumulate when the capacity of the repair mechanisms is overloaded and is not sufficient to reverse the harmful effects induced/caused by UVR. Therefore, repair of oxidative and mutagenic DNA lesions is essential to prevent mutations and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0063">Rold&#225;n-Arjona <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">Morales-Ruiz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0060">Ponferrada-Mar&#237;n <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Considerable evidence has been accrued to demonstrate that when cells are stimulated by biotic or abiotic stress, a complex network of specific protein phosphorylations and dephosphorylations takes place [by the so-called mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)], leading to the activation and/or de-activation of specific group of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0039">Kyriakis and Avruch, 2001</xref>). This process generally leads to a response that allows the cell either to adapt to the new conditions or to enter into a process that will end up in cell death. MAPKs are grouped in canonic tri-modules, and three of these cascades&#8212;extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38&#8212;have been described completely in mammalian cells. Recent studies indicate that MAPK signalling cascades are also present in vascular plants such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>Nicotiana</italic> and <italic>Oryza</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0053">Nakagami <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). However, while the above-mentioned three MAPK subfamilies (ERK, JNK and p38) are present in animal cells, plant kinase genes appear to belong solely to the ERK subfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0085">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). The presence of MAPK-like pathway components in algae has been described previously by our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0034">Jim&#233;nez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0036">2007</xref>). We reported the presence of both p38- and JNK-like MAPKs in <italic>Dunaliella viridis</italic> and their involvement in survival of hyperosmotically stressed cells, demonstrating the presence of ERK1/2 in this microalga and its participation in cell division, including a partial cloning of both MAPKs. Very recently, the expression of MAPK-like proteins in response to stress has been also shown in intertidal macroalgae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0058">Parages <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that algae possess MAPK-like signalling components that serve to sense and respond to stress, permitting cell acclimation and survival under the new conditions.</p><p content-type="indent">Thus, cells have different DNA repair mechanisms to counteract the lethal effects of abiotic injuries, allowing them to maintain their genetic integrity. The most important repair mechanisms are photoreactivation and excision repair. During photoreactivation, the enzyme photolyase in combination with photorepair wavelengths between 330nm and visible light are able to reverse the UVB-induced production of CPDs. Photolyase binds to CPDs in the DNA and, after absorbing a near-UV or blue light photon, it splits the cyclobutane ring to restore the pyrimidine. The photoreactivation process has been demonstrated widely in phytoplankton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">Boelen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0082">Yi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), and in the particular case of <italic>Dunaliella tertiolecta</italic> we have cloned a CPD photolyase expressed in this species (Garc&#237;a-G&#243;mez C, Cano I, Mata MT and Segovia M. GenBank accession no. JF260981) under chronic UVR exposure. In contrast, excision repair mechanisms are able to replace either the damaged base [base excision repair (BER)] or the whole damaged nucleotide [nucleotide excision repair (NER)] in the DNA. During BER, different DNA <italic>N</italic>-glycosylases cleave the glycosylic bond between the target base and deoxyribose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">Garc&#237;a-Ortiz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0062">Rold&#225;n-Arjona and Ariza, 2009</xref>), whilst during NER, the gap formed is replaced by DNA polymerases. </p><p content-type="indent">The cell proliferation nuclear antigen (PCNA) is an auxiliary protein of the &#948;/&#949; DNA polymerase, which is essential for DNA synthesis. Its synthesis and abundance is cell-cycle dependent and it increases during the S phase. PCNA is generally expressed, and the protein accumulated in phytoplankton under normal growth conditions, indicating cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">Carpenter <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). However, previous reports have shown compelling evidence that PCNA is also expressed and the protein accumulates at high rates in cells exposed to UVR, evidencing its participation during DNA repair by both BER and NER pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0046">Masih et al., 2008</xref>). A second nuclear protein, the repressor of transcriptional gene silencing (ROS1), also participates in UVR-induced repair mechanisms. This protein was studied for its role in epigenetic control of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">Gong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), but it contains an endonuclease III domain with significant similarities to BER DNA proteins in the HhH-GPD superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0060">Ponferrada-Mar&#237;n <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Such family contains a diverse range of structurally related DNA repair proteins including endonuclease III [DNA glycosylase/apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) lyase] and MutY (A/G-specific adenine glycosylase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0038">Krokan <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0066">Scharer and Jiricny, 2001</xref>). The genome of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> encodes several other proteins belonging to the HhH family of DNA glycosylases, all with similar DNA repair activities to homologues found in bacteria, fungi and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0063">Rold&#225;n-Arjona <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">Garc&#237;a-Ortiz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). All these proteins act as DNA glycosylases, removing oxidized pyrimidines from the DNA, as well as AP lyase, by cleaving the phosphodiester back-bone by &#946;-elimination at the site where a damaged base has been removed. In addition, genetic and biochemical studies have revealed that the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protein ROS1, which contains a DNA glycosylase domain, initiates the deletion of 5-methylcytosine though a BER process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0057">Ortega-Galisteo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">UVR is usually considered to be a stressor for phytoplankton that reduces the photosynthetic uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide and affects species diversity, ecosystem stability, trophic interactions and global biogeochemical cycles, driving microalgae into decreased cell viability and, in most of species, leading to cell death. The occurrence of programmed cell death (PCD) as an active mechanism by which mass cell death takes place as a consequence of biotic and abiotic stress has been widely reported in unicellular chlorophytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0071">Segovia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">Darehshouri <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0087">Zuppini <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), dinoflagellates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0078">Vardi <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">Bouchard and Purdie, 2011</xref>), cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0064">Ross and Paul, 2006</xref>), diatoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0074">Timmermans <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), haptophytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">Bidle <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">Franklin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), and natural communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0080">Veldhuis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). The mechanisms by which cell death (programmed or not) occurs, considering that cell death in unicells leads to the complete demise of the organism, are always intriguing and there are still many unanswered questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0055">Nedelcu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Among these are the questions of what is the proteolytic machinery involved and how it works. Caspase-like (CL) activities have been reported to be involved in PCD in plants, fungi, protists, and protozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">Bonneau <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0059">P&#233;rez-Mart&#237;n, 2008</xref>). Regarding phytoplankton, the nature of CL activities remains an unrevealed question. Although it is known that CL activities are involved in cell death, these proteases are also essential during the normal physiology of the cells with constitutive functions, as well as during growth and cell stress acclimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0069">Segovia and Berges, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">Bouchard and Purdie, 2011</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Microalgae from the genus <italic>Dunaliella</italic> are among the most ubiquitous eukaryotic organisms and are well known for their extraordinarily high tolerance to salinity, temperature, nutrient limitation, and irradiance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">Ben-Amotz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). These features make these microalgae perfect candidates as model organisms for the study of environmental stress responses. As such, in previous works, we have shown that survival of the halotolerant species <italic>D. viridis</italic> subjected to environmental stress was crucially dependent on phosphorylation of p38- and JNK-like MAPKs. Cell division was impaired after hyperosmotic shock, UVR, heat shock, and nutrient starvation, caused by a marked decrease in the phosphorylated form of ERK. However, depending on the stress factor and on its intensity, cells underwent PCD, as demonstrated morphologically and by an increase in the CL activity DEVDase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0034">Jim&#233;nez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0036">2007</xref>, 2009).</p><p content-type="indent">The aim of this work was to elucidate why <italic>D. tertiolecta</italic> cells did not die when subjected to chronic UVR exposure and the reasons for their resistance. For this purpose, we studied the dynamics of DNA damage accumulation and repair, with regard to cell death and/or survival. We showed that cells survived chronic UVR exposure by activation of DNA repair mechanisms by means of PCNA and ROS1-protein accumulation. Concurrently, we demonstrate that activation of MAPK-like proteins mediated the process and we have also provided evidences that CL proteins, mainly regarded as cell death proteases, are also involved in the response to stress. As such, these proteases must be considered within a wider frame of stress proteins, rather than being specifically involved in cell death in these organisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Culture conditions</title><p>The unicellular chlorophyte <italic>D. tertiolecta</italic> (CCAP 19/6) was used in this work.

Hence, the nucleus suffered the effects of UVR stress in the short term, while the rest of the cell suffered it in the long term, indicating high cellular resistance.

In contrast, P-treated cultures, as expected, showed no increase in the amount of CPDs during the 6 days of exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). However, the damage caused by PAB treatment did not completely suppress DNA replication. Studies in macrophytes have shown that species such as <italic>Palmaria palmata</italic>, <italic>Devaleraea ramentacea</italic>, <italic>Phycodrys rubens</italic>, and <italic>Laminaria saccharina</italic> have the capacity to remove 90% of induced CPDs in just 5h, although other species such as <italic>Odonthalia dentata</italic>, <italic>Coccotylus truncates</italic>, and <italic>Monostroma arcticum</italic> did not show this capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0077">Van de Poll <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). These studies concluded that CPD induction is lower in the Arctic than in temperate and tropical regions. This low capacity of arctic macrophytes seemed to be enough to prevent accumulation of CPDs in their natural habitat. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">Boelen et al. (2001)</xref> observed these same repair mechanisms in tropical phytoplankton when the UVR dose was reduced, and also during and after exposure to UVR of bacteria and phytoplankton in the Red Sea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">Boelen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Nevertheless, these mechanisms were not sufficient to remove DNA damage, suggesting that photomortality is responsible for the loss of the plankton community, which was not the same in our case.</p><p content-type="indent">Cell density increased slightly during UVR exposure, so it could be concluded that there are mechanisms for CPD removal, probably by activation of photolyases through UVA, as well as other repair mechanisms induced by the detection of DNA damage. Among these, NER and BER are the most important. BER is a critical pathway in cellular defence against endogenous or exogenous DNA damage. This complex multistep process is initiated by DNA glycosylases that excise the damaged base and continues through the concerted action of additional proteins that finally restore the DNA to the unmodified state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">Fortini and Dogliotti, 2007</xref>). BER has been studied in detail in eukaryotes, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">C&#243;rdoba-Ca&#241;ero et al. (2009)</xref> extended the biochemical analysis to plants, demonstrating that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cell extracts were able to fully repair U:G mismatches initiated by glycosylase activity. In vascular plants, active DNA demethylation is carried out mainly by a small group of bifunctional DNA glycosylases, including ROS1, DME, DML2, and DML3 [founding members of the DEMETER-LIKE (DML) family]. Once these DNA glycosylases remove the methylated cytosine base and create an abasic site, the gap is refilled with an unmethylated cytosine through a BER pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0086">Zhu, 2009</xref>). Accordingly, our results showed an accumulation of a ROS1-like protein in response to UVR treatment from 48h of exposure to the end of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). A positive correlation was found between TT dimmers and ROS1 accumulation (<italic>P</italic> &lt;0.0001, <italic>r</italic> = 0.766). In <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, the molecular weight for ROS1 is around 160kDa, but it has been demonstrated that members of the DML family are large polypeptides that possess a discontinuous catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0060">Ponferrada-Mar&#237;n <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). The antibody we used was raised against a 30kDa peptide, which is the specific part of the AtROS1 protein. We obtained a single 52kDa band that disappeared when the antibody was blocked with the recombinant protein, and that passed through all the non-specific binding tests performed (see Materials and Methods). Thus, we assumed that, in <italic>D. tertiolecta</italic>, the protein is smaller. In contrast, cultures without UVR exposure presented a basal amount of ROS1 throughout the experiment, without any significant change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). This confirmed all the previous results with regard to cell-cycle progress, morphology, and CPD accumulation, and it also confirmed all the triggered repair mechanisms such as BER and NER, which allowed the cells to survive under UVR. This hypothesis was corroborated by PCNA accumulation, another protein involved in DNA repair. PCNA has received considerable attention because of its role in multiple cellular pathways. In addition to DNA replication and repair events such as base excision, it is also involved in various other processes including NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0056">Nichols and Sancar, 1992</xref>), mismatch repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0076">Umar <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>), cell-cycle control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0081">Watanabe <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>), apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0068">Scott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0031">Hasan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). The primary amino acid sequences of PCNA are highly conserved across the eukaryotic kingdom and more than 90% homology has been observed among plant PCNA proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">Bagewadi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">In our experiments, it was shown that damage caused to the DNA triggers the accumulation of this protein from the start of the PAB treatment (Fig. 5A). As exposure under UVR was extended, the synthesis of PCNA was higher because accumulation of damage was greater, as shown by the CPD results. A positive correlation was found between TT dimmers and PCNA accumulation (<italic>P</italic> &lt;0.0001, <italic>r</italic> = 0.893). These data agree with changes in cell morphology, as detected by disaggregation of chromatin within hours after the outset of the treatment. The basal amount of protein found at the beginning of the experiments is appointed to cell division, because PCNA is also involved in DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">Carpenter <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>), since it is a polymerase auxiliary protein and its presence in the nucleus of <italic>D. tertiolecta</italic> indicates that cells are in S phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0041">Lin <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>). A positive correlation was found between ROS1 and PCNA accumulation (<italic>P</italic> &lt;0.0001, r = 0.790).</p></sec><sec id="s25"><title>MAPK phosphorylation and the response to stress</title><p>The presence and phosphorylation of three MAPK-like proteins was detected in <italic>D. tertiolecta</italic> in response to UVR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). These MAPK-like proteins were most similar to mammalian p38, JNK, and ERK1/2, and showed different behaviours depending on the presence or not of UVR. Six MAPK cascades have been proposed to date in mammalian cells, in only three of which (p38, c-Jun, and ERK) all components have been completely identified. These cascades are involved in the response to a variety of stress conditions (UVR, heat, osmolarity, growth factors, hormones, etc.) and control of cell proliferation and differentiation. In previous studies, we demonstrated that p38-like and JNK-like MAPKs were responsible for stress adaptation in<italic>D. viridis</italic>, while ERK1/2-like protein was involved in cell division control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0034">Jim&#233;nez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0036">2007</xref>). In the current study, it was found that increased phosphorylation of a 40kDa p38-like MAPK occurred in <italic>D. tertiolecta</italic> in the first 24h after exposure to UVR, and the degree of phosphorylation was progressively reduced to initial levels by 144h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). However, activation of this protein with P treatment was much lower and occurred progressively during the first 72h of exposure. JNK-like MAPK was also activated with both in P and PAB treatment, but, activation was higher in the latter and the course of the activation was more extended over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Finally, an ERK-like MAPK was also highly phosphorylated with P treatment during the first days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>), in parallel with the exponential phase of division of <italic>D. tertiolecta</italic>. These results indicated a relationship between UVR stress and p38 and JNK phosphorylation, and, as expected, a decrease in ERK phosphorylation in stressed cells. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0036">Jim&#233;nez et al. (2007)</xref> showed that ERK phosphorylation was mandatory for completing cell division in <italic>D. viridis</italic>, and that several environmental stresses resulted in cell division reduction or arrest due to ERK dephosphorylation.</p><p content-type="indent">Both p38 and JNK have been extensively described to be responsible for stress adaptation in animal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">Capasso <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Among these stresses, it is worth mentioning hyperosmolarity and UVR exposure. With regard to <italic>D. tertiolecta</italic>, a similar response was obtained, with a significant increase in the phosphorylation of both kinases in response to UVR stress. We have shown previously that inhibition of p38 and JNK phosphorylation in <italic>D. viridis</italic> highly impaired adaptation under stressful conditions, as was the case with <italic>D. tertiolecta</italic>. These results indicate that this microalga survives under high UVR stress conditions by activating several cell programmes, among them p38- and JNK-like MAPKs and DNA repair mechanisms such as PCNA plus ROS1 accumulation and CL activities.</p></sec><sec id="s26"><title>CL activities as stress proteins</title><p>Caspase-like activities have been reported to be involved in PCD in organisms other than metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0071">Segovia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">Deponte, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">Bouchard and Purdie, 2011</xref>). However, execution of PCD in non-metazoan organisms is morphologically different from apoptotic PCD in animals; it lacks a number of key molecular components of the apoptotic machinery and in some cases might be referred to as &#8216;apoptotic-like&#8217;. With regard to phytoplankton, the nature of CL activities currently remains an unravelled question. There are no orthologue caspase genes reported to date in kingdoms other than that of metazoans, and metacaspases, which are distant homologues of caspases within the cysteine protease superfamily, found in fungi, vascular plants, and unicellular eukaryotes, were thought to perform similar functions to caspases. However, their target substrates are quite distinct. In the majority of cases, measurement of these activities in unicellular species has been carried out using the classical aspartate-containing caspase substrates. Consequently, the activities measured are &#8216;CL&#8217; activities and not metacaspases, as metacaspase activity has not yet been reported in phytoplankton (metacaspases are calcium-activated enzymes having target sites in P1 lysine or arginine; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0075">Tsiatsiani <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Therefore, the question is: which enzyme is responsible for the observed CL activity in phytoplankton (as well as in plants, fungi, etc.)? Some authors have pointed to the serine protease family proteins to perform this hydrolysis in vascular plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">Bonneau <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) and/or the vacuolar processing enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0030">Hara-Nishimura and Hatsugai, 2011</xref>). It has also been reported that some CL activities are attributable to the plant subtilisin-like proteases&#8212;saspases and phytaspases. These proteases hydrolyse a range of tetrapeptide caspase substrates following the aspartate residue. Data obtained with saspases implicate them in the proteolytic degradation of Rubisco during biotic and abiotic PCD, whereas phytaspase-overproducing and silenced transgenics provide evidence that phytaspase regulates PCD during both abiotic (oxidative and osmotic stresses) and biotic (virus infection) insults. Like putative caspases, phytaspases and saspases are synthesized as pro-enzymes, which are processed autocatalytically to generate a mature enzyme. However, unlike caspases, phytaspases and saspases appear to be constitutively processed and secreted from healthy plant cells into the intercellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0079">Vartapetian <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), showing that there is specificity for aspartate residues and that traditional caspase inhibitors inhibit the above-mentioned proteinases. Even so, the discussion about whether metacaspases are caspases or not remains open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">Carmona-Gutierrez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">Enoksson and Salvesen, 2010</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">In any case, it is clear that further research is needed in phytoplankton and protists to unravel the nature of these proteases, which cleave after an aspartate residue in general. The fact is that they are present and show a &#8216;preference&#8217; for this amino acid. However, although it is known that CL activities are involved in cell death in these organisms, these enzymes are also essential during the normal physiology of the cells, involved in housekeeping functions, as well as during growth and cell stress acclimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0069">Segovia and Berges 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">Bouchard and Purdie 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">Franklin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Our results demonstrated that DEVDase and WEHDase enzymatic activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>) were present and active, showing a broad range of activity depending on the treatment, even though the cells were not dead, and so they must be involved during the response to stress. The proteolytic activity may then possibly be related to a shift to the arrested state, which is a low metabolic state but retains low photosynthetic levels as indicated by Fv/Fm, in this case due to repair responses that are able to keep the cell alive, viable, and accumulating starch to be used when the stress ceases. In this regard, a non-apoptotic-like role for CLs was proposed previously in phytoplankton. They were reported to be constitutive and to have housekeeping functions when <italic>D. tertiolecta</italic> cells were treated with several antibiotics that inhibited <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0069">Segovia and Berges, 2005</xref>), and measurements of the enzymatic activities of &#8216;XXXDase&#8217; demonstrated that they were active. Thus, growing evidence suggests the participation of CLs in other cellular processes such as development, the cell cycle, and cell proliferation, in addition to their well-characterized role in cell death. We have provided evidence that these CL proteases must be considered within a wider general meaning of stress proteins, rather than specifically being involved in cell death in phytoplankton.</p></sec><sec id="s27"><title>UVR as a selection pressure factor for phytoplankton</title><p>Phytoplankton is at the base of the trophic web and is an important component of biogeochemical cycles; thus, research on the ecophysiology of phytoplankton is of relevance. On our planet, half of the organic carbon incorporation is due to phytoplankton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0061">Raven, 2011</xref>) and evaluation of UVR effects on aquatic ecosystems is crucial to estimate carbon flux in the oceans and increase our understanding of global change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0065">Sarmiento et al., 2004</xref>). The stress caused by UV solar radiation depends on various factors. The first is that the radiation levels on the mixed layer must be high enough to produce CPDs and photoinhibition. It is through these first few metres of the water column where UVR is able to penetrate, depending on the transparency of the water, hence causing damage. The second factor is the ability of cells to repair the damage. Our data showed the capacity of <italic>D. tertiolecta</italic> to undergo DNA repair. This species can tolerate high doses of UVR for several days, despite damage caused to DNA and essential proteins. Similar data were obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0050">Montero et al. (2002)</xref> in a study comparing the optimum quantum yield of seven species of microalgae from different phyla subjected to UVR treatments, in which <italic>D. salina</italic> was the most UV-tolerant among the Chlorophyta.</p><p content-type="indent">The explanation for the high resilience of this species can be found in the sequence of temporal events taking place during UVR stress. Biochemical responses precede any structural change or modification. In this regard, we saw that the <italic>F</italic>
<sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic>
<sub>m</sub> value dropped off in matter of 2h as a result of photosynthetic uncoupling because of photoinhibition within the frame of &#8216;short-term responses&#8217;. Concurrently, the DNA was also modified by the formation of CPDs during the short-term response. As a consequence of the UVR-induced biochemical changes, MAPKs were activated by dual phosphorylation, initiating downstream repair processes through PCNA and ROS1 accumulation. In this mid-term time frame, CL activities (which should be expected to help in dismantling the cell according to the traditional role in cell death usually attributed to these enzymes in a variety of organisms) were not related to cell death processes, indicating a role in overcoming/managing the stress. All the biochemical changes that happened during the short- and mid-term response induced structural modifications affecting the cell cycle and morphology.</p><p content-type="indent">Our results suggest that the repair capacity of <italic>D. tertiolecta</italic> and the consequent tolerance to high UVR doses could provide a clear advantage over other phytoplankton species in the photic zone and possibly in the whole water column. Moreover, although projections on the dynamics of the ozone holes indicate changes in distribution, geography, and size (Shanklin, 2010), the capability of <italic>D. tertiolecta</italic> to repair UV-induced damage to DNA and essential proteins would confer clear advantages to this species with regard to dominance and exclusions. The high resilience to abiotic stress of some species such as small chlorophytes could be crucial for phytoplankton vertical community structure and biogeography within the actual global-change scenario.</p><p>This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/uk/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/uk/</uri>) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.</p><p>&#169; 2011 The Authors.</p></sec></sec>
