By using Alu-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and ligation-mediated PCR, 233 viral-host junctions mapped across all human chromosomes at random, no difference between tumor and non-tumor tissue was observed, with the exception of fragile sites (<italic>P</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;0.0070). HBV insertions in close proximity to cancer related genes such as hTERT were found in this study, however overall they were rare events. No direct correlation between chromosome aberrations and the number of HBV integration events was found using a sensitive array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) assay. However, a positive correlation was observed between the status of several tumor suppressor genes (TP53, RB1, CDNK2A and TP73) and the number of chromosome aberrations (r&#8202;=&#8202;0.6625, <italic>P</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;0.0003). Examination of the viral genome revealed that 43% of inserts were in the preC/C region and 57% were in the HBV X gene. Strikingly, approximately 24% of the integrations examined had a breakpoint in a short 15 nt viral genome region (1820&#8211;1834 nt). As a consequence, all of the confirmed X gene insertions were C-terminal truncated, losing their growth-suppressive domain. However, the same pattern of X gene C-terminal truncation was found in both tumor and non-tumor derived samples. Furthermore, the integrated viral sequences in both groups had a similar low frequency of C1653T, T1753V and A1762T/G1764A mutations. The frequency and patterns of HBV insertions were similar between tumor and their adjacent non-tumor samples indicating that the majority of HBV DNA integration events are not associated with hepatocarcinogenesis.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National S &amp; T Major Project for Infectious Diseases (Grant no. 2012ZX10004-904; and 2012ZX10002-007).

There were an estimated 630,000 newly diagnosed HCC cases annually worldwide and more than 55% are attributed to Chinese <xref rid="pone.0040363-Michielsen1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. It is estimated that more than 80% of HCC is etiologically associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) in China <xref rid="pone.0040363-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>As an oncogenic virus, HBV leads to HCC both directly and indirectly <xref rid="pone.0040363-Bonilla1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040363-Neuveut1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Chronic HBV infection results in persistent inflammatory damage to hepatocytes and compensatory regeneration. During the endless cycles of hepatocyte damage and regeneration, mutations accumulate and ultimately liver malignancy occurs. Oncogenic viral proteins such as HBx and mutant large surface protein were also considered as playing direct pathogenic roles <xref rid="pone.0040363-Lei1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040363-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040363-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In addition, it has been proposed more than three decades ago that HBV DNA integration into the hepatocytes cellular genome played a causative role in hepatocarcinogenesis <xref rid="pone.0040363-Edman1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, this speculation was mostly based on small scale observational studies using only tumor tissue and lacked the comparative control of adjacent non-tumor tissue <xref rid="pone.0040363-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040363-Murakami1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040363-Tamori1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040363-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040363-PaterliniBrechot1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040363-Zhong1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Therefore, analysis of adjacent non-tumor tissue and consequently a systematic investigation of this hypothesis is still required.</p><p>In this study, using both Alu-polymerase chain reaction (Alu-PCR) and cassette ligation mediated PCR (LM-PCR), we thoroughly analyzed the HBV integration events in up to 60 paired HBV-HCC tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues, focusing on the discrepancy of integration frequency, host chromosome integration sites and the precise viral-host sequences, the mutation of the viral genes, etc. Furthermore, array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was conducted to assay the co-relationship between HBV DNA integration and host chromosomal aberration. In addition, in order to provide a full holographic view of the pathogeneity of HBV integration in HCC, TP53 status was also considered. Through this systematic investigation, the carcinogenesis significance of HBV integration in hepatocarcinogenesis was re-evaluated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>Sixty HCC patients undergoing surgical operations were recruited from He'nan Cancer Hospital from 2008 to 2009 (ranging age from 30 years to 70 years, mean age&#8202;=&#8202;50.7&#177;8.46 years; male: female&#8202;=&#8202;42: 18; 3 of them were HBeAg-positive and 57 were HBeAg-negative); 58 of them had accompanying liver cirrhosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040363.s002">Table S1</xref>). All HCC diagnoses were confirmed pathologically and their tumor stage was determined according to the 2002 International Union Against Cancer TNM Classification System.</p><p>The patients enrolled in this study fulfilled the following criteria: hepatitis B surface antigen positive; hepatitis B virus genotype C; negative for hepatitis C virus antibody (EIA, Abbott Laboratories). Autoimmune liver disease, drug-related hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, and obstructive jaundice were all excluded; none of the patients had undergone interferon therapy or other anti-virus therapy. Our investigation has been conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.

Alu-PCR was employed using specific primers to human Alu sequences and to HBV sequences to efficiently amplify viral-host junctions, as previously reported with modified primers HBV1 and HBV2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040363.s003">Table S2</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0040363-Murakami1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040363-Tamori1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The HBV specific primers were from the HBV X gene for the forward primers and the HBV preC/C gene for the reverse primers. Both LM-PCR and Alu-PCR have their own limitations. The Alu-PCR approach can only detect viral integration close to a human Alu repeat sequence. By contrast the LM-PCR method requires that there is a recognizable restriction endonuclease site not distant from the point of viral insertion. Therefore, the two methods were used in complementary for the analysis of viral integration events in each specimen.</p><p>The PCR products were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, and the DNA bands were cut out of the gels for subsequent sequencing. The majority of the viral-host junction sequences we got were from direct sequencing of PCR products, either from Alu-PCR or from LM-PCR. The PCR products were sub-cloned into the TA cloning vector (Genstar, Beijing, China) when direct sequencing failed. The viral-host sequences were analyzed by using the NCBI Blast tool and UCSC database hg19 to identify viral genome sequences, and to map the integration sites in the human genome.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Detection of HBV X gene mutation in tumor and non-tumor</title><p>The sequences for the &#8216;free&#8217; HBx region were detected by PCR using primers (HBV3 and HBV4, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040363.s003">Table S2</xref>) spanning from the X gene to the preC/C gene.

The aCGH was performed by the Shanghai Bio Corporation (Shanghai, China) using the Aiglent Human Genome 244K CGH microarray that contains 236,000+ coding and non-coding human sequences, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The raw aCGH profiles extracted from Agilent Feature Extraction 10.5.1.1 were processed to identify statistically significant transitions in copy number using the aberration detection method algorithm found in Agilent DNA Analytics 4.0.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Comprehensive analysis of the status of TP53 gene in tumor tissues</title><p>The exons 2 to 11 of TP53 were amplified using 4 independent PCR reactions.

If the LOH index was less than 0.5 or more than 2.0, this defined the case as a potential LOH site. TP53 LOH was defined when there were two or more than two potential LOH sites in each tissue. This method was validated using the 25 aCGH analyzed tumor and non-tumor tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 14.0 for windows. The &#967;<sup>2</sup> test with Yates correction factor or Fisher's exact test was used to compare categorical variables between two groups. To study potential correlation between the number of HBV integration and chromosomal aberration number, Spearman's correlation test was used. To study the correlation between the number of tumor suppressor gene aberrations and the number of chromosomal aberration, Spearman's correlation test was used. All estimates were accompanied by a 95% confidence interval (CI), where appropriate and a P-value&lt;0.05 was considered as being statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>HBV DNA integration shows no difference either in frequency or chromosome distribution between tumor derived and the corresponding non-tumor derived samples</title><p>Using Alu-PCR and LM-PCR, all 5 known viral-host sequences in the PLC/PRF/5 cell line were detected <xref rid="pone.0040363-Bonilla1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, indicating that the methods we employed here were reliable. A total of 287 different inserted sequences were identified amongst the 88% (53/60) integration positive patients (File S1). Amongst these 101 viral-host junctions were identified in 68% (41/60) of the tumor derived samples and 186 in 72% of the (43/60) non-tumor derived samples. Multiple integration events were found in 50% (22/41) of the tumor derived and 91% (39/43) of the non-tumor derived samples. Amongst the viral-host junctions identified, 233 could be precisely mapped to chromosomes, of which 81 were from tumor derived tissues and 152 from non-tumor samples. The remaining 54 virus-host junctions could not be uniquely mapped due to repetitive or unidentified sequences. A greater number of integration events were detected in non-tumor derived specimens (2.43 per tumor tissue and 4.33 per non-tumor tissues respectively).</p><p>As expected, larger chromosomes harbored more integration events. However, when normalized to the number of integrations per 10<sup>8</sup> base pairs, no obvious chromosome preference was observed in either tumor derived or in non-tumor derived samples. Amongst the 233 precisely mapped viral insertion sites, 64 were found to lie within a known fragile site <xref rid="pone.0040363-Feitelson1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The following fragile sites were found being hit more than once: FRA19B in 5 cases, FRA1A, FRA5A, and FRA7J each in 4 cases, FRA7B and FRA1L in 3 cases, FRA1F, FRA12A, FRA3D, FRA6D and FRA19A in 2 cases. Interestingly, a significant disparity was observed in the frequency with which fragile sites were mapped occurred between the tumor derived and non-tumor samples was observed (31/81 sites in tumor vs. 33/152 sites in non-tumor, <italic>P</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;0.0070).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Cellular gene containing areas in the human genome are the favored target site for HBV integration</title><p>Alignment analysis using the UCSC blast revealed that 47% (110/233) of the viral insertion sites mapped were in introns (35/81 in tumor vs. 75/152 in non-tumor) and 4% (10/233) fell in exons (4/81 in tumor vs. 6/152 in non-tumor) (File S1). The remaining 48% (113/233) were mapped to non-coding regions of the human genome (43/81 in tumor vs. 70/152 in non-tumor) (File S1). In addition, 11 of 81 integration sites mapped from tumor derived samples fell within &#177;10 kb of transcription start sites whilst the same was true for only 15 of the 152 integration sites mapped for non-tumor derived samples. These data indicate that, promoter, exon and intron areas in the genome are the favored target sites for HBV integration. It is of course possible that direct insertion into a gene area could affect the function of the targeted gene. However, no significant differences in integration preference were observed between the tumor derived and the non-tumor derived samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040363-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0040363-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0040363.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Map of the target sites of HBV integration in human chromosomes.</title><p>The solid black triangle indicates 12 insertion sites within the FN1 gene.

The great majority of available data has been derived from the analysis of integration sites solely in tumor derived tissues <xref rid="pone.0040363-Bonilla1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040363-Murakami1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040363-Tamori1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040363-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040363-Zhong1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040363-Minami1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. A systematic side by side comparative analysis of both tumor derived and non-tumor derived samples from the same patient cohort has not been reported previously.</p><p>In the present study, in agreement with a previous report, approximately 70% of tumor derived tissues were found to be carrying integrated HBV DNA <xref rid="pone.0040363-Zhong1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. A recent comprehensive HBV integration study using whole-genome deep sequencing showed that among the 3 HBV positive HCC, the number of viral integration sites was higher in tumor derived tissues compared to that in non-tumor tissues <xref rid="pone.0040363-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. By contrast and somewhat unexpectedly, in the present study, more insertion sites were picked up in the specimens derived from the adjacent non-tumor tissues than that in the paired tumor tissues. The majority of the patients recruited to the study cohort had a cirrhotic liver back ground, in which nodule based clonal expansion is common <xref rid="pone.0040363-Mason1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Therefore, a possible explanation for the larger number of integration events found in our study is that DNA extracted from the adjacent non-tumor tissues may have originated from multiple cirrhotic nodules. The fact that no overlap of HBV integration sites were found between tumor derived and non-tumor derived tissue obtained from the same patient, further supported the assertion that the integration of HBV DNA occurs at random.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that HBV DNA is preferentially inserted into known transcriptional and chromosomal regulatory regions <xref rid="pone.0040363-Horikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. This in turn has prompted speculation that if the gene targeted by an insertion event is tumor related, then integration would be oncogenic. However, in this study the frequencies of insertions located within known or predicted genes in tumor derived and non-tumor derived tissues were almost identical (&#8764;42%). Indeed, the precise mapping of viral-host junctions in the present study has revealed that HBV integration occurred randomly across all human chromosomes, with no difference being observed between tumor derived and non-tumor derived samples at the chromosomal level.</p><p>The hypothesis that targeted viral genome integration might lead to &#8216;activation&#8217; of cellular genes with oncogenic potential arose originally from studies on avian retroviruses <xref rid="pone.0040363-Enrietto1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Later studies on woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) linked WHV DNA integration with woodchuck HCC development. Integration of WHV genome sequences within the N-myc 2 gene was observed in approximately 20% of HCC tumors <xref rid="pone.0040363-Fourel1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Furthermore based on the observed association between integration into N-myc 2 and up-regulation of the gene, it has been suggested that the up-regulation of gene expression would endow the carrier hepatocytes with a selective growth advantage and clonal expansion leading eventually to malignancy <xref rid="pone.0040363-Bruni1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040363-Jacob1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In the present study, HBV insertion was found to occur in the vicinity of the oncogenic hTERT gene in 3 of the 60 HCC tumor derived tissues examined. Further analysis via realtime RT-PCR showed up-regulation of hTERT in 2 of the 3 tumor tissues, in comparison with their corresponding non-tumor tissues. These data indicated that HBV integration may enhance host gene expression, providing for the possibility that the viral insertion could be indirectly involved in hepatocyte malignant transformation by affecting host gene expression. However, to provide additional evidence in support of this possibility, deep sequencing, corresponding mRNA expression profiles and biomedical analysis will be required.</p><p>Interestingly, viral insertion was found to be significantly more frequent in the fragile sites in tumor derived tissues, than in adjacent non-tumor derived tissues. Deletion or rearrangement of genes within fragile site regions frequently occurs in a wide range of human cancers. This preference exhibited by HBV for insertion within fragile sites may induce site-specific instability and thus be a potentially oncogenic effect of HBV integration <xref rid="pone.0040363-Feitelson1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>As far as the viral sequences inserted into the host genome are concerned, this study demonstrated for the first time that insertion in the HBV X gene and preC/C region was common in both tumor derived and non-tumor derived tissues. As previously reported, DR1 and the topoisomerase I motif were the preferred break-points of the inserted viral fragments in both orientations. Indeed, a recent study using DNA based- and RNA based-deep sequencing also revealed that both in tumor and non-tumor tissues, the breakpoint of inserted viral DNA clustered near DR1 region located toward the end of the HBx gene <xref rid="pone.0040363-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Breakage of the viral genome in this region causes C-terminal truncation of the inserted HBx and this has a high probability of resulting in the loss of the near terminal growth-suppressive effect domain of the X gene <xref rid="pone.0040363-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. A number of <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have suggested that HBx carrying C-terminal truncations is more oncogenic <xref rid="pone.0040363-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. However, we failed to show the difference in the frequency of such mutations between tumor derived and non tumor derived samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040363-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>The frequencies of C1653T, T1753V and A1762T/G1764A point mutations in the X gene of the inserted HBV viral sequences were the same as that found for serum derived samples i.e.: &#8216;free&#8217; non integrated viral DNA in CHB group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0040363-t002">Table 2</xref>). This is consistent with HBV integration being an early event in the process of hepatocarcinogenesis and possibly before clonal expansion of individual tumors.</p><p>Genetic instability triggered by HBV integration has been considered in some reports to be an important contributing factor in the pathogenesis of HCC <xref rid="pone.0040363-Neuveut1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040363-Wilkens1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040363-Nakajima1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. However, in this study the analysis of rearrangements of the integrated HBV sequences and of local alterations of the host genome surrounding integration sites failed to identify any significant discrepancies between changes found in tumor derived and non-tumor derived samples. Furthermore, in an aCGH assay, no correlation was found between HBV integration events and large-scale chromosomal alterations. Instead, a positive correlation was found between the number of aberrant tumor suppressor genes (such as TP53, RB1, TP73, BRCA1, and BRCA2) and the number of whole chromosomal aberrations observed (r&#8202;=&#8202;0.6625, <italic>P</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;0.0003). In addition, compared with the non-tumor tissues, an increased tendency of viral DNA rearrangement were found in tumor tissues (25.86% vs. 12.26%, <italic>P</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;0.0269). However, due to limitations of PCR-based technique employed, it was not possible to evaluate the copy number changes in the vicinity of viral integration sites.</p><p>To conclude, with the exception of significantly higher frequencies of chromosome fragile sites integration and vicinal DNA rearrangement in the tumor group, all other properties of HBV insertion into the cellular genome found in this study were similar between tumor derived and adjacent non-tumor derived samples. Therefore, this control tissue validated study did not demonstrate a strong co-relationship between HBV integration and hepatocyte malignant transformation. A large scaled deep sequencing based functional study of the HBV integration in HCC patients will be needed to complete our understanding of its molecular role in HBV infection related hepatocarcinogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0040363.s001"><label>File S1</label><caption><p>
