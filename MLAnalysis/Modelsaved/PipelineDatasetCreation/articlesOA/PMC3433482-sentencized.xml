</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common cause of cancer death in China [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>There were an estimated 630,000 newly diagnosed HCC cases annually worldwide and more than 55% are attributed to Chinese [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>It is estimated that more than 80% of HCC is etiologically associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) in China [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>As an oncogenic virus, HBV leads to HCC both directly and indirectly [4], [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Chronic HBV infection results in persistent inflammatory damage to hepatocytes and compensatory regeneration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>During the endless cycles of hepatocyte damage and regeneration, mutations accumulate and ultimately liver malignancy occurs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Oncogenic viral proteins such as HBx and mutant large surface protein were also considered as playing direct pathogenic roles [6], [7], [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In addition, it has been proposed more than three decades ago that HBV DNA integration into the hepatocytes cellular genome played a causative role in hepatocarcinogenesis [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, this speculation was mostly based on small scale observational studies using only tumor tissue and lacked the comparative control of adjacent non-tumor tissue [8], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Therefore, analysis of adjacent non-tumor tissue and consequently a systematic investigation of this hypothesis is still required. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In this study, using both Alu-polymerase chain reaction (Alu-PCR) and cassette ligation mediated PCR (LM-PCR), we thoroughly analyzed the HBV integration events in up to 60 paired HBV-HCC tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues, focusing on the discrepancy of integration frequency, host chromosome integration sites and the precise viral-host sequences, the mutation of the viral genes, etc. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was conducted to assay the co-relationship between HBV DNA integration and host chromosomal aberration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In addition, in order to provide a full holographic view of the pathogeneity of HBV integration in HCC, TP53 status was also considered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Through this systematic investigation, the carcinogenesis significance of HBV integration in hepatocarcinogenesis was re-evaluated. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>The great majority of available data has been derived from the analysis of integration sites solely in tumor derived tissues [4], [10], [11], [12], [14], [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>A systematic side by side comparative analysis of both tumor derived and non-tumor derived samples from the same patient cohort has not been reported previously. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>In the present study, in agreement with a previous report, approximately 70% of tumor derived tissues were found to be carrying integrated HBV DNA [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>A recent comprehensive HBV integration study using whole-genome deep sequencing showed that among the 3 HBV positive HCC, the number of viral integration sites was higher in tumor derived tissues compared to that in non-tumor tissues [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>By contrast and somewhat unexpectedly, in the present study, more insertion sites were picked up in the specimens derived from the adjacent non-tumor tissues than that in the paired tumor tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>The majority of the patients recruited to the study cohort had a cirrhotic liver back ground, in which nodule based clonal expansion is common [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a possible explanation for the larger number of integration events found in our study is that DNA extracted from the adjacent non-tumor tissues may have originated from multiple cirrhotic nodules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>The fact that no overlap of HBV integration sites were found between tumor derived and non-tumor derived tissue obtained from the same patient, further supported the assertion that the integration of HBV DNA occurs at random. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have suggested that HBV DNA is preferentially inserted into known transcriptional and chromosomal regulatory regions [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>This in turn has prompted speculation that if the gene targeted by an insertion event is tumor related, then integration would be oncogenic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>However, in this study the frequencies of insertions located within known or predicted genes in tumor derived and non-tumor derived tissues were almost identical (∼42%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the precise mapping of viral-host junctions in the present study has revealed that HBV integration occurred randomly across all human chromosomes, with no difference being observed between tumor derived and non-tumor derived samples at the chromosomal level. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis that targeted viral genome integration might lead to ‘activation’ of cellular genes with oncogenic potential arose originally from studies on avian retroviruses [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Later studies on woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) linked WHV DNA integration with woodchuck HCC development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Integration of WHV genome sequences within the N-myc 2 gene was observed in approximately 20% of HCC tumors [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Furthermore based on the observed association between integration into N-myc 2 and up-regulation of the gene, it has been suggested that the up-regulation of gene expression would endow the carrier hepatocytes with a selective growth advantage and clonal expansion leading eventually to malignancy [24], [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>In the present study, HBV insertion was found to occur in the vicinity of the oncogenic hTERT gene in 3 of the 60 HCC tumor derived tissues examined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Further analysis via realtime RT-PCR showed up-regulation of hTERT in 2 of the 3 tumor tissues, in comparison with their corresponding non-tumor tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>These data indicated that HBV integration may enhance host gene expression, providing for the possibility that the viral insertion could be indirectly involved in hepatocyte malignant transformation by affecting host gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>However, to provide additional evidence in support of this possibility, deep sequencing, corresponding mRNA expression profiles and biomedical analysis will be required. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, viral insertion was found to be significantly more frequent in the fragile sites in tumor derived tissues, than in adjacent non-tumor derived tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Deletion or rearrangement of genes within fragile site regions frequently occurs in a wide range of human cancers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>This preference exhibited by HBV for insertion within fragile sites may induce site-specific instability and thus be a potentially oncogenic effect of HBV integration [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>As far as the viral sequences inserted into the host genome are concerned, this study demonstrated for the first time that insertion in the HBV X gene and preC/C region was common in both tumor derived and non-tumor derived tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>As previously reported, DR1 and the topoisomerase I motif were the preferred break-points of the inserted viral fragments in both orientations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Indeed, a recent study using DNA based- and RNA based-deep sequencing also revealed that both in tumor and non-tumor tissues, the breakpoint of inserted viral DNA clustered near DR1 region located toward the end of the HBx gene [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Breakage of the viral genome in this region causes C-terminal truncation of the inserted HBx and this has a high probability of resulting in the loss of the near terminal growth-suppressive effect domain of the X gene [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>A number of in vitro studies have suggested that HBx carrying C-terminal truncations is more oncogenic [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>However, we failed to show the difference in the frequency of such mutations between tumor derived and non tumor derived samples (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of C1653T, T1753V and A1762T/G1764A point mutations in the X gene of the inserted HBV viral sequences were the same as that found for serum derived samples i.e.: ‘free’ non integrated viral DNA in CHB group (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with HBV integration being an early event in the process of hepatocarcinogenesis and possibly before clonal expansion of individual tumors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Genetic instability triggered by HBV integration has been considered in some reports to be an important contributing factor in the pathogenesis of HCC [5], [26], [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>However, in this study the analysis of rearrangements of the integrated HBV sequences and of local alterations of the host genome surrounding integration sites failed to identify any significant discrepancies between changes found in tumor derived and non-tumor derived samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in an aCGH assay, no correlation was found between HBV integration events and large-scale chromosomal alterations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Instead, a positive correlation was found between the number of aberrant tumor suppressor genes (such as TP53, RB1, TP73, BRCA1, and BRCA2) and the number of whole chromosomal aberrations observed (r = 0.6625, P = 0.0003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>In addition, compared with the non-tumor tissues, an increased tendency of viral DNA rearrangement were found in tumor tissues (25.86% vs. 12.26%, P = 0.0269). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>However, due to limitations of PCR-based technique employed, it was not possible to evaluate the copy number changes in the vicinity of viral integration sites. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>To conclude, with the exception of significantly higher frequencies of chromosome fragile sites integration and vicinal DNA rearrangement in the tumor group, all other properties of HBV insertion into the cellular genome found in this study were similar between tumor derived and adjacent non-tumor derived samples. </plain></SENT>
