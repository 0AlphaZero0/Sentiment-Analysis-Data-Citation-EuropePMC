</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Previous epidemiologic studies have found that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) [for a review, see [1]]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Several of these studies have suggested the risk reduction may be greater among certain subgroups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In one study, NSAIDs were associated with reduced AD risk only among those with at least one high-risk ∊4 allele [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Several other studies noted similar albeit non-significant subgroup differences by APOE genotype [3, 4, 5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Two other observational studies reported that the association between NSAIDs and reduced AD risk was greatest among the youngest old and diminished with increasing age [2, 6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The Alzheimer's Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial (ADAPT) was designed to evaluate whether the nonselective NSAID naproxen sodium (Aleve®, Bayer) or the selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor celecoxib (Celebrex®, Pfizer) prevent AD onset among cognitively intact elderly with a family history of AD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Primary results reported from the trial did not support the hypothesis that NSAIDs prevent AD or age-related cognitive decline [7, 8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>This report describes analyses of ADAPT data to determine if the effect of the NSAIDs on AD incidence differed by APOE genotype or age at enrollment in the trial. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>ADAPT was a randomized, placebo-controlled, primary prevention trial sponsored by the National Institute on Aging. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Participants were assigned to the following parallel treatment groups in a 1:1:1.5 ratio: (a) naproxen (220 mg b.i.d.); (b) celecoxib (200 mg b.i.d.), or (c) placebo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Participants and personnel at the clinical sites were masked to treatment assignment using a double-placebo design [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The study protocol was reviewed and approved by all relevant institutional review boards. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>ADAPT participants were recruited primarily through mailings to Medicare beneficiaries in areas surrounding the trial's six field sites in the United States (Baltimore, Md.; Boston, Mass.; Rochester, N.Y.; Seattle, Wash.; Sun City, Ariz.; Tampa, Fla.). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Participants were aged 70 years or older, with a history of at least one first-degree relative with Alzheimer-like dementia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Participants underwent cognitive screening before enrollment to exclude those with dementia or other cognitive disorders. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Participants were enrolled from March 2001 to December 2004 and screened annually by an in-person cognitive assessment battery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In December 2004, enrollment and treatment administration were suspended earlier than planned following the announcement from the Adenoma Prevention with Celecoxib (APC) trial that the dose of celecoxib used in ADAPT produced substantially increased risks of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and related events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The rationale for suspending both treatments in ADAPT has been fully discussed [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>A subsequent analysis of ADAPT data did not show the same level of risk for celecoxib as those of the APC trial [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The follow-up of patients enrolled in ADAPT continued until a common closing date in February 2007. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>A detailed description of the ADAPT design and methods has been published [12]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Participants with possible cognitive syndromes were identified using cognitive assessment batteries or via referral from study clinicians and were invited to return to a study clinic for a dementia evaluation visit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>A description of the battery of tests and procedures used in ADAPT for cognitive assessments and dementia evaluations has been published [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The laboratory, neuroimaging, and cognitive battery results from the annual study visits and the dementia evaluation visit were reviewed by a diagnostic expert panel including the examining clinicians, other ADAPT physicians, and senior site neuropsychologists. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>When appropriate, the panel assigned diagnoses of dementia using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV criteria [13] and of Alzheimer's dementia using the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria [14]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Naproxen and celecoxib were each compared with placebo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>We evaluated time-to-occurrence of AD using the principle of intention-to-treat (ITT) with Cox proportional hazards regression models [15] excluding participants with no follow-up data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>For those participants without an AD event, person-time was censored after the participants’ last completed cognitive assessment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>The event date for those participants with a diagnosis of AD was taken as the date of the relevant dementia evaluation visit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>To test for different treatment effects by age and APOE genotype, we separately examined models with 2-way interactions between treatment and age category (dichotomized at the median baseline age; age &lt;74 years vs. age ≥74 years) or treatment and APOE genotype (dichotomized at one or more APOE ∊4 alleles vs. no ∊4 alleles). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Models were adjusted for field site and 5-year age group (for models not including the dichotomized age variable). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Approximately one-third of the participants had at least one APOE ∊4 allele; only 3% had homozygous ∊4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>More than half of the participants were homozygous for ∊3. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>The incidence of AD was higher among participants with one (HR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.3–4.4, p &lt; 0.01) or two (HR = 6.2, 95% CI: 2.3–16.6, p &lt; 0.01) APOE ∊4 alleles as compared to those with no ∊4 alleles. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>ADAPT was carried out to test the hypothesis that NSAIDs prevent the onset of AD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>The primary results did not provide any support for this hypothesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>The source of the discrepant results between the randomized trial and previous observational studies has been the focus of much debate [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Motivated by findings of several previous observational studies that the effects of NSAIDs may be greater among the youngest old or those with one or more APOE ∊4 allele, we analyzed ADAPT data to test for subgroup differences by age or APOE genotype that might explain the discrepancies between the observational and randomized studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>We found no evidence for such subgroup differences. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>This is the first randomized study of NSAIDs and AD to test for subgroup differences by age or APOE genotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Randomized trials are considered the gold standard for establishing causal relationships in epidemiology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>However, the current study was not designed to test for treatment by genotype or age interactions and may not have had sufficient sample size to rule out important differences in treatment effects by age or APOE genotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>For instance, the estimated hazard ratio for naproxen versus placebo in the subgroup with APOE ∊4 alleles was close to 1.0 (i.e. HR = 0.91), but the confidence interval contained values that would probably be regarded as clinically significant, i.e. potentially a 60% reduction in AD incidence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Similarly for celecoxib versus placebo in those with ∊4 alleles, the wide confidence intervals meant that we are unable to rule out a 40% reduction in AD incidence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>The current findings do argue, however, against subgroup effects on AD incidence of these magnitudes or greater. </plain></SENT>

Event is defined as possible or probable AD based on consensus conference. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (NSAID vs. placebo) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression. Time to event is from randomization to the date of the associated dementia evaluation. Time to censor is from randomization to the most recent cognitive assessment. Models included adjustment for stratification variables of field site (both models) and 5-year age group (model 1 only).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></SecTag></floats-group></article>
