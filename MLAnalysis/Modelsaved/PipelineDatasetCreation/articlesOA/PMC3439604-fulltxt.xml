There are at least five distinct CA gene families: &#945;, &#946;, &#947;, &#948;, and &#949; (So et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2004</xref>). The similarity of the amino acid sequences among these proteins is not high. In the animal kingdom, previously reported CAs are composed of a single gene, the so-called &#945;-carbonic anhydrase (Hewett-Emmett and Tashian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1996</xref>). In mammals, at least 15 different &#945;-CA isozymes have been described; they can be divided into five subgroups by their localizations. Five families (CAI, CAII, CAIII, CAVII, and CAXIII) are cytosolic; others are membrane-bound (CAIV, CAIX, CAXII, CAXV, and CAXIV), mitochondrial (CAVA and CAVB), or secreted (CAVI). The three isoforms that lack CA activity are also known as CA-related proteins (CAVIII, CAX, and CAXI). These CAs show tissue-specific distribution (Tashian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1989</xref>; Pastorekova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2004</xref>).</p><p>CA also participates in biomineralization and is an essential enzyme of calcification (Freeman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1960</xref>; Bensch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1984</xref>; Kakei and Nakahara <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1996</xref>). In the biomineralization of bivalves, there is a correlation between CA activity and larval shell developmental steps (Medakovi&#263; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2000</xref>). CA is an important marker of biomineralization during early shell formation in the European abalone <italic>Haliotis tuberculata</italic>, Linnaeus (Gaume et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2011</xref>). The mantle of the mollusk shell contains CA activity (Wilbur and Jodrey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1955</xref>; Yu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2006</xref>; Medakovi&#263; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2000</xref>). It is believed that the CA of mantle epithelia facilitates the secretion of HCO<sub>3</sub>&#8722; required for this calcification (Boer and Witteveen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1980</xref>).</p><p>Nacrein was first discovered as a carbonic anhydrase in the hard tissue of the bivalve pearl oyster <italic>Pinctada fucata</italic> (Miyamoto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1996</xref>; Miyashita et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2002</xref>). Nacrein is composed of two functional domains: a carbonic anhydrase domain and the Gly-Xaa-Asn (Xaa&#160;=&#160;Asp, Asn, or Glu) repeat (Miyamoto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1996</xref>). Homologs of nacrein were subsequently discovered: the carbonic anhydrase termed N66 (Kono et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2000</xref>) from <italic>Pinctada maxim</italic> and a carbonic anhydrase of the gastropod <italic>Turbo marmoratus</italic> (Miyamoto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2003</xref>). The amino acid sequence of the repeat domain of nacrein and N66 are similar, except for a long NG repeat in N66. On the other hand, most of the repeat domain of <italic>Turbo marmoratus</italic> enzyme is composed of an NG repeat.</p><p>In vitro experiments showed that N66 strongly inhibited the crystallization of CaCO<sub>3</sub> in the free state (Kono et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2000</xref>). In nacrein, the repeat domain participates in the inhibition of the calcium carbonate precipitation and crystal growth (Miyamoto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2005</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the carbonic anhydrases mentioned above, there are some reports of carbonic anhydrases that are involved in hard tissue formation of invertebrates. Proteins were extracted with 0.5&#160;M EDTA from the organic matrix spicules of the alcyonarian, <italic>Synularia polydactyla</italic>, and it is reported that two proteins (83 and 63&#160;kDa) among them had carbonic anhydrase activity and calcium binding capability (Rahman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2005</xref>). Calcium-binding carbonic anhydrases were identified from the nacre-soluble matrix in the freshwater mussel <italic>Unio pictorum</italic> (Marie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2008</xref>). It is speculated that this enzyme might participate in the calcification process and may have a structure similar to that of nacrein.</p><p>The 1.3 kbp 5&#8242; flanking sequence of the human CAII gene has strong promoter activity in renal tubular cells, and this region contains a putative transcription factor AP1 binding element (Lai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1998</xref>). Carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) is essential for osteoclast activity. CAII in osteoclasts is transcriptionally up-regulated by a c-Fos/AP-1 transcription factor (David et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2001</xref>). Furthermore, the promoter of a tumor-associated isoenzyme MN/CAIX (MN) is also activated by AP1 (Kaluzova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2001</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, to characterize the 5&#8242;-flanking transcriptional regulatory region, we isolated and sequenced the 5&#8242;-flanking region of nacrein. We performed in vitro transcription using HeLa nuclear extracts, which suggested that the addition of human c-jun activates transcription from the nacrein promoter.

N66 is a homolog of nacrein of <italic>Pinctada maxima</italic>, and in vitro experiments have shown that N66 strongly inhibits the crystallization of CaCO<sub>3</sub> in the free state (Kono et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2000</xref>). Detailed analysis showed that nacrein prevents crystal formation via an interaction between the Gly-Xaa-Asn repeat and certain crystal faces (Miyamoto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2005</xref>).</p><p>Nacrein mRNA is transcribed actively in the mantle epithelium (Miyamoto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2005</xref>; Takeuchi and Endo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2006</xref>). In this study, Northern blot analysis was performed for other tissues in addition to the mantle epithelium, and the nacrein gene was demonstrated to be transcribed in the adductor muscle, the liver, and the foot at high levels. The expression was also observed in the gill, though at a low level. Recently, the correlation between the transcription of the chicken type II procollagen gene and the translation of the mRNA was reported. In this report, although the mRNA was expressed in multiple tissues, the protein was only detected in chondrogenic cartilage, vitreous body, and cornea (Caixia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2006</xref>). Thus, the presence of the mRNA in the different tissues does not mean that the protein is necessarily expressed there. Nevertheless, if nacrein is expressed in these tissues, it might play an important role in acid&#8211;base balance, ion transport, or maintenance of ionic concentration in the adductor muscle and gill.</p><p>Carbonic anhydrase II is necessary for osteoclast differentiation, and its transcription is activated by c-Fos/AP-1 (David et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2001</xref>). A tumor-associated carbonic anhydrase MN/CA9 (MN) gene is also activated by transcription factor AP1 (Kaluzova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2001</xref>). The 5&#8242;-flanking region of the nacrein gene contains a putative AP1 binding site, in addition to a TATA box (ATAAAT) and possible CCAAT box (CCACT). To examine the promoter activity, we tried to isolate nuclei from the mantle of <italic>Pinctada fucata</italic> to prepare nuclear extracts for in vitro transcription. Unfortunately, we failed to isolate good quality nuclei. This failure may have been due to the special structure of the mantle. The mantle is a complex organ composed of an epithelium layer covering the mantle surface, muscle, connective tissue, and nerve fibers (Waller <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1980</xref>). It is possible that the large amount of cytoskeletal protein and the pigments in the mantle affected the separation of nuclei.</p><p>HeLa cells are epithelial cells derived from cervical cancer cells (Scherer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1953</xref>). We used HeLa nuclear extracts for in vitro transcription as a substitute for <italic>Pinctada fucata</italic> nuclear extracts. In eukaryotic cells, promoters have been proven to be functional across species. For example, the TATA sequence of the octopine-type T-DNA (TC7) is functional in the in vitro transcription system using HeLa nuclear extracts (Yamaguchi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1998</xref>). Promoters from <italic>Drosophila</italic> heat shock proteins and cytomegalovirus are capable of driving the expression of introduced genes in embryos of the oyster <italic>Crassostrea gigas</italic> (Cadoret et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1997</xref>).</p><p>We examined the promoter activity of the nacrein gene in an in vitro transcription system using HeLa nuclear extracts. The addition of human c-jun protein to the in vitro transcription system increased the amount of transcript from the nacrein promoter. The amount of the 500-nt transcript (corresponding to the region between a putative transcription start site to an <italic>Eco</italic>RI site in the first intron) increased dependent on the amount of c-jun added. Deletion analysis showed that c-jun functions through the putative AP1 binding site located at &#8722;830&#160;bp. These results suggest that the AP1 binding site and the TATA box of the nacrein gene are functional in an in vitro transcription system using Hela nuclear extracts.</p><p>C-jun functions as a transcription factor and forms a homo dimer or a hetero dimer with c-Fos, to form the transcription factor AP1 (Kerppola and Curran <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1995</xref>; Angel and Karin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1991</xref>). Accordingly, the results of the in vitro transcription experiments suggested that transcription of the nacrein gene is activated through transcription factor c-jun, which forms a homo dimer. It is expected that c-jun functions as a hetero dimer with c-Fos in vivo. Our results also show that this in vitro transcription system is functional between vertebrate and invertebrate animals.</p><p>In the mantle epithelium, nacrein mRNA is actively transcribed and translated. After translation, the signal peptide causes the secretion of nacrein from the mantle epithelium. The synergistic interaction between the promoter and a transcriptional regulatory element, such as an enhancer, regulates this transcription. The nacrein promoter is the first promoter from a gene that controls hard tissue formation of mollusk shells to be reported.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Open Access</title><p>This article is
