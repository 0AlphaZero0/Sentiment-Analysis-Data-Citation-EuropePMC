</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CAs are widely distributed in all living things, from eukaryotes to prokaryotes, and play an important role in acid–base balance, ion transport, and maintenance of ionic concentration (Cameron 1979; Forster et al. 1986; Henry 1984, 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There are at least five distinct CA gene families: α, β, γ, δ, and ε (So et al. 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The similarity of the amino acid sequences among these proteins is not high. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the animal kingdom, previously reported CAs are composed of a single gene, the so-called α-carbonic anhydrase (Hewett-Emmett and Tashian 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In mammals, at least 15 different α-CA isozymes have been described; they can be divided into five subgroups by their localizations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Five families (CAI, CAII, CAIII, CAVII, and CAXIII) are cytosolic; others are membrane-bound (CAIV, CAIX, CAXII, CAXV, and CAXIV), mitochondrial (CAVA and CAVB), or secreted (CAVI). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The three isoforms that lack CA activity are also known as CA-related proteins (CAVIII, CAX, and CAXI). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These CAs show tissue-specific distribution (Tashian 1989; Pastorekova et al. 2004). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CA also participates in biomineralization and is an essential enzyme of calcification (Freeman 1960; Bensch 1984; Kakei and Nakahara 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In the biomineralization of bivalves, there is a correlation between CA activity and larval shell developmental steps (Medaković 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CA is an important marker of biomineralization during early shell formation in the European abalone Haliotis tuberculata, Linnaeus (Gaume et al. 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The mantle of the mollusk shell contains CA activity (Wilbur and Jodrey 1955; Yu et al. 2006; Medaković 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>It is believed that the CA of mantle epithelia facilitates the secretion of HCO3− required for this calcification (Boer and Witteveen 1980). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Nacrein was first discovered as a carbonic anhydrase in the hard tissue of the bivalve pearl oyster Pinctada fucata (Miyamoto et al. 1996; Miyashita et al. 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Nacrein is composed of two functional domains: a carbonic anhydrase domain and the Gly-Xaa-Asn (Xaa = Asp, Asn, or Glu) repeat (Miyamoto et al. 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Homologs of nacrein were subsequently discovered: the carbonic anhydrase termed N66 (Kono et al. 2000) from Pinctada maxim and a carbonic anhydrase of the gastropod Turbo marmoratus (Miyamoto et al. 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The amino acid sequence of the repeat domain of nacrein and N66 are similar, except for a long NG repeat in N66. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, most of the repeat domain of Turbo marmoratus enzyme is composed of an NG repeat. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In vitro experiments showed that N66 strongly inhibited the crystallization of CaCO3 in the free state (Kono et al. 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In nacrein, the repeat domain participates in the inhibition of the calcium carbonate precipitation and crystal growth (Miyamoto et al. 2005). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In addition to the carbonic anhydrases mentioned above, there are some reports of carbonic anhydrases that are involved in hard tissue formation of invertebrates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Proteins were extracted with 0.5 M EDTA from the organic matrix spicules of the alcyonarian, Synularia polydactyla, and it is reported that two proteins (83 and 63 kDa) among them had carbonic anhydrase activity and calcium binding capability (Rahman et al. 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Calcium-binding carbonic anhydrases were identified from the nacre-soluble matrix in the freshwater mussel Unio pictorum (Marie et al. 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>It is speculated that this enzyme might participate in the calcification process and may have a structure similar to that of nacrein. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The 1.3 kbp 5′ flanking sequence of the human CAII gene has strong promoter activity in renal tubular cells, and this region contains a putative transcription factor AP1 binding element (Lai et al. 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) is essential for osteoclast activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>CAII in osteoclasts is transcriptionally up-regulated by a c-Fos/AP-1 transcription factor (David et al. 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the promoter of a tumor-associated isoenzyme MN/CAIX (MN) is also activated by AP1 (Kaluzova et al. 2001). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Nacrein was the first carbonic anhydrase to be discovered in the nacreous layer of Pinctada fucata (Miyamoto et al. 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>It was later shown to be expressed in the prismatic layer (Miyashita et al. 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Nacrein contains two functional domains, a carbonic anhydrase and a Gly-Xaa-Asn repeat domain (Xaa = Asp, Asn, or Glu). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>N66 is a homolog of nacrein of Pinctada maxima, and in vitro experiments have shown that N66 strongly inhibits the crystallization of CaCO3 in the free state (Kono et al. 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Detailed analysis showed that nacrein prevents crystal formation via an interaction between the Gly-Xaa-Asn repeat and certain crystal faces (Miyamoto et al. 2005). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Nacrein mRNA is transcribed actively in the mantle epithelium (Miyamoto et al. 2005; Takeuchi and Endo 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>In this study, Northern blot analysis was performed for other tissues in addition to the mantle epithelium, and the nacrein gene was demonstrated to be transcribed in the adductor muscle, the liver, and the foot at high levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>The expression was also observed in the gill, though at a low level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Recently, the correlation between the transcription of the chicken type II procollagen gene and the translation of the mRNA was reported. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>In this report, although the mRNA was expressed in multiple tissues, the protein was only detected in chondrogenic cartilage, vitreous body, and cornea (Caixia et al. 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Thus, the presence of the mRNA in the different tissues does not mean that the protein is necessarily expressed there. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, if nacrein is expressed in these tissues, it might play an important role in acid–base balance, ion transport, or maintenance of ionic concentration in the adductor muscle and gill. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Carbonic anhydrase II is necessary for osteoclast differentiation, and its transcription is activated by c-Fos/AP-1 (David et al. 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>A tumor-associated carbonic anhydrase MN/CA9 (MN) gene is also activated by transcription factor AP1 (Kaluzova et al. 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>The 5′-flanking region of the nacrein gene contains a putative AP1 binding site, in addition to a TATA box (ATAAAT) and possible CCAAT box (CCACT). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>To examine the promoter activity, we tried to isolate nuclei from the mantle of Pinctada fucata to prepare nuclear extracts for in vitro transcription. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, we failed to isolate good quality nuclei. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>This failure may have been due to the special structure of the mantle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>The mantle is a complex organ composed of an epithelium layer covering the mantle surface, muscle, connective tissue, and nerve fibers (Waller 1980). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>It is possible that the large amount of cytoskeletal protein and the pigments in the mantle affected the separation of nuclei. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>HeLa cells are epithelial cells derived from cervical cancer cells (Scherer et al. 1953). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>We used HeLa nuclear extracts for in vitro transcription as a substitute for Pinctada fucata nuclear extracts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>In eukaryotic cells, promoters have been proven to be functional across species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>For example, the TATA sequence of the octopine-type T-DNA (TC7) is functional in the in vitro transcription system using HeLa nuclear extracts (Yamaguchi et al. 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Promoters from Drosophila heat shock proteins and cytomegalovirus are capable of driving the expression of introduced genes in embryos of the oyster Crassostrea gigas (Cadoret et al. 1997). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>We examined the promoter activity of the nacrein gene in an in vitro transcription system using HeLa nuclear extracts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>The addition of human c-jun protein to the in vitro transcription system increased the amount of transcript from the nacrein promoter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>The amount of the 500-nt transcript (corresponding to the region between a putative transcription start site to an EcoRI site in the first intron) increased dependent on the amount of c-jun added. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Deletion analysis showed that c-jun functions through the putative AP1 binding site located at −830 bp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the AP1 binding site and the TATA box of the nacrein gene are functional in an in vitro transcription system using Hela nuclear extracts. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>C-jun functions as a transcription factor and forms a homo dimer or a hetero dimer with c-Fos, to form the transcription factor AP1 (Kerppola and Curran 1995; Angel and Karin 1991). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the results of the in vitro transcription experiments suggested that transcription of the nacrein gene is activated through transcription factor c-jun, which forms a homo dimer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>It is expected that c-jun functions as a hetero dimer with c-Fos in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Our results also show that this in vitro transcription system is functional between vertebrate and invertebrate animals. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>In the mantle epithelium, nacrein mRNA is actively transcribed and translated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>After translation, the signal peptide causes the secretion of nacrein from the mantle epithelium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>The synergistic interaction between the promoter and a transcriptional regulatory element, such as an enhancer, regulates this transcription. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>The nacrein promoter is the first promoter from a gene that controls hard tissue formation of mollusk shells to be reported. </plain></SENT>
