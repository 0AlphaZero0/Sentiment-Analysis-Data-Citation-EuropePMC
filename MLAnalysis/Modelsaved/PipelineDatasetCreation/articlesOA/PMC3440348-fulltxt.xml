One target of particular interest is DPP-IV whose most important substrates are incretins that, among other beneficial effects, stimulates insulin biosynthesis and secretion. Incretins have very short half-lives because of their rapid degradation by DPP-IV and, therefore, inhibiting this enzyme improves glucose homeostasis. As a result, DPP-IV inhibitors are of considerable interest to the pharmaceutical industry. The main goals of this study were <bold>(a)</bold> to develop a virtual screening process to identify potential DPP-IV inhibitors of natural origin; <bold>(b)</bold> to evaluate the reliability of our virtual-screening protocol by experimentally testing the <italic>in vitro</italic> activity of selected natural-product hits; and <bold>(c)</bold> to use the most active hit for predicting derivatives with higher binding affinities for the DPP-IV binding site.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We predicted that 446 out of the 89,165 molecules present in the natural products subset of the ZINC database would inhibit DPP-IV with good ADMET properties. Notably, when these 446 molecules were merged with 2,342 known DPP-IV inhibitors and the resulting set was classified into 50 clusters according to chemical similarity, there were 12 clusters that contained only natural products for which no DPP-IV inhibitory activity has been previously reported. Nine molecules from 7 of these 12 clusters were then selected for <italic>in vitro</italic> activity testing and 7 out of the 9 molecules were shown to inhibit DPP-IV (where the remaining two molecules could not be solubilized, preventing the evaluation of their DPP-IV inhibitory activity). Then, the hit with the highest activity was used as a lead compound in the prediction of more potent derivatives.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>We have demonstrated that our virtual-screening protocol was successful in identifying novel lead compounds for developing more potent DPP-IV inhibitors.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by grants from the Ministerio de Educaci&#243;n y Ciencia of the Spanish Government (AGL2011-25831/ALI and AGL2011-23879/ALI) and the ACC1&#211; (TECCT11-1-0012) program (Generalitat de Catalunya).

While current T2DM therapies that increase insulin secretion have proven to have beneficial therapeutic effects, these treatments often suffer from undesirable side effects such as hypoglycemia and weight gain <xref rid="pone.0044971-Havale1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Therefore, there is a significant unmet medical need for better drugs to treat T2DM.</p><p>Recently, the inhibition of human dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV; EC 3.4.14.5) has emerged as a new treatment option for T2DM <xref rid="pone.0044971-Yazbeck1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. This enzyme belongs to the serine protease family and selectively removes N-terminal dipeptides from substrates containing proline or alanine as the second residue. The most important substrates of DPP-IV are incretins, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) <xref rid="pone.0044971-Mentlein1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. GLP-1 is released from intestinal L-cells in response to meals and performs the following actions: GLP-1 stimulates insulin biosynthesis and secretion, reduces glucagon release, slows gastric emptying, reduces appetite, and stimulates the regeneration and differentiation of islet B-cells <xref rid="pone.0044971-Brubaker1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Alternatively, GIP is produced by the duodenal K-cells and is extensively involved in glucose metabolism by enhancing insulin secretion <xref rid="pone.0044971-Meier1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Both peptides have very short half-lives (4 min for GIP and only 1&#8211;2 min for GLP-1) because of their rapid degradation by DPP-IV. Inhibiting DPP-IV prolongs the action of GLP-1 and GIP, which, in turn, improves glucose homeostasis with a lower risk of hypoglycemia. Consequently, DPP-IV inhibitors are of considerable interest to the pharmaceutical industry <xref rid="pone.0044971-Demuth1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and intense research activities in this area have resulted in the launch of sitagliptin, saxagliptin, alogliptin, linagliptin and vildagliptin to the market <xref rid="pone.0044971-Mendieta1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>The DPP-IV binding site is highly druggable in the sense that tight and specific binding to the enzyme can be achieved with small molecules with drug-like physicochemical properties <xref rid="pone.0044971-Kuhn1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044971-Zettl1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The different interaction motifs used by these DPP-IV ligands include Ser630 (that together with Asp708 and His740 form the enzyme catalytic triad), the hydrophobic S1 pocket (formed by Tyr631, Val656, Trp659, Tyr662, Tyr666 and Val711), the hydrophobic S2 pocket (formed by Arg125, Phe357, Arg358, Tyr547, Pro550 and Asn710) and the N-terminal recognition region (formed by Glu205, Glu206 and Tyr662) <xref rid="pone.0044971-Kuhn1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044971-Aertgeerts1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Based on the analysis of the DPP-IV crystal structures <xref rid="pone.0044971-Edmondson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0044971-Nordhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and interpretation of the structure-activity relationship (SAR) data, both the lipophilic S1 pocket and the Glu205/Glu206 dyad can be considered as crucial molecular anchors for DPP-IV inhibition <xref rid="pone.0044971-Kuhn1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>The large scaffold diversity and properties of natural products (NPs), such as structural complexity and drug similarity, makes these molecules ideal starting points for drug design. The main goal of this paper is to apply a virtual screening (VS) protocol to identify NPs with DPP-IV inhibitory activity as well as different scaffolds relative to known DPP-IV inhibitors that could be used as lead compounds in drug-design. In order to achieve this goal, we first identified complexes between DPP-IV and potent reversible inhibitors of non-peptide nature in the PDB. After validating the fit of the coordinates of binding site residues and inhibitors onto the corresponding electron density map, the validated DPP-IV complexes were overlapped to get the experimental poses of the inhibitor in the same orientation. Subsequently, the relative contribution of the different intermolecular interactions to the protein-ligand binding affinity was quantified to derive structure-based pharmacophores. The resulting energetically optimized pharmacophores were used to derive a structure-based common pharmacophore that contained key intermolecular interactions between DPP-IV and the inhibitors. The exclusion volumes were also determined and added to the pharmacophore. Then, the previous structure-based pharmacophore and a VS protocol were used to look for DPP-IV inhibitors in a NPs database <xref rid="pone.0044971-Irwin1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, and the reliability of the prediction was demonstrated using <italic>in vitro</italic> testing to determine the DPP-IV inhibitory effects of representative VS hits. Lastly, the hit with the highest activity was used as a lead compound in a combinatorial screen for the prediction of more potent DPP-IV inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Common Structure-based Pharmacophore Building and Description</title><p>There are currently 54 entries for DPP-IV in the Protein Data Bank (PDB; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pdb.org">http://www.pdb.org</ext-link>; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0044971-t001">Table 1</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0044971-Berman1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> but only 10 of those entries correspond to validated complexes of the native enzyme with potent reversible inhibitors of a non-peptide nature (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044971-g001">Figure 1</xref>). As a result, only these 10 entries are suitable for deriving reliable structure-based pharmacophores that capture the key intermolecular interactions needed for drugs to inhibit DPP-IV. In order to define a common background for DPP-IV inhibition, we identified features of inhibitors that make the most important contributions to the bioactivity of the ligand by first superposing all 10 PDB files. Then, the energetic pharmacophores were derived from the resulting coordinates, and energetically relevant pharmacophore sites were visually inspected for finding common or frequent ones. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044971-g002">Figure 2</xref> shows that all 10 pharmacophores have two sites in common (one positive/donor and one hydrophobic/aromatic ring) that often make the most important contribution to the protein-ligand binding affinity (see data for sites <bold>P/D</bold> and <bold>H/R1</bold> in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0044971-t002">Table 2</xref>). From these data, we inferred that these two sites are essential for the inhibition of DPP-IV and considered them to be required in the common structure-based pharmacophore (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044971-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, previous studies have identified the lipophilic S1 pocket (formed by Tyr631, Val656, Trp659, Tyr662, Tyr666 and Val711) and the Glu205/Glu206 dyad as crucial molecular anchors for inhibition <xref rid="pone.0044971-Kuhn1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044971-Almasri1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044971-Ward1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and, in coherence with this, the mandatory hydrophobic/aromatic ring and positive/donor sites interact with the S1 pocket and Glu205/Glu206, respectively. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0044971-t002">Table 2</xref> also shows that there are two other hydrogen-bond acceptors (<bold>A1</bold> and <bold>A2</bold>) and three hydrophobic/aromatic ring sites (<bold>H/R2</bold>, <bold>H/R3</bold> and <bold>H/R4</bold>) that, although not common to all experimental poses, could increase either protein-ligand binding affinity or drug-specificity. Moreover, it is remarkable that these sites correspond to interactions with other relevant areas from the DPP-IV binding site. For example, the <bold>H/R2</bold> site interacts with Phe357, Arg358 and Tyr547 in the S2 pocket (known to preferentially recognize large hydrophobic and aromatic side chains <xref rid="pone.0044971-Aertgeerts1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>).

To prove the reliability of our predictions, we selected 9 molecules (<bold>C1</bold> and <bold>C2</bold> from cluster 30, <bold>C3</bold> from cluster 36, <bold>C4</bold> from cluster 37, <bold>C5</bold> and <bold>C6</bold> from cluster 41, <bold>C7</bold> from cluster 45, <bold>C8</bold> from cluster 49 and <bold>C9</bold> from cluster 50) from 7 of these 12 clusters (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044971-g005">Figure 5</xref>) and tested their effects on the DPP-IV activity using an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay.

The remaining molecules, <bold>C4</bold> and <bold>C6</bold>, could not be solubilized, preventing the evaluation of their DPP-IV inhibitory activity. The lack of DPP-IV inhibitory activity for <bold>C5</bold>, <bold>C7</bold> and <bold>C9</bold> at 1mM was also due to insolubility (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044971-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044971-g006">Figure 6</xref> shows that from all the tested molecules, <bold>C5</bold> is the most potent inhibitor with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 61.55 &#181;M (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044971-g007">Figure 7</xref>). With the exception of <bold>C1</bold>, which significantly inhibited DPP-IV only at 1 mM, the rest of the molecules significantly inhibit DPP-IV at 0.25 mM (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044971-g006">Figure 6</xref>) showing a dose-response effect.

Finally, the chromene ring of the 7-hydroxy-2H-chromen-2-one moiety forms &#960;-&#960; interactions with Phe357. Interestingly, this interaction with Phe357 has been shown to be directly related to the increased potency of synthetic DPP-IV inhibitors relative to those that lack this interaction <xref rid="pone.0044971-Edmondson2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044971-Biftu1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044971-Andrews1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0044971-Qiao1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.

Moreover, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044971.s003">Table S3</xref> also shows that all of the substituents that have replaced the original <bold>C5</bold> butyl group (<italic>i.e.</italic>, at the <bold>H/R1</bold> site) have a common positive formal charge that, according to results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044971-g009">Figure 9</xref>, allows them to form &#960;-cation interactions with two of the aromatic residues in the S1 pocket (<italic>i.e.</italic>, Tyr662 and Tyr666). Additionally, some of the substituents at this location (<italic>i.e.</italic>, <bold>97</bold> in <bold>C5-97-786</bold>, <bold>100</bold> in <bold>C5-100-563</bold> and <bold>274</bold> in <bold>C5-274-536</bold>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044971.s003">Table S3</xref>) also aid in increasing the protein-ligand binding affinity by enclosing the two sides of the corresponding ring in the lipophilic protein environment in the S1 pocket (results not shown). Furthermore, all substituents at the <bold>H/R2</bold> site (except the one in <bold>C5-309-787</bold>) are able to make hydrogen bonds either with the S2 pocket residue Arg358 (<italic>i.e.</italic>, <bold>786</bold> in <bold>C5-97-786</bold>, <bold>784</bold> in <bold>C5-137-784</bold> and <bold>563</bold> in <bold>C5-100-563</bold>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044971-g009">Figures 9B, 9C and 9D</xref>) or with Arg669 (<italic>i.e.</italic>, <bold>536</bold> in <bold>C5-274-536</bold>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044971-g009">Figures 9F</xref>). The <bold>786</bold> substituent in <bold>C5-97-786</bold> is also able to make a hydrogen bond with the Ser209 side chain (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044971-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). Remarkably, there are SAR studies with a structurally distinct series of DPP-IV inhibitors that show <bold>(1)</bold> a 4-fold loss of potency when substituents that interact with the side chains of Ser209 and Arg358 are removed <xref rid="pone.0044971-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <bold>(2)</bold> a 2-fold increase in inhibition when a carboxylic acid that interacts with Arg358 is introduced <xref rid="pone.0044971-Qiao1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, and <bold>(3)</bold> a 6-fold increase in inhibition when a 3-pyridyl group that interacts with Ser209 is introduced <xref rid="pone.0044971-Wallace1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.

Furthermore, these 7 molecules were selected based on their commercial availability, cost and purity with the primary goal of testing the performance of our VS protocol.
