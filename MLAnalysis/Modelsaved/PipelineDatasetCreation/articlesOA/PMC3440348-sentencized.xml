</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There has been great interest in determining whether natural products show biological activity toward protein targets of pharmacological relevance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One target of particular interest is DPP-IV whose most important substrates are incretins that, among other beneficial effects, stimulates insulin biosynthesis and secretion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Incretins have very short half-lives because of their rapid degradation by DPP-IV and, therefore, inhibiting this enzyme improves glucose homeostasis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As a result, DPP-IV inhibitors are of considerable interest to the pharmaceutical industry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The main goals of this study were (a) to develop a virtual screening process to identify potential DPP-IV inhibitors of natural origin; (b) to evaluate the reliability of our virtual-screening protocol by experimentally testing the in vitro activity of selected natural-product hits; and (c) to use the most active hit for predicting derivatives with higher binding affinities for the DPP-IV binding site. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Notably, when these 446 molecules were merged with 2,342 known DPP-IV inhibitors and the resulting set was classified into 50 clusters according to chemical similarity, there were 12 clusters that contained only natural products for which no DPP-IV inhibitory activity has been previously reported. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Nine molecules from 7 of these 12 clusters were then selected for in vitro activity testing and 7 out of the 9 molecules were shown to inhibit DPP-IV (where the remaining two molecules could not be solubilized, preventing the evaluation of their DPP-IV inhibitory activity). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is considered to be the “epidemic of the 21st century” and, consequently, the development of new therapies is one of the main challenges in drug discovery today [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>While current T2DM therapies that increase insulin secretion have proven to have beneficial therapeutic effects, these treatments often suffer from undesirable side effects such as hypoglycemia and weight gain [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Therefore, there is a significant unmet medical need for better drugs to treat T2DM. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Recently, the inhibition of human dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV; EC 3.4.14.5) has emerged as a new treatment option for T2DM [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>This enzyme belongs to the serine protease family and selectively removes N-terminal dipeptides from substrates containing proline or alanine as the second residue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The most important substrates of DPP-IV are incretins, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 is released from intestinal L-cells in response to meals and performs the following actions: GLP-1 stimulates insulin biosynthesis and secretion, reduces glucagon release, slows gastric emptying, reduces appetite, and stimulates the regeneration and differentiation of islet B-cells [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, GIP is produced by the duodenal K-cells and is extensively involved in glucose metabolism by enhancing insulin secretion [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Both peptides have very short half-lives (4 min for GIP and only 1–2 min for GLP-1) because of their rapid degradation by DPP-IV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Inhibiting DPP-IV prolongs the action of GLP-1 and GIP, which, in turn, improves glucose homeostasis with a lower risk of hypoglycemia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Consequently, DPP-IV inhibitors are of considerable interest to the pharmaceutical industry [7], and intense research activities in this area have resulted in the launch of sitagliptin, saxagliptin, alogliptin, linagliptin and vildagliptin to the market [8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The DPP-IV binding site is highly druggable in the sense that tight and specific binding to the enzyme can be achieved with small molecules with drug-like physicochemical properties [9], [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The different interaction motifs used by these DPP-IV ligands include Ser630 (that together with Asp708 and His740 form the enzyme catalytic triad), the hydrophobic S1 pocket (formed by Tyr631, Val656, Trp659, Tyr662, Tyr666 and Val711), the hydrophobic S2 pocket (formed by Arg125, Phe357, Arg358, Tyr547, Pro550 and Asn710) and the N-terminal recognition region (formed by Glu205, Glu206 and Tyr662) [9], [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Based on the analysis of the DPP-IV crystal structures [12]–[18] and interpretation of the structure-activity relationship (SAR) data, both the lipophilic S1 pocket and the Glu205/Glu206 dyad can be considered as crucial molecular anchors for DPP-IV inhibition [9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The large scaffold diversity and properties of natural products (NPs), such as structural complexity and drug similarity, makes these molecules ideal starting points for drug design. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The main goal of this paper is to apply a virtual screening (VS) protocol to identify NPs with DPP-IV inhibitory activity as well as different scaffolds relative to known DPP-IV inhibitors that could be used as lead compounds in drug-design. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>In order to achieve this goal, we first identified complexes between DPP-IV and potent reversible inhibitors of non-peptide nature in the PDB. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>After validating the fit of the coordinates of binding site residues and inhibitors onto the corresponding electron density map, the validated DPP-IV complexes were overlapped to get the experimental poses of the inhibitor in the same orientation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the relative contribution of the different intermolecular interactions to the protein-ligand binding affinity was quantified to derive structure-based pharmacophores. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The resulting energetically optimized pharmacophores were used to derive a structure-based common pharmacophore that contained key intermolecular interactions between DPP-IV and the inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The exclusion volumes were also determined and added to the pharmacophore. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Then, the previous structure-based pharmacophore and a VS protocol were used to look for DPP-IV inhibitors in a NPs database [19], and the reliability of the prediction was demonstrated using in vitro testing to determine the DPP-IV inhibitory effects of representative VS hits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Lastly, the hit with the highest activity was used as a lead compound in a combinatorial screen for the prediction of more potent DPP-IV inhibitors. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><sec id="s2a"><title><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Common Structure-based Pharmacophore Building and Description </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>There are currently 54 entries for DPP-IV in the Protein Data Bank (PDB; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pdb.org">http://www.pdb.org</ext-link>; see Table 1) [20] but only 10 of those entries correspond to validated complexes of the native enzyme with potent reversible inhibitors of a non-peptide nature (see Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>As a result, only these 10 entries are suitable for deriving reliable structure-based pharmacophores that capture the key intermolecular interactions needed for drugs to inhibit DPP-IV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>In order to define a common background for DPP-IV inhibition, we identified features of inhibitors that make the most important contributions to the bioactivity of the ligand by first superposing all 10 PDB files. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Then, the energetic pharmacophores were derived from the resulting coordinates, and energetically relevant pharmacophore sites were visually inspected for finding common or frequent ones. Figure 2 shows that all 10 pharmacophores have two sites in common (one positive/donor and one hydrophobic/aromatic ring) that often make the most important contribution to the protein-ligand binding affinity (see data for sites P/D and H/R1 in Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>From these data, we inferred that these two sites are essential for the inhibition of DPP-IV and considered them to be required in the common structure-based pharmacophore (see Figure 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, previous studies have identified the lipophilic S1 pocket (formed by Tyr631, Val656, Trp659, Tyr662, Tyr666 and Val711) and the Glu205/Glu206 dyad as crucial molecular anchors for inhibition [9], [21], [22] and, in coherence with this, the mandatory hydrophobic/aromatic ring and positive/donor sites interact with the S1 pocket and Glu205/Glu206, respectively. Table 2 also shows that there are two other hydrogen-bond acceptors (A1 and A2) and three hydrophobic/aromatic ring sites (H/R2, H/R3 and H/R4) that, although not common to all experimental poses, could increase either protein-ligand binding affinity or drug-specificity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it is remarkable that these sites correspond to interactions with other relevant areas from the DPP-IV binding site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>For example, the H/R2 site interacts with Phe357, Arg358 and Tyr547 in the S2 pocket (known to preferentially recognize large hydrophobic and aromatic side chains [11]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these sites were also included as optional sites in the common structure-based pharmacophore (see Figure 3). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that our pharmacophore is able to capture all of the essential features for an inhibitor interaction with the DPP-IV binding-site, which would explain why all of the assayed molecules show activity as DPP-IV inhibitors (see Figure 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the analysis in Table S2 shows that C5 activity can be improved if (1) its butyl group matching the H/R1 site is replaced by a group that is able to interact with the lipophilic atoms of the S1 pocket either by producing the so-called hydrophobic enclosure reward (that would consist of enclosing the two sides of the substituent –at a 180° angle– on the hydrophobic environment of the S1 pocket) or by making π-cation interactions with the aromatic side chains in this pocket and (2) groups that match the H/R2 site (optional in our pharmacophore but present in half of the ligands used to derive the pharmacophore; see Table 2) and that are able to make hydrophobically packed correlated H-bonds are added to C5. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Additionally, some of the substituents at this location (i.e., 97 in C5-97-786, 100 in C5-100-563 and 274 in C5-274-536; see Table S3) also aid in increasing the protein-ligand binding affinity by enclosing the two sides of the corresponding ring in the lipophilic protein environment in the S1 pocket (results not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, all substituents at the H/R2 site (except the one in C5-309-787) are able to make hydrogen bonds either with the S2 pocket residue Arg358 (i.e., 786 in C5-97-786, 784 in C5-137-784 and 563 in C5-100-563; see Figures 9B, 9C and 9D) or with Arg669 (i.e., 536 in C5-274-536; see Figures 9F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>The 786 substituent in C5-97-786 is also able to make a hydrogen bond with the Ser209 side chain (see Figure 9B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, there are SAR studies with a structurally distinct series of DPP-IV inhibitors that show (1) a 4-fold loss of potency when substituents that interact with the side chains of Ser209 and Arg358 are removed [28], (2) a 2-fold increase in inhibition when a carboxylic acid that interacts with Arg358 is introduced [27], and (3) a 6-fold increase in inhibition when a 3-pyridyl group that interacts with Ser209 is introduced [29]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is possible that there are other molecules among the remaining 210 molecules in clusters 10, 29, 30, 36, 37, 38, 40, 41, 44, 45, 49 and 50 (see Table S1) that could be better starting points than C5 for the rational drug design of potent and selective DPP-IV inhibitors with new chemical scaffolds. </plain></SENT>
