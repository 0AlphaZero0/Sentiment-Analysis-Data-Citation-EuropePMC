</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of membrane proteins are anchored to biological membranes through hydrophobic α-helices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These transmembrane (TM) α-helices, rather than serving solely as featureless hydrophobic stretches required for anchorage of proteins in membranes, have structural and/or functional roles well beyond this canonical capacity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In fact, the folding and assembly of membrane proteins rely in part on interacting TM helices, which was conceptualized as a two-stage process [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the first stage, TM helices are inserted into the membrane by the translocon. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The driving force for this process derives primarily from the transfer of hydrophobic side chains from the aqueous channel of the translocon to the apolar region of the bilayer [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In the second stage, the protein attains its native tertiary structure through the packing of its TM helices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In the apolar environment of the membrane core, van der Waals packing, hydrogen bonding and ionic interactions are the dominant contributors to TM helix packing. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of high-resolution membrane protein structures show that ionizable amino acid residues are present in TM helices, although at a low frequency level [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Insertion of these residues through the translocon has been proved to be feasible thanks to the overall hydrophobicity of the TM segment [4] and depending on their position along the hydrophobic region [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In many cases, ionizable residues are involved in TM helix packing [6], [7], [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Likely, hydrogen bonding [6], [7] or salt-bridge [9] formation with other membrane-spanning hydrophilic residues drives these interactions, while at the same time, reduces the unfavorable energetics of inserting polar or ionizable residues into the hydrophobic membrane core. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Homo-oligomeric membrane proteins provide attractive systems for the study of TM helix packing because of their symmetry and relative simplicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>These model systems can serve as an excellent starting point to understand the structural dynamics and folding pathways of larger membrane proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>One of the best-suited models of membrane protein that oligomerizes (more specifically, dimerizes) through non-covalent interactions of its TM α-helix is undoubtedly glycophorin A (GpA) [10], [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The wide use of this protein as a model membrane protein is partially based on its intrinsic simplicity, since the free energy decrease associated with TM helix-helix interactions is enough to confer detergent resistant dimerization to the protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Thus, those factors that could affect or modify the dimerization process can be analyzed using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-PAGE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The GpA homodimer, defines a dimerization interface that has been extensively studied by diverse techniques such as saturation mutagenesis [12] and alanine-insertion scanning [13] in SDS micelles, solution NMR in dodecyl phosphocholine micelles [14] and solid-state NMR in lipid membranes [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The output of these studies describes a dimerization motif in the TM segment composed of seven residues, L75IxxGVxxGVxxT87, which is responsible for the dimerization process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>More recently, using proline-scanning mutagenesis it was demonstrated that Leu75 is not so cleanly involved in the packing process [16], focusing the interaction on the central G79VxxGVxxT87 motif, which includes the widely proved framework for TM helix association, GxxxG [17], [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the sequence context highly determines the thermodynamic stability of GxxxG-mediated TM helix-helix interactions (recently reviewed [19]). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have analyzed the distribution of ionizable (Asp, Glu, Lys and Arg) amino acid residues in TM segments from high-resolution membrane protein structures, which have to energetically accommodate into the highly hydrophobic core of biological membranes by interacting favorably with its local environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Then, we address the consequences of replacing specific residues by ionizable amino acids along the hydrophobic region of the GpA TM domain on the dimerization of this model membrane protein, both in detergent micelles and in biological membranes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrate that ionizable residues are stably inserted in hydrophobic environments, and tolerated in the dimerization process when oriented toward the lipid face, emphasizing the complexity of protein-lipids interactions in biological membranes. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>TM helices of lengths between 17 and 38 residues were selected from the MPTOPO database [20], which included helical segments that do completely span the hydrophobic core of the membrane. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>TM helices shorter than 17 residues as well as larger than 38 residues were excluded since they may not cross entirely the membrane or may contain segments parallel to the membrane [3], respectively. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>As expected, ionizable residues (Asp, Glu, Lys, and Arg) are present at a low frequency level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>All together, these residues constitute only 6.6% of the residues within TM helices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Despite their lower presence, strongly polar residues are evolutionary conserved in TM proteins, which can be partially explained by their tendency to be buried in the protein interior and also in many cases due to their direct involvement in the function of the protein [21], [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Among the 792 TM helices included in our database, 366 helices (46.2%) contained at least one ionizable residue within the hydrophobic region (that is, the central 19 amino acid residues). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>A summary of the statistics is presented in Figure 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 96 TM helices contained at least one acidic plus one basic residue in their sequence, and 20 of these helices present oppositely charged residues with the appropriate periodicity (i, i+4) to form intrahelical charge pairs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>To gain more detailed insight into the structural role of these ionizable residues within the membrane core, we analyzed the environment of all these 20 helices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Approximately half of the ionizable residues (51%) found in these helices are buried in the protein interior, but the rest are partly exposed to the lipid face. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Some of these lipid facing ionizable residues are located in pairs at the appropriate distance to form a salt-bridge, as in the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 1 protein (Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Next, we investigated the effect of strongly polar residues in TM helix packing using the GpA TM segment as a model (scaffold) segment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Initial polar mutations (T87D, T87K, I91D, and I91K) made on residues located at the helix-helix interface (Fig. 3A) abolished dimerization (Fig. 3B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it has been reported that T87S (which retains the side chain γ oxygen) permits dimer formation both in SDS micelles [23] and in E. coli membranes [24], whereas a bulkier hydroxylated side chain (T87Y) is strongly disruptive (Fig. 3B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>However, point mutations corresponding to replacements of nonpolar residues located at the lipid-facing interface (Fig. 3A) by ionizable residues gave rise to a more tolerated response (Fig. 3B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>When Ile85 was substituted by ionizable side-chain residues, either negatively charged (I85D) or positively charged (I85K and I85R), the dimerization level was similar to native GpA TM sequence as shown under SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 2, 3 and 4 to lane 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>It is commonly assumed that single ionizable residues should exist in their uncharged form within membrane-spanning helices [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>In fact, the pK a values observed for Asp residues in hydrophobic helices were somewhat elevated (5–8.5) relative to those for Asp residues in solution [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the replacement of Leu89 by basic residues (L89K and L89R) had almost no effect, while its substitution by an acidic residue (L89D) abolished dimerization (Fig. 3B and 3C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The opposing consequences observed for Leu89 mutants can be explained taking into account the nature of the SDS-micelles used in these experimental conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that L89D mutation alters the interaction of the protein with the negatively charged detergent micelle, possibly resulting in a structure that differs from a ‘transmicellar’ α-helix due to helix distortions and interaction with the polar micelle surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>This effect was not observed when the Asp residue was located in a more central position (I85D), where its carboxylate should be located away from the negatively charged sulfate groups of the SDS molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>In this regard, the capacity of SDS to respond to such nuance of sequence in terms of SDS solvation of TM segments within protein-SDS detergent complexes has been proved to be highly sequence (position) dependent [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the comparable electrophoretic migration observed for I85D and L89D (Fig. 3C) suggests that the monomers associate with SDS quite similarly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>To identify the helix interface responsible of dimer formation in the Leu89 mutants, we designed double mutants that contained a non-polar highly disruptive mutation (G83L). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Gly83 has been proved to be extremely sensitive, since all mutations tested disrupted the dimer completely [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>As shown in Fig. 3B, G83L mutant did not form any detectable dimer, and both double mutant proteins (G83L/L89K and G83L/L89D) containing this mutation did not dimerized, suggesting that the lysine residue introduced was not participating in the dimerization process, instead, the native dimerization motif is responsible of helix-helix interaction. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>To further assess if intrahelical charge pair formation can be tolerated in dimerizing TM sequences, we performed a double mutation combining two strongly dimerizing sequences (I85D/L89K), which only reduced dimerization by about 50% compared to the wild-type sequence (Fig. 3B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Similarly, I85K/L89K mutant retained the same level of dimerization, likely favored by a beneficial SDS solvation effect on the lysine residues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, when oppositely charged residues were located at the TM-interacting interface (T87D/I91K) dimerization was abrogated (Fig. 3B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, when charge pairs include L89D mutation although facing the lipids, as for I85K/L89D, we found no evidence for dimer formation (Fig. 3B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that charge pairs are tolerated only when located at the non-interacting interface, but solely at specific positions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Recent mutational analysis of strongly self-interacting TM segments demonstrated that basic and acidic residues located at the helix-interacting interface participate in homotypic interactions [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>In this case, basic and acidic residues spaced (i, i+1) and (i, i+2) contribute to the interaction of model TM segments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>To test this idea in the GpA sequence, we designed two mutants with appropriately spaced basic and acidic residues (L89D/I91K and L90D/I91K), and no dimeric forms were observed in any of these proteins. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>In light of our experiments in SDS micelles, it can be concluded that nonpolar to ionizable substitutions away from the dimer interface (lipid facing) in combination with N-terminal native GpA dimerization motif (including GxxxG sequence) does not perturb the dimerization process, while similar mutations positioned at the helix-interacting interface strongly compromise dimer formation. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>To test the molecular effect of the ionizable residues in biological membranes we used a glycosylation mapping technique to measure changes in the insertion capacity of the GpA TM domain after introduction of ionizable residues at the more tolerant positions in terms of TM packing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>The glycosylation mapping technique has been used previously to investigate the membrane insertion level of hydrophobic regions and to systematically examine the effects of individual residues on their position in the membrane [16], [28], [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>The method is based on the observation that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) enzyme oligosaccharide transferase (OST) can only transfer a sugar moiety to Asn-X-Thr/Ser acceptor sites when they are oriented toward the lumen of the ER membrane. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>To assess the effect of the presence of ionizable residues on the GpA TM segment insertion into biological membranes, we located this hydrophobic sequence (Fig. 4A) in place of the second TM fragment of the well-characterized Escherichia coli inner membrane protein leader peptidase (Lep). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Although of bacterial origin, Lep integrates efficiently into dog pancreas microsomes with the same topology as in E. coli [30] (i.e., with both the N- and C-termini exposed to the luminal side of the ER membrane) and the presence of its first TM segment together with the cytoplasmic P1 domain (Figure 4B) is sufficient for proper targeting of chimeric proteins to the eukaryotic membrane [30], [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>An engineered glycosylation site placed at the C-terminal P2 domain is glycosylated efficiently upon correct insertion into the microsomal membrane (Fig. 4B), serving as a reporter to distinguish between a lumenal (glycosylated) and a cytoplasmic (unglycosylated) location. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Glycosylation of the molecule results in an increase in molecular mass of about 2.5 kDa relative to the observed molecular mass of Lep expressed in the absence of microsomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>The efficiency of glycosylation of Lep under standard conditions is 80–90% [31], [32]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, L89K mutation allowed efficient insertion (Fig. 4C, lane 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>The different effect observed for these two mutants can be explained by differences in amino acid side chain size and the position of the residue in relation to the midpoint of the TM sequence (Fig. 4A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Hence, in the case of L89K, the longer side chain of this cationic amino acid and its proximity to the membrane interface compared to I85D may allow the hydrophilic moiety of the lysine residue to snorkel, that is, to approach its ε-amino group toward the interfacial and aqueous region, close to the negatively charged phospholipid head groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Next, a construct with an Asp-Lys pair at the same positions (double mutant I85D/L89K) was glycosylated somewhat more efficiently than the I85D construct (Fig. 4C, lanes 4 and 8), supporting the idea that an intrahelical salt-bridge or hydrogen bond interactions between Lys and Asp side chains located on the same face of a TM helix can facilitate its insertion into biological membranes by reducing the free energy of membrane partitioning, as previously suggested in a similar system [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the predicted insertion frequencies from the biological hydrophobicity scale [2], [5] for these mutants using the ΔG Prediction Server v1.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dgpred.cbr.su.se/">http://dgpred.cbr.su.se/</ext-link>) are shown in Table 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>In this algorithm, the predicted insertion frequency comes from the apparent free-energy difference (ΔGapp) from insertion into ER membranes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>Since very low and very high insertion efficiencies cannot be accurately measured, ΔGapp values outside the interval ±1.5 kcal/mol are only qualitative. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>The positive value of ΔGapp predicted that the tested-sequence is not TM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>The high negative value for the GpA wild-type sequence agrees with our experimentally measured glycosylation data showing the highest insertion efficiency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>A closer analysis of the output data highlighted I85D mutation as precluding TM disposition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Hence, replacing Ile85 with aspartic acid reduced ΔGapp by almost 2 kcal/mol (Table 1), which correlates with our lowest glycosylation efficiency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>However, replacing Leu89 with lysine has a lower energy cost (ΔGapp close to 0) that is reflected by a higher insertion level (Fig. 4C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Finally, the double mutant I85D/L89K results in the highest predicted penalty for TM disposition, whereas experimentally we find no evidence that GpA TM segment is significantly compromised by the presence of two poplar/ionizable residues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Such phenomena points towards an intra-helical interaction between the ionizable residues and should be taken into account to improve TM prediction algorithms. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>This assay uses a chimeric construct composed of the ToxR N-terminal transcriptional activation domain [34] fused to the GpA TM segment and a C-terminal maltose binding protein (MBP) domain (Fig. 5A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>TM-mediated dimerization of the chimera in the E. coli inner membrane results in transcriptional activation of a reporter gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), with the level of CAT protein expression indicating the strength/intensity of TM helix-helix interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>After transformation of these ToxCAT constructs into E. coli NT326 cells, we tested the ability of the wild-type and mutant fusion proteins carrying ionizable residues to complement the malE phenotype of the NT326 strain by growing each construct on plates containing maltose as the sole carbon source. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Cells containing a construct that lack a TM segment do not grow (pccKAN), but the wild-type and all point mutants support growth on maltose (Fig. 5B), indicating that the MBP domains of these chimeric proteins are properly targeted to the periplasm of the NT326 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the expected topology (Fig. 5A) is being achieved by these proteins, in agreement with GpA wild-type and point mutants in ToxR [35] and ToxCAT [33] assays. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, differences in TM segment length and flanking residues sequences (see Fig. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Mutation of Leu89 to lysine (L89K) had a smaller effect on TM dimerization, and double mutant I85D/L89K still retained some dimerization capacity (Fig. 5C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>In agreement with these data, recent molecular dynamics simulations suggested that a lysine residue outside the contact interface could exert a significant influence on TM helix association affinity of the bacteriophage M13 major coat protein because the extent of their burial in the membrane could be different in monomers and dimers [37]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Ionizable amino acid residues are functionally and/or structurally important residues in membrane proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Therefore, although the insertion of such residues into the membrane hydrophobic core may be energetically unfavourable, there is often a functional and/or structural necessity to accommodate them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>In the light of our experiments it can be concluded that nonpolar to ionizable point substitutions at specific positions away from the dimer interface (‘lipid facing’) in combination with a N-terminal GxxxG motif does not preclude neither the dimerization process nor TM helix insertion, while point mutations of nonpolar (or polar nonionizable) to ionizable residues in the ‘helix facing’, e.g. I91D/E, I91K/R, or T87D strongly compromise dimer formation. </plain></SENT>
