</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The European black sea urchin Arbacia lixula (Linnaeus, 1758) is currently one of the most abundant echinoids in shallow rocky habitats of the Mediterranean [1], where it has the potential to greatly influence benthic communities with their grazing activity [2]–[4]. A. lixula has a considerable trophic plasticity, ranging from omnivory to strict carnivory [5] and its scraping predatory behaviour can bulldoze the substrate bare of erect and encrusting algae and sessile animals. A. lixula broadly overlaps its habitat with the common edible sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus (Lamarck, 1816). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Both species are traditionally thought to have the ability to trigger the development of subtidal barren zones of reduced benthic productivity and diversity [6]–[9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>However, new and increasing evidence suggests that A. lixula could actually be playing the principal role in producing and maintaining these barrens [10] and that this trend could be worsening in the near future due to foreseeable climatic changes [11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Arbacia lixula is commonly regarded as a typical native species in the Mediterranean fauna [12], since it is currently found in shallow rocky shores all along the Mediterranean, often at high densities, and has been so since historical times. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>However, its tropical affinities have been suggested for a long time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Based on the lack of Mediterranean fossil record, Stefanini [13] and Mortensen [14] stated that A. lixula (reported as A. pustulosa), probably originated at the Tropical Atlantic region, from where it spread into the Mediterranean. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Kempf [15], Tortonese [16] and Fenaux [17] also considered that A. lixula was a thermophilous species. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In NW Mediterranean, increasing abundances over time have been reported for this species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In 1950, Petit et al. reported that Arbacia lixula had become abundant in Marseilles during the previous 30 years [18], despite Marion had described it as rare in the same area in 1883 [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>More recently, Francour et al. reported a 12–fold increase in the abundance of A. lixula in Corsica over a period of nine years (1983–1992) and speculated that a long term rise in the water temperature could have been the cause for this proliferation [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In the same period (1982 to 1995), a 5-fold increase in A. lixula densities was reported at the Port-Cros Marine Reserve (France) [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in a recent 5-year follow-up (2003–2008) at Ustica Island (Southern Thyrrenian Basin), a positive correlation was found between the gonado-somatic index of adult A. lixula and summer surface water temperature, suggesting increased reproductive potential with temperature [10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Arbacia is an ancient genus with a fossil record that dates back to the Paleocene [22] whose distribution is mainly Neotropical. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Unlike other sea urchin genera, Arbacia has a history of latitudinal shifts [23], and the five extant species inhabit mainly temperate and tropical shallow waters [24], being mostly allopatric. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Only one species, A. dufresnii, is able to live in cold Subantarctic waters. A. lixula is the only species in the genus that lives in the Old World. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Its present distribution includes Brazil, the African Atlantic coast from Morocco to Angola, the East Atlantic archipelagos of Cape Verde, Canaries, Madeira and Azores, and the whole Mediterranean basin, excluding the Black Sea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>It has never been reported from the Atlantic European coast north of Gibraltar (J. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Rodrigues; pers. comms.), probably due to the low sea surface temperature originated by the southward Portugal Current [25]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Recently, Lessios et al. [26] presented an exhaustive phylogenetic study of genus Arbacia, using sequences of the mitochondrial COI (cytochrome c oxidase I) and the nuclear gamete recognition protein bindin, which has clarified many interesting questions on inter-specific relationships within this remarkable genus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Notably, the sequence of speciation events was consistently reconstructed and their divergence times were reliably estimated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Thus, the splitting between A. lixula and its sister species, the NW Atlantic A. punctulata, was estimated to have taken place some 2.2–3.0 Mya (millions years ago) based on COI sequences, or 1.9–3.3 Mya based on bindin sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The phylogeny of bindin sequences also allowed these authors to infer that Brazil populations separated from the rest of A. lixula some 1.8–3.4 Mya; i.e. very early in the evolution of this species (however, only 5 individuals from Brazil were used in the analysis, and no estimation could be inferred for the same event from mitochondrial sequences, due to the unresolved position of the Brazilian clade within other A. lixula haplotypes). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Yet, many questions remain open about the intra-specific relationships of Arbacia lixula. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Considering its unusually wide present distribution area, which ranges from equatorial waters to temperate Mediterranean, the great colonizing potential shown by this species, including the ability to cross trans-oceanic barriers to gene flow [26], and the massive potential impact of its behaviour on coastal ecosystems, further research on its phylogeography and population genetics is necessary in order to elucidate the history and ongoing processes that shape the distribution of the species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="?"><plain>In this work, we present a phylogeographic study using the mitochondrial marker COI, based on a representative sample of individuals covering most of the distribution area of Arbacia lixula. Our goals were to answer relevant questions concerning the history and present-day distribution of the species: What are the relationships between the main geographic areas where the species is found? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="?"><plain>Do the main geographic barriers to gene flow, that are known to regulate the genetic structure of many other marine organisms, affect the present-day genetic structure of this species? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="?"><plain>Can recent geographic and/or population expansion events be traced and reconstructed by analysing the signature left in sequence data of this species? </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>COI and other mitochondrial markers have proven to be the most useful tool for tracing both intraspecific and intrageneric genealogies of many echinoid species [26], [64]–[65], [70]–[73] and usually yield easily interpretable results which are consistent with those of other nuclear markers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, our analyses are based on a single mitochondrial marker (COI). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Thus, these results must be taken with caution, and further analyses using nuclear markers would be desirable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, previous works in Echinoidea have shown that other nuclear markers were mainly used only to confirm the evolutionary history depicted by mtDNA [26], [72] or else displayed too much diversity to produce interpretable results [73]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>The Arbacia lixula populations sampled showed high values of haplotype diversity and haplotype richness, but relatively low values of nucleotide diversity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>The lowest diversity was found in Brazilian populations and, specifically, in the westernmost locality (Itaipu), which is close to the distribution limit of the species and separated from the other Brazilian locality by the Cabo Frio upwelling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the highest diversity was found in the East Atlantic, as expected if this region is the geographical origin of the species [16], [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>We detected three haplogroups in A. lixula. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>One of them (Group A) seems to be ancestral and is found only in Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean populations, while another (Group B) is present at both sides of the Atlantic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>The third one (Group C) is derived from Group B and found only in Brazil. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>In a recent work, Lessios et al. [26] concluded that Arbacia lixula split from a common ancestor with A. punctulata ca. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>2.6 Mya, and attributed this split to the mid-Atlantic barrier, separating the western A. punctulata from the eastern A. lixula, which would later have crossed back this barrier to establish itself, as an isolated clade, in the coast of Brazil. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>A problem with this view is that the mid-Atlantic barrier was fully in place long before the estimated date of the split, so the separation of the two species could not be a vicariance event but a range expansion event (on the part of the lineage that would become A. lixula), and two crossings of the barrier are required to fully explain the present-day distribution of the species (though the second crossing could be facilitated by the South Equatorial Current system [74]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>An alternative scenario would be that the two Atlantic species diverged in Western Atlantic, after the rise of the Panama isthmus isolated their ancestor from the eastern Pacific region (the possible origin of the genus Arbacia [26]), and that A. lixula crossed the Atlantic ridge only once to colonize the Eastern Atlantic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>Our results favour the first (Lessios’) view, as the haplotypes from Brazil formed a derived monophyletic group nested within the amphi-Atlantic Group B, rather than the opposite. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>This indicates a derived lineage in Western Atlantic, old enough to have had time to evolve forming the haplotype Group C. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>A more thorough sampling of the whole range of the Western Atlantic distribution and the inclusion of more data from Western Africa, are necessary before firm evidence can be obtained about the historical whereabouts of the main lineages of A. lixula. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Overall, the pattern of distribution of genetic variability (as shown in F st, Jost’s D, MDS and AMOVA analyses) showed three groups of populations that differed significantly from each other (Brazilian, Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean), while little structure could be found within these groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>It is remarkable that the F st measures based on sequence distance metrics and the differentiation measure D based on haplotype frequencies yielded essentially the same results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>This is attributable to the prevalence of close haplotypes separated by small number of mutations (hence the low nucleotide diversity in general) that are widespread among populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Thus, haplotype genetic differences had relatively little weight and most population structure derives from haplotype frequency differences. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Another striking pattern resulting from our molecular analyses is that recent demographic phenomena have shaped the present-day genetic structure of Arbacia lixula populations in the Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>This does not seem to be the case of the Brazilian population but, given the small sample size, it is unclear if the resulting mismatch distribution (Fig. 6A) is either multimodal or L-shaped in this population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Multimodal curves are typical of populations at demographic equilibrium, but L-shaped distributions may result from very recent demographic bottlenecks [75]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>More extensive sampling would be required to get the full picture of the demographic processes that have shaped the Brazilian populations of A. lixula. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>The lack of an exclusively Mediterranean mitochondrial lineage of Arbacia lixula is remarkable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Other Atlanto-Mediterranean echinoderms such as Marthasterias glacialis [76], Holothuria mammata [77] or Paracentrotus lividus [73], [78] do have lineages exclusive of the Mediterranean. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>These species have been probably present in the Mediterranean for several million years and their populations may have suffered several episodes of impaired gene flow during the Pleistocene glaciations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>The genetic structure shown by A. lixula probably reflects a different demographic history from these other species. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Even if there is no phylogenetic break in the Mediterranean (as also found by Lessios et al. [26]) and alleles are widely shared at both sides of the Gibraltar boundary, this barrier seems nevertheless to restrict gene flow in Arbacia lixula, so as to establish significant differences in terms of haplotype frequencies between Mediterranean and Eastern Atlantic populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>The AMOVA (and pairwise comparisons) detected significant genetic differentiation between these groups of populations (Table 5), suggesting a reduced gene flow through the Strait of Gibraltar. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Differently to what can be found in other marine organisms [79], the Strait itself, and not the Almeria-Oran Front (some 350 Km east of Gibraltar), is the place of the phylogeographic break, as the populations from the Alboran Sea are undistinguishable from other Mediterranean populations, but are significantly differentiated from most Atlantic populations (Fig. 4, Tables 3 and 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Thus, A. lixula does not show any genetic differentiation among populations throughout the whole Mediterranean Sea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>This could be due to recurrent gene flow, but oceanographic barriers such as the Almeria-Oran Front or the Siculo-Tunisian Strait [79] are strong enough to maintain genetic differentiation among different sub-basins in the case of other echinoderms of similar larval dispersive capacity [73], [77]–[78]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>We favour the alternative explanation (for the lack of genetic structure) that the colonization of the Mediterranean by A. lixula is so recent (see below) that populations in the different Mediterranean sub-basins have not had yet enough time to diverge from each other. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>In the case of Macaronesian and Cape Verdean populations (Table 6), it seems likely that the present-day genetic similarity could be the result of a recent demographic expansion (see below), which could have swamped any trace of previous differentiated lineages potentially formed during periods of restricted gene flow among archipelagos. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Brazilian populations of Arbacia lixula are completely differentiated from Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean populations (Tables 3 &amp; 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>In addition, they showed the lowest genetic diversity and did not show any signature of demographic expansion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, our sample size is small, and Northern and Central Brazilian populations of A. lixula have never been sampled for phylogeographic studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>More extensive sampling along the Brazilian coast would be required for a full understanding of factors shaping the genetic structure of the West Atlantic populations of A. lixula. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>The almost complete lack of fossil record for Arbacia lixula in the Mediterranean is most revealing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>At present, the species is highly abundant and occurs in areas that have been thoroughly sampled by palaeontologists. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>Other Mediterranean echinoids currently co-occurring in the same habitats are commonly found in assemblages of the Pleistocene and have been abundantly reported in the paleontological literature [80]–[83]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only one fossil individual of A. lixula from the Mediterranean has ever been reported in the literature [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>It was found in very young deposits from Livorno (Italy) whose recency led Stefanini to speculate that A. lixula had an exotic origin and had entered the Mediterranean in recent times [13]. A. lixula is consistently absent from fossil assemblages of the so-called “Senegalese fauna” that characterize the warmer periods from the Tyrrhenian stage (ca. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>260–11.4 kya), which have been extensively sampled and thoroughly described [84]–[89]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>As for the Atlantic archipelagos, recent work on the fossil echinoid fauna of Azores Islands [90] has revealed the presence of A. lixula, providing several tens of pieces of individuals, including the oldest known record of this species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>These deposits are currently dated to 130–120 kya [91], which corresponds to the last interglacial or Riss-Würm (also called MIS 5e, ca. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>130–114 kya). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>These specimens add up to the only other Atlantic A. lixula fossil specimen known from the Pleistocene of Madeira [13] whose dating is more uncertain. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>Thus, there is scarce paleontological evidence of the occurrence of Arbacia lixula in the Mediterranean, and somewhat more, but still scarce, evidence of the colonization of the Atlantic archipelagos of Azores and Madeira, which probably occurred during the last interglacial period of the Pleistocene (MIS 5e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>These observations are in agreement with the genetic signatures we observed in the mismatch distributions, which clearly show that recent sudden expansions have occurred in the Mediterranean and Macaronesian populations (Fig. 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>This is also supported by the strikingly star-shaped topologies of the haplotype network (Fig. 2) and by the comb-like clades in the BI phylogenetic tree (Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>Our temporal estimation for the demographic expansion in the Mediterranean (93.8–205.2 kya) is coherent with the only available fossil record [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>This is considerably younger than the times for expansion events found in other Mediterranean echinoderms using the same estimation method, which vary from 300 to 600 kya [73], [77] and fits with the possibility that the colonization of the Mediterranean by A. lixula took place as recently as during the last interglacial period (MIS 5e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>This period was also the longest of all interglacial warm periods of the Pleistocene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>The minimum winter surface temperature of the Mediterranean Sea stayed warmer than 19°C for several thousands of years [89]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>This probably enabled tropical Atlantic populations of A. lixula to cross the Strait of Gibraltar and colonize the Mediterranean. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>In the case of Eastern Atlantic populations, the exponential demographic expansion is even more apparent, since the mismatch distribution follows a sharp unimodal curve which fits to a sudden expansion model with a very high value for θ1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>This expansion probably occurred more recently than in the Mediterranean (31.3–68.4 kya). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>This estimation falls within the Late Pleistocene, an epoch generally dominated by the last glaciation (Würm), during which the mean sea level dropped down to 80 m below the present level [92]–[93]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Changes in ocean circulation related to this sea level drop can be related to the population expansion of A. lixula in the Eastern Atlantic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>Contrary to what happens in the Mediterranean, the fossils available show that the species was present in Macaronesia before this expansion [90], so the demographic history of the Atlantic populations of A. lixula seems to be more complex than that of the Mediterranean populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>To complete the picture of the colonization of Atlantic archipelagos, data from continental African shores would be highly valuable. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>An invasive species can be defined as a “species that threatens the diversity or abundance of native species, the ecological stability of infested ecosystems, economic activities (e.g., agricultural, aquacultural, commercial, or recreational) dependent on these ecosystems and/or human health” [94]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>Although the term is generally applied to species introduced as a result of human activities, it should not be necessarily so. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>Moreover, ecosystem engineer species such as Arbacia lixula, that have shaped contemporary communities as the result of a colonization event that took place many years ago, can be falsely viewed as native [95]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>According to our molecular data, A. lixula has indeed colonized the Mediterranean recently and complies with the terms of the former definition, even if it is usually viewed as native because its colonization took place following natural climatic changes, without human intervention. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>Whether considered as an “old natural invader” or as native, the present trend of global warming can potentially boost the negative impact of A. lixula in Mediterranean ecosystems, thus possibly turning a “natural” colonization into an ecological problem related (at least partially) to human intervention. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>The ongoing warming [96] may facilitate population blooms of A. lixula in Northern Mediterranean, by releasing the constraint to larval development due to low water temperature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>Warnings have been issued about its potential population increase and the generation of barren grounds in sublittoral habitats [10]–[11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>Thus, genetic data are in agreement with the consideration of Arbacia lixula as a thermophilous species that has recently colonised the Mediterranean and whose densities may increase in the foreseeable future. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>Monitoring of populations seems highly recommendable as a management tool in the near future for protecting the threatened Mediterranean shallow water ecosystems. </plain></SENT>
