</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Modulating protein–protein interactions (PPIs) using small compounds can greatly contribute to the therapeutic intervention of various human diseases, since most proteins in a cell function by interacting with other proteins (1–4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Many proteins such as membrane receptors and enzymes have been intensively studied as drug targets, and various biological information on the target proteins have been stored in some public databases, for example Therapeutic Target Database (5) and SuperTarget (6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there are only a limited number of drug target PPIs deposited in databases, TIMBAL (7) and 2P2IDB (8), despite the biological importance of the PPIs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>To date, we have developed novel methodologies to assess the druggability [also called ‘ligandability’ (9)] of PPIs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our approach is based on support vector machine (SVM) utilizing the physicochemical properties of the PPI-inhibitor-binding pockets (structural attributes), the number of drugs/chemicals that target interacting proteins (drug/chemical attributes) and available information on biological function such as diseases, pathways, gene ontologies and gene expression profiles (functional attributes) (10, 11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>By applying our methodologies to human PPIs, we have predicted their druggabilities (11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>We created a database of predicted druggable PPIs, named Dr. PIAS, aiming at helping researchers effectively explore druggable PPIs from interactome data (12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Here, we introduce Dr. PIAS version 2.0, which contains novel features not present in the first version of the database. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><sec><title><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>PPI data </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>We have retrieved PPI data from three resources, mainly focusing on human, mouse, rat and human immunodeficiency virus proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>One of the resources is the Entrez Gene (13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>It integrates PPI data from BIND (14), BioGRID (15) and HPRD (16) databases, and thus includes most human PPIs experimentally identified to date. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Other two resources are the Genome Network Platform in Japan (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genomenetwork.nig.ac.jp/index_e.html">http://genomenetwork.nig.ac.jp/index_e.html</ext-link>) and several publications (17–19), and many PPIs in these resources have not been registered in the Entrez Gene yet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In the current version, Dr. PIAS contains 83 324 PPIs, a considerable increase from the 71 500 PPIs in the previous version. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>PPIs between human proteins are most abundant (72 130), followed by mouse PPIs (4819). </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>New positive instances in our SVM-based method </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Dr. PIAS assesses the druggability of PPIs based on one of the supervised machine learning method, SVM, using the computational program package Libsvm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/">http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/∼cjlin/libsvm/</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In our previous studies, we used 30 well-studied drug target PPIs as the positive instances in our SVM-based method (11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Progress in the research area of drug target PPIs has allowed us to add 4 PPIs (CREBBP/TP53, MDM4/TP53, RAF1/YWHAZ and S100B/TP53) and 10 tertiary structures (PDB entries 2D82, 2OPY, 2W3L, 3HCM, 3INQ, 3JZK, 3LBJ, 3LBK, 3LBL and 3RDH) as the new positives. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>These structures are complexes of a protein from a PPI and a compound inhibiting the PPI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Although the number of added PPIs and structures is small, in the cross-validation tests, these additions increase the accuracy and specificity from 80.5% and 80.5% in the previous SVM classifier to 83.2% and 84.7% in the new classifier, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity remains constant at 81.6%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the new classifier used in Dr. PIAS 2.0 has more discriminative power for druggable and non-druggable PPIs than the previous one. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Application of the new SVM classifier to the positives shows that the mean value of druggability scores (using all attributes) of the positives is 0.908 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://database.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bas034/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Among 72 096 human PPIs (except for the positives) in Dr. PIAS, 41 have a score ≥0.908 and can thus be considered to be ‘highly druggable’ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://database.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bas034/DC1">Supplementary Table S2</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In the current version, we introduced a novel concept of ‘similar positives’ of druggable PPIs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>When a PPI is judged to be highly druggable by our method, the information on which positive is most similar to the PPI will be valuable for further investigation of the PPI from a viewpoint of discovering small inhibitory compounds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>As described in our previous papers, we calculated the ‘druggability score’ of a PPI as the number of times the PPI was judged to be positive in a 10 000 times training-prediction iteration using 10 000 random training data (11, 12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>A high druggability score of a PPI indicates that the PPI has a feature vector highly similar to the positives. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>If a PPI (test instance) was judged as positive in a process, we calculated similarities between the feature vector of the test and that of each positive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Similarities were measured using a radial basis function kernel, k(xpositive, xtest) = exp (−γ||xpositive − xtest||2) (where γ &gt; 0). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>When a positive gives the largest k(xpositive, xtest) among all measurements, it is identified as most closely located (most similar) to the test in a feature space of SVM. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Two examples are shown in Figure 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Both IL1B/IL1R1 and XIAP/DIABLO are the positives and also are used as the tests in this case. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>They have high druggability scores of 0.8652 and 0.8305, respectively, when assessed using all attributes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>It is reasonable that the feature vector of IL1B/IL1R1 is essentially identical to itself (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, Figure 1B indicates that the feature vectors of XIAP/DIABLO have high frequencies to be located nearest to each other in the feature space of SVM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Similarity matrix of the positives based on all attributes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://database.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bas034/DC1">Supplementary Table S3</ext-link>) clearly shows that the identical PPIs (only the structural attributes are different) and the homologous PPIs form a cluster in the feature space. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>This trend is also observed in similarity matrices based on structural (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://database.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bas034/DC1">Supplementary Table S4</ext-link>), drug/chemical (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://database.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bas034/DC1">Supplementary Table S5</ext-link>) and functional attributes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://database.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bas034/DC1">Supplementary Table S6</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>[In these tables, similarity scores range from 0 (dissimilar) to 10 000 (highly similar or identical).] In these matrices, however, similarities not only within clusters but also between clusters are observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>For example, in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://database.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bas034/DC1">Supplementary Table S4</ext-link>, all instances in the cluster of EGFR/GRB2 and GRB2/MET show slight similarities (scores of 258–825) to STAT3/STAT3 (see No. 43–60 in row and No. 92 in column). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>This implies that the physicochemical properties of the pockets at the interfaces of these PPIs are similar to each other. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Indeed, SH2 is common to these PPIs as the target domain for the inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Any inhibitor of EGFR/GRB2 and GRB2/MET may thus provide a starting point for the discovery or development of a small compound that can interfere with STAT3/STAT3, and vice versa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The information on similar positives may also be useful for avoiding small compounds that have a potency to inhibit non-target PPIs as well as an intended target and cause side effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>In <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://database.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bas034/DC1">Supplementary Table S4</ext-link>, instances in some clusters, such as IL1B/IL1R1 (No. 62) (also shown in Figure 1A), RAC1/TIAM1 (No. 81–84) and RAC1/TRIO (No. 85), show similarities only to themselves or only within clusters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Small compound inhibitors of these PPIs may have low potencies to bind other PPI interfaces and lead to side effects. Figure 1Pie charts of the number of times each positive instance (see ‘Legend’ of the chart) was located nearest to (A) IL1B/IL1R1 or (B) XIAP/DIABLO in a feature space, when IL1B/IL1R1 or XIAP/DIABLO was assessed by our SVM-based method. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>(A) Druggability score (using all attributes) of IL1B/IL1R1 is 0.8652. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>This means that IL1B/IL1R1 was judged to be positive 8652 times in the 10 000 training-prediction iteration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Among the 8652, IL1B/IL1R1 is 8600 times most closely located to itself in the feature space. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>(B) Druggability score (using all attributes) of XIAP/DIABLO is 0.8305. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Among the 8305, 4 positive instances (XIAP/CASP9(PDB:1nw9_A), XIAP/DIABLO(PDB:1g73_C), XIAP/DIABLO(PDB:1g73_D), and XIAP/DIABLO(PDB:2opy_A)) are 1011–2729 times most closely located to XIAP/DIABLO in the feature space. </plain></SENT>
