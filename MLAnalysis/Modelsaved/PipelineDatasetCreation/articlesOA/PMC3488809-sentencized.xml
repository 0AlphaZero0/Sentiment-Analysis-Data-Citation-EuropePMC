</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama, Hemiptera: Psyllidae, is a phloem feeding insect native to Asia and the Far East with a host range of only Citrus spp. and its near Rutaceae relatives (Halbert &amp; Núñez, 2004). Diaphorina citri causes little direct feeding damage, but it vectors the phloem limited bacterial citrus pathogens, ‘Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’, ‘C. L. africanus’, and ‘C. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>L. americanus’, which cause ‘citrus greening disease’ or Huanglongbing (HLB), a disease which is considered one of the most damaging to citrus (Capoor et al., 1967; Martinez &amp; Wallace, 1967; Teixeira et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The impact of this disease on world citrus production and concern over its continued spread have lead to research on the vector's plant host range, interactions with parasitoids and host-vector-pathogen interactions (Bové, 2006; Halbert &amp; Manjunath, 2004; Hall et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Despite these endeavors, there is virtually no information available regarding D. citri genetic diversity and the implications this may hold for these and other studies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The Asian citrus psyllid's current distribution extends from the Arabian Peninsula (Saudi Arabia and Yemen) and from Afghanistan through to the Indian Subcontinent, Southeast Asia and the Ryukyu Archipelago and Kyushu in Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the coastal provinces of Guangxi, Guangdong, Fujian and Zhejiang in China, the Philippine Islands and through the Indonesian archipelago to northeastern Papua New Guinea; in the Pacific Islands of Hawaii and Guam; the continental USA (Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas), as well as the Caribbean (Bahamas, Cayman Islands, Cuba, Jamaica, Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico), Central (Honduras and Mexico) and South America (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela) and the Indian Ocean islands of Mauritius and Réunion (Costa Lima, 1942; French et al., 2001; Halbert &amp; Manjunath, 2004; Halbert &amp; Núñez, 2004; Mead, 1977; Pluke et al., 2008; Tsai et al., 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Because of the lack of global phylogenetics for this species, hypotheses describing its origin include either southeastern Asia or southwestern Asia (India/Pakistan) (Mead, 1977). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Anthropogenic spread via the pathway of infested plant material has been the principal means by which this pest has spread. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>This was responsible for the New World invasions that have seen its distribution expand to include countries in North, Central and South America and the Caribbean (Núñez, 2004). Diaphorina citri was first reported from the continental USA (Florida) in 1998 (Bové, 2006) and now occurs from Florida to California. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Understanding the genetic diversity underlying an invasive pest is a key element that supports the development of effective management strategies (Rosen, 1978; Schauff et al., 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Complicating the analysis of genetic diversity among world populations of many invasive insects is that many contain a cryptically diverse collection of populations that cannot be easily categorized by morphological characteristics (Scheffer, 2000; Clarke et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Diversity can be represented as distinct biotypes and may extend to reproductive isolation, suggesting the existence of multiple cryptic species (Bickford et al., 2007; De Barro et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The emergence of molecular systematic approaches has allowed the more precise and rapid characterization of diversity among populations of invasive species beyond what can be ascertained from morphological evaluations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>This information can be used to identify the geographic origin of the invaders, if not directly, then at least from an evolutionary perspective (Xavier et al., 2009; De Barro &amp; Ahmed, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Such knowledge is invaluable when looking for effective biological control agents, and understanding basic biology and ecology. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to use mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (mtCO1) to assess the genetic relationships between different collections of D. citri from around the world. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="?"><plain>The questions we set out to answer were: (i) Can mtCOI haplotype analysis provide an insight into phylogeographic relationships of Old World D. citri populations? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="?"><plain>If so, (ii) is there population structure that can be used to monitor global movement of specific genetic types? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="?"><plain>And, (iii) is there evidence of cryptic species based on relative genetic relationships of individuals from the different collections? </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Due to the minimal sequence diversity in this intraspecific haplotype comparison, and the resulting poor support for the phylogenetic inference using standard tree construction methods (data not shown), it was determined that a haplotype network analysis would be the most appropriate way to consider the relationship between haplotypes (Hart &amp; Sunday, 2007; Chen et al., 2010; De Barro &amp; Ahmed, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>The analysis using TCS is graphically represented in fig. 1. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>By considering the two most frequently encountered haplotypes and their singleton derivatives as separate ‘groups’, Dcit-1 groups with Dcit-4, Dcit-6 and Dcit-7 to form what we refer to as the SWA group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Dcit-1 was the most frequently encountered haplotype in this group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>The other haplotype group was composed of Dcit-2 and Dcit-8 and represents the SEA group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Placement of Dcit-3 (all Caribbean collections) and Dcit-5 (a single Chinese collection) was ambiguous, possibly because of the small numbers collected from those areas and because of the greater number of nucleotide substitutions in relation to the most common sequences. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>This network analysis shows a diverged haplotype, Dcit-3, distributed in the Caribbean yet absent from all other samples (fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>This result was surprising since the Caribbean was thought to be the source of D. citri that entered Florida (Halbert &amp; Núñez, 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Since Dcit-3 is not found in Florida, either the Florida D. citri have come from some location other than the Caribbean or there is greater diversity in the Caribbean than we observed in the four collections (Psy-24, -48, -49, -50) and 13 individuals obtained from Puerto Rico and Guadaloupe (table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>The relatively distant relationship between the Florida and Caribbean haplotypes (three substitutions, see fig. 1) indicate that the invasion of Florida did not come from the established Caribbean (Guadeloupe and Puerto Rico) populations, but more sampling is needed to verify these findings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Further, because D. citri is hypothesized to have entered the Caribbean as recently as the 1990s (Hall, 2008) and the Caribbean samples have a mtCOI genotype that was not found anywhere else in the old world, we are left to draw the conclusion that there is more worldwide diversity than what was captured in our sampling. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Within the Old World, few haplotypes predominate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>However, the distribution of these haplotypes suggests a phylogeographic break. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Dcit-2 occurs in &gt;90% of all the Southeast Asia individuals and 75% of all Chinese samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Despite its common occurrence in SE Asia and China, it appears to be absent from the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Conversely, Dcit-1 and Dcit-6, just one synonymous mutation away, are the only haplotypes observed in both the Middle East and Indian subcontinent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Considering all the haplotypes present in Old World collections, Dcit-1 and Dcit-6 displayed a southwestern Asia (SWA) bias and Dcit-2, -5 and -8 a southeastern Asia bias. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>In the New World, where D. citri was introduced within the last 25 years (Halbert &amp; Núñez, 2004), a geographical bias to haplotype distribution was also observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>With the exception of one individual carrying haplotype Dcit-7, all 23 USA collections (99 individuals) contained Dcit-1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>The individual carrying Dcit-7, which differs by a single non-synonymous substitution, was collected from St Lucie County, Florida alongside Dcit-1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>In the four Brazilian collections, both Dcit-1 and Dcit-2 haplotypes were observed, but not in the same collections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>In Mexico, three collections were analyzed, one from northern Mexico near the Texas, USA border and the other two from the Yucatan Peninsula. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>The collection close to Texas contained the same haplotype found in Texas (Dcit-1), but the Yucatan Peninsula collections were fixed for a unique haplotype Dcit-4, which differed from Dcit-1 by a single nucleotide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Although D. citri is a pest that has spread worldwide, unlike other pests such as the whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Boykin et al., 2007b; Dinsdale et al., 2010), the low level of sequence diversity indicates that it is most likely a single species rather than a species complex. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>A major aim of this study was to show how D. citri in Florida are related to D. citri elsewhere. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>We found that the Florida D. citri were most closely related to those from Mexico, Pakistan, Brazil, Texas, Saudi Arabia, India, Indonesia and Réunion Island, and includes the SWA sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>New World populations show three distinct separations based on phylogeographic interpretation of the haplotype network (fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>North American continental populations (USA: Florida and Texas; and Mexico) belong to the SWA group, whereas individuals from locations in South America were either SWA or SEA in origin; SWA and SEA did not co-occur in any of the collections, suggesting two separate introductions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>The only case where a collection from a single location contained individuals from both SWA and SEA was in the Indian Ocean island of Réunion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>It is interesting to consider here whether there is some factor that limits the capacity of these two groups to co-occur. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>The only other New World locations sampled were the two Caribbean islands of Puerto Rico and Guadeloupe, where both contained the same haplotype Dcit-3. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Network-based genealogies can offer insight into ancestral sequences, as these sequences are expected to be common, widely distributed and highly connected (Chen et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>While these predictions hold in theory, application is often difficult. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Insufficient or non-uniform sampling schemes can bias the frequencies of observed haplotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Anthropogenic activity can alter geographical distributions at a scale and rate well beyond the ability of genetic systems to equilibrate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>In our study, &gt;60% of our samples are from the New World where D. citri is invasive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Using frequency of occurrence or geographic distribution as a metric for predicting ancestry would bias predictions by frequency of invasion and invasion success. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>While both haplotype frequency and geographical distribution are likely not reflective of equilibrium evolutionary processes, patterns of haplotype connectivity may be more robust. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Using this criterion, the mitochondrial haplotype network for D. citri suggests a basal and thus ancestral position for Dcit-1 (fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>Even a conservative analysis, excluding all New World haplotypes that were singleton branches from the main Dcit-1 and Dcit-2 groups leaving only old world haplotypes, predicts Dcit-1 as ancestral based on connectivity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Although early work suggested a far eastern Asia (Asia region to the east of India) origin of D. citri (Mead, 1977), more recent reconstructions based on plant host origins and historical information suggest a southwestern Asia origin, i.e. India (Hall, 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Therefore, ancestral placement of the SWA group supports the more contemporary view of D. citri evolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>However, because of limited sampling in the Old World, we do not have a clear phylogeographic picture of the complete distribution of the SWA and SEA groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>The phylogeographic interpretations of our data identify two geographical redistributions of D. citri. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>First, some apparent geographical separation between the SWA and SEA groups that requires more intense sampling in the Old World to provide a true characterization of this relationship, and then a more recent radiation of the SWA and SEA groups into the New World most likely within the last 25 years (Halbert &amp; Núñez, 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>There is one earlier report of D. citri from Brazil in the early 1940s (Costa Lima, 1942); however, no one can substantiate this record, and it is certain that established populations were not reported until much more recently. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec></sec></SecTag><SecTag type="CONCL"><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec4"><title><text><SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that with respect to the mCOI haplotypes and within the limits of our global sampling, there is very little genetic diversity among the populations worldwide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>Despite this limited diversity, enough information was gained to partially answer the three questions on which this research was based. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="129" pm="?"><plain>(i) Can mtCOI haplotype analysis provide an insight into phylogeographic relationships of Old World D. citri populations? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Limited sampling became a factor in this interpretation; however, two mtCOI haplotypes predominate, Dcit-1 and Dcit-2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>These differed from each other by just two nucleotides and formed the basis of Dcit-1 group individuals (Dcit -1,-4, -6 and -7) and Dcit-2 group individuals (Dcit-2 and -8), as defined by those individuals whose mtCOI sequence diverges from the most common sequence (either Dcit-1 or Dcit-2) by only one nucleotide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Distribution of these two haplotype groups displayed some apparent Old World geographical bias. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>The Dcit-1 group was more abundant in SWA samples, and the Dcit-2 group was more abundant in SEA samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Clearly, more sampling was done in SEA (Indonesia, Vietnam, Taiwan, Thailand and China) with 12 different collections, than in SWA (Pakistan, Saudia Arabia and India) with only three collections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>However, if collections from Mauritius and Reunion are excluded as anthropogenic introductions because they are not considered a center of D. citri diversity and are isolated islands where both Dcit-1 and-2 are present, 11 of the 12 SEA samples contained individuals belonging to the Dcit-2 group, while all SWA samples contained only Dcit-1 group individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, there is an appearance of geographically distinct populations; however, due to the limited sequence divergence between the observed groups, more in-depth sampling is needed for this to be verified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>The authors suggest that further sampling from these Middle East and Asian countries needs to be conducted to better survey diversity and also utilize the other genetic markers such as microsatellites (Boykin et al., 2007a). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="138" pm="?"><plain>(ii) Is there population structure that can be used to monitor global movement of specific genetic types? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the New World collections showed that invasions into North America came from the SWA group only, whereas those involving South America came from both the SWA and SEA groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>There was extensive sampling in the USA (22 collections within Florida) and only minimal sampling in South America (four collections), so it is unlikely that SEA populations were missed in the USA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Despite this observed difference in haplotype distribution in the New World, our limited Old World sampling and the small amount of global mtCOI sequence variation precludes the ability to provide a concise determination of origin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>However, knowledge from this research may be useful in searching for effective biological control agents and may help explain differences in effectiveness of Tamarixia radiata, a parasitoid introduced in the New World to control invasive populations of D. citri (Hoy &amp; Nguyen, 2001; Hoy et al., 2004; Michaund, 2004; Pluke et al., 2008; Barr et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Although, one needs to be cautious here, as ecological factors may be as or more important than genetic variability within the parasitoid and should not be overlooked. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="144" pm="?"><plain>(iii) Is there evidence of cryptic species based on relative genetic relationships of collections? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>All individuals were closely related, and there is no evidence for complex cryptic species structure within these populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>This may be expected as genetic variation is expected to increase with time since divergence (globalization) and increased host variability (local adaptation). D. citri has a very limited host range (only within the Rutaceae) and has only recently (within the last 15 to 25 years) spread to the New World. </plain></SENT>
