</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are highly conserved, short noncoding RNA molecules of approximately 22 nucleotides in length in their mature form. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>miRNAs originally reside in the nucleus as RNA polymerase II primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) transcripts [1]; thereafter, they are processed in two steps. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Within the nucleus, pri-miRNAs are processed into approximately 70–100 nucleotide hairpin-shaped precursors known as pre-miRNAs by Drosha, which form complexes with a double-stranded RNA-binding domain protein, DGCR8/Pasha [2, 3], before being transported to the cytoplasm via an Exportin-5- and Ran-GTP-dependent mechanism [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Once in the cytoplasm, the double-stranded ribonuclease, Dicer, cleaves the pre-miRNAs to yield approximately 20–22 base pair mature miRNA duplexes [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The duplex is incorporated into the effector ribonucleic acid-induced silencing complex (RISC) where the duplex is unwound to form a mature single-stranded miRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The mature miRNA strand that is incorporated in the RISC binds to the 3′ untranslated region and more rarely to other regions of specific target mRNAs through a perfect or near-perfect complementary match to block translation or cleaves the mRNA [6, 7] (reviewed in [8–10]). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Pluripotent stem cells can be directly differentiated toward endothelial cell (EC) lineages [11] and may be used to generate a large supply of transplantable, healthy, functional cells for repair of ischemic tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>However, the control of the intricate transcriptional events controlling pluripotent stem cell to vascular EC differentiation remains to be fully interrogated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are reported to express a unique panel of miRNAs, including the miR-302 cluster and miR-371/372/373 cluster [12, 13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The expression of these pluripotency-associated miRNAs is suppressed upon differentiation with concordant induction of differentiation-specific miRNAs, namely miR-145 and Let7 [14, 15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Indeed, it has recently been demonstrated that overexpression of the miR-302 cluster can facilitate reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotency [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>We believe that pluripotent stem cells, both hESCs and induced pluripotent stem cells, may provide a unique model system through which the study of miRNA function during early stages of lineage development and commitment can be quantified. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Initial evidence for contribution of miRNAs in EC development and differentiation was provided by the observation that Dicer knockout mice have an embryonic lethal phenotype [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In fact, Dicer knockout embryos suffered severely disrupted blood and vessel formation accompanied with retarded expression of early endothelial markers VEGF, FLT1, KDR, and tie1 [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>These results were supported in vitro by demonstration that Dicer is a prerequisite for EC function [18, 19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>However, endothelial-restricted tissue-specific deletion of Dicer demonstrated that endothelial progenitor cells developed, albeit with compromised blood circulation, and a lack of embryonic lethal phenotype was observed in both zebrafish [20] and mice [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that miRNAs may not be pivotal in endothelial differentiation and developmental angiogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>This is compounded by the failure to date in using a specific miRNA deletion to evoke fully penetrant embryonic lethality in mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>On other hand, murine ESCs subjected to loss of global miRNAs via Dicer or Drosha knockdown exhibit reduced self-renewal and proliferative capabilities with marked defects in differentiation [22, 23]; however, this has yet to be reported in hESCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>To date, only a small number of studies have focused on the involvement of angiogenesis-associated miRNAs in EC differentiation from pluripotent stem cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>This is in agreement with current literature reporting that despite the demonstration of differentially expressed miRNAs during endothelial differentiation in vitro, none of the miRNAs so far have been reported to directly govern EC fate decisions [24, 25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>For example, miR-126 was identified as enriched in ECs derived from mouse ESCs and in developing mouse embryos [26, 27], with knockdown studies in zebrafish resulting in hemorrhage and loss of vascular integrity [26, 27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Indeed, previous studies in zebrafish have provided evidence that miR-126 provides a crucial link between flow and Vegf signaling to promote angiogenesis, by acting downstream of klf2a to drive shear flow-stimulated angiogenesis via repression of spred1 and pik3r2 [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, targeted deletion of miR-126 evoked defects in EC function and resulted in leaky vessels in mice, but did not evoke full embryonic lethality [29], suggesting that the endothelial-specific miR-126 does not control EC differentiation but does control cell function [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis is further ratified with results from a previous study reporting that miRNA-126 overexpression in pluripotent SCs prevented differentiation toward the EC lineage [27], indicating that miR-126 does not command early EC lineage commitment but is induced by vascular differentiation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>We have recently described the increased expression of angiogenesis-associated miRNAs (miR-126, -130a, -133a, -133b, and -210) [25, 30] and decrease in antiangiogenic miRNAs (miR-20a, -20b, -221, and -222) [31] during our feeder- and serum-free-directed hESC-EC differentiation protocol [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>To date, despite the demonstration of miRNA regulation in a myriad of vascular biology events and the mapping of initial stages of mesoderm commitment [32], no individual miRNAs have been shown to directly control mesoderm to vascular EC fate decisions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>There is still insufficient evidence demonstrating miRNA involvement in early human development of vascular cells, how they control mesoderm-EC fate commitment, and the mechanisms involved in these differentiation processes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed early stages of EC lineage commitment and the miRNA-ome to identify miRNAs integral to human EC development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>We identified miR-99b, -181a, and -181b as miRNAs enriched in hES-ECs differentiated from pluripotent stem cells and confirmed their expression in adult venous ECs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>We interrogated their role in differentiation by modulating their expression and directing differentiation to EC lineage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of the aforementioned miRNAs augmented the differentiation potential of pluripotent cells and improved their potential for therapeutic angiogenesis in a mouse model of limb ischemia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The results herein demonstrate that miRNA regulation of development to specified lineages is a potential target for optimizing the generation of proangiogenic vascular ECs for regenerative medicine. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>This study describes the identification of three miRNAs that are expressed upon differentiation of ECs from pluripotent stem cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>We report that miRNA processing by Dicer is necessary for endothelial differentiation, evidenced by Dicer knockdown substantially reducing hESC differentiation to EC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>We analyzed early stages of EC lineage commitment and the miRNA transcriptome to identify miR-99b, -181a, and -181b specifically upregulated during differentiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we report that augmentation of miRNAs by gene transfer can potentiate the endothelial differentiation capacity in a hESC line that evokes relatively poor differentiation to ECs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Finally, we demonstrate that the transplantation of hESC-ECs overexpressing either miR-99b or -181b into the muscle of immunodeficient mice subjected to hind limb ischemia promoted therapeutic neovascularization and blood flow recovery. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>With respect to in vitro differentiation from pluripotent stem cells, the role of miRNAs has been implicated in studies using Dicer- or Drosha-deficient mouse ESCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Dicer- or Drosha-deficient ESCs were unable to generate mature miRNAs, which subsequently impeded differentiation [23, 42, 43]; however, this has as yet not been reported in hESCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>We report herein the first demonstration that LV-mediated knockdown of Dicer abrogated the potential of pluripotent hESCs to differentiate to an EC lineage (Fig. 2) highlighting that the canonical biogenesis of mature miRNAs is likely required for successful endothelial differentiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Herein, we also report that Dicer knockdown suppresses the production of NO in hESC directed to EC lineage (Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>This is in agreement with our previous data demonstrating a differentiation-specific increase in EC marker gene expression concordant with a functional EC phenotype in vitro and in vivo and the ability to produce and respond to an NO stimulator [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Recent additional studies have reported that abrogation of Dicer is capable of preventing ES differentiation toward other lineages [44–48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>We have focused on hES-EC differentiation, but it is likely that Dicer suppression would impair human pluripotent cell differentiation to other lineages similar to murine ESCs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>We reasoned that lineage-specific miRNAs must be processed and contribute to the master regulation of the earliest stages of lineage specification and commitment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated that the expression of angiogenesis-associated mature miRNAs (miR-126, -130a, -133a, -133b, and -210) was present at 10-day postdifferentiated functional hES-ECs [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>With this in mind, we sought to identify miRNAs expressed at earlier stages of lineage commitment to EC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>We differentiated hESCs toward an EC lineage using our previously reported serum- and feeder-free protocol [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>This protocol circumvented the need for an embryoid body formation with cells differentiating in a uniform manner, thereby providing a unique opportunity to analyze the miRNA component at early stage of lineage commitment without the need to deplete cells from the other germ lineages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>In agreement with previous studies, we identified the expression of the pluripotency-associated miRNA clusters 302 and 372/373 as present in our pluripotent hESC samples [12, 13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>We also validated the substantial loss of differentiation-associated miR-302a–d, -372, and -373 in agreement with previous studies [12, 13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>We identified and validated the expression of miR-99b, -181a, and -181b in the early stages of EC differentiation from three pluripotent hESC lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>miR-99b is an intergenic miRNA and transcribed in a cluster with miR-125a and Let7e. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>This is in agreement with our previous finding that members of the Let7 family were induced upon directed differentiation to ECs [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we also identified miR-125a-5p as being highly expressed in the early stage of EC lineage specification (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=vtsddsqskeiwcvc&amp;acc=GSE33675">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=vtsdd sqskeiwcvc&amp;acc=GSE33675</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>miR-181a and -181b are both predicted to be expressed from two genomic hairpin loci, miR-181a/b-1 and -181a/b-2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.mirbase.org">www.mirbase.org</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>The mature sequences are identical regardless of cleavage by Dicer from pre-miR-181a/b-1 or -2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>miR-181a and -181b are both intragenic, but the genes that they reside in currently have no known function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>We subsequently confirmed the expression of miR-99b, -181a, and -181b in adult human SVECs, with no notable differences observed in mature miR-99b expression levels between the adult ECs and SA461 hES-ECs differentiated for 10 days (Supporting Information Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>S3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>We did observe significantly less miR-181a and -181b between day 10-differentiated hES-ECs and adult SVECs although levels at day 10 were easily detected by Northern blot analysis (Supporting Information Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>S3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>The identification of miR-99b [49], -181a [50], and -181b [19] is consistent with previous miR profiling data performed in ECs, but to our knowledge none have been associated with differentiation from pluripotency to endothelial lineage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>miR-181b has also previously been identified as expressed in CD34+ cells during hematopoietic differentiation from pluripotent cells [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>CD34 is expressed on mesoderm and early ECs [52] providing further evidence for a miR-181b role in early-stage commitment to EC differentiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>In addition, we have demonstrated that there is very low expression of miR-99b, -181a, and -181b in cells that are differentiated toward neural (ectopic) or hematopoietic (mesoderm) lineages; however, this is greatly potentiated in cells directed toward EC lineage (Fig. 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>To this end, it remains likely that miR-99b, -181a, and -181b are also expressed to a certain extent on cells of mesoderm origin, for example, hematopoietic cells owing to the common precursor that HSC and EC develop through [53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>However, this does highlight that in some capacity miR-99b, -181a, and -181b could be acting to promote cell cycle and generic differentiation progression from the pluripotent state, as previously reported for miR-195 and -372 [54]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether modulation of miR-99b, -181a, or -181b would elicit any effect of the differentiation capacity of pluripotent stem cells toward an EC lineage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of the premiR sequence for miR-99b, -181a, and -181b induced a significant increase in mature miR-99b, -181a, and -181b expression, respectively, thus signifying efficient processing of pre-miRNAs (Supporting Information Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>S4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>miR-99b and -181a augmentation was capable of significantly increasing the vascular EC marker genes, Pecam1 and VE Cadherin, at the transcript level in both hESC lines (Fig. 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>No additional benefit was observed by overexpressing all three miRNAs in combination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we report that upon analysis of the cell population expressing both proteins and ability to produce NO, we noted that there was an increased response to miRNA overexpression for all three miRNAs, including miR-181b that did not evoke a significant response at the mRNA level, in the H1 hESC line, when compared with SA461 cells (Fig. 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>This was encouraging as we had also observed a substantial difference in the baseline efficiency of the hESC lines to acquire an endothelial phenotype (expression of one or both markers), with H1 cells proving more refractory than SA461 cells when exposed to our EC differentiation protocol (Fig. 5), in agreement with a previous study examining the differentiation heterogeneity between lines [55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>We acknowledge that expression of one marker alone is not conclusive demonstration of EC lineage, but it may indicate a proportion of cells that are still differentiating to a terminally differentiated, bona fide EC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>Indeed, in our previous manuscript [11], we reported that the percentage of SA461 cells expressing both markers increased from days 14 to 21 of differentiation, this is in keeping with the data produced herein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it remains possible that we are unable to improve the differentiation efficiency of SA461 hES owing to the high base level EC differentiation efficiency (as determined by cells expressing one or more EC markers and MFI values), whereas with H1 cells there remains potential to enhance the differentiation, in this instance by modulating miRNA expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>It is therefore feasible that a finite EC differentiation capacity exists regardless of the hES background. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we suggest that pluripotent stem cell lines that are more refractory to differentiation protocols may benefit from the modulation of miRNAs to enhance the differentiation efficiency, but this requires analysis in other lines for confirmation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>In addition, we observed significantly improved therapeutic angiogenesis in a mouse model of peripheral ischemia after transplantation of hESC-ECs differentiated for 14 days, which overexpressed either miR-99b or -181b but interestingly not miR-181a (Fig. 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>This miRNA-mediated increase in neoangiogenesis efficiency may be a combination of a direct cell effect of transplanted cells and miR-mediated proangiogenic paracrine mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>These results show that overexpression of each of the individual miRNAs is capable of enhancing the vascular endothelial phenotype but not all will evoke a significant response at transcript, protein, and functional level, indicating that their modus operandi in EC biology is considerably complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>Knockdown studies also failed to elucidate the role of miR-99b, -181a, and -181b, with a significant reduction observed in vascular endothelial markers at the transcript level and a reduction in NO production, but no effect on the cell population expressing endothelial marker proteins (Supporting Information Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>S5). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have not provided evidence for a single miRNA possessing a pivotal role in the governance of EC fate decisions despite the demonstration of differentially expressed miRNAs during endothelial differentiation in vitro [24, 25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>We postulate that cell specification during the later stages of development may be controlled by miRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>For instance, miR-126 is not required for endothelial differentiation [27] but has been reported to inhibit erythropoiesis in CD34+ cells retaining the potential to develop toward either EC lineage or hematopoietic cell lineage [51], indicating miRNAs may negatively regulate further lineage specification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>This has also recently been demonstrated in ECs, with miR-181a reported to directly target Prox1, the key regulator of lymphatic EC identity, [56, 57] and miR-181a overexpression directing lymphatic ECs toward a blood vascular phenotype [50]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>This is in agreement with the data presented herein, with miR-181a knockdown inducing expression of Prox1 and overexpression augmenting the expression of the arterial-specific genes, EphrinB1, EphrinB2, Jagged2, and Hey2 [58], and inhibiting the expression of Prox1 [56] (Fig. 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>This increase in arterial gene expression is perhaps surprising considering that we observed no significant improvement in therapeutic angiogenesis with miR-181a overexpressing hES-ECs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>Overexpression and knockdown strategies for miR-99b and -181b failed to determine a similar pattern; however, speculatively, it is possible that these miRs may be more involved in the function of hES-ECs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>We observe improvement in hES-EC NO production at later differentiation time points for overexpression of miR-99b and -181b than for -181a (Fig. 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>This may in turn elicit a more potent response in vivo, potentially accounting for the increased improvement in neoangeogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>Equally, it remains possible that the expression of these miRNAs is increased as a consequence of endothelial differentiation, as opposed to their expression governing differentiation, and that their role in cell specification remains to be fully elucidated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>To understand the functional role of these or any subsequently identified miRNAs in endothelial fate determination, it will be necessary to identify and validate target genes involved in developmental specification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>There are several predicted targets for miRNAs miR-99b, -181a, and -181b; however, most of these targets have not been experimentally validated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>Our study is impaired toward identifying targets of miR-99b, -181a, and -181b as most of these predicted targets will not be expressed in pluripotent, mesoderm, or ECs and their precursors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>It is likely that the increased expression of these and other miRNAs serves to inhibit the induction of genes, which may facilitate development or differentiation to alternative germ layers or mesoderm cell lineages. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this is the first study to demonstrate that miR-99b, -181a, and -181b are upregulated during hESC differentiation to ECs and can potentiate EC differentiation from pluripotent hESCs; miR-99b and -181a/b overexpression can improve the differentiation efficiency of hESC lines, which are refractory to specified lineage differentiation and enhance postischemic neoangiogenesis induced by hESC-ECs. </plain></SENT>
