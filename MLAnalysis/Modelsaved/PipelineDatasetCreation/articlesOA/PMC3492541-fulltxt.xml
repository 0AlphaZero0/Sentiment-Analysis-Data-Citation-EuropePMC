The human complex engages microtubules with a globular &#8220;head&#8221; formed by tandem calponin-homology domains and an 80 amino-acid unstructured &#8220;tail&#8221; that contains sites of phospho-regulation by the Aurora B kinase. Using biochemical, cell biological, and electron microscopy analyses, we have dissected the tail&#8217;s roles in microtubule binding and mediating cooperative interactions between Ndc80 complexes. Two segments of the tail that contain Aurora B sites become ordered at interfaces; one with tubulin and the second with an adjacent Ndc80 head on the microtubule surface, forming interactions which are disrupted by phosphorylation. We propose a model in which Ndc80&#8217;s interaction with either growing or shrinking microtubule ends can be tuned by the phosphorylation state of its tail.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The Ndc80 complex (Ndc80c), a member of the conserved KMN (Knl1 complex, Mis12 complex, Ndc80 complex) network<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, has been identified as a primary site of kinetochore-microtubule attachment<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and a necessary factor for the proper operation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC)<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. The complex is a heterotetramer of Ndc80 (also known as HEC1 in humans<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>), Nuf2, Spc24, and Spc25, each of which features a globular head domain and a coiled-coil stalk that mediates dimerization into subcomplexes: Ndc80 with Nuf2 and Spc24 with Spc25<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. The tetramerization interface is formed by the dimerized coiled-coils, resulting in an elongated, dumbbell architecture<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. The Ndc80&#8211;Nuf2 coiled-coil features a break halfway along its length that imparts flexibility by acting as a molecular hinge<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, and which may also act as a binding site for other factors<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. The Spc24&#8211;25 head, which has a unique fold<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, mediates kinetochore association by direct interaction with the Mis12 linker complex<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. The Ndc80-Nuf2 head is formed by the tandem association of calponin-homology (CH) domains contributed by each protein<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and mediates microtubule binding<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">In addition to the Ndc80&#8211;Nuf2 head, microtubule association <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> depends on the disordered N-terminal tail of the Ndc80 protein<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. The tail can be phosphorylated on multiple residues by Aurora B kinase<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, which reduces the affinity of the Ndc80c for microtubules <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and destabilizes improper kinetochore-microtubule attachments <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Although an unstructured, Aurora B-regulated tail is a conserved feature of the Ndc80 protein in all eukaryotes, the region is highly divergent in sequence and length, making functionally relevant features difficult to identify by bioinformatic methods.</p><p id="P5">We therefore set out to experimentally characterize in detail the role of this key 80 amino acid region in human Ndc80 complex function. We previously reported a sub-nanometer resolution cryo-EM reconstruction of an engineered version of the human Ndc80c (Ndc80 bonsai<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>) bound to the microtubule<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, revealing tail-dependent oligomerization of the complex on the microtubule surface and details of the interaction between the Ndc80 CH domain and tubulin&#8217;s globular domains. Here we extend our analysis of the tail, delineating in detail its interactions with tubulin and the Ndc80&#8211;Nuf2 globular head when bound to the microtubule. Using a combination of biochemical, structural, and cell biological methods we dissect the physiological role of specific Aurora B sites and provide support for a model in which dynamic Aurora B phosphorylation of the Ndc80c can support directed chromosome motions during mitosis<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> in addition to promoting proper attachment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Dissection of Ndc80&#8217;s N-terminal tail</title><p id="P6">Examination of the primary sequence of the Ndc80 N-terminal tail (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) shows two distinct regions of Aurora B phosphorylation sites separated by a proline-rich linker. We refer to the cluster of sites found between amino acids 40&#8211;80 as &#8220;zone 1&#8221; and those found between amino acids 1&#8211;20 as &#8220;zone 2.&#8221; We previously found that the tail plays a role in the formation of phospho-regulated Ndc80c clusters along microtubule protofilaments <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, suggesting that this segment mediates protein-protein interactions between Ndc80c molecules in addition to contacting tubulin. In order to probe these two activities of the tail, we removed it from the context of the entire complex and fused it to GST for primary structure-function analysis. All GST tail peptides were well-expressed and soluble (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Guided by the positions of the two Aurora B phosphorylation regions, we created a number of constructs to test microtubule binding and tail&#8211;Ndc80c interactions (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a,b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Identification of the microtubule-binding region</title><p id="P7">We first performed microtubule co-sedimentation assays as described previously<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. When compared to the negative control of GST alone, which we found does not interact with microtubules (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c,d</xref>), we found that the full-length tail (GST 1&#8211;80) showed significant interaction with microtubules independently of the CH domains of Ndc80 and Nuf2, as had been reported previously for HEC1 residues 1&#8211;80 in the absence of GST<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. This activity is conferred by residues 40&#8211;80, as both GST 40&#8211;80 and GST 20&#8211;80 bound microtubules as well as the full-length tail in our assay, while GST 1&#8211;40, GST 1&#8211;20 and GST 20&#8211;40 showed negligible microtubule binding activity. GST 40&#8211;60 displayed weaker but still significant microtubule binding activity, while GST 60&#8211;80 did not, suggesting that residues from both of these regions are necessary for full binding.</p><p id="P8">We therefore made finer truncations of the 40&#8211;80 region in three amino-acid steps and identified residues 47&#8211;68 as the minimal tubulin-binding region of the tail (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2A&#8211;D</xref>), corresponding very closely to zone 1 of Aurora B sites. This is the most conserved region of the tail, with residues 49&#8211;61 showing modest but detectable conservation in all eukaryotes except nematodes and insects and the Aurora B site at Ser55 displaying the highest level of conservation (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>). Furthermore, most species feature prolines adjacent to this region (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>), suggesting that the architecture of the tail may be conserved although the sequence is not.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Phospho-regulated interaction between Ndc80 complexes</title><p id="P9">We next investigated the ability of the tail to interact with the Ndc80c in trans. Using GST pull-down assays we were unable to detect an interaction between the tail and the Ndc80c (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), in agreement with the observation that the Ndc80c does not form clusters in the absence of MTs<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. We therefore turned to an indirect assay: we mixed microtubules with an Ndc80 complex lacking the tail (bonsai &#916;1&#8211;80), which is deficient in microtubule binding<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, in the presence and absence of our GST tail constructs, reasoning that constructs containing both microtubule-binding and Ndc80c-binding elements would increase the apparent affinity of the bonsai &#916;1&#8211;80 for microtubules. Bonsai &#916;1&#8211;80 showed a significant increase in binding only in the presence of GST 1&#8211;80 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c,e</xref>), suggesting the N-terminal half of the tail, particularly zone 2, containing the second cluster of Aurora B sites, is important for tail&#8211;Ndc80c interaction in trans in the context of the microtubule.</p><p id="P10">These results suggested an approximate functional segregation of the tail into two regions: a tubulin binding region and an Ndc80c binding region, each of which contains a cluster of Aurora B sites.</p><p id="P11">We next investigated if the two zones of Aurora B sites differentially regulated tail&#8211;tubulin binding and tail&#8211;Ndc80c binding, and by extension Ndc80c&#8211;microtubule binding and cluster formation, respectively. Nine Aurora B phosphorylation sites (S4, S5, S8, S15, S44, T49, S55, S62, S69) have been reported in the tail<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, teal and red residues), but only 7 of the sites (S5, S8, S15, S44, S55, S62, S69) were unambiguously verified in an <italic>in vitro</italic> Aurora B phosphorylation assay using the wild-type bonsai as a substrate<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, red residues). In a recent study investigating HEC1 phosphorylation by Aurora B <italic>in vivo</italic> Ser4 and Thr49 were not probed<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. We therefore conservatively focused on the <italic>in vitro</italic> verified sites, although it is likely that Ser4 and Thr49 play a role <italic>in vivo</italic>. Importantly, both fall inside the two Aurora B zones we identified.</p><p id="P12">We made phosphomimetic serine to aspartic acid mutations in both zones individually and in combination. All phosphomimetic GST tail peptides showed significantly reduced microtubule binding relative to the wild-type control GST 1&#8211;80 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). The tail phosphomimetic in zone 2 showed a modest (20%) reduction microtubule binding, while tails phosphomimetic in zone 1 (GST 4D) and both zone 1 and zone 2 (GST 7D) showed severe reductions (60% and 80%, respectively). These results demonstrate that phosphorylation of zone 1 has a stronger negative impact on microtubule binding than phosphorlyation of zone 2, consistent with our finding that residues in zone 1 form a direct interaction with tubulin and supporting a functional segregation between the two Aurora B zones.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Interplay between the N-terminal tail and CH domains</title><p id="P13">We next examined the same set of phosphomimetic constructs, but this time in the context of the Ndc80 bonsai complex (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c,d</xref>). Again, all constructs showed a significant reduction in microtubule binding relative to the wild-type, although the effect of phosphomimetic mutations was more modest, presumably due to the contribution of the Ndc80&#8211;Nuf2 head domain to microtubule binding. Indeed, we found that the bonsai &#916;1&#8211;80 complex retained a tail-independent residual microtubule binding activity, as has been previously reported<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P14">As was the case with the GST tail peptides, phosphomimetic mutations in both zone 1 and zone 2 in combination produced the greatest reduction in MT binding (70%, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c,d</xref>). However, in the context of the Ndc80 bonsai phosphomimetic mutations in zone 2 (bonsai 3D) resulted in a slightly greater reduction in microtubule binding (35%) than mutations in zone 1 (bonsai 4D, 20%), the reverse of what we observed for the GST tail peptides. Since residues in zone 2 do not directly interact with tubulin, these results suggest that zone 2 mediates interactions between Ndc80c molecules that dominate apparent microtubule binding. Consistent with this observation, an Ndc80 complex lacking the first 40 amino acids of the tail (bonsai &#916;1&#8211;40) also showed significantly reduced binding compared to the wild-type (20%), even though these amino acids do not interact with tubulin. This construct nevertheless bound microtubules more robustly than the bonsai 3D construct, suggesting that phosphorylation of zone 2 negatively regulates the interaction between Ndc80c molecules.</p><p id="P15">Although our co-sedimentation assays report on the relative contributions of elements of the Ndc80 complex to microtubule binding, they do not address the underlying mechanism. To directly investigate the effects of mutations on cooperative microtubule binding, we turned to electron tomography to visualize and quantify Ndc80c clusters along protofilaments<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). We found that both the bonsai 4D and bonsai 3D mutants were significantly impaired in clustering (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>), with a most probable cluster size of 2 and 1, respectively, distributions that are statistically indistinguishable from each other but distinct from wild-type bonsai<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Both were capable of forming significantly larger clusters than the bonsai 7D mutant<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, or a complex completely lacking the tail<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> (bonsai &#916;1&#8211;80). These results suggest that the region of the tail that directly interacts with tubulin may also contribute to Ndc80c&#8211;Ndc80c binding in the context of a cluster. The bonsai &#916;1&#8211;40 mutant was still capable of clustering robustly, showing a distribution of cluster sizes similar to the wild-type bonsai (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>), consistent with our observation of higher microtubule-binding affinity for this mutant. This result further supports our model that phosphorlyation of zone 2 results in repulsion between Ndc80c molecules, even though this region is not strictly required for clustering.</p><p id="P16">In order to investigate the role of the two Aurora B phosphorylation zones <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used an RNAi knockdown and replacement protocol<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> in HeLa cells to assay kinetochore function during the first mitosis in cells that contained mutated Ndc80 proteins featuring phosphomimetic tails (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). As has previously been reported, we found that wild-type Ndc80 (WT Ndc80&#8211;GFP) rescued the RNAi phenotype, as indicated by a well-organized metaphase plate, while Ndc80 with a N-terminal tail phosphomimetic in both zone 1 and zone 2 (Ndc80 7D&#8211;GFP) resulted in a disorganized plate, consisting mostly of unaligned chromosomes. Phosphomimetic mutants in both zone 1 (Ndc80 4D&#8211;GFP) and zone 2 (Ndc80 3D&#8211;GFP) individually produced intermediate phenotypes; most cells had chromosomes that were poorly aligned or unaligned in both cases. These results demonstrate that zone 1, which is involved in Ndc80c&#8211;tubulin interactions, and zone 2, which is involved in Ndc80c&#8211;Ndc80c interactions, are both critical for Ndc80c function <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Delineating the path of the N-terminal tail</title><p id="P17">In order to structurally characterize tail&#8211;tubulin and tail&#8211;Ndc80c interactions, we turned to cryo-electron microscopy analysis (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Using a novel multi-model refinement strategy (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>) we were able to generate an improved reconstruction of wild-type Ndc80 bonsai bound to the microtubule (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a,c</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Movie 1</xref>) with a resolution of 7.9 &#197; (FSC 0.143 criterion, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). In this reconstruction all secondary structural features, including most loops, are resolved in both the bonsai globular head and tubulin. At a high threshold, two prominent densities are visible which are not accounted for by the docked crystal structure of bonsai &#916;1&#8211;80 and tubulin, which we designate densities 1 and 2 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). Density 1 extends directly from the amino terminus of the docked crystal structure of bonsai &#916;1&#8211;80 and thus very likely corresponds to the residues immediately preceding amino acid 80. Based on its length and assuming an extended polypeptide chain, this density would correspond approximately to residues 67&#8211;80, containing the first Aurora B site found in zone 1.</p><p id="P18">We next generated cryo-EM reconstructions of the bonsai 4D and bonsai &#916;1&#8211;40 mutants (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>), to structurally interrogate the positions of zone 1 and zone 2, respectively. Difference map analysis (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>) shows distinct peaks of density present in the wild-type complex that are absent from each of the two mutants. The bonsai &#916;1&#8211;40 difference density maps to the location of density 2 in the high-resolution wild-type reconstruction, suggesting that some of the residues in the 1&#8211;40 region, which contains zone 2 of Aurora B sites, make a major contribution to this density. The bonsai 4D difference density largely maps to the area between densities 1 and 2 and the base of density 2, consistent with a localization of zone 1 residues (40&#8211;67) to this area.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>The tubulin E hook interacts with both the Ndc80 tail and Nuf2</title><p id="P19">An examination of the high-resolution wild-type reconstruction at lower threshold (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Movie 2</xref>) shows additional density extending from the C-terminal end of the docked crystal structure of tubulin; by parsimony we attribute this density to an ordered portion of the tubulin C-terminus, or &#8220;E hook&#8221;<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. This density connects to both density 2, and to the CH domain of Nuf2 within an Ndc80c molecule whose toe (the region of the Ndc80 CH domain which contacts the globular portion of tubulin<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>) is bound to a laterally adjacent protofilament.</p><p id="P20">The density is branched, which has three potential explanations. The first is that our map represents a mixture of states in this region, because the E hooks of &#945; and &#946;-tubulin, which are indistinguishable in our reconstruction and thus averaged together, actually adopt different conformations. The second possibility is that one of the two branches corresponds to a portion of the N-terminal tail engaging the E hook (part of density 2). The third and most intriguing explanation is that the branch corresponds to polyglutamylation of the E hook<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> a post-translational modification which is enriched in brain<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> (the source of the tubulin used in our experiments), and the mitotic spindle<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Assuming an extended poly-peptide conformation, Glu254, the site of glutymalyation<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, would be near the branch point. If Ndc80c binding to microtubules were sensitive to the glutamylation state of tubulin, it would allow for an additional mechanism to regulate the interaction between kinetochores and microtubules. This hypothesis could be tested by measuring the affinity of Ndc80c for de-glutamylated microtubules, an experiment currently rendered difficult by the lack of purified deglutamylating enzymes<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P21">The E hook contact site on the CH domain of Nuf2 corresponds to a positively charged patch (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>) previously identified as being important for microtubule binding <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. <italic>In vivo</italic> it was found that multiple charge-reversal substitutions in this patch were required to generate a deleterious phenotype<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, consistent with an electrostatic interaction between Nuf2&#8217;s positive patch and the negatively charged E hook. The contact with density 2 corresponds to a direct interaction between the Ndc80 tail and the E hook that had been previously suggested based on biochemical studies <sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Based on the difference map analysis of the bonsai &#916;1&#8211;40 and our biochemical data with the GST peptides, we propose that the base of density 2 corresponds to residues in zone 1 that directly interact with the E hook, while the remainder of density 2 is composed of residues in the 1&#8211;40 region that become ordered upon Ndc80c clustering, potentially including zone 2 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>). In the context of Ndc80c clusters, the tubulin-binding region of the tail is precisely positioned by the tail&#8211;Ndc80c interaction, suggesting that microtubule binding and cluster formation are intimately linked. We also find that under conditions of limiting microtubule binding sites, the tail is unable to effectively compete with the wild-type bonsai complex despite being in excess (2:1 GST tail:Ndc80 bonsai) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Collectively our results support a 3-way interaction between the tail, the Ndc80&#8211;Nuf2 globular head, and the microtubule that is significantly stronger than the binary tail&#8211;microtubule interaction. This model is also in agreement with our finding that the presence of the full-length tail increases binding of the bonsai &#916;1&#8211;80 complex (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c,e</xref>).</p><p id="P22">While these results provide a rich description of Ndc80c&#8217;s microtubule-binding inside a cluster, the mechanism by which the complex engages the microtubule prior to cluster formation or at the edge of a cluster remains unknown, and is an important area for future research.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S9"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P23">The existence of two different zones of Aurora B phosphorylation sites, one of which regulates both Ndc80c&#8211;tubulin and Ndc80c&#8211;Ndc80c interactions (zone 1), the other of which negatively regulates Ndc80c&#8211;Ndc80c interactions (zone 2), suggests that there are multiple mechanisms by which Aurora B can regulate the Ndc80c&#8211;microtubule interface. In our reconstruction of the wild-type Ndc80 bonsai bound to the microtubule, residues in zone 2 are located on the periphery of the cluster and are more accessible, while residues in zone 1 are buried within the cluster. Thus, we speculate that residues in zone 2 may still be susceptible to phosphorylation by Aurora B once a cluster has formed, while residues in zone 1 may be protected from re-phosphorylation. This model is consistent with the recent report that all Aurora B sites in the tail are highly phosphorylated in early stages of cell division, after which sites in zone 2 remain phosphorylated at an intermediate level while sites in zone 1 are dephosphorylated<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Our finding that phosphorylation in zone 2 negatively regulates cluster formation suggests that the cell may dynamically regulate the degree of Ndc80c clustering throughout mitosis, even after microtubule attachment has occurred.</p><p id="P24">In our model the Ndc80 complex begins prometaphase with zones 1 and 2 maximally phosphorylated at an unattached kinetochore. We propose that once proper attachment is achieved the tail is de-phosphorylated and Ndc80c clusters are formed (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). Given the recent revised estimate that there are ~20 copies of the Ndc80 complex per kinetochore microtubule<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>, we believe that the high local concentration of the complex on the microtubule surface makes clustering likely <italic>in vivo</italic>. Zone 1 would become buried upon cluster formation and inaccessible for re-phosphorylation, while zone 2 would remain available as an Aurora B substrate, thereby acting as a cluster clutch. During metaphase, aligned chromosomes undergo oscillatory motions across the metaphase plate with a period of tens of seconds<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. It was recently found that cells expressing a version of the Ndc80 complex which could not be phosphorylated by Aurora B did not support chromosome oscillations<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>; we thus speculate that zone 2 may be dynamically phosphorylated and dephosphorylated during oscillations.</p><p id="P25">If clusters were strongly disrupted, it is possible that zone 1 would also become re-accessible for phosphorylation by Aurora B, although this may not happen on a physiologically relevant time scale. Deluca <italic>et al.</italic> found that phospho-specific antibodies against Aurora B sites in the Ndc80 tail still reacted with the kinetochores of chromosomes that had not yet achieved biorientation upon nocodazole treatment to depolymerize microtubules<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Unexpectedly, however, antibodies against zone 1 did not react with the kinetochores of chromosomes that had achieved bi-orientation, even though kinetochore microtubules were no longer present and Aurora B activity was not down-regulated, while antibodies against zone 2 showed some reactivity. It is tempting to speculate that as a stable (bi-oriented) kinetochore&#8211;microtubule attachment matures, additional factors sequester zone 1 of the Ndc80 tail, either through direct interaction with this region or by stabilizing Ndc80c clusters independently from microtubules. Interestingly, it appears that zone 2 still remains somewhat accessible. The detailed kinetics of microtubule-bound Ndc80c phosphorylation by Aurora B is an important subject for future studies <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, as is the potential role of the Ndc80 tail in mediating interactions between kinetochore complexes.</p><p id="P26">Our high-resolution cryo-EM reconstruction corresponds to the fully de-phosphorylated state (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). We previously found that the dephosporylated form of Ndc80c strongly enhanced microtubule stability against depolymerization by cold, promoting straight microtubule tubulin polymers<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Our improved cryo-EM reconstruction provides a richer mechanistic explanation for effect: in addition to promoting a straight tubulin conformation by wedging its toe into both intradimer and interdimer longitudinal interfaces, where protofilaments bend during microtubule depolymerization, and by oligomerizing along protofilaments, with the consequent stabilization of longitudinal contacts, the complex also engages a neighboring protofilament via the C-terminus of tubulin, stabilizing lateral contacts. Thus, the dephosphorylated complex is optimized, via a three-component mechanism, to promote microtubule stability and polymerization.</p><p id="P27">We envision zone 2 could be re-phosphorylated, loosening or disrupting Ndc80c clusters and making the complex more mobile on the microtubule surface and thus capable of tracking depolymerizing ends via a biased diffusion mechanism (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>.

The interactions formed by zones 1 and 2 of the Ndc80 tail are numbered, and tubulin E hook&#8211;Nuf2 CH interactions are depicted as red circles. For simplicity only interactions within the Ndc80c cluster are shown. In this configuration, the cluster can promote both tubulin longitudinal contacts along protofilaments, through its toe&#8211;tubulin interactions, and lateral contacts between protofilaments, by interacting with tubulin E hooks from a neighboring protofilament. This network of interactions has a cumulative effect on microtubule stability. (<bold>b</bold>) Cartoon of Ndc80c phosphorylated in zone 2 but not zone 1. We envision that in this state the complex will remain attached to the MT surface but in the context of smaller and looser clusters. In some cases a weak interaction between Ndc80 complexes may still be maintained via zone 1 (top panel, left), while in other cases all cooperative interactions may be absent (bottom panel). This intermediate phosphorylation state may enhance the mobility of the complex, enabling kinetochore tracking on depolymerizing microtubule ends by a biased diffusion mechanism.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms407588f6"/></fig></floats-group></article>
