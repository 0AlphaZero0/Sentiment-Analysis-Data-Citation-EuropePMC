</text></title><p id="P3"><text><SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Ndc80 complex (Ndc80c), a member of the conserved KMN (Knl1 complex, Mis12 complex, Ndc80 complex) network1, has been identified as a primary site of kinetochore-microtubule attachment2–5 and a necessary factor for the proper operation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC)6–8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The complex is a heterotetramer of Ndc80 (also known as HEC1 in humans9), Nuf2, Spc24, and Spc25, each of which features a globular head domain and a coiled-coil stalk that mediates dimerization into subcomplexes: Ndc80 with Nuf2 and Spc24 with Spc2510,11. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The tetramerization interface is formed by the dimerized coiled-coils, resulting in an elongated, dumbbell architecture10–12. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The Ndc80–Nuf2 coiled-coil features a break halfway along its length that imparts flexibility by acting as a molecular hinge12, and which may also act as a binding site for other factors13. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The Spc24–25 head, which has a unique fold14, mediates kinetochore association by direct interaction with the Mis12 linker complex15,16. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The Ndc80-Nuf2 head is formed by the tandem association of calponin-homology (CH) domains contributed by each protein17,18 and mediates microtubule binding1,17,18. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P4"><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In addition to the Ndc80–Nuf2 head, microtubule association in vitro and in vivo depends on the disordered N-terminal tail of the Ndc80 protein19,20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The tail can be phosphorylated on multiple residues by Aurora B kinase1,5,21, which reduces the affinity of the Ndc80c for microtubules in vitro1,18 and destabilizes improper kinetochore-microtubule attachments in vivo5,19,20,22. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Although an unstructured, Aurora B-regulated tail is a conserved feature of the Ndc80 protein in all eukaryotes, the region is highly divergent in sequence and length, making functionally relevant features difficult to identify by bioinformatic methods. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P5"><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>We therefore set out to experimentally characterize in detail the role of this key 80 amino acid region in human Ndc80 complex function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>We previously reported a sub-nanometer resolution cryo-EM reconstruction of an engineered version of the human Ndc80c (Ndc80 bonsai18) bound to the microtubule23, revealing tail-dependent oligomerization of the complex on the microtubule surface and details of the interaction between the Ndc80 CH domain and tubulin’s globular domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Here we extend our analysis of the tail, delineating in detail its interactions with tubulin and the Ndc80–Nuf2 globular head when bound to the microtubule. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Using a combination of biochemical, structural, and cell biological methods we dissect the physiological role of specific Aurora B sites and provide support for a model in which dynamic Aurora B phosphorylation of the Ndc80c can support directed chromosome motions during mitosis24 in addition to promoting proper attachment. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P6"><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Examination of the primary sequence of the Ndc80 N-terminal tail (Fig. 1a) shows two distinct regions of Aurora B phosphorylation sites separated by a proline-rich linker. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>We refer to the cluster of sites found between amino acids 40–80 as “zone 1” and those found between amino acids 1–20 as “zone 2.” We previously found that the tail plays a role in the formation of phospho-regulated Ndc80c clusters along microtubule protofilaments in vitro23, suggesting that this segment mediates protein-protein interactions between Ndc80c molecules in addition to contacting tubulin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In order to probe these two activities of the tail, we removed it from the context of the entire complex and fused it to GST for primary structure-function analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>All GST tail peptides were well-expressed and soluble (Supplementary Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Guided by the positions of the two Aurora B phosphorylation regions, we created a number of constructs to test microtubule binding and tail–Ndc80c interactions (Fig. 1a,b). </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="S4"><title><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Identification of the microtubule-binding region </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="P7"><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>We first performed microtubule co-sedimentation assays as described previously18,23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>When compared to the negative control of GST alone, which we found does not interact with microtubules (Fig. 1c,d), we found that the full-length tail (GST 1–80) showed significant interaction with microtubules independently of the CH domains of Ndc80 and Nuf2, as had been reported previously for HEC1 residues 1–80 in the absence of GST20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>This activity is conferred by residues 40–80, as both GST 40–80 and GST 20–80 bound microtubules as well as the full-length tail in our assay, while GST 1–40, GST 1–20 and GST 20–40 showed negligible microtubule binding activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>GST 40–60 displayed weaker but still significant microtubule binding activity, while GST 60–80 did not, suggesting that residues from both of these regions are necessary for full binding. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P8"><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>We therefore made finer truncations of the 40–80 region in three amino-acid steps and identified residues 47–68 as the minimal tubulin-binding region of the tail (Supplementary Fig. 2A–D), corresponding very closely to zone 1 of Aurora B sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>This is the most conserved region of the tail, with residues 49–61 showing modest but detectable conservation in all eukaryotes except nematodes and insects and the Aurora B site at Ser55 displaying the highest level of conservation (Supplementary Fig. 2e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, most species feature prolines adjacent to this region (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 2e), suggesting that the architecture of the tail may be conserved although the sequence is not. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P9"><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>We next investigated the ability of the tail to interact with the Ndc80c in trans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Using GST pull-down assays we were unable to detect an interaction between the tail and the Ndc80c (Supplementary Fig. 3), in agreement with the observation that the Ndc80c does not form clusters in the absence of MTs23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>We therefore turned to an indirect assay: we mixed microtubules with an Ndc80 complex lacking the tail (bonsai Δ1–80), which is deficient in microtubule binding18, in the presence and absence of our GST tail constructs, reasoning that constructs containing both microtubule-binding and Ndc80c-binding elements would increase the apparent affinity of the bonsai Δ1–80 for microtubules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Bonsai Δ1–80 showed a significant increase in binding only in the presence of GST 1–80 (Fig. 1c,e), suggesting the N-terminal half of the tail, particularly zone 2, containing the second cluster of Aurora B sites, is important for tail–Ndc80c interaction in trans in the context of the microtubule. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P10"><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>These results suggested an approximate functional segregation of the tail into two regions: a tubulin binding region and an Ndc80c binding region, each of which contains a cluster of Aurora B sites. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P11"><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>We next investigated if the two zones of Aurora B sites differentially regulated tail–tubulin binding and tail–Ndc80c binding, and by extension Ndc80c–microtubule binding and cluster formation, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Nine Aurora B phosphorylation sites (S4, S5, S8, S15, S44, T49, S55, S62, S69) have been reported in the tail19 (Fig. 1a, teal and red residues), but only 7 of the sites (S5, S8, S15, S44, S55, S62, S69) were unambiguously verified in an in vitro Aurora B phosphorylation assay using the wild-type bonsai as a substrate18 (Fig. 1a, red residues). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>In a recent study investigating HEC1 phosphorylation by Aurora B in vivo Ser4 and Thr49 were not probed24. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>We therefore conservatively focused on the in vitro verified sites, although it is likely that Ser4 and Thr49 play a role in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Importantly, both fall inside the two Aurora B zones we identified. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P12"><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>We made phosphomimetic serine to aspartic acid mutations in both zones individually and in combination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>All phosphomimetic GST tail peptides showed significantly reduced microtubule binding relative to the wild-type control GST 1–80 (Fig. 2a,b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The tail phosphomimetic in zone 2 showed a modest (20%) reduction microtubule binding, while tails phosphomimetic in zone 1 (GST 4D) and both zone 1 and zone 2 (GST 7D) showed severe reductions (60% and 80%, respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that phosphorylation of zone 1 has a stronger negative impact on microtubule binding than phosphorlyation of zone 2, consistent with our finding that residues in zone 1 form a direct interaction with tubulin and supporting a functional segregation between the two Aurora B zones. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="S6"><title><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Interplay between the N-terminal tail and CH domains </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="P13"><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>We next examined the same set of phosphomimetic constructs, but this time in the context of the Ndc80 bonsai complex (Fig. 2c,d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Again, all constructs showed a significant reduction in microtubule binding relative to the wild-type, although the effect of phosphomimetic mutations was more modest, presumably due to the contribution of the Ndc80–Nuf2 head domain to microtubule binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Indeed, we found that the bonsai Δ1–80 complex retained a tail-independent residual microtubule binding activity, as has been previously reported17,18. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P14"><text><SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>As was the case with the GST tail peptides, phosphomimetic mutations in both zone 1 and zone 2 in combination produced the greatest reduction in MT binding (70%, Fig. 2c,d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>However, in the context of the Ndc80 bonsai phosphomimetic mutations in zone 2 (bonsai 3D) resulted in a slightly greater reduction in microtubule binding (35%) than mutations in zone 1 (bonsai 4D, 20%), the reverse of what we observed for the GST tail peptides. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Since residues in zone 2 do not directly interact with tubulin, these results suggest that zone 2 mediates interactions between Ndc80c molecules that dominate apparent microtubule binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this observation, an Ndc80 complex lacking the first 40 amino acids of the tail (bonsai Δ1–40) also showed significantly reduced binding compared to the wild-type (20%), even though these amino acids do not interact with tubulin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>This construct nevertheless bound microtubules more robustly than the bonsai 3D construct, suggesting that phosphorylation of zone 2 negatively regulates the interaction between Ndc80c molecules. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P15"><text><SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Although our co-sedimentation assays report on the relative contributions of elements of the Ndc80 complex to microtubule binding, they do not address the underlying mechanism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>To directly investigate the effects of mutations on cooperative microtubule binding, we turned to electron tomography to visualize and quantify Ndc80c clusters along protofilaments23 (Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>We found that both the bonsai 4D and bonsai 3D mutants were significantly impaired in clustering (Fig. 3b), with a most probable cluster size of 2 and 1, respectively, distributions that are statistically indistinguishable from each other but distinct from wild-type bonsai23 (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Both were capable of forming significantly larger clusters than the bonsai 7D mutant23, or a complex completely lacking the tail23 (bonsai Δ1–80). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the region of the tail that directly interacts with tubulin may also contribute to Ndc80c–Ndc80c binding in the context of a cluster. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The bonsai Δ1–40 mutant was still capable of clustering robustly, showing a distribution of cluster sizes similar to the wild-type bonsai (Fig. 3b), consistent with our observation of higher microtubule-binding affinity for this mutant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>This result further supports our model that phosphorlyation of zone 2 results in repulsion between Ndc80c molecules, even though this region is not strictly required for clustering. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P16"><text><SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate the role of the two Aurora B phosphorylation zones in vivo, we used an RNAi knockdown and replacement protocol20,25 in HeLa cells to assay kinetochore function during the first mitosis in cells that contained mutated Ndc80 proteins featuring phosphomimetic tails (Fig. 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>As has previously been reported, we found that wild-type Ndc80 (WT Ndc80–GFP) rescued the RNAi phenotype, as indicated by a well-organized metaphase plate, while Ndc80 with a N-terminal tail phosphomimetic in both zone 1 and zone 2 (Ndc80 7D–GFP) resulted in a disorganized plate, consisting mostly of unaligned chromosomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Phosphomimetic mutants in both zone 1 (Ndc80 4D–GFP) and zone 2 (Ndc80 3D–GFP) individually produced intermediate phenotypes; most cells had chromosomes that were poorly aligned or unaligned in both cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that zone 1, which is involved in Ndc80c–tubulin interactions, and zone 2, which is involved in Ndc80c–Ndc80c interactions, are both critical for Ndc80c function in vivo. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P17"><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>In order to structurally characterize tail–tubulin and tail–Ndc80c interactions, we turned to cryo-electron microscopy analysis (Fig. 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Using a novel multi-model refinement strategy (Supplementary Fig. 4a) we were able to generate an improved reconstruction of wild-type Ndc80 bonsai bound to the microtubule (Fig. 5a,c, Supplementary Movie 1) with a resolution of 7.9 Å (FSC 0.143 criterion, Supplementary Fig. 4b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>In this reconstruction all secondary structural features, including most loops, are resolved in both the bonsai globular head and tubulin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>At a high threshold, two prominent densities are visible which are not accounted for by the docked crystal structure of bonsai Δ1–80 and tubulin, which we designate densities 1 and 2 (Fig. 5a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Density 1 extends directly from the amino terminus of the docked crystal structure of bonsai Δ1–80 and thus very likely corresponds to the residues immediately preceding amino acid 80. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Based on its length and assuming an extended polypeptide chain, this density would correspond approximately to residues 67–80, containing the first Aurora B site found in zone 1. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P18"><text><SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>We next generated cryo-EM reconstructions of the bonsai 4D and bonsai Δ1–40 mutants (Supplementary Fig. 5), to structurally interrogate the positions of zone 1 and zone 2, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Difference map analysis (Fig. 5b) shows distinct peaks of density present in the wild-type complex that are absent from each of the two mutants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>The bonsai Δ1–40 difference density maps to the location of density 2 in the high-resolution wild-type reconstruction, suggesting that some of the residues in the 1–40 region, which contains zone 2 of Aurora B sites, make a major contribution to this density. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>The bonsai 4D difference density largely maps to the area between densities 1 and 2 and the base of density 2, consistent with a localization of zone 1 residues (40–67) to this area. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="S8"><title><text><SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>The tubulin E hook interacts with both the Ndc80 tail and Nuf2 </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="P19"><text><SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>An examination of the high-resolution wild-type reconstruction at lower threshold (Fig. 5c, Supplementary Movie 2) shows additional density extending from the C-terminal end of the docked crystal structure of tubulin; by parsimony we attribute this density to an ordered portion of the tubulin C-terminus, or “E hook”26. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>This density connects to both density 2, and to the CH domain of Nuf2 within an Ndc80c molecule whose toe (the region of the Ndc80 CH domain which contacts the globular portion of tubulin27) is bound to a laterally adjacent protofilament. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P20"><text><SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>The density is branched, which has three potential explanations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>The first is that our map represents a mixture of states in this region, because the E hooks of α and β-tubulin, which are indistinguishable in our reconstruction and thus averaged together, actually adopt different conformations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>The second possibility is that one of the two branches corresponds to a portion of the N-terminal tail engaging the E hook (part of density 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>The third and most intriguing explanation is that the branch corresponds to polyglutamylation of the E hook28 a post-translational modification which is enriched in brain29 (the source of the tubulin used in our experiments), and the mitotic spindle30. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Assuming an extended poly-peptide conformation, Glu254, the site of glutymalyation28, would be near the branch point. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>If Ndc80c binding to microtubules were sensitive to the glutamylation state of tubulin, it would allow for an additional mechanism to regulate the interaction between kinetochores and microtubules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis could be tested by measuring the affinity of Ndc80c for de-glutamylated microtubules, an experiment currently rendered difficult by the lack of purified deglutamylating enzymes31. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P21"><text><SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>The E hook contact site on the CH domain of Nuf2 corresponds to a positively charged patch (Fig. 5e) previously identified as being important for microtubule binding in vitro18. In vivo it was found that multiple charge-reversal substitutions in this patch were required to generate a deleterious phenotype32, consistent with an electrostatic interaction between Nuf2’s positive patch and the negatively charged E hook. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>The contact with density 2 corresponds to a direct interaction between the Ndc80 tail and the E hook that had been previously suggested based on biochemical studies 19,20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Based on the difference map analysis of the bonsai Δ1–40 and our biochemical data with the GST peptides, we propose that the base of density 2 corresponds to residues in zone 1 that directly interact with the E hook, while the remainder of density 2 is composed of residues in the 1–40 region that become ordered upon Ndc80c clustering, potentially including zone 2 (Fig. 5d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>In the context of Ndc80c clusters, the tubulin-binding region of the tail is precisely positioned by the tail–Ndc80c interaction, suggesting that microtubule binding and cluster formation are intimately linked. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>We also find that under conditions of limiting microtubule binding sites, the tail is unable to effectively compete with the wild-type bonsai complex despite being in excess (2:1 GST tail:Ndc80 bonsai) (Supplementary Fig. 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Collectively our results support a 3-way interaction between the tail, the Ndc80–Nuf2 globular head, and the microtubule that is significantly stronger than the binary tail–microtubule interaction. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P23"><text><SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>The existence of two different zones of Aurora B phosphorylation sites, one of which regulates both Ndc80c–tubulin and Ndc80c–Ndc80c interactions (zone 1), the other of which negatively regulates Ndc80c–Ndc80c interactions (zone 2), suggests that there are multiple mechanisms by which Aurora B can regulate the Ndc80c–microtubule interface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>In our reconstruction of the wild-type Ndc80 bonsai bound to the microtubule, residues in zone 2 are located on the periphery of the cluster and are more accessible, while residues in zone 1 are buried within the cluster. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Thus, we speculate that residues in zone 2 may still be susceptible to phosphorylation by Aurora B once a cluster has formed, while residues in zone 1 may be protected from re-phosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>This model is consistent with the recent report that all Aurora B sites in the tail are highly phosphorylated in early stages of cell division, after which sites in zone 2 remain phosphorylated at an intermediate level while sites in zone 1 are dephosphorylated24. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Our finding that phosphorylation in zone 2 negatively regulates cluster formation suggests that the cell may dynamically regulate the degree of Ndc80c clustering throughout mitosis, even after microtubule attachment has occurred. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P24"><text><SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>In our model the Ndc80 complex begins prometaphase with zones 1 and 2 maximally phosphorylated at an unattached kinetochore. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>We propose that once proper attachment is achieved the tail is de-phosphorylated and Ndc80c clusters are formed (Fig. 6a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Given the recent revised estimate that there are ~20 copies of the Ndc80 complex per kinetochore microtubule33, we believe that the high local concentration of the complex on the microtubule surface makes clustering likely in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Zone 1 would become buried upon cluster formation and inaccessible for re-phosphorylation, while zone 2 would remain available as an Aurora B substrate, thereby acting as a cluster clutch. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>During metaphase, aligned chromosomes undergo oscillatory motions across the metaphase plate with a period of tens of seconds34,35. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>It was recently found that cells expressing a version of the Ndc80 complex which could not be phosphorylated by Aurora B did not support chromosome oscillations24; we thus speculate that zone 2 may be dynamically phosphorylated and dephosphorylated during oscillations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P25"><text><SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>If clusters were strongly disrupted, it is possible that zone 1 would also become re-accessible for phosphorylation by Aurora B, although this may not happen on a physiologically relevant time scale. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Deluca et al. found that phospho-specific antibodies against Aurora B sites in the Ndc80 tail still reacted with the kinetochores of chromosomes that had not yet achieved biorientation upon nocodazole treatment to depolymerize microtubules24. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, however, antibodies against zone 1 did not react with the kinetochores of chromosomes that had achieved bi-orientation, even though kinetochore microtubules were no longer present and Aurora B activity was not down-regulated, while antibodies against zone 2 showed some reactivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>It is tempting to speculate that as a stable (bi-oriented) kinetochore–microtubule attachment matures, additional factors sequester zone 1 of the Ndc80 tail, either through direct interaction with this region or by stabilizing Ndc80c clusters independently from microtubules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, it appears that zone 2 still remains somewhat accessible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>The detailed kinetics of microtubule-bound Ndc80c phosphorylation by Aurora B is an important subject for future studies in vivo and in vitro, as is the potential role of the Ndc80 tail in mediating interactions between kinetochore complexes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P26"><text><SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Our high-resolution cryo-EM reconstruction corresponds to the fully de-phosphorylated state (Fig. 6a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>We previously found that the dephosporylated form of Ndc80c strongly enhanced microtubule stability against depolymerization by cold, promoting straight microtubule tubulin polymers23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Our improved cryo-EM reconstruction provides a richer mechanistic explanation for effect: in addition to promoting a straight tubulin conformation by wedging its toe into both intradimer and interdimer longitudinal interfaces, where protofilaments bend during microtubule depolymerization, and by oligomerizing along protofilaments, with the consequent stabilization of longitudinal contacts, the complex also engages a neighboring protofilament via the C-terminus of tubulin, stabilizing lateral contacts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Thus, the dephosphorylated complex is optimized, via a three-component mechanism, to promote microtubule stability and polymerization. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P27"><text><SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>We envision zone 2 could be re-phosphorylated, loosening or disrupting Ndc80c clusters and making the complex more mobile on the microtubule surface and thus capable of tracking depolymerizing ends via a biased diffusion mechanism (Fig. 6b)36. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>The presence of other microtubule-binding outer kinetochore components, such as the Ska complex37–39, which cooperates with the KMN network40,41, kinesins, and plus-tip tracking proteins, are also likely to alter the architecture of the kinetochore–microtubule attachment site to promote microtubule growth under certain conditions and enable processive tracking along depolymerizing microtubule ends in others. </plain></SENT>
