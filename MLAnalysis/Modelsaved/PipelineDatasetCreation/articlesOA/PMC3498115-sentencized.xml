</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The TPPPs, a new eukaryotic protein family, has recently been identified [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Its first member, the Tubulin Polymerization Promoting Protein, TPPP/p25, was originally found as a brain-specific protein, p25alpha, with unknown function [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>It is mainly expressed in differentiated oligodendrocytes [4]–[7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>This small, basic, unstructured protein promotes tubulin polymerization into normal and double-walled microtubules and induces their bundling [8]–[10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>It exhibits Microtubule Associated Protein (MAP)-like function by the stabilization of the microtubular network [10]–[12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Under pathological conditions, TPPP/p25 is enriched in glial and neuronal inclusions in synucleinopathies as Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy [13], [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has also been suggested that TPPP/p25 may work as a protective factor for cells against the damage effects of the accumulation of abnormal forms of prion protein [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>There are three TPPP paralogs in the human genome; denoted as TPPP/p25, TPPP2/p18 and TPPP3/p20 (shortly TPPP1, TPPP2 and TPPP3, respectively), indicating their molecular mass [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>TPPP3 but not TPPP2 shares the MAP-like features of TPPP1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The common C-terminal part of the three proteins (55–219 amino acids in TPPP1) is denoted as p25alpha domain, Pfam05517 or IPR008907, which corresponds practically to the whole sequence of TPPP2 or. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>There are no data about the function of these proteins except two human paralogs which are involved in developmental processes of the brain (TPPP1) [7], [12] and the musculoskeletal system (TPPP3) [16], respectively. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In this paper I have investigated the conservation of this protein/gene family and the occurrence of the p25alpha domain in a systematic bioinformatics study. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>The TPPP gene was considered to be conserved in the genomes of ciliated/flagellated eukaryotes but to be absent from those that are non-ciliated [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>(Eukaryotic cilia/flagella are organelles with a microtubule-based cytoskeleton called the axoneme.) Although the strength of this relationship seems to be slightly weakened since TPPP genes (but not yet proteins) were identified in a few land plants without these organelles [38] but the ancient origin of this protein family is supported by the ancient origin of the eukaryote cilia/flagella and by the fact that its members are widely distributed in the phylogenomic “supergroups” (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>TPPP-like proteins can be found in taxa of all the six eukaryotic supergroups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>As suggested recently, eukaryotes can be divided into three monophyletic megagroups: unikonts, photosynthetic megagroup, Excavata [28], [29]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>Although in some cases lateral gene transfer might happen (see above), considering the wide phyletic distribution of TPPPs, I can suggest that long- and short-type TPPPs and the partial p25-alpha domain were present in the last common ancestor of eukaryotes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>If we consider the present view of the eukaryote tree of life [28], [29], [56], we can conclude that the loss of short-type TPPP could occur in the common ancestor of the ‘unikonts’, which was followed by the loss of long-type TPPP in the common ancestor of Amoebozoa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the common ancestor of the ‘photosynthetic megagroup’ still contained all the three kinds of genes but the long-type TPPP could be lost in the ancestor of the SAR (stramenopiles, Alveolata, Rhizaria) group and preserved in Archaeplastida. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>Thus short- and long-type TPPPs are different proteins which are in close relation and can be can considered as “outparalogs”. </plain></SENT>
