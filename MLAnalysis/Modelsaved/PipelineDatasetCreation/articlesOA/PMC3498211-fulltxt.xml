Sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) are the master transcription factors controlling the homeostasis of fatty acids and cholesterol in the body. Transcription, expression, and activity of SREBPs are regulated by various nutritional, hormonal or stressful stimuli, yet the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in these adaptative responses remains elusive. In the present study, we found that overexpressed acyl-CoA binding domain containing 3 (ACBD3), a Golgi-associated protein, dramatically inhibited SREBP1-sensitive promoter activity of fatty acid synthase (FASN). Moreover, lipid deprivation-stimulated SREBP1 maturation was significantly attenuated by ACBD3. With cell fractionation, gene knockdown and immunoprecipitation assays, it was showed that ACBD3 blocked intracellular maturation of SREBP1 probably through directly binding with the lipid regulator rather than disrupted SREBP1-SCAP-Insig1 interaction. Further investigation revealed that acyl-CoA domain-containing N-terminal sequence of ACBD3 contributed to its inhibitory effects on the production of nuclear SREBP1. In addition, mRNA and protein levels of FASN and de novo palmitate biosynthesis were remarkably reduced in cells overexpressed with ACBD3. These findings suggest that ACBD3 plays an essential role in maintaining lipid homeostasis via regulating SREBP1's processing pathway and thus impacting cellular lipogenesis.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Young Investigator Award from National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression and the grants from National Institutes of Health, DK084336, HD026979, and MH079614 (to SFK).

There are three well-characterized SREBP isoforms in mammals: SREBP1A, SREBP1C and SREBP2 <xref rid="pone.0049906-Horton1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. They are the master regulators of lipid homeostasis in the cells through controlling expression of over 30 genes, such as fatty acid synthase (FASN), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), low-density lipoprotein receptor, HMG-CoA reductase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase, ATP citrate lysase and Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase <xref rid="pone.0049906-Shimano1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049906-Espenshade1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. This list of SREBP target genes is continuously expanded. For an example, a recent report by Walker et al. revealed that S-adenosylmethionine synthetase type 1, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, methionine synthase and several other related genes were regulated by SREBP1 <xref rid="pone.0049906-Walker1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Those SREBP target genes are required for biosynthesis of fatty acid, cholesterol, triglyceride and phospholipids. The activity of SREBP1A markedly increases the expression of genes involved in both cholesterol and fatty acid. SREBP1C demonstrates a slight selectivity, but lower activity, on fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis. SREBP2 causes a preferential induction of genes related to cholesterol biosynthesis <xref rid="pone.0049906-Ferre1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049906-Eberle1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>SREBPs are initially synthesized and are located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as full-length precursor proteins (fSREBPs) forming a complex with SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) and insulin induced gene (Insig). Upon receiving activation signals, the fSREBPs are transported to Golgi apparatus where they are cleaved sequentially by site 1 protease and site 2 protease. The newly-generated N-terminal fragments (nSREBPs) then translocate into nucleus, bind on both E-boxes and sterol regulatory elements within the promoter regions of their targets and stimulate lipogenic gene transcription <xref rid="pone.0049906-Horton1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049906-Eberle1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Acyl-coenzyme A binding domain containing 3 (ACBD3) is recognized as a Golgi-associated protein, although small levels of protein expression can be detected in cytoplasm, ER and mitochondria <xref rid="pone.0049906-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049906-Fan1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. During cell mitosis, the Golgi-associated section of ACBD3 is released into cytosol due to Golgi structure disintegration <xref rid="pone.0049906-Fan1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Previous studies have suggested this ubiquitously expressed protein plays several biological functions such as lipid metabolism, iron-related neurotoxicity, membrane trafficking, neuronal division, neurogenesis, development, and virus replication. Through involving in protein kinase A-mediated signaling, ACBD3 facilitates cholesterol entry into mitochondria and thus steroidogenesis <xref rid="pone.0049906-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. We previously showed that ACBD3 bound with Dexras1 and DMT1 to enormously promote iron uptake in neurons, which contributed to the NMDA-induced excitotoxicity <xref rid="pone.0049906-Cheah1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Through interacting with integral Golgi membrane protein giantin, ACBD3 is implicated in the structure maintenance of Golgi and ER-to-Golgi protein trafficking <xref rid="pone.0049906-Sohda1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. During mitotic Golgi fragmentation, ACBD3 was found to physically interact with Numb protein and functionally modulate Numb signaling, which is critical for neural progenitor cell's asymmetric division and neurogenesis <xref rid="pone.0049906-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Embryonic lethality of ACBD3 homozygous knockout mice indicates that this protein is critical for embryonic development <xref rid="pone.0049906-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.

Since ACBD3 contains an acyl CoA-binding domain at its N-terminus and is involved in steroid biosynthesis, and SREBP proteins are the regulators of lipid homeostasis in cells, we were interested to investigate whether ACBD3 plays a role in homeostasis of lipids, especially fatty acids, and how ACBD3 affects expression and function of SREBP1. In the present study, we showed that overexpressed ACBD3 down-regulated the nuclear mature form of SREBP1 and inhibited its transcriptional activity, ultimately attenuating FASN expression and activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>ACBD3 inhibits SREBP1-promoted FASN transcription</title><p>Since FASN is one SREBP1 target gene and an essential multi-function enzyme in the de novo fatty acid biosynthesis pathway <xref rid="pone.0049906-Menendez1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, we employed a luciferase reporter vector, encoding a sterol regulatory element (SRE)-containing FASN promoter sequence fused with firefly luciferase to assess how ACBD3 overexpression changed FASN promoter activity.

We overexpressed full length SREBP1A and FASN reporter construct with or without ACBD3 and measured luciferase activity.

On the other hand, lipid-repletion incubation gave rise to the opposite response for nuclear SREBP1. Those observations suggested that our lipid manipulation successfully initiated SREBP1 adaptative responses. When ACBD3-overexpressing cells were exposed to the lipid-deprivation condition, a prominent attenuation of the depletion-initiated SREBP1 feedback was observed, even though the upregulating trend of nSREBP still existed.

We found that, in the cell total lysate, overexpressed Myc-ACBD3 greatly down-regulated mature form (&#8764;60 KDa) but up-regulated full-length form (&#8764;120 KDa) of endogenous SREBP1 in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049906-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Overexpression of GST- or GFP-tagged ACBD3 caused the identical regulation pattern of SREBP1 as the Myc-tagged protein did (data not shown). Furthermore, cell fractionation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049906-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) showed that ACBD3 reduced the nuclear mature SREBP1 but increased the full-length membrane form in a dose-dependent manner.

Hence we wondered whether any of these domains specifically played a role in regulating SREBP1. With the luciferase assay, it was shown that the deletion of the N-terminal region (1&#8211;171) in ACBD3 (&#916;N) significantly attenuated ACBD3-mediated suppression of FASN promoter activity, (40% vs. 76%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049906-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). This change pattern did not vary in the presence of overexpressed SREBP1A. Similarly, even though this mutant was found to disrupt the production of nuclear mature form of SREBP1, its disruptive effect was still smaller than that mediated by full-length ACBD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049906-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). However, the other deletion mutant of ACBD3 without the C-terminal GOLD domain (&#916;C) showed comparable inhibitory effect on SREBP1's maturation and transcriptional function as the full-length protein.

These data significantly broaden our views on the biological roles played by ACBD3 and provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying how lipid-binding proteins affect lipid homeostasis.</p><p>In cells, there are several families of lipid-binding proteins such as ACBDs, FATPs and FABPs, which function coordinately to regulate homeostasis and function of fatty acids. Entry of free fatty acids into the cells can be mediated through either passively diffusing through cell membrane or actively uptaking by FATPs.

According to the findings of the present study, biological functions of ACBD3 are expanded significantly into area of de novo lipogenesis to modulate fatty acid biosynthesis. Due to the embryonic lethality induced by ACBD3 gene knockout in mice and the fundamental nature of fatty acids in cell survival, growth, proliferation and death, the physiological and pathological roles undertaken by ACBD3 appear to be more important and complicated than those currently recognized in the field.</p><p>Intracellular SREBPs can be modulated by different nutritional and hormonal cues at several levels, including transcription, translation, processing (maturation) and degradation.

Together, all of these observations indicated that SREBP-regulated lipogenic pathway represents a fundamental adaptation mechanism, which is critical for cells to response to their dynamically-changed living environment.</p><p>Our results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049906-g003">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0049906.s001">S1A</xref> clearly showed dose-dependent reduction of nuclear SREBP1 (nSREBP1) and the corresponding enhancement of membrane form (fSREBP1) at 48 hours after ACBD3 vector transfection. Moreover, it was displayed that ACBD3 physically bound with fSREBP1 but not nSREBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049906-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Meanwhile, our results excluded possibility that ACBD3-inhibited SREBP1 maturation is due to ACBD3's disturbing effect on the physical interaction among SREBP1-SCAP-Insig1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0049906.s003">Figure S3</xref>). These findings strongly implicated that ACBD3, via binding with a non-N-terminal domain of fSREBP1 on the Golgi membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049906-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), blocks a process of S1P/S2P-mediated proteolytic cleavage. Considering ACBD3's putative inhibitory function on ER-to-Golgi vesicular trafficking <xref rid="pone.0049906-Sohda1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, SREBP1 transfer from the ER to Golgi may be also disrupted in the presence of overexpressed ACBD3. Owing to the well-conserved proteolytic processing steps among the three SREBP family members, it is probable that ACBD3 might exert a similar impact on SREBP2. In fact, we have observed that (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0049906.s001">Figures S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0049906.s002">S2</xref>) that manipulation of ACBD3 induced similar impact on SREBP2 as those of SREBP1. In addition, it is unlikely that ACBD3 directly regulates nSREBP1 post-translational modification, degradation and/or transactivation capacity because of their undetectable physical interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049906-g004">Figure 4</xref>), the ACBD3-induced upregulation of fSREBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049906-g003">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0049906.s001">S1A</xref>), and significantly different subcellular localization (cytosol vs. nucleus).</p><p>At 72 hours after transfection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0049906.s001">Figure S1A</xref>), ACBD3 overexpressed from the lowest-dose transfection apparently boosted the fSREBP1, while those from higher-dose transfection largely downregulated the full-length protein. This discrepancy could be explained by SREBP1's auto-regulatory function and lag time between gene transcription, protein translation and degradation. We might expect to see the reduced fSREBP1 if cells were allow to overexpress ACBD3 at the lowest level for longer duration than 72 hours. This expectation was further supported by the observation that all three different levels of overexpressed ACBD3 promoted the expression of fSREBP1 at 48-hours time point.</p><p>Additionally, the different responsiveness of FASN and ACC to ACBD3 overexpression at 48 and 72 hours following transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049906-g006">Figure 6C</xref>) could also be attributed to the lag time between transcription inhibition and protein turnover of FASN and ACC. At 48 hours after transfection, pre-existing FASN and ACC seemed to contribute to the irresponsiveness even though nSREBP1 was down-regulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0049906.s001">Figure S1A</xref>) and transcription of the two target genes was inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049906-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>) at this point. With the prolonged ACBD3 overexpression (72 hr after transfection), significant amounts of the pre-existing proteins were degraded and there was no enough newly-synthesized proteins to compensate in the system. As a result, dose-dependent decreases of steady-state FASN and ACC were displayed under this prolonged expression condition. These findings were in accord with the results from experiments quantifying de novo palmitate synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049906-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Palmitate production was significantly reduced only when ACC and FASN protein levels were decreased.</p><p>Utilizing molecular and biochemical approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049906-g005">Figure 5</xref>), we found that N-terminal domain (residues 1&#8211;171) of ACBD3 played an important role in its inhibitory function on the intracellular processing and transcriptional activity of SREBP1. This observation implied that the ACB domain (residues 80&#8211;171), accounting for more-than-half portion of the deleted N-terminal sequence, might be required for ACBD3 to modulate SREBP1 activation to highest extent. Moreover, confocal imaging results showed that the &#916;N mutant still localized mainly on the Golgi just like the full-length wildtype, indicating that Golgi association was not sufficient for its maximum inhibitory function. This observation, from a different perspective, supported the concept that ACB domain might involve in ACBD3-mediated SREBP1 regulation. On the other hand, deletion of C-terminal GOLD domain did not disrupt ACBD3's function to inhibit SREBP1 activity, revealing that these residues (381&#8211;526) were not required for its effect. Interestingly, unlike full-length and &#916;N ACBD3, this &#916;C mutant is localized more diffusely and only a small portion appeared to be located on the Golgi. Based on this finding, we still could not exclude the possibility that Golgi association contributes to ACBD3's effects on SREBP1.</p><p>As one master lipid regulator, Akt/mTORC1-regulated SREBP function is apparently fundamental for maintaining structure and energy homeostasis of cells, determining cell survival and growth. Accordingly, it is not surprising that altered SREBP expression and activity have been implicated in imbalanced lipid metabolism during the development of many dyslipidemic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, hepatic steatosis, cancer, neurodegeneration, and schizophrenia <xref rid="pone.0049906-Menendez1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049906-Ferre2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049906-Le1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0049906-Karasinska1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.

Confocal fluorescent images were obtained by a Leica TCS SP5 II (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) scan head mounted on a Leica DMI6000B inverted-based microscope with a 63&#215; NA 1.4 objective. Sequential excitations at 405 nm (DAPI), 513 nm (EYFP-Golgi) and 594 nm (Myc-ACBD3, SCAP and Insig1) were provided by diode, argon and helium-neon gas lasers, respectively. Blue, yellow and red fluorescent images of the same view were saved with Laser AF software. The term co-localization refers to the coincidence of yellow and red fluorescence, as measured by the confocal microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Lipid Deprivation and Cell Fractionation</title><p>HeLa cells were transfected with pCMV-Myc-ACBD3 or empty vector using Polyfect on day 1. On day 2, the growth media were replaced with either Depletion (inducing) medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% delipidated FBS, 100 U/ml PS, 50 &#181;M Mevastatin, 50 &#181;M Mevalonic acid sodium) or Repletion (suppressing) medium (Depletion medium supplemented with 10 &#181;g/ml cholesterol plus 1 &#181;g/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol). Cells were incubated at 37&#176;C for 20 hr followed by cell fractionation to extract cellular membrane and nuclear fractions using FractionPREP kit according to the manufacturer protocol. Aliquots of the nuclear extracts (9 &#181;g of protein) and membranes (9 &#181;g of protein) were subjected to SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Luciferase Assay</title><p>HEK293T cells were seeded onto 12-well plates and cultured for 24 hr before transfection. Plasmid encoding FASN promoter luciferase was co-transfected into the cells with Myc-ACBD3 in the presence or absence of vector expressing Myc-hSREBP1A. After indicated time period, cells were rinsed with 1&#215; PBS and harvested. Luciferase assays were subsequently carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol with Luciferase assay kit, and luciferase activity was quantified by using Synergy 4 Multi-mode Microplate Reader (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT). We did consider using CMV <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase as the control vector to normalize transfection efficiency. All of our preliminary experiments showed that co-expression with or without <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase had no effect on the degree of ACBD3-initiated inhibition onto FASN promoter, which means that transfection efficiency was not an issue for our experiment. Therefore, we did not co-transfect <italic>Renilla</italic> control vector in the formal experiments. All experiments were performed in triplicate.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Knockdown of Endogenous ACBD3</title><p>Two short hairpin RNA-expressing vectors for knocking down endogenous human ACBD3 were generated using pRNAT-U6.1 (Neo) as the template.

The two sense fragments are <named-content content-type="gene">5&#8242;-CCCAGCTCATAGGTGTTCATA-3&#8242;</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene">5&#8242;-GCAAAGCATTTCATCCAACTT -3&#8242;</named-content> and specifically target parts of 3&#8242;-UTR and coding region of human ACBD3 transcripts, respectively. Cells were transfected with the mixture of the two plasmids (1&#8758;1) or the control empty using Lipofectamine 2000 (HEK293T) or Neon Transfection System (Hep G2) according to the manufacturer protocol. Cells were harvested 72 hr after transfection, and then lysed for immunoblotting to determine protein expression.</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>RNA Isolation and Real-time qPCR</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from HEK293T cells overexpressing Myc-ACBD3 for indicated time period using RNeasy Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNAs were synthesized from 4 &#181;g of total RNA using High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit according to the manufacturer's manual. Ten nanogram of the resulting cDNA was subsequently mixed with Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix and various sets of gene-specific primers and then subjected to RT-PCR quantification using the ABI 7300 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The sequences of the primers used were as follows: FASN (forward), <named-content content-type="gene">5&#8242;-CGCGTGGCCGGCTACTCCTAC-3&#8242;</named-content>; FASN (reverse), <named-content content-type="gene">5&#8242;-CGGCTGCCACACGCTCCTCT- 3&#8242;</named-content>; ACC2 (forward), <named-content content-type="gene">5&#8242;- GGTGCTTATTGCCAACAACGGGAT-3&#8242;</named-content>; ACC2 (reverse), <named-content content-type="gene">5&#8242;-TCTTGATGTACTCTGCGTTGGCCT-3&#8242;</named-content>; GAPDH (forward), <named-content content-type="gene">5&#8242;- AGAAGGCTGGGGCTC ATTTG-3&#8242;</named-content>; GAPDH (reverse), <named-content content-type="gene">5&#8242;- AGGGGCCATCCACAGTCTTC-3&#8242;</named-content>. GAPDH mRNA was used as the invariant endogenous control, and melting curve analysis was run to make sure specificity of each amplicon. All reactions were performed in triplicate.

Twenty-four or forty-eight hours following transfection, cell medium was changed with Labeling medium (Complete growth medium supplemented with 5% D2O). After labeling for 24 hours, cells were washed with 1&#215; PBS and harvested. Cell pellet was delipidated with chloroform&#8758;methanol (2&#8758;1 v&#8758;v) following the addition of heptadecanoate (17:0) as an internal standard. The lower chloroform fraction containing extracted lipids was collected following the addition of PBS (0.75 volume).
