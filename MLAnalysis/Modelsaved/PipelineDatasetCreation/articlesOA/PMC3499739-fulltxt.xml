The symptoms and severity of myotonic dystrophy type l (DM1) ranges from severe and congenital forms, which frequently result in death because of respiratory deficiency, through to late-onset baldness and cataract. In adult patients, cardiac conduction abnormalities may occur and cause a shorter life span. In subsequent generations, the symptoms in DM1 may present at an earlier age and have a more severe course (anticipation). In myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2), no anticipation is described, but cardiac conduction abnormalities as in DM1 are observed and patients with DM2 additionally have muscle pain and stiffness. Both DM1 and DM2 are caused by unstable DNA repeats in untranslated regions of different genes: A (CTG)n repeat in the 3'-UTR of the <italic>DMPK</italic> gene and a (CCTG)n repeat in intron 1 of the <italic>CNBP</italic> (formerly <italic>ZNF9</italic>) gene, respectively. The length of the (CTG)n repeat expansion in DM1 correlates with disease severity and age of onset. Nevertheless, these repeat sizes have limited predictive values on individual bases. Because of the disease characteristics in DM1 and DM2, appropriate molecular testing and reporting is very important for the optimal counseling in myotonic dystrophy. Here, we describe best practice guidelines for clinical molecular genetic analysis and reporting in DM1 and DM2, including presymptomatic and prenatal testing.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2</title><p>Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is an autosomal dominant, multisystem disorder that is characterized by myotonic myopathy with associated abnormalities in other organs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> DM is clinically heterogeneous, and at least two types can be distinguished: DM type 1 (DM1; Steinert disease), which can be subdivided into four clinical subgroups, and DM type 2 (DM2; proximal myotonic myopathy (PROMM), or Ricker syndrome). DM1 is the most common form of muscular dystrophy in adults with an estimated incidence of 1:8000.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> The incidence for DM2 seems to be much lower than for DM1 and appears to be population dependent, reaching a higher incidence in Germany and Finland<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> with an incidence similar to that of DM1. Despite the comparable core diagnostic features and multi-organ involvement, there are specific clinical features of DM1 and DM2, which enable them to be distinguished.</p><sec><title>Myotonic dystrophy type 1</title><p>There is a wide range of symptoms in DM1, ranging from mild features, such as baldness and cataracts, to very severe features including muscle weakness and cardiac conduction defects. Many of the severely affected patients die of cardiac failure or respiratory distress. The cardiac involvement in DM1 may range between asymptomatic ECG abnormalities to sudden cardiac death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup></p><p>From a clinical perspective DM1 may be classified into four different subtypes: (i) mild; (ii) classical; (iii) juvenile and (iv) congenital types: (i) mild DM1: mildly symptomatic patients may have premature cataracts and baldness as the sole clinical features. A late-onset myopathy may develop and myotonia may only be detectable by electromyography. Cardiac conduction abnormalities may arise and result in a shorter life span. (ii) Classical or adult-onset DM1: The age of onset is typically in the second or third decade of life. The most frequent symptoms are distal weakness, involving the long finger flexors of the arms and the dorsiflexors of the legs, leading to symptoms relating to the strength of hand grasping and an increased incidence of stumbling. In addition patients may have cataracts, baldness and cardiac conduction abnormalities as in minimal DM1. Clinical myotonia, gastro-intestinal symptoms and fatigue may also occur. Apathy, lack of initiative, daytime sleepiness and experience fatigue can be distressing to DM1-patients, their partners and other family members. These features have a significant impact on quality of life. (iii) Juvenile DM1: this form resembles the classical form of myotonic dystrophy. However, it is more clearly associated with cognitive and behavioral abnormalities, for example, difficulties in learning and socialization at school. Muscle involvement may be minimal in the juvenile presentation. (iv) Congenital DM1. Polyhydramnios and poor fetal movements precede the birth of an infant with congenital DM1. The affected parent is nearly always the mother and congenital DM1 occurs in a quarter of offspring of affected DM1 mothers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> The infant is typically a floppy baby with failure to thrive and severe respiratory distress. Facial and jaw muscles are weak and produce a tented upper lip with difficulties in feeding and suckling. Clubfeet and joint contractures are also common. Myotonia is typically absent clinically, and may be difficult to detect initially even on EMG. Mental retardation and developmental delay are common. There is a high mortality rate in the perinatal period. Muscle biopsies of patients with congenital DM1 may reveal only variability in fiber size and centralization of nuclei. However, none of the characteristics found in muscle biopsies of patients with classical or adult-onset DM1 myotonic dystrophy are present. Therefore, in order to confirm a clinical suspicion of congenital DM1, the diagnosis can only be established by DNA analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Myotonic dystrophy type 2</title><p>The DM2 phenotype has some similarities to that of DM1 (myotonia, cataract and muscle weakness), but also some differences. The typical clinical presentation of DM2 is that of predominantly proximal muscle weakness, with muscle pain but no atrophy (PROMM phenotype).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> Myotonia is variable (both clinically as well as on EMG). However, in its mildest form, DM2 can be difficult to recognize. Conversely, DM2 may also present with severe proximal muscle involvement with remarkable muscle wasting without clinical myotonia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> The mean age of onset for DM2 is in the third and fourth decades of life.

Although expansions in all size ranges can be detected by TP-PCR, no reliable information about the length of the expanded repeat will be obtained because of extinction of the signal in the higher size region. In DM1 expansion analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> for an example), the TP-PCR has proven to be an accurate technique. Nevertheless, the presence of rare interruptions of the otherwise pure CTG repeat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> may result in aberrant patterns or failure to detect expansions with TP-PCR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> Therefore, to exclude false-negative reports, an additional test (such as a TP-PCR at the other repeat end or Southern blotting) is strongly recommended.</p></sec><sec><title>Southern blotting of long-range PCR-products</title><p>This Southern blot method (for an example, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) requires precise PCR conditions to ensure the amplification of larger fragments, monitored by using appropriate positive and negative (healthy) controls, followed by probing with an end-labeled (CTG)<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> (where <italic>x</italic> is 5 or more) probe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> On these Southern blots, expanded <italic>DMPK</italic> alleles will appear in virtually all cases as smears or multiple fragments, which is (in part) owing to somatic heterogeneity.

Because of the variability of the different units of this complex (TG)<sub>n</sub>(TCTG)<sub>n</sub>(CCTG)<sub>n</sub>, repeat, the precise length of the pathogenic CCTG unit within this repeat can only be determined by sequencing.

For (larger) expansions, a range of repeat lengths should be estimated on basis of markers and/or control samples. However, in the reports of most laboratories the exact length of the repeat is not specified. The result of appropriate testing leads to one of the following possibilities and subsequent recommended reporting guidelines: (i) no expansion (homozygous or compound heterozygous for a normal allele size): this excludes the diagnosis of DM2. (ii) A heterozygous expansion of over 75 CCTG-repeat units: (a) the diagnosis of DM2 is confirmed and (b) relatives (including offspring) of the counselee may be at risk of developing DM2. Therefore, they should be offered counseling. An offer of repeat-length analysis to those relatives is warranted.</p><p>A tabular format of the reporting guidelines is available as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Data</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>These guidelines were established at the EMQN Best Practice Meeting, held at 31st of October 2008 in Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

Genomic DNA samples were fragmented using <italic>Eco</italic>RI and subjected to electophoresis and capillary blotting to a nylon membrane. Subsequently, the membrane was hybridized with a mixture of the CL3N58 (within the <italic>CNBP</italic> gene) and a reference probe (both <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup>P-labeled). Visualized fragments were from a healthy control (lane 1), and patients with one normal and one expanded allele (lanes 2 and 3). Note the decrease in intensity of the normal allele in the patients with an expansion, when compared with the control probe signal. Normal sized <italic>CNPB</italic> alleles and expansions, as well as the reference probe, are indicated.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ejhg2012108f2"/></fig><table-wrap id="tbl1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Size ranges of CTG repeats in the <italic>DMPK</italic> gene and corresponding most common phenotypes</title></caption><table-wrap-foot><fn id="t1-fn1"><p>Abbreviation: DM, myotonic dystrophy.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap id="tbl2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Primer sequences used for myotonic dystrophy tests</title></caption><table-wrap-foot><fn id="t2-fn1"><p>Abbreviations: C, Copenhagen; LR, long-range, N, Nijmegen; QP, quadruplet-repeat primed; R, Rome; TP: triplet-repeat primed, W, W&#252;rzburg</p></fn><fn id="t2-fn2"><p>Repeat sequences are underlined.</p></fn><fn id="t2-fn3"><label>a</label><p>These primers amplify the CL3N58 marker, which is defined as a CAGG repeat and is the reverse complement of the CCTG repeat in the <italic>CNBP</italic> gene.
