</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Tea (Camellia sinensis) is one of the most popular beverage crops originated in Asia, and the products are widely consumed all over the world. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In 2009, the FAO estimated that 2.8 million hectares of tea fields was harvested (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://faostat.fao.org/">http://faostat.fao.org/</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Harvested fresh tea leaves are processed into many types of tea, including black tea, pan-fired green tea, steamed green tea, oolong tea and powdered green tea, and the processed tea leaves are traded around the world. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Some of the major tea-producing countries are developing countries, for which tea is a major source of foreign currency revenue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Tea has a genome size of 4 Gb (Tanaka et al. 2006); its basic chromosome number is n = 15 (Morinaga et al. 1929) and it is commonly diploid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Since tea is an outcrossing woody plant with a self-incompatible reproductive system (Tomo et al. 1956), its genome is always heterogeneous. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Traditionally, tea trees have been propagated as seedlings, but seedling tea trees do not have synchronous bud break, uniform harvest times and uniform quality. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Recently, clonal cultivars have become the main plant materials used in many countries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Clonal cultivars have synchronous bud break, uniform harvest times and uniform quality, making them well suited for machine harvesting. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>To breed clonal tea cultivars, breeders have to select a large number of individuals with desirable characters from a large number of F1 segregating populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The selected individuals are clonally propagated and screened with the information of clonal strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>After evaluation, elite clones are released as cultivars. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Production of high-quality tea leaves is the most important breeding objective, but the evaluation is laborious and time-consuming. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In addition to being a lengthy process, tea breeding also requires large field areas. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>For these reasons, it is efficient and effective to multiply early-stage populations and select breeding materials on the basis of an evaluation of DNA markers for important agronomic characters that are controlled by a few loci, such as pest resistance, before planting the seedlings in the field. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>At Makurazaki Tea Research Station, a breeding system that combines marker-assisted selection (MAS) in the juvenile phase and the acceleration of generations has shown successful results (Tanaka 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>It would be efficient to be able to perform MAS for many characters in many different populations, so a method of genetic analysis is needed for a wide range of genetic materials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>It is therefore desirable to construct a reference map with many landmark markers. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>A few linkage maps of tea based on the pseudo-testcross theory (Grattapaglia and Sederoff 1994) have been reported (Hackett et al. 2000, Ota and Tanaka 1999, Tanaka et al. 1995). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>These maps were constructed by using dominant marker systems such as Random Amplified Polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs) or Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>By using pseudo-testcross theory, it is easy to construct accurate linkage maps for small F1 populations having two heterozygous parents, because the segregation ratio of each marker is 1 : 1 and linkage relationships among them are very simple and clear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>However, the utility of dominant markers depends on the particular material being tested: they are not universal markers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>In addition, the relationships among the linkage groups on the previously reported maps are unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In a few fruit trees, reference linkage maps have been developed by using co-dominant Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequences (CAPS) and Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR) markers (Omura et al. 2000, Yamamoto et al. 2002, 2005, 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Here, we developed a high-density reference map of tea, using both newly developed SSR markers and some previously reported SSR and CAPS markers (Ogino et al. 2009, Taniguchi et al. 2012, Ujihara et al. 2011) as landmark markers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>RAPD markers were included in the parental maps but were not used as landmark markers because of their dominant nature. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that Chinese tea materials have greater genetic diversity than Japanese ones (Kaundun and Matsumoto 2003, Wachira et al. 2001, Yamaguchi and Tanaka 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>We expected there to be high heterozygosity across the genomes of these materials because of the lack of duplication in the pedigrees of the parents and because tea has an out-crossing propagation system. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>In many cases, SSR marker bands generated by the same primer sets were expected to amplify the same locus in each of the two parents, so SSR markers tended to map within linkage groups in the same order in both parental maps. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>To supply a marker to cover this gap, RAPD marker ‘OpT_18_200’ from the map of ‘Kana-Ck17’ was cloned and sequenced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Because there is no polymorphism for this sequence in ‘Sayamakaori’, the flanking sequence was amplified by using TAIL-PCR and sequenced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>There were 2 SNPs revealing heterozygosity in ‘Sayamakaori’ in the flanking sequence of ‘OpT_18_200’ (accession numbers: AB623060 [Sayamakaori], AB623061 [Kana-Ck17]); these SNPs were mapped to the same locus as RAPD marker ‘OpM_11_750’ on the ‘Sayamakaori’ map. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>The segregation patterns obtained for ‘OpM_11_750’ and the new marker were identical, so we mapped the new STS marker (designated ‘OpM_18_200STS’) onto the core map. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>We have illustrated the reference map in such a way that the core map for each linkage group is sandwiched between the corresponding parental maps. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>Although obtained from the same F1 population, the sets of linkage information for each parent are independent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>If the maps of the two parents were to be merged into a single map by using the landmark markers, the order of the non-landmark markers would be expected to be very inaccurate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>This three-line manner of illustration presents reasonably accurate marker orders. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>It is common to have inaccurate marker orders in linkage maps because of missing data, especially when the population size is small. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used automated DNA sequencers to detect the sizes of amplified fragments from the SSR marker analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>In this method, some background peaks hampered the detection of particular alleles; for example, this occurred with MSG0213 in linkage group 4 of ‘Sayamakaori’ and MSE0230a in linkage group 3 of ‘Kana-Ck17’. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>For such markers, the core map should be more accurate than either parental map because it is based on double the amount of linkage data per marker. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>In addition, the core markers are likely to be more informative and more useful than other markers for genetic analysis in other populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>For a marker to be designated as a core marker, both parental materials had to be heterozygous for the marker and the segregation of the alleles derived from one parent had to be detectable without the interference of alleles from the other parent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>That is, if the genotype of one parent was AB, the genotype of the other parent had to have been AC, BC or CD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>In other words, a core marker must have had at least three distinguishable alleles within the two parental lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>To select markers for genetic analysis, it is efficient to choose markers firstly from the core marker set, secondly co-dominant markers on the parental maps. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>If there are no polymorphic markers within the target area, it is possible to search SNP markers from the sequence information of SSR markers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Even if no SSR markers are found in the target region, it is possible to search SNPs from the sequence of flanking region of SSR markers, or even from the sequence of an RAPD band or its flanking region, as was done here in the case of ‘OpT_18_200’ STS. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>The linkage map presented here should be useful as a reference map of tea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>This reference map will play an important role in establishing the alignment of genomic sequences of tea as we work toward full-genome sequencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>In the future, we expect that many additional markers will be developed and mapped and these will further advance the accuracy and density of the available maps. </plain></SENT>
