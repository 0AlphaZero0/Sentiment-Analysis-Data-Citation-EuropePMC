Specifically, loss of PTP&#963; has been shown to elicit a number of cellular phenotypes including enhanced nerve regeneration following spinal cord injury (SCI), chemoresistance in cultured cancer cells, and hyperactive autophagy, a process critical to cell survival and the clearance of pathological aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases. Owing to these functions, modulation of PTP&#963; may provide therapeutic value in a variety of contexts. Furthermore, a small molecule inhibitor would provide utility in discerning the cellular functions and substrates of PTP&#963;. To develop such molecules, we combined <italic>in silico</italic> modeling with <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphatase assays to identify compounds which effectively inhibit the enzymatic activity of PTP&#963;. Importantly, we observed that PTP&#963; inhibition was frequently mediated by oxidative species generated by compounds in solution, and we further optimized screening conditions to eliminate this effect. We identified a compound that inhibits PTP&#963; with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 10 &#181;M in a manner that is primarily oxidation-independent. This compound favorably binds the D1 active site of PTP&#963; <italic>in silico,</italic> suggesting it functions as a competitive inhibitor. This compound will serve as a scaffold structure for future studies designed to build selectivity for PTP&#963; over related PTPs.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Department of Defense Prostate Cancer Research Program of the Office of Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs PC081089 to JPM.

Protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and phosphatases (PTPs) work in concert to control these signaling cascades, and alterations in the expression or activity of these enzymes hallmark many human diseases <xref rid="pone.0050217-Lahiry1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050217-Tonks1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. While PTKs have long been the focus of extensive research and drug development efforts, the role of PTPs as critical mediators of signal transduction was initially underappreciated <xref rid="pone.0050217-Tautz1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Consequently, the molecular characterization of these phosphatases has trailed that of PTKs, and only recently has the PTP field reached the forefront of disease based-research. As validation for phosphastases in human disease, half of PTP genes are now implicated in at least one human disease <xref rid="pone.0050217-Tautz1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>The critical role of PTPs in cell function and their role in disease etiology highlight the importance of developing phosphatase agonists and inhibitors. Unfortunately, phosphatases have historically been perceived as &#8220;undruggable&#8221; for several important reasons <xref rid="pone.0050217-Tautz2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. First, phosphatases often control multiple signaling pathways and thus, inhibition of a single enzyme may not yield a specific cellular effect. Second, signaling cascades are generally controlled by multiple phosphatases and accordingly, blocking the activity of one may not sufficiently induce the desired modulation to a signaling pathway. Finally, and most importantly, phosphatase active sites display high conservation which hinders the ability to develop catalysis-directed inhibitors with any degree of selectivity <xref rid="pone.0050217-Tautz2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Despite these pitfalls, the emerging role of PTPs in human disease etiology has necessitated a solution. Largely through use of structure-based drug design, several PTPs now represent promising targets for disease treatment. Most notably, bidentate inhibitors of PTP1B, implicated in type II diabetes and obesity, have been developed which span both the catalytic pocket and a second substrate binding pocket discovered adjacent to the active site <xref rid="pone.0050217-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050217-Shen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050217-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Drug development around PTP1B has provided a proof-of-concept for investigations focused on additional PTP targets. Several studies have uncovered physiologically important and disease relevant functions for the classic receptor type PTP, PTP&#963; (encoded by the <italic>PTPRS</italic> gene), which underscore its potential as a biological target. PTP&#963; is highly expressed in neuronal tissue where it regulates axon guidance and neurite outgrowth <xref rid="pone.0050217-McLean1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050217-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050217-Sapieha1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050217-Siu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050217-Faux1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Furthermore, it was recently reported that loss of PTP&#963; facilitates nerve regeneration following spinal cord injury (SCI), owing to the interaction of its ectodomain with chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) <xref rid="pone.0050217-Shen2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050217-Fry1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In addition to its neural function, PTP&#963; has been implicated in chemoresistance of cancer cells. First, we discovered that RNAi-mediated knockdown of PTP&#963; in cultured cancer cells confers resistance to several chemotherapeutics <xref rid="pone.0050217-MacKeigan1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Additionally, we have discovered that loss of PTP&#963; hyperactivates autophagy, a cellular recycling program that may contribute to chemoresistance of cancer cells <xref rid="pone.0050217-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Taken together, it is apparent that modulation of PTP&#963; may have therapeutic potential in a range of contexts. Notably, inhibition of PTP&#963; could potentially provide benefit following SCI through enhanced neural regeneration. In addition, it is possible that PTP&#963; inhibition may yield therapeutic value in diseases in which increasing autophagy represents a promising treatment strategy (i.e., neurodegenerative diseases). Furthermore, a small molecule would provide value as a molecular probe or tool compound to interrogate the cellular functions and disease implications of PTP&#963;.</p><fig id="pone-0050217-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0050217.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Workflow overview for PTP&#963; inhibitor development.</title><p>
<italic>In silico</italic> docking was performed using the crystal structure of the D1 active site of PTP&#963; as a target (PDB ID: 2fh7). Three structurally distinct scaffolds were chosen, along with 74 additional compounds identified by a sub-structure search of compounds in the ChemBridge, were tested <italic>in vitro</italic> to for the ability to inhibit PTP&#963; phosphatase activity. To eliminate oxidation-mediated inhibition, we optimized the biochemical assay and discovered one lead compound whose inhibition was not mediated by oxidation. Future efforts (dashed boxes and lines) will introduce selectivity into this lead compound through a detailed structural analysis of PTP&#963; and related PTPs.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0050217.g001"/></fig><p>Several approaches exist for the identification of small molecule inhibitors of phosphatases. While high-throughput screening (HTS) of compounds <italic>in vitro</italic> has been successfully utilized to discover inhibitors of LAR (PTPRF), PTP1B, SHP2, CD45, and others <xref rid="pone.0050217-Mattila1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, the technical and physical investment is considerable as is the potential for experimental artifacts leading to false negatives and positives <xref rid="pone.0050217-Mattila1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Alternatively, a primary screen for inhibitor scaffolds can be guided by <italic>in silico</italic> virtual screening. This method involves high-throughput computational docking of small molecules into the crystal structure of a phosphatase active site and selecting the molecules which bind favorably, akin to a natural substrate <xref rid="pone.0050217-Kitchen1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Following the selection of the best-scoring scaffolds, each scaffold can then be tested and validated for phosphatase inhibition <italic>in vitro.</italic> This approach has gained popularity as the number of enzymes with solved crystal structures has increased and it is advantageous in many ways. First, utilization of the phosphatase structure allows for the exclusion of molecules which have little chance of interacting with the active site, greatly reducing the number of scaffolds to be biochemically screened and improving the screen results. Second, an understanding of the unique structural features and residues comprising the active site as well as proximal folds or binding pockets can guide the selection and refinement of an inhibitor. Furthermore, an <italic>in silico</italic> approach is incredibly efficient in that it allows tens of thousands to millions of compounds to be screened virtually in a matter of weeks.</p><fig id="pone-0050217-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0050217.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>

While we discovered 25 active compounds with micromolar potency against PTP&#963;, we discovered compounds frequently catalyzed the production of oxidative species in the assay buffer, a common culprit for non-selective PTP inhibition.

<italic>In silico</italic> Docking Identifies Small Molecules Targeting the PTP&#963; D1 Active Site</title><p>The tandem phosphatase domains of PTP&#963; have been crystallized in their apo form <xref rid="pone.0050217-Almo1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. We retrieved this structure from the protein data bank (PDB ID: 2fh7) and verified its utility by molecularly docking a phosphotyrosine peptide (NPTpYS) into the catalytically active D1 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050217-g002">
<bold>Figure 2A</bold>
</xref>). We hypothesized that the active site could be exploited in the development of competitive inhibitors targeted to PTP&#963;. To this end, we used the ZINC database to virtually screen a library of compounds for their ability to dock into the D1 domain of PTP&#963; <xref rid="pone.0050217-Irwin1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. From the top scoring compounds which were most favorably bound by the active site, we identified three compounds (Compounds 6, 48, and 49) which represented structurally distinct scaffolds and demonstrated an ability to inhibit PTP&#963; activity in preliminary <italic>in vitro</italic> assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050217-g002">
<bold>Figure 2B&#8211;D</bold>
</xref>). To expand these into a set of compounds for biochemical investigation, we performed a substructure search and retrieved 74 additional molecules similar to these three scaffolds from the ChemBridge compound library. This entire collection of molecules, along with the established pan-PTP inhibitor sodium orthovanadate, were analyzed for their ability to inhibit PTP&#963; phosphatase activity <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>To measure the catalytic activity of PTP&#963; <italic>in vitro</italic>, we utilized the chromogenic phosphatase substrate, <italic>para</italic>-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP). The dephosphorylated product para-nitrophenol (pNP), yields an intense yellow color under alkaline conditions measurable at 405 nm absorbance on a spectrophotometer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050217-g003">

<bold>Figure 3B&#8211;C</bold>
</xref>). We then used initial velocities (in pNP absorbance per minute) measured across a series of pNPP substrate concentrations to calculate the K<sub>m</sub> of PTP&#963;. The K<sub>m</sub> of PTP&#963; was determined to be 250 &#181;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050217-g003">
<bold>Figure 3D&#8211;E</bold>
</xref>). When analyzing competitive inhibition, the mode of inhibition predicted for molecules binding the D1 active site, it is critical to use a substrate concentration at or below the K<sub>m</sub>
<xref rid="pone.0050217-Tierno1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Accordingly, we used a pNPP substrate concentration less than 250 &#181;M for inhibitor studies.</p><p>To profile the inhibition of PTP&#963; conferred by compounds, we pre-incubated recombinant PTP&#963; with each compound (100 &#181;M) for 30 minutes, then initiated phosphatase reactions with the addition of pNPP for an additional 30 minutes. We identified 25 active compounds which inhibited PTP&#963; activity by 90% or more, a potency similar to that of sodium orthovanadate (Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050217-g004">

In fact, compounds chosen for structural similarities to compound 6 represented less than 15% of the active compounds. Therefore, we proceeded to follow up on compounds 48, 49, and similar structures.</p><sec id="s2a1"><title>Compounds inhibit PTP&#963; by non-selective oxidation</title><p>After identifying the most active compounds capable of inhibiting PTP&#963; <italic>in vitro</italic>, we explored the mechanism by which these molecules were reducing phosphatase activity. In particular, because PTP active sites are maintained in a reduced state for preservation of the nucleophilic cysteine which primes them for optimal activity, these enzymes are extremely sensitive to oxidation <xref rid="pone.0050217-Tonks2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Oxidative species, such as hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), generated in the assay is a common culprit for decreased phosphatase activity <xref rid="pone.0050217-Tautz2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. To determine whether the reaction conditions were favoring H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated inhibition of PTP&#963;, we repeated phosphatase assays in the presence or absence of catalase, an enzyme which converts H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into water and oxygen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050217-g005">
<bold>Figure</bold>
<bold>5A</bold>
</xref>). We found that catalase negated all inhibition conferred by compounds 48 and 49 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050217-g005">

To achieve these conditions, we used a low dose of compound (10 &#181;M) and reduced the pre-incubation period to only 10 minutes, as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation and inhibition is time-dependent <xref rid="pone.0050217-Tautz2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Under these conditions, we discovered that two compounds, 36 and 38, inhibited PTP&#963; by 40%, slightly more so than the equivalent dose of Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050217-g005">
<bold>Figure 5C</bold>
</xref>). We next assessed whether the inhibition mediated by these compounds involved H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by determining dose-dependent inhibition in the presence and absence of catalase. Compound 38 conferred less than 50% inhibition of PTP&#963; at the maximal dose tested when incubated with catalase, suggesting a substantial oxidative effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050217-g005">
<bold>Figure 5D</bold>
</xref>). Conversely, catalase had a less substantial effect on compound 36-mediated inhibition of PTP&#963; and in fact, could not prevent the inhibition conferred by relatively high doses of compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050217-g005">
<bold>Figure 5E</bold>
</xref>). This suggests that while H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was partially contributing to PTP&#963; inhibition by compound 36, its effect was largely independent of oxidation. We used a dose-response of PTP&#963; inhibition to calculate the IC<sub>50</sub> of compound 36 to be 10 &#181;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050217-g006">
<bold>Figure 6A</bold>
</xref>). To confirm that this molecule is capable of binding the active site of PTP&#963;, we molecularly docked compound 36 into the open conformation of the PTP&#963; D1 active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050217-g006">
<bold>Figure 6B&#8211;C</bold>

Importantly, the tyrosine-like moiety of compound 36 binds in the domain of PTP&#963; anticipated to bind the phosphotyrosine side chain of the known substrate.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Taken together, this integrative approach of computational and biochemical methods led to the identification of several small molecule inhibitors of PTP&#963;. <italic>In silico</italic> docking demonstrated that these compounds were molecularly accommodated by the D1 active site of PTP&#963;, similar to a natural phosphotyrosine substrate, suggesting they function as competitive inhibitors. We confirmed that one potential active site lead molecule, compound 36 [1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-[(2-hydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)amino]-2-propen-1-one], inhibits PTP&#963; in a dose-dependent manner with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 10 &#181;M.</p><p>Oxidation and inhibition of PTP active sites by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has been well established as a physiological mode of regulation <xref rid="pone.0050217-Salmeen1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. A number of compounds, in particular those containing quinones, have been documented to inhibit phosphatases through the generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> species <xref rid="pone.0050217-Tautz2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050217-Urbanek1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050217-Bova1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Although the precise mechanism was not characterized, the reversal of phosphatase inhibition by compounds 48 and 49 achieved by treatment with catalase provides evidence that for at least these compounds, inhibition is partially mediated through H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation. Oxidation does not discriminate selectively for the PTP&#963; active site and thus, is not an ideal mechanism of inhibition for a PTP&#963; inhibitor. To address this, we optimized assay conditions to eliminate oxidative effects and found that compound 36 was able to inhibit PTP&#963; by a mechanism largely independent of oxidation. This suggests that compound 36 functions as a competitive inhibitor of PTP&#963; and in agreement with this, it docked favorably into the D1 active site of PTP&#963; <italic>in silico</italic>.</p><p>Although compound 36 proved potent and non-oxidative, we do not anticipate that it will be a selective inhibitor of PTP&#963; in its current form, owing to the high degree of sequence conservation among phosphatase catalytic domains. In particular, the residues forming the active site predominantly lie within highly conserved motifs showing little sequence variability across the entire PTP family <xref rid="pone.0050217-Andersen1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. In fact, preliminary studies suggest compound 36 displays activity towards PTP1B, in addition to PTP&#963; (unpublished data). This underscores the importance of our future efforts to identify and create modifications to the compound 36 scaffold which will favor selective inhibition of PTP&#963;.</p><p>We believe a combination of <italic>in silico</italic> methods and carefully optimized biochemical screening (i.e., an assay that minimizes inhibition by oxidative species) represents an useful approach to develop effective PTP inhibitors. Through the <italic>in silico</italic> approach described here, we were able to identify active phosphatase scaffolds while bypassing a primary assay that would entail a high-throughput biochemical screening of compounds <italic>in vitro</italic>. Coupling this effort with biochemical assays, we prioritized compound 36 as a lead molecule. Our future studies will include structure-based refinement of this scaffold in order to develop selective inhibitors of PTP&#963;. In this approach, we will characterize the activity of compound 36 against related PTPs and following, use molecular docking and structural analyses of these counter-targets to identify chemical modifications that promote selectivity for PTP&#963;.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Structural Modeling and Phosphotyrosine Substrate Docking</title><p>The crystal structure of PTP&#963; (PDB ID: 2FH7) was retrieved from the Protein Data Bank.
