</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Tyrosine phosphorylation is a critical mechanism by which cells exert control over signaling processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and phosphatases (PTPs) work in concert to control these signaling cascades, and alterations in the expression or activity of these enzymes hallmark many human diseases [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>While PTKs have long been the focus of extensive research and drug development efforts, the role of PTPs as critical mediators of signal transduction was initially underappreciated [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the molecular characterization of these phosphatases has trailed that of PTKs, and only recently has the PTP field reached the forefront of disease based-research. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>As validation for phosphastases in human disease, half of PTP genes are now implicated in at least one human disease [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The critical role of PTPs in cell function and their role in disease etiology highlight the importance of developing phosphatase agonists and inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, phosphatases have historically been perceived as “undruggable” for several important reasons [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>First, phosphatases often control multiple signaling pathways and thus, inhibition of a single enzyme may not yield a specific cellular effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Second, signaling cascades are generally controlled by multiple phosphatases and accordingly, blocking the activity of one may not sufficiently induce the desired modulation to a signaling pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Finally, and most importantly, phosphatase active sites display high conservation which hinders the ability to develop catalysis-directed inhibitors with any degree of selectivity [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Despite these pitfalls, the emerging role of PTPs in human disease etiology has necessitated a solution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Largely through use of structure-based drug design, several PTPs now represent promising targets for disease treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Most notably, bidentate inhibitors of PTP1B, implicated in type II diabetes and obesity, have been developed which span both the catalytic pocket and a second substrate binding pocket discovered adjacent to the active site [5], [6], [7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Drug development around PTP1B has provided a proof-of-concept for investigations focused on additional PTP targets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Several studies have uncovered physiologically important and disease relevant functions for the classic receptor type PTP, PTPσ (encoded by the PTPRS gene), which underscore its potential as a biological target. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>PTPσ is highly expressed in neuronal tissue where it regulates axon guidance and neurite outgrowth [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it was recently reported that loss of PTPσ facilitates nerve regeneration following spinal cord injury (SCI), owing to the interaction of its ectodomain with chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) [13], [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In addition to its neural function, PTPσ has been implicated in chemoresistance of cancer cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>First, we discovered that RNAi-mediated knockdown of PTPσ in cultured cancer cells confers resistance to several chemotherapeutics [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we have discovered that loss of PTPσ hyperactivates autophagy, a cellular recycling program that may contribute to chemoresistance of cancer cells [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Taken together, it is apparent that modulation of PTPσ may have therapeutic potential in a range of contexts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Notably, inhibition of PTPσ could potentially provide benefit following SCI through enhanced neural regeneration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In addition, it is possible that PTPσ inhibition may yield therapeutic value in diseases in which increasing autophagy represents a promising treatment strategy (i.e., neurodegenerative diseases). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a small molecule would provide value as a molecular probe or tool compound to interrogate the cellular functions and disease implications of PTPσ. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>While high-throughput screening (HTS) of compounds in vitro has been successfully utilized to discover inhibitors of LAR (PTPRF), PTP1B, SHP2, CD45, and others [17], the technical and physical investment is considerable as is the potential for experimental artifacts leading to false negatives and positives [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, a primary screen for inhibitor scaffolds can be guided by in silico virtual screening. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>This method involves high-throughput computational docking of small molecules into the crystal structure of a phosphatase active site and selecting the molecules which bind favorably, akin to a natural substrate [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Following the selection of the best-scoring scaffolds, each scaffold can then be tested and validated for phosphatase inhibition in vitro. This approach has gained popularity as the number of enzymes with solved crystal structures has increased and it is advantageous in many ways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>First, utilization of the phosphatase structure allows for the exclusion of molecules which have little chance of interacting with the active site, greatly reducing the number of scaffolds to be biochemically screened and improving the screen results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Second, an understanding of the unique structural features and residues comprising the active site as well as proximal folds or binding pockets can guide the selection and refinement of an inhibitor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, an in silico approach is incredibly efficient in that it allows tens of thousands to millions of compounds to be screened virtually in a matter of weeks. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>We retrieved this structure from the protein data bank (PDB ID: 2fh7) and verified its utility by molecularly docking a phosphotyrosine peptide (NPTpYS) into the catalytically active D1 domain ( Figure 2A ). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the active site could be exploited in the development of competitive inhibitors targeted to PTPσ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>To this end, we used the ZINC database to virtually screen a library of compounds for their ability to dock into the D1 domain of PTPσ [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>From the top scoring compounds which were most favorably bound by the active site, we identified three compounds (Compounds 6, 48, and 49) which represented structurally distinct scaffolds and demonstrated an ability to inhibit PTPσ activity in preliminary in vitro assays ( Figure 2B–D ). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>To expand these into a set of compounds for biochemical investigation, we performed a substructure search and retrieved 74 additional molecules similar to these three scaffolds from the ChemBridge compound library. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>This entire collection of molecules, along with the established pan-PTP inhibitor sodium orthovanadate, were analyzed for their ability to inhibit PTPσ phosphatase activity in vitro. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>To measure the catalytic activity of PTPσ in vitro, we utilized the chromogenic phosphatase substrate, para-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>The dephosphorylated product para-nitrophenol (pNP), yields an intense yellow color under alkaline conditions measurable at 405 nm absorbance on a spectrophotometer ( Figure 3A ). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>We generated recombinant PTPσ and determined an amount (2 µg) that yielded linear pNP formation during the course of the phosphatase reaction while producing a maximal signal at least five-fold above background ( Figure 3B–C ). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>We then used initial velocities (in pNP absorbance per minute) measured across a series of pNPP substrate concentrations to calculate the Km of PTPσ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>The Km of PTPσ was determined to be 250 µM ( Figure 3D–E ). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>When analyzing competitive inhibition, the mode of inhibition predicted for molecules binding the D1 active site, it is critical to use a substrate concentration at or below the Km [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we used a pNPP substrate concentration less than 250 µM for inhibitor studies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>To profile the inhibition of PTPσ conferred by compounds, we pre-incubated recombinant PTPσ with each compound (100 µM) for 30 minutes, then initiated phosphatase reactions with the addition of pNPP for an additional 30 minutes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>We identified 25 active compounds which inhibited PTPσ activity by 90% or more, a potency similar to that of sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4) ( Figure 4A–C ). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>One of the scaffolds chosen in silico, compound 6, inhibited PTPσ to a lesser extent than the remaining in silico scaffolds, compounds 48 and 49. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>After identifying the most active compounds capable of inhibiting PTPσ in vitro, we explored the mechanism by which these molecules were reducing phosphatase activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>In particular, because PTP active sites are maintained in a reduced state for preservation of the nucleophilic cysteine which primes them for optimal activity, these enzymes are extremely sensitive to oxidation [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Oxidative species, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), generated in the assay is a common culprit for decreased phosphatase activity [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the reaction conditions were favoring H2O2-mediated inhibition of PTPσ, we repeated phosphatase assays in the presence or absence of catalase, an enzyme which converts H2O2 into water and oxygen ( Figure 5A ). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>To identify compounds with minimal oxidative effects that may better represent true competitive inhibitors, we revisited small molecules predicted to bind the PTPσ active site in silico. We retrieved 63 additional molecules, representing diverse structures among the top 200 scoring compounds, and tested them under screening conditions optimized to significantly diminish the potential for H2O2 generation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>To achieve these conditions, we used a low dose of compound (10 µM) and reduced the pre-incubation period to only 10 minutes, as H2O2 generation and inhibition is time-dependent [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Under these conditions, we discovered that two compounds, 36 and 38, inhibited PTPσ by 40%, slightly more so than the equivalent dose of Na3VO4 ( Figure 5C ). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>We next assessed whether the inhibition mediated by these compounds involved H2O2 by determining dose-dependent inhibition in the presence and absence of catalase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Compound 38 conferred less than 50% inhibition of PTPσ at the maximal dose tested when incubated with catalase, suggesting a substantial oxidative effect ( Figure 5D ). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Conversely, catalase had a less substantial effect on compound 36-mediated inhibition of PTPσ and in fact, could not prevent the inhibition conferred by relatively high doses of compounds ( Figure 5E ). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>This suggests that while H2O2 was partially contributing to PTPσ inhibition by compound 36, its effect was largely independent of oxidation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>We used a dose-response of PTPσ inhibition to calculate the IC50 of compound 36 to be 10 µM ( Figure 6A ). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>To confirm that this molecule is capable of binding the active site of PTPσ, we molecularly docked compound 36 into the open conformation of the PTPσ D1 active site ( Figure 6B–C ). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Taken together, this integrative approach of computational and biochemical methods led to the identification of several small molecule inhibitors of PTPσ. In silico docking demonstrated that these compounds were molecularly accommodated by the D1 active site of PTPσ, similar to a natural phosphotyrosine substrate, suggesting they function as competitive inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>We confirmed that one potential active site lead molecule, compound 36 [1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-[(2-hydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)amino]-2-propen-1-one], inhibits PTPσ in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 10 µM. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Oxidation and inhibition of PTP active sites by H2O2 has been well established as a physiological mode of regulation [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>A number of compounds, in particular those containing quinones, have been documented to inhibit phosphatases through the generation of H2O2 species [4], [45], [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Although the precise mechanism was not characterized, the reversal of phosphatase inhibition by compounds 48 and 49 achieved by treatment with catalase provides evidence that for at least these compounds, inhibition is partially mediated through H2O2 generation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Oxidation does not discriminate selectively for the PTPσ active site and thus, is not an ideal mechanism of inhibition for a PTPσ inhibitor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>To address this, we optimized assay conditions to eliminate oxidative effects and found that compound 36 was able to inhibit PTPσ by a mechanism largely independent of oxidation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>This suggests that compound 36 functions as a competitive inhibitor of PTPσ and in agreement with this, it docked favorably into the D1 active site of PTPσ in silico. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Although compound 36 proved potent and non-oxidative, we do not anticipate that it will be a selective inhibitor of PTPσ in its current form, owing to the high degree of sequence conservation among phosphatase catalytic domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>In particular, the residues forming the active site predominantly lie within highly conserved motifs showing little sequence variability across the entire PTP family [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>In fact, preliminary studies suggest compound 36 displays activity towards PTP1B, in addition to PTPσ (unpublished data). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>This underscores the importance of our future efforts to identify and create modifications to the compound 36 scaffold which will favor selective inhibition of PTPσ. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>We believe a combination of in silico methods and carefully optimized biochemical screening (i.e., an assay that minimizes inhibition by oxidative species) represents an useful approach to develop effective PTP inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Through the in silico approach described here, we were able to identify active phosphatase scaffolds while bypassing a primary assay that would entail a high-throughput biochemical screening of compounds in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Coupling this effort with biochemical assays, we prioritized compound 36 as a lead molecule. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Our future studies will include structure-based refinement of this scaffold in order to develop selective inhibitors of PTPσ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>In this approach, we will characterize the activity of compound 36 against related PTPs and following, use molecular docking and structural analyses of these counter-targets to identify chemical modifications that promote selectivity for PTPσ. </plain></SENT>
