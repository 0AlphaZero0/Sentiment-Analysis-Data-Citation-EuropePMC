<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Treatment for the past four decades has involved concurrent fluorouracil/mitomycin and radiation therapy (Glynne-Jones and Mawdsley, 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Although effective, treatment is associated with significant morbidity: pancytopenia, severe diarrhoea and dermatitis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients with progressive disease are left with limited and untested options. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Hence, it is important that new treatment strategies be investigated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In the past two decades a significant amount of research has been spurred by the concept of using tumour-specific biomolecules to increase response rates and decrease morbidity of current cancer treatment regimens (Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the more recent discovery that certain biomolecules can sensitise tumours to radiation therapy has opened the door to the field of molecular radiation biology/oncology (Zaidi et al, 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>To date, the most successful example of radiosensitisation by a biomolecule is that of Cetuximab. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the use of Cetuximab for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SccH&amp;N) in combination with radiation therapy (Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Cetuximab (Erbitux/C225) is an IgG1 chimeric monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The EGFR (HER-1 or erbB1) is a member of the tyrosine kinase receptor family that also includes HER2 (erbB2), erbB3 and erbB4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>It is believed that EGFR contributes to tumour development and progression through autocrine stimulation of cell proliferation (Matczak, 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The EGFR is overexpressed in many common epithelial cancers and it is associated with poor prognosis and treatment response (Nicholson et al, 2001; Ang et al, 2002). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Several tyrosine kinase activating EGFR mutations have been identified, the majority of which are associated with responsiveness to EGFR inhibition in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Lynch et al, 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The two most common EGFR mutations, representing 85â90% of documented EGFR mutations, result from an in-frame deletion of 9â24 nucleotides centred around codons 746â750 in exon 19, or a point mutation at nucleotide 2573 (CTG to CGG) resulting in an arginine for leucine substitution at amino acid 858 (L858R) in exon 21 (Riely et al, 2006). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Kirsten-ras (K-ras), a small signalling G-protein downstream of EGFR, is necessary for EGFR signal transduction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Activating mutations of the K-ras gene have been strongly associated with decreased response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in NSCLC (Eberhard et al, 2005), and decreased response to Cetuximab monotherapy in colorectal cancer (Karapetis et al, 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The K-ras mutations have also been implicated in tumour radioresistance (Bernhard et al, 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Mutations in codon 12 and 13 of exon 2 account for up to 99% of all K-ras mutations (Bos, 1989). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>More recently, Walker et al (2009) found that 96% of 48 invasive SCAC displayed strong membrane immunoreactivity for EGFR using clone 3C6 from Ventana. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>They also tested in situ lesions as well as condyloma acuminata, and found that with progressive lesion severity, the percentage of samples staining for EGFR increased. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Finally, Van Damme et al (2010) looked at 43 cases of SCAC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Using clone 31G7 they found that about 84% (36 cases) showed immunoreactivity to EGFR, and among these, two thirds exhibited moderate (2+) or strong (3+) staining intensities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Overall, EGFR overexpression in SCAC appears to vary from 55 to 100% depending on the immunohistichemical techniques, antigen retrieval methods, antibodies and scoring systems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Our study, using clone SPM 341 from AnaSpec, demonstrated results in keeping with the literature and confirms that patients in the Montreal area have similar EGFR expression as those patients previously reported. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>It is noteworthy that all the samples that failed to show membranous EGFR staining did show some intracellular staining, suggesting possible intracellular stores. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>The significance of this is unknown as it has not been commented on by other authors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Similar to our cohort of samples, the vast majority of SccH&amp;N are also positive for EGFR overexpression by IHC (Ang et al, 2002; Thariat et al, 2012). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>No K-ras mutations were detected in any of the SCAC samples screened against known positive controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>The K-ras mutations appear to be rare in squamous cell tumours as others reported low K-ras mutation rates in several epithelial tumours (Bos, 1989). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>Recently, Van Damme et al (2010) sequenced 30 anal cancer samples for K-ras mutation, and all samples were wild-type. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Similarly, Zampino et al (2009) found that their 26 tested samples were wild-type K-ras as well. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>All tested samples were negative for EGFR 19 mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>One of our samples, sample 68, was an outlier from the wild-type spread, but it was found to harbour no mutation in the amplified exon when sequenced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>This sample was likely a true false-positive in both the K-ras and EGFR exon 19 assays. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>False positives are well documented in HRMA secondary to degraded DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (Do et al, 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>The only other published paper to look at EGFR exon 19 mutations in SCAC found no mutations in their cohort of 30 samples (Van Damme et al, 2010). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Three samples tested positive by HRMA for EGFR exon 21 mutation and were confirmed to have a synonomous SNP by direct sequencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Both the wild-type and mutated codon code for an arginine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>The ability of the HRMA assay to identify the 1-bp change highlights the sensitivity of the technique and further validates its use. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Within the limited published literature for EGFR mutations in SCAC, Van Damme et al (2010) also found no EGFR mutations in exon 21 in their 30 investigated samples. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of K-ras or EGFR mutation with regards to treatment with concurrent radiation and Cetuximab has not been established (Krause and Baumann, 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Radiation has been shown to stimulate EGFR signalling pathways, and repopulation of epithelial tumour cells after radiation exposure appears to be related to the activation and expression of EGFR (Peter et al, 1993; Schmidt-Ullrich et al, 1997; Petersen et al, 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Irradiation causes EGFR receptor internalisation and transport into the nucleus, binding of the receptor to the catalytic subunit of DNAâprotein kinase, and subsequent repair of the lethal double-strand DNA breaks that result from radiation (Dittmann et al, 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Cetuximab inhibits EGFR activation in the absence and presence of radiation (Dittmann et al, 2005) and it is hypothesised that by preventing double-strand break repair, cancer cells are deprived of a key mechanism of radioresistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Thus, when combined with radiotherapy, blockade of EGFR signalling could conceivably cause irreparable damage to the cancer cells, and result in cancer cure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Indeed, preliminary clinical trials suggest that effectiveness of radiation does increase if combined with anti-EGFR treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>In a landmark phase III study by Bonner et al (2010), Cetuximab combined with radiotherapy vs definitive radiotherapy alone at 5 years demonstrated significant benefits in median duration of overall survival (49 vs 29.3 months, P=0.03) in patients with SccH&amp;N. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there have also been promising results in phase II trials with Cetuximab and concurrent radiation in stage III NSCLC (Jensen et al, 2011), and with chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer (Velenik et al, 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>There are already a few reported cases of anal cancer patients being treated by EGFR inhibitor monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy (Saif et al, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Overall, there is hope in the field that EGFR inhibitors, when combined with current treatment regimens, will help improve survival in refractory anal cancer patients (Lim and Glynne-Jones, 2011). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Presently, there are no clinically established biological markers that can identify patients likely to be radiosensitised by EGFR inhibitors, but we do know that SccH&amp;N tumours express EGFR and lack both EGFR and K-ras mutations (Yarbrough et al, 1994; Temam et al, 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Our results confirm that SCAC overexpresses EGFR and lacks the most commonly described mutations in K-ras and EGFR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>As SCAC is known to be a highly radiosensitive tumour, we support the introduction of clinical trials testing EGFR inhibitors, such as Cetuximab, with concurrent radiotherapy in SCAC. </plain></SENT>
