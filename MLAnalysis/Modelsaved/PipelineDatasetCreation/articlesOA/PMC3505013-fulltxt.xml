non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients for overall survival (OS) after treatment
with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). In this
study, VeriStrat was evaluated as a pre-treatment stratification tool in patients with
advanced stage NSCLC for treatment with the combination of erlotinib and sorafenib,
considering both OS and progression-free survival (PFS) as end points.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Serum samples from 50 patients treated within the context of a phase II trial of
first-line erlotinib and sorafenib were analysed with VeriStrat, a fully locked mass
spectrometry-based test that identifies patients likely to have good or poor outcome on
EGFR therapy based on eight distinct features in mass spectra. Analysis was performed
fully blinded to all clinical data, and then the outcome data were analysed with respect
to the obtained serum classifications.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>VeriStrat classified pre-treatment samples into two groups, VeriStrat Good and

of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Inhibition of the EGFR pathway with tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs), such as erlotinib in patients with advanced NSCLC, leads to improved
survival compared with placebo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Shepherd <italic>et al</italic>,
2005</xref>). Another area of investigation has been the vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) pathway, which has a crucial role in initiation of angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Herbst <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). When both pathways are inhibited
simultaneously, the effect may be synergistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Camp <italic>et al</italic>,
2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Herbst <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Indeed,
treatment with an EGFR-TKI and a VEGF receptor inhibitor showed improved response rates and
progression-free survival (PFS) as compared with EGFR-TKI mono-therapy; however, so far this
combination treatment has not demonstrated a survival benefit and showed disappointing
results in an unselected patient population in first-line setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dingemans <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Herbst <italic>et al</italic>,
2011</xref>). Hence, a reliable biomarker that predicts clinical benefit of combined
EGFR-VEGF inhibition would be very helpful in guiding patient selection, as of today EGFR
mutations are the sole validated predictive biomarkers for patient selection for treatment
with single-agent EGFR-TKIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Sequist <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).
Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry
(MS) is a technique for analysing biological samples, such as plasma, urine and tissue, by
characterising protein content through peaks in the mass spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Yanagisawa <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). VeriStrat (Biodesix, Boulder, CO, USA) is a
test based on a MALDI-TOF MS signature of eight protein or peptide features. It was
developed using pre-treatment serum samples from a cohort of advanced NSCLC patients that
experienced long-term stable disease <italic>vs</italic> early progression on gefitinib monotherapy.
From the mass spectra of these serum samples, eight MS features differentiating the two
outcome groups were identified and used to develop the VeriStrat classifier. This classifier
assigns a classification to each new serum sample: VeriStrat Good (&#8216;good') or
VeriStrat Poor (&#8216;poor'). In less than 3% of cases an unequivocal
classification cannot be assigned and the result is reported as indeterminate. The VeriStrat
test was validated in two independent cohorts of unselected NSCLC patients treated with
erlotinib or gefitinib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Taguchi <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), which
showed that patients with pre-treatment serum classified as &#8216;good' had better
overall survival (OS) than those with serum classified as &#8216;poor' after treatment
with EGFR-TKIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Taguchi <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Also, it has
been shown to be able to classify two independent cohorts of first-line patients and one
cohort of second-line patients treated with erlotinib and bevacizumab (a VEGF receptor
inhibitor) into groups with better or worse OS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akerley <italic>et al</italic>,
2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carbone <italic>et al</italic>, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gautschi <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Newer oral VEGF receptor inhibitors
(such as sorafenib) in combination with erlotinib were found to have clinically relevant
activity in a recent phase II study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lind <italic>et al</italic>,
2010</xref>). Within the context of this study, it was investigated whether VeriStrat
also differentiates outcome after treatment with erlotinib and sorafenib in
chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced NSCLC.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec><title>Patients and protocol</title><p>Serum samples were collected from chemotherapy-naive patients (<italic>n</italic>=50)
who were treated with erlotinib and sorafenib in a multicentre single-arm phase II study
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lind <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). Inclusion criteria in this
trial were chemotherapy-naive patients with pathologically documented, inoperable,
locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic NSCLC. In addition, age &#10878;18 year, Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1, estimated life expectancy &#10878;12
weeks and adequate haematologic, renal and hepatic function were required for inclusion.
Patients had to have at least one measurable lesion according to the Response Evaluation
Criteria of Solid Tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Therasse <italic>et al</italic>,
2000</xref>). Exclusion criteria included symptomatic brain metastasis, severe or
unstable systemic disease, seizure disorder requiring medication, history of bleeding
diathesis and cardiac disease, and uncontrolled hypertension. Patients received orally
administered sorafenib 400&#8201;mg twice a day and erlotinib 150&#8201;mg once a day.
OS was defined as time from start of treatment to death, irrespective of cause. PFS was
defined as time from start of treatment to documented progression of disease or death.
The study was approved by the local medical ethical review boards. All patients provided
written informed consent. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00722969.</p></sec><sec><title>Serum samples</title><p>Serum samples were collected pre-treatment and at weeks 1 and 3 after treatment
initiation. The collection of sera was performed according to the protocols approved by
the local institutional review board. The sera were allowed to clot for 1&#8201;h after
which they were centrifuged at room temperature for 10&#8201;min at 3000&#8201;r.p.m.
Aliquots were taken and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C until further use. Thawing of
aliquots was allowed only once. Serum samples were sent to Biodesix (Boulder, CO, USA)
for VeriStrat testing blinded to all clinical data. The treating physician was unaware
of the outcome of the VeriStrat testing.</p></sec><sec><title>Serum proteomic testing</title><p>The sera were diluted 1&#8201;:&#8201;10 in HPLC-grade water and mixed
(1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;v/v) with matrix solution

&amp; Jackson, Muskegon, MI, USA) :&#8201;water&#8201;:&#8201;trifluoroacetic acid
(Sigma)). The serum&#8211;matrix mixture was spotted in triplicate on a MALDI target in
randomly assigned plate positions and mass spectra acquired using an Autoflex MALDI-TOF
mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). Each replicate spectrum consisted
of an average of 2000 individual spectra collected from various locations within the
spot. Spectral preprocessing was performed, which included background and noise
estimation, background subtraction, alignment and normalisation to partial ion current
before spectral analysis by the VeriStrat algorithm, which classifies each sample as
VeriStrat Good, Poor or Indeterminate. All details of sample processing, spectral
preprocessing and the classification algorithm, based on eight distinct
<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> features have been fixed since development of the test in
2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Taguchi <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). The identity of the
proteins that make up the MALDI-MS features used in the test are still under
investigation. VeriStrat classifications obtained for the samples were returned to the
centre curating the study database, where they were unblinded and merged with the
clinical database.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical significance of difference in OS and PFS between groups was assessed using
log-rank <italic>P</italic>-values. The hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using
Mantel&#8211;Haenszel methods. Categorical data were compared between patient groups
using Fisher's exact tests. Analyses were performed using PRISM (Graphpad, La
Jolla, CA, USA) and SAS Enterprise Guide 4.3 (SAS, Cary, NC, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient characteristics and pre-treatment VeriStrat classification</title><p>Pre-treatment samples were collected from 50 patients. One sample was classified as
indeterminate and one sample was not available, due to withdrawal of consent.
Thirty-three samples were classified as &#8216;good' and 15 samples as
&#8216;poor'. Distribution of the patient characteristics by VeriStrat
classification is given in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Only histology showed
significant correlation with VeriStrat classification (adenocarcinoma <italic>vs</italic> other;
Fisher's exact test <italic>P</italic>=0.02). It is of note that recently presented
results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grigorieva <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>) indicate that,
in contrast to previous results in non-BAC adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of
the lung, no significant separation in PFS was found between VeriStrat groups in BAC
lung cancer. Hence, in this analysis, BAC is listed separately and not included in the
adenocarcinoma subset, even though the term &#8216;BAC' is outdated and the
histological subtype is now considered as adenocarcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Travis
<italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>VeriStrat classification within 3 weeks of treatment initiation</title><p>Changes in VeriStrat classification in the first weeks of treatment were observed in a
substantial proportion of patients. After 3 weeks, 41 samples were available and 35
patients had data at all three time points (pre-treatment, weeks 1 and 3). One week
after commencement of therapy only 26 (60%) patients maintained their
pre-treatment VeriStrat classification, with 12 patients changing from
&#8216;good' to &#8216;poor' and 6 changing from &#8216;poor' to
&#8216;good'. About 45% of patients experienced further changes of
classification at week 3. As a result, out of 35 patients that had data at all three
time points, 46% maintained their classification throughout, 20% changed
at week 1 and reverted at week 3 (all these changes were
&#8216;good'&#8211;&#8216;poor'&#8211;&#8216;good'), and 34%
either changed at week 1 and stayed changed or changed at week 3.</p></sec><sec><title>OS and PFS</title><p>Patients with pre-treatment classification of &#8216;good' had statistically
significantly improved OS compared with those with pre-treatment classification
&#8216;poor' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The HR for OS was 0.30
(95% confidence interval (CI): 0.12&#8211;0.74), with log-rank
<italic>P</italic>=0.009. Median OS was 13.7 months (95% CI: 12.0
months&#8211;undefined) for the &#8216;good' group and 5.6 months (95% CI:
1.6&#8211;7.6 months) for the &#8216;poor' group.</p><p>Patients with pre-treatment classification of &#8216;good' had statistically
significantly improved PFS compared with patients with &#8216;poor' classification
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The HR between groups was 0.40 (95% CI:
0.17&#8211;0.94), with log-rank <italic>P</italic>=0.035. Median PFS was 5.5 months
(95% CI: 3.0&#8211;6.9 months) for the &#8216;good' group and 2.7 months
(95% CI: 1.4&#8211;5.6 months) for the &#8216;poor' group.</p><p>In addition to VeriStrat classification, histology (large-cell and squamous <italic>vs</italic>
adenocarcinoma) was statistically significant in univariate OS analysis. The median
survival for adenocarcinoma patients was 12.4 months (95% CI: 6.3
months-undefined) and 4.7 months (95% CI: 1.6&#8211;10.9 months) for patients
with large cell or squamous histology. In univariate PFS analysis, histology
(adenocarcinoma <italic>vs</italic> large cell or squamous) and smoking history (never
<italic>vs</italic> ever) were significant as well (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Given the relatively small sample size, with only 15 pre-treatment samples classified
as &#8216;poor', meaningful multivariate analysis was not possible. However, we
could perform some subgroup analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A and B</xref> show
OS and PFS for adenocarcinoma patients by VeriStrat classification. The
&#8216;good' group had longer median OS and PFS (12.5 months and 5.5 months,
respectively) than the &#8216;poor' group (5.6 months and 2.7 months,
respectively), although separation between groups did not reach statistical significance
for either comparison (log-rank <italic>P</italic>=0.21, HR=0.45, 95% CI:
0.13&#8211;1.57 for OS and log-rank <italic>P</italic>=0.093, HR=0.26, 95%
CI: 0.06&#8211;1.25 for PFS). Examination of the ever-smokers subgroup showed separation
between &#8216;good' and &#8216;poor' groups that was significant in OS
(<italic>P</italic>=0.0074, HR=0.27, 95% CI: 0.10&#8211;0.70) and trended
to significance in PFS (<italic>P</italic>=0.058, HR=0.43, 95% CI:
0.18&#8211;1.03) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C and D</xref>). The small number of
patients with other histologies and who were never smokers did not allow meaningful
survival analysis in these complementary subgroups.</p><p>Carrying out survival analysis with the PFS data (relative to same starting point as
for the pre-treatment analysis) using the VeriStrat classifications obtained from the
samples collected at weeks 1 and 3 yields no statistically significant separation
between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). For week 1 classification, the
analysis produces HR=0.61 (95% CI: 0.31&#8211;1.23) and log-rank value
<italic>P</italic>=0.17, whereas for week 3 classification, the HR is 0.97 (95%
CI: 0.41&#8211;2.30) and log-rank <italic>P</italic>-value is 0.94.</p></sec><sec><title>Response rates</title><p>Five patients were not evaluable for response: four patients discontinued treatment
before the week 6 CT scan and one patient developed a large cavity in the primary tumour
superimposed by infection. Of these five patients, three were classified as
&#8216;poor' and two were classified as &#8216;good'. Considering response
rates at 6 weeks after commencing treatment by pre-treatment VeriStrat classification,
disease control was maintained in 84% of the &#8216;good' group and in
75% of the &#8216;poor' group, this difference was not statistically
significant (Fisher's exact test <italic>P</italic>-value=0.66) (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In 26% of the &#8216;good' group, an objective
response was measured compared with a response rate of 25% in the
&#8216;poor' group, the difference not being significant (Fisher's exact
test <italic>P</italic>-value &gt;0.99).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Selection of patients most likely to benefit from specific therapies remains a
challenging task in the treatment of NSCLC. This study demonstrates the capacity of the
VeriStrat test to stratify patients with advanced stage NSCLC after treatment with
erlotinib and sorafenib in terms of OS and PFS.</p><p>VeriStrat was developed from pre-treatment sera of patients treated with gefitinib and
subsequently proved able to identify patients likely to have &#8216;poor' or
&#8216;good' outcomes after EGFR-TKI treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Taguchi <italic>et
al</italic>, 2007</xref>). A retrospective analysis on a subset of patients from the
BR.21 trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Shepherd <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) showed a
significant prolongation of OS in the &#8216;good' group after treatment with
erlotinib, whereas there was no significant benefit for the &#8216;poor' group. At
the same time, the significant prognostic power of VeriStrat, that is, separation of
VeriStrat groups in OS and PFS in the placebo arm, was also demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carbone <italic>et al</italic>, 2010a</xref>). In addition, VeriStrat has been
able to stratify outcomes of patients treated with a combination of TKIs and VEGF
inhibitors (erlotinib and bevacizumab) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akerley <italic>et al</italic>,
2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carbone <italic>et al</italic>, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gautschi <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). As erlotinib in combination with
newer oral VEGF receptor inhibitors such as sorafenib may have clinically relevant
antitumour activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lind <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>), it is of
interest that in this cohort of patients treated with erlotinib and sorafenib, VeriStrat
has again demonstrated its potential to identify patients likely to have good and poor
outcomes.</p><p>The study presented has several limitations, common to many retrospective analyses of
phase II studies and related to the small number of the samples. Thus, multivariate
analysis that would have given an estimation of the significance of VeriStrat
classification in the presence of possible confounding factors was not feasible. Previous
analyses in larger retrospective studies have shown that VeriStrat classification remains
a significant factor for outcome in advanced NSCLC patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amann
<italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carbone <italic>et al</italic>,
2010a</xref>), although, these studies involved different treatment regimens.</p><p>However, although the size of the study did not allow meaningful multivariate analysis,
consistent behaviour was found in adenocarcinoma and ever-smoker subgroups. Despite that,
the small group sizes did not give sufficient power to always expect significant
differences and these results should be treated with caution.</p><p>This study found a significant correlation between VeriStrat classification and
histology, a finding that has been observed in previous studies. In larger studies,
multivariate analysis was possible and it has been shown that VeriStrat remains a
significant predictor even when adjusted for this and other possible confounding factors
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Taguchi <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carbone <italic>et al</italic>, 2010a</xref>).</p><p>In the original development study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Taguchi <italic>et al</italic>,
2007</xref>) no statistically significant separation between VeriStrat groups was
found in patients treated with surgery or second-line chemotherapy. VeriStrat Poor
patients may have an advantage when they are treated with chemotherapy instead of
EGFR-TKIs, in contrast to the VeriStrat Good patients who may be likely to benefit from
treatment with targeted therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gregorc, 2009</xref>). Two
ongoing prospective phase III trials are designed to further validate the role of
VeriStrat as a test for treatment optimisation in NSCLC; both trials use VeriStrat
classification as a stratification factor. PROSE is a randomised phase III study of
second-line erlotinib <italic>vs</italic> chemotherapy in patients with inoperable NSCLC
stratified by VeriStrat classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sorlini <italic>et al</italic>,
2011</xref>). The EMPHASIS trial (European Thoracic Oncology Platform) compares
treatment of erlotinib <italic>vs</italic> docetaxel in patients with squamous histology in
patients who failed first-line chemotherapy.</p><p>Recently, the potential of VeriStrat for follow-up during treatment was described
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lazzari <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). The risk of progression
with new lesions in patients that changed classification from &#8216;good'
pre-treatment to &#8216;poor' near progression when treated with gefitinib was
significantly higher than in the rest of the study population. Although further
prospective research on this topic is necessary, it illustrates the potential of VeriStrat
as a longitudinal marker. In our study, serum samples taken after 1 and 3 weeks of
treatment were not related to outcome and were much more variable than in the previous
study, although 66% of patients did keep or return to their pre-treatment
classification 3 weeks after treatment initiation. The differences in the stability of the
classification are probably related to the duration of the intervals between sample
collections: in the former study they were much longer (pre-treatment, after 1 month of
therapy, every 2 months thereafter until progression) than in our trial. Hence, it is
possible that the initiation of therapy has a short-term role in changing the
classification of some patients, who then return to their original classification on a
longer time scale. Also, the previous study involved treatment with gefitinib monotherapy
and this study involves dual EGFR/VEGF inhibition, which may be a factor as well. The
biological meaning of these short-term changes is unclear and needs further
investigation.</p><p>The proteins that make up the VeriStrat proteomic signature have not yet been
conclusively identified. A recent publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Milan <italic>et al</italic>,
2012</xref>) confirmed our earlier (unpublished) results that four out of the eight
peaks of the VeriStrat signature contain several forms of SAA1. However, while numerous
studies have shown elevated levels of SAA1 in various malignancies as well as other
diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biran <italic>et al</italic>, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kokubun <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dowling <italic>et al</italic>,
2012</xref>), attempts to use its direct measurement did not lead to the development
of any clinically useful test. We do not know yet the identity of other proteins
constituting the signature, as well as whether proteins identified are causing the effect
or are just highly correlated with some other proteins relevant to the mechanism of action
of the test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Venet <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). The differential
biological activity of VeriStrat Good and Poor serum was shown in cell line experiments,
which have demonstrated that it is possible to decrease the sensitivity of some lung
cancer cells to EGFR inhibitors by incubating them in media containing VeriStrat Poor
serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hunsucker <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). We hypothesise that
the signature is associated with specific tumour&#8211;host interactions, which lead to
the differential responses to various treatments between VeriStrat groups. It is
interesting to note that several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amann <italic>et al</italic>,
2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chung <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lazzari <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>) and the BR.21 retrospective analysis
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carbone <italic>et al</italic>, 2010a</xref>) have evaluated the
relation between VeriStrat classification and EGFR mutations, and no significant
correlations have been found. We think that worse outcome observed in VeriStrat Poor
patients treated with sorafenib and erlotinib may result from a complex interaction of
tumour cells and tumour microenvironment.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that VeriStrat, a serum proteomic test based on
MALDI-MS of pre-treatment serum samples, can separate chemotherapy-naive advanced NSCLC
patients treated with the erlotinib and sorafenib combination in groups with statistically
different outcomes in terms of PFS and OS. The results need to be confirmed in a larger
trial population.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Sorafenib was provided by Bayer B.V. Division Healthcare, the Netherlands.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p>This work is published under the standard license to publish agreement. After 12 months the
