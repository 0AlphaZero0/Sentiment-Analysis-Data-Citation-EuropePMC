</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Palate lung nasal epithelium clone (PLUNC) was first described in the nasal epithelium of the mouse embryo and the trachea/bronchi of adult mice (Weston et al. 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We cloned the human and mouse PLUNC genes (Bingle and Bingle. 2000; LeClair et al. 2001), and subsequently made the key observation that PLUNC belongs to a group of proteins that make up the largest branch of a lipid transfer protein family. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This group includes phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP), cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP), bactericidal permeability increasing protein (BPI) and LPS-binding protein (LBP) (Bingle and Craven 2002; Bingle and Craven 2004; Bingle et al. 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Structural similarity across the PLUNC/BPI family suggested that these proteins would function by binding lipid molecules (Beamer et al. 1997; Bingle and Craven 2004), and this led to the hypothesis that PLUNCs may share host defence functions with BPI and LBP (Bingle and Craven. 2002). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>PLUNC proteins are encoded by genes in a single locus on human chromosome 20q11, and conserved loci are found in all mammals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>PLUNC proteins encoded by these genes were originally grouped into short (SPLUNC1 etc.) and long (LPLUNC1 etc.) proteins on the basis of structural homology to the domains of BPI, with SPLUNCs having structural similarity to the N-terminal domain of BPI, and LPLUNCs having structural similarity to both domains (Bingle and Craven. 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Due to the increasing complexity of this gene family and conflicting gene nomenclature, a new, comprehensive nomenclature has recently been developed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Within this framework, all family members have been renamed using the root symbol BPIF# for “BPI fold containing”. Family members that contain a single domain have the designation BPIFA (so that SPLUNC1/PLUNC becomes BPIFA1), and those containing two domains have the designation BPIFB (so that LPLUNC1 becomes BPIFB1) (Bingle et al. 2011b). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>BPIF genes are amongst the most rapidly evolving mammalian genes and there is significant interspecies diversity in the wider family, particularly within the BPIFA branch (Bingle et al. 2004; Bingle et al. 2011a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The interspecies diversity and rapid evolution support a role for these proteins in host defence, although compelling functional data is only just starting to emerge (Wright et al. 2010; Gally et al. 2011; Lukinskiene et al. 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>BPIFA1 has also been shown to have a surfactant-like function (Gakhar et al. 2010), and also to be involved in the activation of the sodium channel, ENaC (Garcia-Caballero et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The sites of expression of BPIF proteins are not well-characterised, and indeed many of the genes have never been studied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>However, existing data indicate that these genes are predominantly expressed in locations where innate defence is a major requirement, namely in the nasal, tracheal, and bronchial passages, as well as in major salivary glands and minor mucosal glands of the oral cavity (reviewed in Bingle and Bingle. 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Expression of these genes outside of these regions has also been shown, including Bpifa1 in the mouse thymus (LeClair et al. 2001) and Bpifb1 in the gastrointestinal tract (LeClair et al. 2001; Hou et al 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The prototypic two BPI-domain containing protein, BPIFB1 (LPLUNC1) and the founding family member BPIFA1 (SPLUNC1/PLUNC) are highly expressed in the upper respiratory tract (reviewed in Bingle and Bingle 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>These two family members are present in all mammals (Bingle, Seal and Craven. 2011), and both are also readily detectable in human nasal secretions, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and sputum (Casado et al. 2005; Wu et al. 2005; Nicholas et al. 2006). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Despite initially being cloned in mice, these genes are actually less well-described in this species. Bpifa1 is expressed in the respiratory epithelium of the nasal passages, as well as in the large airways (Weston, et al 1999; LeClair et al. 2001; Genter et al. 2003; LeClair et al. 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Similar nasal expression domains have been shown in the rat (Sung et al. 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Our observations on the expression of Bpifb1 in the epithelium and minor glands of the dorsal tongue and in the large airways, along with the report of expression in the early embryo, remain the only studies of expression of this gene in mice (Hou et al. 2004; LeClair et al. 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there is extensive information concerning the localisation and expression of mouse and rat BPIFA2E (previously known as parotid secretory protein/psp) in the major salivary glands (reviewed in Ball et al. 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Indeed, this protein is the best studied member of this family. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have used mouse specific antibodies to BPIFA1 and BPIFB1 to carry out an extensive analysis of protein localisation in the nasal and oral cavities of adult mice. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Although Bpifa1 (plunc/splunc1) was initially cloned from mice, limited published information exists on the sites of expression in this species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>To inform our choice of tissue samples, we interrogated mouse tissue expression datasets (Su et al. 2004) on the BioGPS portal, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biogps.org">http://biogps.org</ext-link> (Wu et al. 2009) for expression of bpifa1 and bpifb1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>This analysis suggested that both genes have very limited expression domains and are broadly found in similar regions of the nasal cavities, including the nasal septum, the nasal septal organ, the vomeronasal organ (VNO), and the olfactory epithelium, as well as in the trachea and to a lesser extent the lung (Sup Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Because of the low level of sequence similarity between human and mouse BPIF proteins, we generated mouse-specific antibodies against BPIFA1 and BPIFB1 for use in our studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Both BPIFA1 antibodies and one BPIFB1 antibody (Antibody “B”) worked well for immunohistochemistry (IHC), and crucially they failed to show specific staining in tissue samples from mice deficient in BPIFA1 and BPIFB1 (Sup Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>We have also recently used these antibodies for the identification of the proteins in mouse bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, and to show the differential localisation of the proteins in the respiratory tract (Bingle et al. 2012). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Given the original isolation of bpifa1 from the mouse nasal septum, we surveyed the localisation of BPIFA1 in the adult head using a series of coronal sections starting from the snout. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Within the anterior nasal cavity, most of the surface is covered with squamous epithelium, and in this region BPIFA1 is present in the patches of respiratory epithelium (Fig. 1a) on the lateral surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>The transitional epithelium overlaying the nasal septum was negative. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>In more caudal/posterior sections there was always a very clear demarcation between staining in the respiratory epithelium (Fig. 1b–f) and complete lack of staining in the transitional epithelium and olfactory epithelium of these regions. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that both bpifa1 and bpifb1 were originally cloned from mouse heads over 10 years ago (bpifa1 from nasal tissue and bpifb1 from proximal tongue), information on their expression domains is quite limited and is exclusively based on RNA expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>One of the most interesting observations on members of the wider BPIF-family is that they share relatively limited sequence similarity both within and between species (Bingle et al. 2004: Bingle, Bingle and Craven. 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>This key observation has allowed us to generate a series of unique species-specific antibodies to study BPIFA1 and BPIFB1 localisation in mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Our study of these two proteins in adult mice has allowed us to gain a fuller understanding of the sites of production, and has confirmed that both proteins are largely confined to regions of the head and upper respiratory tract. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>We have also recently reported that the two proteins are expressed in distinct epithelial cell populations in the airway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>BPIFA1 is expressed in non-ciliated cells of the upper airway and the bronchial passages, whereas BPIFB1 stains a limited population of goblet cells in the upper airways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Neither protein is expressed in the small airways or in peripheral lung tissue (Bingle et al 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>In this report, we described the systematic localisation of BPIFA1 or BPIFB1 in the mouse, a model that will be of value in understanding the biological function of these proteins. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Bpifa1 was originally identified in developing nasal passages and the upper respiratory tract of adult mice (Weston et al. 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Our immunohistochemical analysis confirms that these are the major sites of expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>The most intense staining for BPIFA1 is in regions of the nasal passages, and within these regions the protein is localised to epithelial cells within the respiratory epithelium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>This is also consistent with previous studies of rat bpifa1 (Sung et al. 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>The protein is not found in the squamous, transitional, or olfactory epithelium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>The protein is associated with mucoid secretions of the nasal turbinates as well as with the ciliated surface overlying the olfactory epithelium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>It seems likely that BPIFA1 is secreted by Bowman’s glands, as both the glands and their associated ducts stain strongly for BPIFA1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>The protein does not seem to be produced by any of the other multiple minor glands associated with the nasal passages, nor does it appear to be produced by the vomeronasal or the nasal septal organs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this localisation, the protein is readily detected in nasal washes by Western blotting (results not shown), and the data suggest that the protein is secreted into the mucosal lining fluids in these locations where it likely plays a host defence role. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Mouse bpifb1 was originally cloned (NCBI accession number U46068) from minor glands of the proximal tongue and our in situ hybridization studies confirmed this, along with expression in the epithelium of the upper airways (LeClair et al. 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>The present study further confirms that the protein is found in the serous portions of minor glands of the proximal tongue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, here it appears to be expressed in the same cells as the well-studied rodent family member, BPIFA2E (formally known as parotid secretory protein) (Ball et al. 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Such co-localisation is the exception rather than the rule, as BPIFB1 is not produced in the sublingual and parotid glands, which strongly express BPIFA2E. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Conversely, BPIFB1 is expressed in the serous demilunes of the seromucus glands of the soft palate, where BPIFA2E is not expressed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>In the submucosal glands of the larynx (and trachea), BPIFB1 and BPIFA1 are present in different cellular compartments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>BPIFB1 is found in the serous cells, whereas BPIFA1 is present in mucous cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>This distribution mirrors that seen in human airway submucosal glands and other minor mucosal glands (Bingle et al. 2005; Bingle et al. 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>It remains to be determined why members of this family exhibit such a precise spatial expression pattern within these glands, given that secretory products from the serous and mucous cells ultimately end up being secreted into the same biological fluids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, there do appear to be interspecies differences in the distribution of BPIF proteins in the major salivary glands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>BPIFA1 and BPIFB1 are expressed in human major salivary glands (Bingle et al. 2005; Vargas et al 2009; Bingle et al. 2010), and are readily detected in saliva (Ramachandran et al. 2006; Walz et al. 2006; Siqueira et al. 2008), but our data shows that they are absent, or lowly expressed, in adult mouse salivary glands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in mouse, BPIFA2E (parotid secretory protein) is a major component of saliva accounting for 20-30 % of salivary protein, whereas levels of the closest human orthologue of the protein in man, BPIFA2, are much less. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>In addition to being present in the serous compartment of tongue minor glands, BPIFB1 is also present in a subset of what appear to be goblet cells within the nasopharynx This is particularly evident in sections through the nasal cavity and within the nasopharynx (Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>As we have previously reported for the human protein, not all goblet cells in these regions produce the protein (Sup Fig. 4), and goblet cells in other locations, including the GI tract (Sup Fig 3) and the conjunctiva (data not shown), do not stain for BPIFB1. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Outside of the head, neck, and upper respiratory tract, it appears that both of these proteins have limited expression in adult mouse tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Mouse bpifa1 expression was originally reported in the adult mouse heart (Weston et al. 1999), whilst other studies have suggested that the gene is expressed in models of cardiomyopathy (Bekeredjian et al. 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>We have been unable to detect the protein in normal adult heart tissues by immunohistochemistry, suggesting that the protein is either absent from this tissue or is produced at levels below the limit of detection by IHC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Human BPIFA1 expression has also been reported in the stomach, colon, and kidney, leading to the suggestion that it plays a role in the regulation of processing of the sodium channel, ENaC in these location (Garcia-Caballero et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>We were unable to detect the protein in mouse kidney, nor in any portions of the mouse GI tract from the stomach to the rectum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>This may reflect a true difference between species, or again may be due to the fact that expression is very low in these tissues, and below the detection limit of the IHC technique. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that bpifb1 was expressed in the prenatal GI tract (LeClair et al. 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Expression has also been reported in the adult mouse stomach (Hou et al. 2004; Kallio et al. 2010) as well as in the developing wallaby stomach (Kwek et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Our protein studies support these observations, showing that BPIFB1 is present in a population of cells within the gastric fundus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>We were unable to detect the protein in any other regions of the GI tract, suggesting that it is not a significant product of the gastrointestinal mucosa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>As far as we are aware, the protein has not previously been reported in the mouse GI tract, but we have recently shown that the protein is present in a population of Paneth cells in the human duodenum (Shin et al. 2011), where it has been shown to decrease pro-inflammatory responses to V. cholerae and E. coli LPS. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>In summary, we have shown that the two most abundantly expressed members of the mouse BPIF protein family, BPIFA1 and BPIFB1, are localised to a number of epithelial cell types and minor mucosal glands associated with the nose, mouth, and respiratory tract. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>BPIFA1 is most strongly expressed in the nasal respiratory epithelium, whereas BPIFB1 appears to be most strongly expressed in the minor glands of the proximal tongue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>There is limited expression of BPIFB1 in a population of goblet cells in the nasopharynx. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>As is the case in man, the two proteins are produced by different epithelial cell types, and may play host defence roles in the mucosal fluids in these locations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Understanding where these proteins are produced in the mouse will be of benefit to future functional studies on these and other members of the BPIF family. </plain></SENT>
