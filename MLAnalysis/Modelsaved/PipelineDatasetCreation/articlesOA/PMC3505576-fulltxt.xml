The accelerated breakdown of muscle and adipose tissues providing substrates to the host and the tumour is responsible for the depletion of lipid and protein stores and account for most of the weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Skeletal muscle atrophy is a major factor involved in cancer cachexia since it contributes to physical disability, weakness and decreased capacity of wound healing and reduces responsiveness to chemotherapy. Skeletal muscle loss in cancer cachexia is due to fibre atrophy, which seems to affect predominantly glycolytic fibres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Research efforts have led to better understanding of the molecular and signalling mechanisms responsible for skeletal muscle atrophy in cancer cachexia. Studies in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] as well as in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] emphasise the ubiquitin&#8211;proteasome pathway as the main mechanism for myofibrillar protein degradation. Muscle atrophy F box (MAFbx)/atrogin 1 and muscle RING finger 1 (MuRF1), muscle-specific E3 ligases with function in protein ubiquitination, have been shown to mediate proteosome-dependent protein degradation in cancer cachexia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The ubiquitin&#8211;proteasome-dependent proteolysis is an ATP requiring process. Therefore, we can logically wonder how muscle mitochondria deals with these high energy needs for proteolysis in cancer cachexia. The mitochondrial respiratory chain ATP synthesis by the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub>ATP synthase is coupled to oxygen consumption (oxidation). The coupling of the oxidative phosphorylation is modulated in order to maintain energy homeostasis with a compromise between the rate and efficiency of ATP synthesis. During high energy demand, the cost for a high rate of ATP synthesis in mitochondria is a decreased efficiency. These processes represent energy wasting since all oxygen consumed will not be converted into ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In this way, we can hypothesise that in a situation of high muscle proteolysis as in cancer cachexia, muscle mitochondria could be the place of energy wasting. If energy wasting (reduction in ATP production efficiency) is occurring in skeletal muscle mitochondria, it could participate significantly to cancer cachexia by increasing energy expenditure since skeletal muscle accounts for 15 to 30&#160;% of the basal energy expenditure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Pioneer indirect evidences for a reduction in oxidative phosphorylation efficiency in skeletal muscle mitochondria in cancer cachexia came from studies reporting uncoupling protein 2 and 3 (UCP) genes overexpression in skeletal muscle in animal model of cancer cachexia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] as well as in patients with cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], or other wasting diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Overexpression of UCP2 and UCP3 were considered by these authors as possibly associated to mitochondrial uncoupling, but never experimentally proven. Recently, Constantinou and collaborators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], using in vivo <sup>31</sup>P nuclear magnetic resonance, published interesting data reinforcing the idea that muscle energy production capacities are affected in cancer cachexia. Indeed, skeletal muscle ATP synthesis rate was significantly reduced in mouse model of cancer cachexia. However, to our knowledge, only one study has investigated muscle mitochondrial respiratory chain function in a rat cancer cachexia model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Ushmorov and co-workers found a reduction in oxygen consumption in phosphorylating state (with ATP synthesis) in isolated skeletal muscle mitochondria but data on ATP synthesis efficiency and energy wasting were lacking. Another recent study reported a reduction in cytochrome c oxidase IV (COX IV) protein expression in skeletal muscle of ApcMin/+ cachectic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Despite these indirect evidences and arguments, efficiency of skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in cancer cachexia is still unexplored while it can significantly affect energy balance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine if efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation is impaired in skeletal muscle mitochondria in a preclinical model of cancer cachexia in rats.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animal care and experimental design</title><p>The present investigation received the agreement of the French Ethic Committee &#8216;Region Centre&#8217; and was performed in accordance with the French guiding principles in the care and use of animals. Twenty healthy immunocompetent male Berlin&#8211;Druckrey IX (BDIX) rats were supplied by Charles River laboratories (L&#8217;Arbresle, France) at 8&#160;weeks of age (195&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2&#160;g). After arrival, the rats were housed three per cage and were fed ad libitum and weighed weekly.</p><p>We used the PROb-BDIX model of cancer cachexia as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. At 9&#160;weeks of age, rats were individually housed and acclimated for 2&#160;weeks. During this period, body weight and food intake were measured every 2&#160;days. Then, rats were divided into three groups as follows: (1) one fed ad libitum with tumour inoculation (peritoneal carcinosis, PC; <italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;10) that received a single IP injection of 10<sup>6</sup> of PROb cells in 1&#160;ml of RPMI 1640 medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], (2) one healthy group fed ad libitum that received an IP injection of 1&#160;ml of RPMI 1640 medium without tumour inoculation (Hal; n&#8201;=&#8201;10) and (3) one healthy group pair-fed to PC rats (PF, <italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;10). PF rats, weight-matched to PC rats, received an IP injection of 1&#160;ml of RPMI 1640 medium without tumour inoculation. The use of a pair-fed group as control allowed us to discriminate between the effects of anorexia and hypermetabolism related to cancer cachexia on the parameters measured in this study. The amount of food for the PF rats was based on the food intake measured every 2&#160;days in PC rats until sacrifice (each PC rat was paired with a PF rat).</p><p>As we described previously (for details, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]), when PC rats reached severe cachexia state (sacrifice time), food intake was significantly reduced (severe anorexia, &#8722;75&#8201;&#177;&#8201;4&#160;% of reduction in comparison to Hal rats). Food intake reduction was progressive during peritoneal carcinosis development and became statistically significant from 24&#160;days after cancer induction (&#8722;20&#160;%) until sacrifice (35&#160;days after cancer induction) (&#8722;75&#8201;&#177;&#8201;4&#160;%).</p><p>Body weight (ascites free) of PC rats at sacrifice was significantly lower than in Hal (305&#8201;&#177;&#8201;29 vs 378&#8201;&#177;&#8201;28&#160;g, respectively) and PF rats (332&#8201;&#177;&#8201;21&#160;g) (results published in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]). Moreover, body weight of PF rats at sacrifice time was significantly lower than in the Hal group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].

After RNase-Free DNase treatment, RNA was reverse-transcribed using Super Script II RNase H Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and random primers (Promega, Charbonnieres-les-bains, France). Quantitative real-time RT-PCRs were performed in duplicate using an ABI Prism 7000 apparatus (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The primers chosen for studying the gene expression of two ubiquitin&#8211;protein ligases ((E3) MuRF1 and atrogin 1/MAFbx) and UCP2 and UCP3 were specifically designed and validated (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). All primers were obtained from Eurogentec SA (Angers, France). The cycling conditions consisted in a denaturation step (95&#176;C for 10&#160;min) and 35 cycles of amplification, including both denaturation for 15&#160;s at 95&#176;C and annealing&#8211;extension for 1&#160;min at 60&#176;C (62&#176;C for UCP2). At the end of the PCR, dissociation was performed by slowly heating the samples from 60 to 95&#176;C and continuous recording of the decrease in SYBR Green fluorescence resulting from the dissociation of double-stranded DNA. Mean PCR efficiency for each target gene was determined by performing five to six serial dilutions of a cDNA pool. The threshold cycle (Ct), defined as the cycle at which an increase in fluorescence above a defined baseline can be first detected, was determined for each sample. The mRNA levels were estimated based on the Ct deviation of an unknown sample vs a control cDNA (consisting of a pool of rat muscle cDNA) according to the equation proposed by Pfaffl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

Skeletal muscle atrophy is a main target of cancer cachexia. Direct and indirect evidences suggested the implication of mitochondrial bioenergetics disorders in muscle loss during cancer cachexia. Hypotheses about these bioenergetics disorders are mitochondrial uncoupling and/or alteration of ATP synthesis rate. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine if efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation is impaired in skeletal muscle mitochondria in a preclinical model of cancer cachexia in rats.</p><p>We had previously validated the model of cancer induced by peritoneal carcinosis in BDIX rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It is a useful preclinical model in cancer cachexia field because peritoneal carcinosis is a serious clinical situation with a poor prognosis that is frequent in several cancer types, such as ovarian, pancreatic, stomach or colorectal cancers. We have demonstrated the occurrence of hallmarks of the syndrome: anorexia, systemic inflammation, white adipose and skeletal muscle wasting. Furthermore, the use of pair-fed rats demonstrated the presence of a hypermetabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The first step of the present study was to check if the model of peritoneal carcinosis-induced cachexia in BDIX rats was presenting the main specific characteristics of muscle wasting described in animal and human studies. Focussing on main hindlimb muscles as <italic>quadriceps</italic> (Quad), <italic>extensor digitorum longus</italic> (EDL), <italic>gastrocnemius</italic> (Gast), <italic>plantaris</italic> (PL), <italic>soleus</italic> (Sol) and <italic>tibialis anterior</italic> (TA) that presented various compositions in fibre type, we found that the <italic>soleus</italic> was the only muscle unaffected by peritoneal carcinosis. These results are in agreement with previous studies reporting that fast glycolytic muscles are more susceptible to wasting in cancer cachexia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Muscle wasting in the present study was associated to a large increase in the expression of two major genes involved in the ubiquitin&#8211;proteasome system, MuRF1 and MAFbx, in <italic>quadriceps</italic> PC rats in comparison to Hal and PF rats as reported by numerous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Since there was no difference between Hal and PF rats in muscle weight and proteolysis-related gene expression, we chose to use PF rats as control for PC rats for the analysis of the following data. Moreover, the aim of the present study was to investigate if energy wasting (reduction in ATP production efficiency) was occurring in skeletal muscle mitochondria keeping in mind that it could contribute to cancer cachexia-related hypermetabolism. In this way, the pair-fed group allowed us to discriminate between the effects of anorexia and hypermetabolism related to cancer cachexia on the parameters measured in this study.</p><p>Muscle morphology study indicates that muscle loss observed in rat with peritoneal carcinosis was due to a reduction in fibre CSA rather that in its number. From these data, we can conclude that peritoneal carcinosis induction in BDIX rats reached all characteristics of cancer cachexia, since in addition to what we described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], there was a clear muscle atrophy affecting fast-twitch fibres associated to large up-regulation of the ubiquitin&#8211;proteasome pathway. Thus, the PROb-BDIX model is a suitable model to investigate mechanisms involved in cancer cachexia and specifically to study mitochondrial bioenergetics in <italic>quadriceps</italic> muscle wasting.</p><p>In order to elucidate if there are alterations in energy production yield in skeletal muscle mitochondria in cancer cachexia, we performed a complete analysis of mitochondrial bioenergetics. Our study is the first investigating the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, in isolated skeletal muscle mitochondria in a preclinical cancer cachexia model. The ATP synthesis efficiency was sought by measuring the relationship between oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis rate (ATP/O). The ATP/O was similar between PC and PF rats. Therefore, we clearly demonstrated that ATP synthesis efficiency was unchanged in <italic>quadriceps</italic> mitochondria in our rat model of cancer cachexia (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p><p>The absence of alteration in oxidative phosphorylation efficiency in PC rats compared to PF rats is contradictory with the previously suggested mitochondrial uncoupling (by UCPs) reported in skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In our study, the absence of mitochondrial uncoupling was confirmed by similar oxygen consumption in non-phosphorylating state (state IV) in PC rats and PF rats. In fact, state IV is described as the oxygen consumption necessary to compensate loss of electrochemical gradient, considered as uncoupling due to proton leak. Moreover, respiratory control ratio (state III/state IV) of skeletal muscle mitochondria was not affected by peritoneal carcinosis-induced cachexia. The absence of uncoupling was concomitant with overexpression of UCP2 gene in skeletal muscle in PC rats compared to PF. Surprisingly, there was no difference in UCP3 expression. These later data need to be compared with the study that had designed pair-fed groups as calorie restriction is well known to increase UCP2 and UCP3 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Since PF rats had a significant increase of 74&#160;% in UCP3 gene expression in comparison to Hal rats (data not shown), our study is in agreement with studies reporting that UCP3 gene expression is related to calorie intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. As mitochondrial uncoupling is unlikely, our data clearly questioned the role of UCP2 in skeletal muscle during cancer cachexia. The physiological and pathological roles of UCP2 and UCP3 are still a large subject of debate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, we can highlight the suggested function of UCP2 as antioxidant defence by reducing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production (ROS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. To reinforce this potential antioxidant role of UCP2, we have shown that there was no difference in <italic>quadriceps</italic> mitochondrial ROS production in PC and PF rats (data not shown).</p><p>Even though the global analysis (slope and intercept) of ATP/O indicates no alteration in ATP synthesis efficiency, some difference come to light. In this way, the oxygen consumption at the highest hexokinase concentration (highest ATP synthesis rate) was significantly lower in PC compared to PF (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In the same way, at the highest oxygen consumption common to PC and PF rats of ATP/O, ATP synthesis rate was reduced by 20&#160;% in PC rats compared to PF rats, without reaching statistically significant difference. Our data are in agreement with the significant reduction in skeletal muscle ATP synthesis rate, measured in vivo by <sup>31</sup>P NMR, in mice implanted with Lewis lung carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This suggests that the reduction in the rate of ATP synthesis observed in vivo is rather due to a reduction in the respiratory chain activity than an alteration of the ATP synthesis efficiency.</p><p>We confirmed the reduction in respiratory chain activity by performing oxygraphic measurement on isolated mitochondria. In fact, <italic>quadriceps</italic> mitochondrial oxygen consumption in the phosphorylating state and in the uncoupled state was significantly reduced in PC rats compared to PF rats. These data clearly demonstrate lower muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacities in PC rats compared to PF suggesting alterations in content and/or activity of respiratory chain complexes. Because complex IV is one of the main regulator of oxidative phosphorylations in skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], we measured the activity and protein content of this respiratory complex. While complex IV expression was unaffected by cancer cachexia, activity was significantly decrease in PC compared to PF rats. Such dysfunctions were reported by Ushmorov and collaborators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] with C57BL/6 mice bearing fibrosarcoma MCA-105 as model of cancer cachexia. These authors demonstrated that in the phosphorylating state, skeletal muscle mitochondria from tumour-bearing mice displayed significant reduction in oxygen consumption at complexes II&#8211;III and IV in comparison to control mice. More specifically, as the protocol was set by Ushmorov and co-workers, the measurement of &#8216;complexes II&#8211;III&#8217; activities was in fact &#8216;complex II&#8211;III&#8211;IV&#8217; activities since complex IV is the final electron acceptor of the respiratory chain. Thus, by reporting around the same percent of reduction (&#8722;20 and &#8722;25&#160;%) in the activities of complexes &#8216;II&#8211;III&#8211;IV&#8217; and IV alone, these authors provided evidence for an alteration in complex IV activity in skeletal muscle-isolated mitochondria from cachectic animals in complete accordance with our data. We confirmed the specific implication of complex IV in oxidative capacities reduction with a positive significant correlation between COX activity and uncoupled state oxygen consumption (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).</p><p>Among the regulators of complex IV activity, cardiolipins, a specific phospholipid class of mitochondrial membranes, have been clearly identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In the present study, the cardiolipin content in <italic>quadriceps</italic> mitochondria was not affected by cancer cachexia. As oxidative stress was clearly associated to muscle wasting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], we cannot exclude the occurrence of cardiolipin peroxidation that was reported to affect COX activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Direct oxidative damages of complex IV by lipid-derived protein adducts (4-HNE and MDA) cannot be ruled out since protein oxidative damages were reported in <italic>gastrocnemius</italic> muscle in AH-130 Yoshida hepatoma rat model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, these authors found ATP synthase as the only oxidative phosphorylation-related protein affected by lipid peroxidation by-products. Lastly, because COX activity is known to be regulated by ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], we can hypothesise that reduction in COX is due to a higher allosteric ATP inhibition by modulation of COX phosphorylation.</p><p>A reduced mitochondrial oxidative capacity in muscle during cancer cachexia is somehow paradoxical since proteolysis by the ubiquitin&#8211;proteasome system is ATP dependent. In this condition, additional ATP supply is produced by anaerobic glycolytic energy pathways with lactate production. Thus, skeletal muscle mitochondrial alterations could participate significantly to the increase in plasma lactate concentration supplying the futile Cori cycle that participate to the increase in whole body energy needs. Moreover, we can speculate that reduction in skeletal muscle oxidative capacities could play a significant role in (1) lipid droplet accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and (2) insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] that are occurring during cancer cachexia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The PROb-BDIX rat model is suitable to investigate the mechanisms involved in cancer cachexia and specifically in muscle wasting and the potential implication of mitochondrial bioenergetics alterations. Moreover, this model can be used to test nutritional and pharmacological strategies to limit muscle atrophy in cancer cachexia. First, our study confirms that skeletal muscle mitochondrial bioenergetics alterations are present in cancer cachexia. The nature of these alterations is not related to energy wasting but to a reduction in mitochondrial oxidative capacities due to a decrease in complex IV activity. This could be responsible for a reduction in ATP production in muscle mitochondria without modification of ATP synthesis efficiency. The present study brings new pieces in the puzzle of mitochondrial implication in muscle wasting. The mechanisms implicated in the reduction in muscle mitochondrial complex IV activity in cachectic rat need to be fully explored.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by Ligue Contre le Cancer (comit&#233;s 37 and 28), Conseil R&#233;gional de la R&#233;gion Centre and Canceropole Grand Ouest (axe Valorisation des produits de la mer en canc&#233;rologie)&#8217;.
