</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Cancer cachexia is a complex syndrome that encompasses a wide range of metabolic, hormonal and cytokine-related abnormalities leading to a negative energy balance due to both anorexia and hypermetabolism resulting in a wasting syndrome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The accelerated breakdown of muscle and adipose tissues providing substrates to the host and the tumour is responsible for the depletion of lipid and protein stores and account for most of the weight loss [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Skeletal muscle atrophy is a major factor involved in cancer cachexia since it contributes to physical disability, weakness and decreased capacity of wound healing and reduces responsiveness to chemotherapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Skeletal muscle loss in cancer cachexia is due to fibre atrophy, which seems to affect predominantly glycolytic fibres [2, 3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Research efforts have led to better understanding of the molecular and signalling mechanisms responsible for skeletal muscle atrophy in cancer cachexia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Studies in animals [4] as well as in humans [5] emphasise the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway as the main mechanism for myofibrillar protein degradation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Muscle atrophy F box (MAFbx)/atrogin 1 and muscle RING finger 1 (MuRF1), muscle-specific E3 ligases with function in protein ubiquitination, have been shown to mediate proteosome-dependent protein degradation in cancer cachexia [4, 6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The ubiquitin–proteasome-dependent proteolysis is an ATP requiring process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we can logically wonder how muscle mitochondria deals with these high energy needs for proteolysis in cancer cachexia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The mitochondrial respiratory chain ATP synthesis by the F1F0ATP synthase is coupled to oxygen consumption (oxidation). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The coupling of the oxidative phosphorylation is modulated in order to maintain energy homeostasis with a compromise between the rate and efficiency of ATP synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>During high energy demand, the cost for a high rate of ATP synthesis in mitochondria is a decreased efficiency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>These processes represent energy wasting since all oxygen consumed will not be converted into ATP [7, 8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In this way, we can hypothesise that in a situation of high muscle proteolysis as in cancer cachexia, muscle mitochondria could be the place of energy wasting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>If energy wasting (reduction in ATP production efficiency) is occurring in skeletal muscle mitochondria, it could participate significantly to cancer cachexia by increasing energy expenditure since skeletal muscle accounts for 15 to 30 % of the basal energy expenditure [9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Pioneer indirect evidences for a reduction in oxidative phosphorylation efficiency in skeletal muscle mitochondria in cancer cachexia came from studies reporting uncoupling protein 2 and 3 (UCP) genes overexpression in skeletal muscle in animal model of cancer cachexia [10–15] as well as in patients with cancer [16], or other wasting diseases [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of UCP2 and UCP3 were considered by these authors as possibly associated to mitochondrial uncoupling, but never experimentally proven. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Recently, Constantinou and collaborators [15], using in vivo 31P nuclear magnetic resonance, published interesting data reinforcing the idea that muscle energy production capacities are affected in cancer cachexia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Indeed, skeletal muscle ATP synthesis rate was significantly reduced in mouse model of cancer cachexia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>However, to our knowledge, only one study has investigated muscle mitochondrial respiratory chain function in a rat cancer cachexia model [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Ushmorov and co-workers found a reduction in oxygen consumption in phosphorylating state (with ATP synthesis) in isolated skeletal muscle mitochondria but data on ATP synthesis efficiency and energy wasting were lacking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Another recent study reported a reduction in cytochrome c oxidase IV (COX IV) protein expression in skeletal muscle of ApcMin/+ cachectic mice [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Despite these indirect evidences and arguments, efficiency of skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in cancer cachexia is still unexplored while it can significantly affect energy balance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine if efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation is impaired in skeletal muscle mitochondria in a preclinical model of cancer cachexia in rats. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Cancer cachexia is the consequence of a negative energy balance due to both anorexia and hypermetabolism, resulting in a wasting syndrome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Skeletal muscle atrophy is a main target of cancer cachexia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Direct and indirect evidences suggested the implication of mitochondrial bioenergetics disorders in muscle loss during cancer cachexia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Hypotheses about these bioenergetics disorders are mitochondrial uncoupling and/or alteration of ATP synthesis rate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine if efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation is impaired in skeletal muscle mitochondria in a preclinical model of cancer cachexia in rats. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>We had previously validated the model of cancer induced by peritoneal carcinosis in BDIX rats [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>It is a useful preclinical model in cancer cachexia field because peritoneal carcinosis is a serious clinical situation with a poor prognosis that is frequent in several cancer types, such as ovarian, pancreatic, stomach or colorectal cancers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated the occurrence of hallmarks of the syndrome: anorexia, systemic inflammation, white adipose and skeletal muscle wasting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the use of pair-fed rats demonstrated the presence of a hypermetabolism [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>The first step of the present study was to check if the model of peritoneal carcinosis-induced cachexia in BDIX rats was presenting the main specific characteristics of muscle wasting described in animal and human studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Focussing on main hindlimb muscles as quadriceps (Quad), extensor digitorum longus (EDL), gastrocnemius (Gast), plantaris (PL), soleus (Sol) and tibialis anterior (TA) that presented various compositions in fibre type, we found that the soleus was the only muscle unaffected by peritoneal carcinosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>These results are in agreement with previous studies reporting that fast glycolytic muscles are more susceptible to wasting in cancer cachexia [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Muscle wasting in the present study was associated to a large increase in the expression of two major genes involved in the ubiquitin–proteasome system, MuRF1 and MAFbx, in quadriceps PC rats in comparison to Hal and PF rats as reported by numerous studies [4, 6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Since there was no difference between Hal and PF rats in muscle weight and proteolysis-related gene expression, we chose to use PF rats as control for PC rats for the analysis of the following data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the aim of the present study was to investigate if energy wasting (reduction in ATP production efficiency) was occurring in skeletal muscle mitochondria keeping in mind that it could contribute to cancer cachexia-related hypermetabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>In this way, the pair-fed group allowed us to discriminate between the effects of anorexia and hypermetabolism related to cancer cachexia on the parameters measured in this study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Muscle morphology study indicates that muscle loss observed in rat with peritoneal carcinosis was due to a reduction in fibre CSA rather that in its number. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>From these data, we can conclude that peritoneal carcinosis induction in BDIX rats reached all characteristics of cancer cachexia, since in addition to what we described previously [20], there was a clear muscle atrophy affecting fast-twitch fibres associated to large up-regulation of the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Thus, the PROb-BDIX model is a suitable model to investigate mechanisms involved in cancer cachexia and specifically to study mitochondrial bioenergetics in quadriceps muscle wasting. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>In order to elucidate if there are alterations in energy production yield in skeletal muscle mitochondria in cancer cachexia, we performed a complete analysis of mitochondrial bioenergetics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Our study is the first investigating the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, in isolated skeletal muscle mitochondria in a preclinical cancer cachexia model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>The ATP synthesis efficiency was sought by measuring the relationship between oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis rate (ATP/O). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>The ATP/O was similar between PC and PF rats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we clearly demonstrated that ATP synthesis efficiency was unchanged in quadriceps mitochondria in our rat model of cancer cachexia (Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>The absence of alteration in oxidative phosphorylation efficiency in PC rats compared to PF rats is contradictory with the previously suggested mitochondrial uncoupling (by UCPs) reported in skeletal muscle [10–12, 14–16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>In our study, the absence of mitochondrial uncoupling was confirmed by similar oxygen consumption in non-phosphorylating state (state IV) in PC rats and PF rats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>In fact, state IV is described as the oxygen consumption necessary to compensate loss of electrochemical gradient, considered as uncoupling due to proton leak. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>Moreover, respiratory control ratio (state III/state IV) of skeletal muscle mitochondria was not affected by peritoneal carcinosis-induced cachexia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>The absence of uncoupling was concomitant with overexpression of UCP2 gene in skeletal muscle in PC rats compared to PF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, there was no difference in UCP3 expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>These later data need to be compared with the study that had designed pair-fed groups as calorie restriction is well known to increase UCP2 and UCP3 expression [28, 29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Since PF rats had a significant increase of 74 % in UCP3 gene expression in comparison to Hal rats (data not shown), our study is in agreement with studies reporting that UCP3 gene expression is related to calorie intake [10, 11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>As mitochondrial uncoupling is unlikely, our data clearly questioned the role of UCP2 in skeletal muscle during cancer cachexia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>The physiological and pathological roles of UCP2 and UCP3 are still a large subject of debate [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>However, we can highlight the suggested function of UCP2 as antioxidant defence by reducing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production (ROS) [31, 32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>To reinforce this potential antioxidant role of UCP2, we have shown that there was no difference in quadriceps mitochondrial ROS production in PC and PF rats (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Even though the global analysis (slope and intercept) of ATP/O indicates no alteration in ATP synthesis efficiency, some difference come to light. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>In this way, the oxygen consumption at the highest hexokinase concentration (highest ATP synthesis rate) was significantly lower in PC compared to PF (Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>In the same way, at the highest oxygen consumption common to PC and PF rats of ATP/O, ATP synthesis rate was reduced by 20 % in PC rats compared to PF rats, without reaching statistically significant difference. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Our data are in agreement with the significant reduction in skeletal muscle ATP synthesis rate, measured in vivo by 31P NMR, in mice implanted with Lewis lung carcinoma [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the reduction in the rate of ATP synthesis observed in vivo is rather due to a reduction in the respiratory chain activity than an alteration of the ATP synthesis efficiency. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>We confirmed the reduction in respiratory chain activity by performing oxygraphic measurement on isolated mitochondria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>In fact, quadriceps mitochondrial oxygen consumption in the phosphorylating state and in the uncoupled state was significantly reduced in PC rats compared to PF rats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>These data clearly demonstrate lower muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacities in PC rats compared to PF suggesting alterations in content and/or activity of respiratory chain complexes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Because complex IV is one of the main regulator of oxidative phosphorylations in skeletal muscle [33], we measured the activity and protein content of this respiratory complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>While complex IV expression was unaffected by cancer cachexia, activity was significantly decrease in PC compared to PF rats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Such dysfunctions were reported by Ushmorov and collaborators [18] with C57BL/6 mice bearing fibrosarcoma MCA-105 as model of cancer cachexia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>These authors demonstrated that in the phosphorylating state, skeletal muscle mitochondria from tumour-bearing mice displayed significant reduction in oxygen consumption at complexes II–III and IV in comparison to control mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>More specifically, as the protocol was set by Ushmorov and co-workers, the measurement of ‘complexes II–III’ activities was in fact ‘complex II–III–IV’ activities since complex IV is the final electron acceptor of the respiratory chain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Thus, by reporting around the same percent of reduction (−20 and −25 %) in the activities of complexes ‘II–III–IV’ and IV alone, these authors provided evidence for an alteration in complex IV activity in skeletal muscle-isolated mitochondria from cachectic animals in complete accordance with our data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>We confirmed the specific implication of complex IV in oxidative capacities reduction with a positive significant correlation between COX activity and uncoupled state oxygen consumption (Fig. 6). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Among the regulators of complex IV activity, cardiolipins, a specific phospholipid class of mitochondrial membranes, have been clearly identified [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the cardiolipin content in quadriceps mitochondria was not affected by cancer cachexia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>As oxidative stress was clearly associated to muscle wasting [3], we cannot exclude the occurrence of cardiolipin peroxidation that was reported to affect COX activity [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Direct oxidative damages of complex IV by lipid-derived protein adducts (4-HNE and MDA) cannot be ruled out since protein oxidative damages were reported in gastrocnemius muscle in AH-130 Yoshida hepatoma rat model [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>However, these authors found ATP synthase as the only oxidative phosphorylation-related protein affected by lipid peroxidation by-products. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Lastly, because COX activity is known to be regulated by ATP [36], we can hypothesise that reduction in COX is due to a higher allosteric ATP inhibition by modulation of COX phosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>A reduced mitochondrial oxidative capacity in muscle during cancer cachexia is somehow paradoxical since proteolysis by the ubiquitin–proteasome system is ATP dependent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>In this condition, additional ATP supply is produced by anaerobic glycolytic energy pathways with lactate production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Thus, skeletal muscle mitochondrial alterations could participate significantly to the increase in plasma lactate concentration supplying the futile Cori cycle that participate to the increase in whole body energy needs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we can speculate that reduction in skeletal muscle oxidative capacities could play a significant role in (1) lipid droplet accumulation [37] and (2) insulin resistance [38] that are occurring during cancer cachexia [1]. </plain></SENT>
