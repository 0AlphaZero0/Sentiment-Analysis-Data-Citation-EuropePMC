Two CVA16 virus fractions were separated and detected when the harvested CVA16 viral concentrate was purified by a sucrose gradient zonal ultracentrifugation. The viral particles detected in the 24&#8211;28% sucrose fractions had low viral infectivity and RNA content. The viral particles obtained from 35&#8211;38% sucrose fractions were found to have high viral infectivity and RNA content, and composed of four viral proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4), as shown by SDS-PAGE analyses. These two virus fractions were formalin-inactivated and only the infectious particle fraction was found to be capable of inducing CVA16-specific neutralizing antibody responses in both mouse and rabbit immunogenicity studies. But these antisera failed to neutralize enterovirus 71. In addition, rabbit antisera did not react with any peptides derived from CVA16 capsid proteins. Mouse antisera recognized a single linear immunodominant epitope of VP3 corresponding to residues 176&#8211;190.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results provide important information for cell-based CVA16 vaccine development.

These virus seeds were first adapted to replicate in Vero cells grown in T-flask cell culture containing Medium-199 plus 5% fetal bovine serum. Based on TCID<sub>50</sub> assay, the virus titer of these viruses can reach &gt;10<sup>6</sup> by the fifth day of post-infection. One clinical isolate (N5079) that grew consistently to 5&#215;10<sup>6</sup> virus titer in the T-flask was selected as the vaccine strain (data not shown). To be compliant with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines and screening for the fast growth and high yield CVA16 virus clone, N5079 clinical isolate was first adapted to grow in Vero cell culture containing serum-free (SF) medium VP-SFM and then plaque purified. High-growth virus clones (5079N/R_P2) were selected and prepared for CVA16 virus seed stocks for further evaluation, including genetic characterization and pilot production in bioreactor cell cultures.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Genetic characterization of 5079N/R_P2 CVA16</title><p>Nucleotide sequences of two selected clones from 5079N/R_P2 were analyzed and the gene sequences were found to be 100% match.

The genomic sequences of these two clones were found to be identical to those found in the original sequence data from Professor Jen-Ren Wang of the National Cheng Kung University (Taiwan). Therefore, these results indicate that the 5079N/R_P2 vaccine strain has strong genetic stability in passage.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Optimization of CVA16 viral yield</title><p>Some cell-based inactivated vaccines such as polio, influenza and hepatitis A are commercial available, but there is little information available on their manufacturing processes and culturing systems. Because of intellectual property rights and proprietary technologies used in these vaccine products, there is limited information on virus and product yield influenced by the composition of culture medium and bioreactor systems. For optimal growth of mammalian cells, serum-containing (SC) medium is necessary as a source of nutrients, hormones and growth factors. These serum factors facilitate the attachment and spreading of cells, and also provide protection against mechanical damage and shear forces. Besides these advantages, SC medium may contain unwanted contaminants that could cause safety concerns. To evaluate the efficiency of CVA16 production in Vero cell grown in either the SC medium or SF medium, four different multiplicities of infection (MOI): 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001 and 0.00001 were first tested and compared for virus growth profile in the microcarrier 1 liter bioreactor. The highest virus titer reached 1 to 5&#215;10<sup>6</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL by 6 DPI for all MOI tested in both media (data not shown). Since SC medium did not provide significant advantages over SF medium and to eliminate any potential serum protein contaminations, SF medium was selected as the growth medium for CVA16 vaccine production. To test whether temperature could influence virus growth and yield, CVA16 was grown at various temperatures from 32 to 37&#176;C. The virus growth profile at 32&#176;C was slower, but no significant difference in final virus yield was observed at 6 DPI (data no shown).

The current results indicate that this CVA16 vaccine strain produces a significant amount of defective (non-infectious) CVA16 particles similar to those found in the previous EV71 study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049973-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, lanes 1 &amp; 3) <xref rid="pone.0049973-Liu2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p><p>Surprisingly, formalin-inactivated P-particles formulated with alum elicited no titer or very low titer (1/16) of virus neutralizing antibody responses against CVA16 in BALB/c mice and rabbits (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0049973-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0049973-t002">2</xref>), respectively. In contrast, alum formulated formalin-inactivated CVA16 R-particles could induce neutralizing antibody responses in both rabbit and mice, but the neutralization titers were found to be low compared to those obtained with EV71 vaccine candidate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0049973-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0049973-t002">2</xref>). In addition, current results and previous EV71 studies (<xref rid="pone.0049973-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and our unpublished results) indicate that these virus neutralizing antibodies are virus-specific and have little or no cross-neutralization activity against other genotypes of human enterovirus. These results suggest that some of the neutralization epitopes in CVA16 are very sensitive to chemical modification and can be destroyed by formalin inactivation. Formalin inactivation is effective by cross-linking primary amino groups in viral proteins with aldehyde and other nearby nitrogen atoms. The inability of formalin-inactivated CVA16 P-particles to induce neutralizing antibody responses in mouse immunogenicity studies is very similar to that of the poliovirus C-antigen; and suggests that the conformations and interactions of viral proteins within the pentamers of P- and R-particles are likely to be different. This difference in particle structure and the interactions between the viral proteins were not easily observed by TEM. Differences in conformation were also observed in non-infectious empty particles and infectious viral particles of type 3 poliovirus using antigen-specific antibodies <xref rid="pone.0049973-Ferguson1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049973-Minor2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and EV71 crystal structures <xref rid="pone.0049973-Plevka1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0049973-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The CVA16 P-particle configuration that may be similar to the poliovirus C-antigen, is different from that of the D-antigen. This configuration could in turn influence the display of critical antigenic sites <xref rid="pone.0049973-Ferguson1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049973-Minor2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. The main antigenic sites and neutralization epitopes of poliovirus have been identified as conformational and are located in the VP1, VP2 and VP3 regions <xref rid="pone.0049973-Minor2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Current results from virus neutralization assay and linear epitope mapping suggest that CVA16 virus neutralization epitopes are also most likely conformational since rabbit anti-sera did not react with any linear CVA16 peptides and only one mouse linear epitope was identified within residues 176&#8211;190 of VP3. These findings are also very different from EV71 virus studies. Mouse immunodominant linear neutralization epitopes of EV71 are identified as residues 208&#8211;222 and 240&#8211;260 of the VP1 capsid protein <xref rid="pone.0049973-Foo1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049973-Guang1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049973-Liu3" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0049973-Chang3" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Mouse neutralizing antibodies induced by formalin-inactivated CVA16 R-particles recognized VP1 of CVA16 but not EV71 in Western blot analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049973-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Mouse anti-sera also failed to recognize these important epitopes of VP1 during epitope mapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049973-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). There could be two reasons for the failure of linear epitope mapping: (1) the surface exposed fragments and/or peptides of VP1 are not immunogenic, so no B-cell recognize them for antibody production; (2) antibodies generated against formalin-modified epitopes would not react with peptides with native amino acids. Also it is not surprising since there are five and eight amino acid differences in neutralization epitopes between EV71 and CVA16 within VP1 residues 205&#8211;220 and 240&#8211;255 respectively <xref rid="pone.0049973-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049973-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0049973-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. This observation is also supported by the fact that the epitope-specific (residue 205&#8211;220) monoclonal antibody N1 only recognizes VP1 of EV71 <xref rid="pone.0049973-Liu3" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and not CVA16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049973-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). All current results indicate that the configuration of formalin-inactivated CVA16 P-particles may be different enough to influence important antigenic and immunogenic sites for eliciting virus neutralizing antibody responses. In addition, EV71 formalin-inactivated P-particles could not elicit neutralizing antibody responses and would not be useful as CVA16 vaccine candidates in future.</p><p>In conclusion, the current findings and the full characterization of CVA16 viral particles provide valuable information for the development of cell-based formalin-inactivated CVA16 vaccine. Current mouse and rabbit immunological and serological data indicate that anti-sera raised against formalin-inactivated CVA16 vaccine candidates cannot cross-neutralize the EV71 virus, so a bi-valent EV71/CVA16 containing both viral particles should be considered for HFMD vaccine development. The proposed bi-valent EV71/CVA16 vaccine is also fully supported by the fact that EV71 immune responses can be recalled by exposure to CVA16 virus <xref rid="pone.0049973-Wu3" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0049973-Lin3" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Professor Suh-Chin Wu and staff in Taiwan CDC for their advice and technical supports.
