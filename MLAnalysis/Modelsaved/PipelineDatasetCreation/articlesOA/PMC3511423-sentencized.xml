</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Coxsackie virus A16 (CVA16), similar to polio virus, is a non-enveloped, single positive-stranded RNA virus of the family Picornaviridae with a genome size of approximately 7.4 kb. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>CVA16 consists of 60 copies of VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4 capsid proteins that form a pentameric icosahedral particle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Viral infections by CVA16 and enterovirus 71 (EV71) can cause hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) and herpangina in young children [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>As such, it has become a serious public health problem in the Asia-Pacific region [1]–[8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Although the host receptors for EV71 and CVA16 have been identified [9], [10], there is no effective antiviral agent to combat both EV71 and CVA16 infections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Since EV71 infections can lead to severe diseases such as poliomyelitis-like paralysis and fatal encephalitis in neonates [1]–[8], it has attracted greater vaccine research and development [1]–[2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Experimental vaccines that have been tested in animal models include a live-attenuated virus [8]–[13], formalin-inactivated virions [14], [15], baculovirus expressed virus-like particles [16], VP1 recombinant protein [17], [18], a VP1 DNA vaccine [19], a VP1 peptide-based vaccine [20], [21], bacterial or viral vectors expressing VP1 [17], [22], and a Vero cell-adapted live attenuated virus [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Among all these vaccine candidates, formalin-inactivated EV71 (FI-EV71) has been found to be the most potent and is currently being tested in human clinical trials [17], [18], [23], [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Mao et al. [25] and our unpublished results have shown that animal anti-FI-EV71 sera had low or no cross-neutralization effect against CVA16. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a bi-valent vaccine containing antigens from both viruses should be developed to prevent HFMD. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>In Asia, human EV71 and CVA16 are most commonly identified as the viruses associated with HFMD outbreaks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Young children (under 5 years) infected with CVA16 develop fever and painful blisters in the mouth and on the hands and feet, but recover quickly within a week and without long-term problems in most cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>However, EV71 epidemics in Taiwan in 1998, 2001, 2005 and 2008 caused children to develop more severe symptoms such as neurological disease and death. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>For these reasons, we initiated Vero cell-based EV71 vaccine development in 2007 and have successfully produced a formalin-inactivated whole virion EV71 vaccine candidate currently being evaluated in human phase 1 clinical trials [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>The preliminary results from current trials indicate that human sera generated from formalin-inactivated EV71 virions have low and no cross-neutralizing antibodies against CVA16. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>In addition, Mao et al. [25] and our unpublished results showed that animal anti-sera (mouse, rabbit and macaque) generated from formalin-inactivated EV71 had low or no cross-neutralization against CVA16. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is of interest to investigate whether CVA16 vaccine candidates could elicit cross-neutralizing antibody responses against EV71. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used a similar approach to develop a Vero cell-based formalin-inactivated whole virion CVA16 vaccine candidate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>From 3 clinical CVA16 isolates we have identified and selected a potential vaccine strain (N5079) which has consistently shown faster growth and higher virus titer in serum-free medium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Fast-growth CVA16 clone (5079N/R-P2) has been tested for genetic stability in passage studies and has been found to be highly stable as shown by nucleotide sequence analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Although this vaccine strain can consistently provide virus titer &gt;106 TCID50 per mL, the bioprocess needs to be optimized since the current virus titer is lower than those found in the previous EV71 studies [23], [27]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Using 5 L bioreactor and microcarrier cell culture systems as the up-stream process and sucrose gradient zonal ultracentrifugation as the downstream purification, two types of particles were separated and purified: defective particles (P-particles) and infectious particles (R-particles). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>The biophysical and biochemical observations are very similar to EV71 and those of poliovirus studies [27], [31]–[36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Two types of poliovirus structures (D- and C-antigens) were observed and characterized by electron microscopy and biochemical assays [32]–[34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>The crystal structures of EV71 particles were also recently solved [35]–[36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Using RT-PCR analysis, the R-particle in this study similar to the D-antigen has a high viral RNA content and a full particle structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the P-particles found in both EV71 and CVA16 studies are similar to the C-antigen which has an empty particle structure and lacks of RNA content [32]–[36]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>When we compared the total protein yield of these CVA16 viral particles from 5 batches of bioreactor runs, the ratio of P-particles to R-particles was consistently 1∶2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>This ratio is different from those found in EV71 studies [23], [27] wherein the ratio was 7∶3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Currently we are investigating the factors that could influence this ratio and the final infectious virus yield. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>Biophysical and biochemical analyses were performed to further characterize these particles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Through EM imaging, the two formalin-inactivated CVA16 particles were found to have very similarly-sized icosahedral structures (Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>EM imaging also revealed some CVA16 particles containing irregular icosahedral structure (30–32 nm in diameter) that could be due to formalin inactivation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>In contrast, EV71 particles were found to have different sizes ranging from 31–33 nm and 33–35 nm for P-particles and R-particles respectively [27], [35]–[36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>This size difference is due to differences in the composition of viral protein components and viral RNA contents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Generally, Picornaviridae virus morphogenesis begins with freshly-translated P1 polypeptide forming the pre-virion that requires specific cleavage of the P1 polypeptide into VP0, VP1 and VP3 proteins by the viral non-structural protein, 3CD protease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>The final virion is assembled when VP0 protein is then cleaved into VP2 and VP4 by autocatalytic action that involves viral RNA [31], [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Based on biochemical (SDS-PAGE and Western blot) analyses, CVA16 P-particles were found to be immature particles in which the P1 polypeptide and VP0 protein (VP2+VP4) was incompletely processed (Fig. 4, lane 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Quantitative RT-PCR studies of the VP1 gene content also suggest that little amounts of CVA16 viral RNA were packaged into these immature and defective P-particles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>The current results indicate that this CVA16 vaccine strain produces a significant amount of defective (non-infectious) CVA16 particles similar to those found in the previous EV71 study (Fig. 4, lanes 1 &amp; 3) [27]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, formalin-inactivated P-particles formulated with alum elicited no titer or very low titer (1/16) of virus neutralizing antibody responses against CVA16 in BALB/c mice and rabbits (Tables 1 and 2), respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>In contrast, alum formulated formalin-inactivated CVA16 R-particles could induce neutralizing antibody responses in both rabbit and mice, but the neutralization titers were found to be low compared to those obtained with EV71 vaccine candidate (Tables 1 and 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>In addition, current results and previous EV71 studies ([24] and our unpublished results) indicate that these virus neutralizing antibodies are virus-specific and have little or no cross-neutralization activity against other genotypes of human enterovirus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that some of the neutralization epitopes in CVA16 are very sensitive to chemical modification and can be destroyed by formalin inactivation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Formalin inactivation is effective by cross-linking primary amino groups in viral proteins with aldehyde and other nearby nitrogen atoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>The inability of formalin-inactivated CVA16 P-particles to induce neutralizing antibody responses in mouse immunogenicity studies is very similar to that of the poliovirus C-antigen; and suggests that the conformations and interactions of viral proteins within the pentamers of P- and R-particles are likely to be different. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>This difference in particle structure and the interactions between the viral proteins were not easily observed by TEM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Differences in conformation were also observed in non-infectious empty particles and infectious viral particles of type 3 poliovirus using antigen-specific antibodies [32], [38] and EV71 crystal structures [35]–[36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>The CVA16 P-particle configuration that may be similar to the poliovirus C-antigen, is different from that of the D-antigen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>This configuration could in turn influence the display of critical antigenic sites [32], [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>The main antigenic sites and neutralization epitopes of poliovirus have been identified as conformational and are located in the VP1, VP2 and VP3 regions [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Current results from virus neutralization assay and linear epitope mapping suggest that CVA16 virus neutralization epitopes are also most likely conformational since rabbit anti-sera did not react with any linear CVA16 peptides and only one mouse linear epitope was identified within residues 176–190 of VP3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>These findings are also very different from EV71 virus studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Mouse immunodominant linear neutralization epitopes of EV71 are identified as residues 208–222 and 240–260 of the VP1 capsid protein [20], [21], [39]–[41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Mouse neutralizing antibodies induced by formalin-inactivated CVA16 R-particles recognized VP1 of CVA16 but not EV71 in Western blot analyses (Fig. 5B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Mouse anti-sera also failed to recognize these important epitopes of VP1 during epitope mapping (Fig. 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>There could be two reasons for the failure of linear epitope mapping: (1) the surface exposed fragments and/or peptides of VP1 are not immunogenic, so no B-cell recognize them for antibody production; (2) antibodies generated against formalin-modified epitopes would not react with peptides with native amino acids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>Also it is not surprising since there are five and eight amino acid differences in neutralization epitopes between EV71 and CVA16 within VP1 residues 205–220 and 240–255 respectively [4], [42]–[43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>This observation is also supported by the fact that the epitope-specific (residue 205–220) monoclonal antibody N1 only recognizes VP1 of EV71 [39] and not CVA16 (Fig. 6C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>All current results indicate that the configuration of formalin-inactivated CVA16 P-particles may be different enough to influence important antigenic and immunogenic sites for eliciting virus neutralizing antibody responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>In addition, EV71 formalin-inactivated P-particles could not elicit neutralizing antibody responses and would not be useful as CVA16 vaccine candidates in future. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the current findings and the full characterization of CVA16 viral particles provide valuable information for the development of cell-based formalin-inactivated CVA16 vaccine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Current mouse and rabbit immunological and serological data indicate that anti-sera raised against formalin-inactivated CVA16 vaccine candidates cannot cross-neutralize the EV71 virus, so a bi-valent EV71/CVA16 containing both viral particles should be considered for HFMD vaccine development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>The proposed bi-valent EV71/CVA16 vaccine is also fully supported by the fact that EV71 immune responses can be recalled by exposure to CVA16 virus [44]–[45]. </plain></SENT>
