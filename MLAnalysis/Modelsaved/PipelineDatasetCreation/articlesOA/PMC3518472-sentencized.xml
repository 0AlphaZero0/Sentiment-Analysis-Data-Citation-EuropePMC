<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>ATP8B1 deficient patients suffer from intrahepatic cholestasis, often accompanied with extrahepatic symptoms including diarrhoea, pancreatitis and hearing problems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Milder phenotype presents with recurrent attacks of cholestasis typically without permanent liver damage [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Serum γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (γ-GT) activity and cholesterol concentrations are normal. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The ATP8B1/FIC1 (Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis 1) protein, a member of the P4-type ATPases subfamily, is widely expressed in epithelial tissues [4], [5], [6] and is considered a phosphatidylserine flippase, translocating phosphatidylserine from the outer to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane [6], [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The ATP8B1 disease mechanism is, however, poorly understood. In vivo experiments using “Byler“ Atp8b1G308V/G308V mice or ATP8B1 deficient hepatocytes demonstrated defective membrane order due to the impaired flippase activity of ATP8B1 [8], [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>A more recent study [10] challenged the proposed mechanism and on ATP8B1-depleted Caco-2 cells demonstrated an unimpaired flippase activity, with profound disorganization of apical actin cytoskeleton and loss in microvilli. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Since ATP8B1 deficiency is primarily characterised by cholestasis, some studies attempted to attribute the phenotype to a defective farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signalling pathway [11], [12], [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Others [14] suggested that impaired FXR activity is secondary to cholestasis and, as such, is not responsible for the PFIC1/BRIC1 phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Unperturbed activity of FXR and its target genes was observed in ATP8B1-depleted Caco-2 cells using small hairpin RNA and small interfering RNA respectively [9], [10], which suggests an unimpaired FXR signalling pathway in PFIC1/BRIC1 patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In a large study by Klomp et al. [15] ATP8B1 mutations were detected in fewer than 50% of the families screened, irrespective of severity of their disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>It may be partly because only the coding region of the gene was analyzed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Even though the ATP8B1 gene is important biologically and clinically, our knowledge of its regulatory regions remains limited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to characterise the transcriptional control of the ATP8B1 gene by identifying its promoter and 5′untranslated (5′UTR) regions, and to search for putative regulatory sites in any newly discovered parts of the gene. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Even though our study does not support such tissue specific regulation of ATP8B1 at the transcriptional level in the tested samples, further research could characterise the role of all three promoters in different organs under varying conditions and address the involvement of post-transcriptional control mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>In a view of the complex structure of the ATP8B1 gene and its highly variable mRNA levels across cell types, RNA stability and post-transcriptional control appears to be more important in ATP8B1 regulation than previously expected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate significant differences between the activity observed for the promoter upstream of Ex −1 (P1) versus the promoter upstream of Ex −3 (P3). </plain></SENT>

Drawings of the minimum free energy (MFE) structures for each splicing variant of ATP8B1 5′UTR suggest their possible different role in regulation of gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>One of the regulatory mechanism, formation of stable secondary structures, was shown to impede the progress of the scanning ribosome [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Such scanning is influenced by the size and the position of the secondary structure(s) towards the 5′cap of the mRNA species: that is, an alternative transcript with a shorter version of the 5′UTR is frequently translated more efficiently than the one with a longer 5′ region [3], [4], [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Likewise, a stem-loop structure located a considerable distance from the 5′cap will require a higher free energy compared to one situated closer to it to affect the access of a pre-initiation complex to the mRNA. [2], [6]. </plain></SENT>
