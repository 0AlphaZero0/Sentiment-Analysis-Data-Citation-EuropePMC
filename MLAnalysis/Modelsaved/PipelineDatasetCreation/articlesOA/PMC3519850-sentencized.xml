</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7 (EHEC O157) is an important cause of food- and water-borne illnesses in developed nations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Diseases associated with EHEC O157 infections include hemorrhagic colitis (HC) and the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>HUS following EHEC O157 infection is associated with 3% to 5% mortality [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Cattle are a major reservoir of EHEC O157 and consumption of contaminated bovine-origin foods is frequently linked to EHEC O157 outbreaks [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Shiga toxin (Stx) expression is an important virulence factor of EHEC O157. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Stx are encoded in late genes of lambdoid bacteriophages; specific bacteriophages, associated with specific Stx variants, are typically inserted at one or two preferred chromosomal locations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Bacteriophages play a major role in generating genetic diversity in the EHEC O157 genome [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Molecular epidemiological studies using Stx-associated bacteriophage insertion (SBI) sites for strain differentiation have shown that EHEC O157 can be classified into several genotypes [5], [10], [14]. Bovine-biased genotypes (BBG) are significantly over-represented among cattle isolates compared to clinical isolates, whereas clinical genotypes (CG) are typical of clinical isolates and are also frequently isolated from cattle [15], [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Other genotyping methods also demonstrate a similar bias in distribution of EHEC O157 lineages/clades among cattle and human host [6], [8], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Both BBG and CG usually carry both EHEC O157 cardinal virulence factors: production of one or more Stx and expression of the Locus of Enterocyte Effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island required for intestinal colonization [1], [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The pronounced differences in their frequency of isolation from human disease and from cattle suggest that BBG may have reduced virulence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>This possibility was supported by the recent demonstration that CG strains cause more severe clinical signs, more severe histopathologic lesions, and higher mortality than BBG strains in two animal models of human disease [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that specific bacteriophage-associated genetic factors underlie the differential virulence of CG and BBG EHEC O157. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we: 1) identified consistent bacteriophage-mediated genetic differences associated with four BBG and three CG strains using optical mapping; 2) developed a 12-plex PCR to efficiently SBI genotype EHEC O157 isolates and formatted a biologically relevant SBI genotype nomenclature; and 3) applied SBI typing to evaluate the consistency of the genetic differences discovered in the optically mapped strains in approximately 200 additional isolates each from cattle and human clinical sources. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The presence of specific stx2 variants and/or their associated bacteriophages were strongly associated with specific SBI genotypes and with their relative frequency of isolation from human illness and cattle reservoir. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>This technology was used previously by Kotewicz et al. to identify differences in EHEC O157 strains representing SNP clusters and spinach outbreak strains [22], [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>While Kotewicz et al. provided valuable information on genetic diversity among EHEC O157 strains of clinical origin; their clinical isolate strain set lacked defined BBG isolates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Our study was specifically designed to identify bacteriophage-related differences between the predominant CG (CG-1 and CG-3, now AY2 and WY12) and BBG (BBG-5 and BBG-6, now SY2c and ASY12c) groups that previously had been associated with differential virulence potential [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>SBI has proven to be a useful genotyping technique to identify strains of EHEC O157 differing in distribution [5], [10], [14], gene expression [16] and virulence [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Although based on the content and insertional locations of bacteriophages (i.e., mobile genetic elements), SBI genotypes are empirically stable characteristics of EHEC O157 strains, as recently confirmed by Bono et al. [33] in their demonstration of close correlation between SBI genotypes and chromosomal backbone SNP-defined lineages of EHEC O157. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Specifically, CG-1 (referred in current paper as AY2/ASY2/ASY22c) and CG-3 (WY12) correspond to SNP lineage II and I, respectively, and BBG-5 (SY2c) and BBG-6 (SY12c/ASY12c) corresponds to lineages III, IV, V and VII [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the SBI multiplex PCR described here provides a means for presumptive identification of EHEC O157 lineages as defined by SNP typing. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>SBI genotype designations were modified to incorporate data from additional targets and to provide a biologically-based nomenclature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>The additional targets include independent detection of stx2a and stx2c variants and two additional chromosomal - bacteriophage insertion sites, argW and sbcB. Even before addition of these targets well over 20 different SBI genotypes had been reported, and this cumbersome number as well as the arbitrary nature of the ordinal genotype designations threatened the usability of the system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Therefore, here we propose identification of SBI genotypes by the concatenation of letters representing specific chromosomal insertion sites followed by numbers indicating the stx variants detected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Isolates classified by this revised SBI designation system are more strongly associated with specific hosts, suggesting that the system is consistent with the biological behavior of the bacterium. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>The findings of this study clarify the bacteriophage related genetic differences characterizing BBG and CG, and confirm the strong association of stx2 subtypes in these two genogroups. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Some CG strains additionally have Stx2c-associated bacteriophage sequences adjacent to sbcB, with or without stx2c carriage, and about half of BBG isolates additionally have Stx2a-associated bacteriophage sequences adjacent to argW but lack stx2a. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>The close association of stx2a with the more clinically relevant CG strains is the most striking finding of our study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>We recently demonstrated that CG strains (carrying stx2a with or without stx2c) induced more severe clinical symptoms, earlier and higher mortality, and more severe histopathological lesions compared to BBG strains (carrying stx2c only) in two animal models [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>That study also demonstrated that CG strains produced higher amounts of ELISA-reactive Stx than BBG strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>A recent microarray study [16] demonstrated differential expression profiles of BBG and CG strains suggesting that the increased prevalence of EHEC O157 illness caused by certain strains is associated with over-expression of several virulence factors including ehx, genes on the LEE pathogenicity island, and pO157 genes, although no difference in stx expression was identified. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Other comparative genomic studies on EHEC O157 have demonstrated similar variation in the frequency of stx variants among cattle and human isolates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Using octamer-based genome scanning and LSPA-6 genotyping [12], [13], [34], EHEC O157 isolates were differentiated into three lineages: I, I/II, and II. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Ziebell et al. [37] and Zhang et al. [34] demonstrated that nearly all lineage II strains carried stx2c, nearly all of the lineage I strains carried stx2a and 50.0% of lineage I/II strains carried stx2c. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Similarly a recent study on Japanese isolates also suggests stx2a is the most distinctive feature in clinical isolates compared to cattle isolates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>The human isolates, predominantly LSPA-6 lineage I or I/II, typically carried stx2a alone or in combination with stx1 or stx2c while LSPA-6 lineage II cattle isolates carried stx2c alone or in combination with stx1 [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>These investigators also demonstrated that lineage I (stx1-stx2) isolates showed multiple stress resistances when compared to the lineage II (stx1-stx2c) genotypes [39]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Several of these epidemiological studies [41], [42], [43], [45], [46], [47], [48] demonstrated that EHEC O157 carrying stx2a (with or without stx2c) rather than stx2c were more frequent among clinical isolates, in agreement with the results presented here. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Recently, Kawano et al. [48] along with others [43], [45], [46] suggested that EHEC O157 carrying stx2c were associated with asymptomatic individuals and mild disease however it is also isolated from patients with severe disease (bloody diarrhea, HC and HUS) as shown by others [23], [40], [41], [44], [47], [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Fuller et al. recently demonstrated that purified Stx2a is more potent than Stx2c against primary human kidney cell lines and in mouse models [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>It is possible that carriage and expression of stx2a alone is sufficient to confer increased virulence in animal models and increased expression of human disease, but alternatively these phenotypes may result in whole or in part on other genetic factors that are correlated with stx2a. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Knock-out and complementation studies to evaluate the role of stx2a in otherwise isogenic strains may be required to clarify this question. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, optical scanning proved effective at identifying large genetic indels associated with insertion or deletion of Stx-associated bacteriophages among major SBI genotypes of EHEC O157. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>The multiplex PCR described in this study provides a simple and rapid method to efficiently determine SBI genotypes of EHEC O157 isolates, now known to correlate with lineages within the EHEC O157 clade. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>We conclude that differential virulence of EHEC O157 genotypes may be due to variation in the presence of stx2 variants and/or bacteriophages associated these variants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Unraveling the roles of these genetic elements in EHEC O157 virulence will improve our understanding of pathogenesis and may facilitate development of strategies for the prevention and control of this important food-borne pathogen. </plain></SENT>
