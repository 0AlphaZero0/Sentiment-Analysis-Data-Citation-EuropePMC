</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Characterization of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genomes in cnidarians has become an increasing interest in evolutionary and phylogenetic studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The phylum Cnidaria is divided into two large clades, Medusozoa and Anthozoa, the former of which contains four classes, including Hydrozoa, Cubozoa, Scyphozoa, and Staurozoa [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Species in the Medusozoa have a medusoid body form in their life cycle, as different from those in the Anthozoa, and a linear mtDNA molecule in contrast to a single circular molecule of 14 to 20 kilobases in metazoans [2], [3], [4], [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>However, most available data on cnidarian mtDNA sequences are derived from species in the Anthozoa, with the availability of more than 40 complete mtDNA sequences in public databases, which shows a degree of similarity to metazoan mtDNA genomes in being a circular structure [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, it seems likely that there is an increasing amount of data on mtDNA genomes in medusozoans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>So far, 26 linear mtDNA genomes, although not all fully complete, have been reported from species of all four classes in the Medusozoa [7], for example, Hydra oligactis [8], H. vulgaris, and H. magnipapillata [9] in Hydrozoa, Alatina moseri [10] in Cubozoa, Lucernaria janetae [7] in Staurozoa, and Aurelia aurita in Scyphozoa [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the linear mtDNA can be divided into two to eight molecules [7], [9], [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Kayal et al. (2012) firstly examined linear mtDNA in Medusozoa and reconstructed the evolutionary history of linear mtDNA in medusozoans by analyzing the mitochondrial genome structures [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The dramatic feature of two open reading frames (ORFs), polB and ORF314, was identified in mtDNA sequences of cubozoan, scyphozoan, staurozoan, and trachyline hydrozoan, which was thought to be remnants of a linear plasmid that invaded the mitochondrial genomes of the last common ancestor of Medusozoa and should be responsible for the linearity [7], [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>However, hydroidolinan hydrozoans have lost the two ORFs and they instead have duplicated cox1 at each end of their mitochondrial chromosome(s) [7], [8], [9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>However, very few nucleotide sequences can be found from Craspedacusta in public databases, such as in GenBank. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The nucleotide sequences referred to Craspedacusta mtDNA comprise only several cox1 and rnl sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Recently, a nearly complete mitochondrial genome sequence of Cubaia aphrodite (Hydrozoa, Trachylina, Limnomedusae) was reported [7]. C. aphrodite, living in marine water, belongs to the same order, Limnomedusae, as freshwater jellyfish Craspedacusta sowerbyi. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Though with sequence of the identical inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) and partial polB being undetermined, its mitogenome was thought to possesses characteristically the mitochondrial ancestral medusozoan gene order (AMGO), as reported in scyphozoans and staurozoans [7], [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>But, the mitochondrial genome organizations in non-trachyline hydrozoans contain one or several linear molecules, thus exhibiting a degree of variation, with probably the presence of other three gene orders [7], [8], [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Mitochondrial genome organizations in the Hydrozoa may be thus much more variable than in other medusozoans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The understanding of their mtDNA genomes may provide necessary information to reveal the diversity of mtDNA genome organization and their evolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>More mitogenomes from trachyline hydrozoans are certainly needed to test whether AMGO is typical of this group or whether other gene orders exist. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Freshwater jellyfish are frequently reported, with more than 20 species of freshwater jellyfish in the world [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Among them, Craspedacusta sowerbyi (Hydrozoa, Trachylina, Limnomedusae) is the most widely distributed species [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>It is considered that this species is originated from the Yangtze River area in China [13], [14], but has been dispersed to many freshwater habitats in the world [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The hydrozoan has two adult forms, the fixed polyp, and the free-living medusa, with the latter being the sexual form, occurring sporadically in different season of the year, although more commonly during summer in temperate regions [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>It was thus considered possible to obtain samples of C. sowerbyi in China in order to examine its mtDNA genome [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>In this report, we presented the complete sequence of the mitochondrial genome of C. sowerbyi, which represents the first complete mitochondrial genome for species in the Trachylina. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we used this sequence together with other reported sequences of medusozoan mtDNA to analyze the phylogenetic relationship within the Cnidaria, and especially within the Medusozoa. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Thus far, only two mitochondrial genomes were determined in the order of Limnomedusae, with one from the marine species C. aphrodite and another from the freshwater jellyfish C. sowerbyi. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>The mtDNA sequences of these two species show high similarity with each other, especially in the presence of same gene order and the closest relationship in the phylogenetic tree. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>The AMGO and the two ORFs similar to polB and ORF314 were found in mitogenomes of limnomedusans, as reported in staurozoans and discomedusan scyphozoans [7], [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>However, the mitochondrial genomes of hydroidolinans have at least three gene orders similar to AMGO and lack the two ORFs [7], [8], [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Like other hydrozoans, Limnomedusae has a biphysic life history. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>It consists of a planula stage developing into a benthic polyp and a medusa stage developing via the entocodon. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>It appears to be easily characterized by two symplesiomorphies, i.e., ecto-endodermal statocysts and a life cycle that includes a polyp stage, shared with other members of Trachylina and Hydroidolina, respectively [2], [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Limnomedusae was once classified into a group named Hydroidomedusa (including Anthomedusae, Laingiomedusae, Leptomedusae, Limnomedusae, and Siphonophorae), which was characterized with a polyp stage budding medusae through a medusary nodule [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>In the cladistic analysis based on 87 morphological and life history characters of medusozoans by Marques and Collins [1], Limnomedusae was identified as either the earliest diverging hydrozoan lineage or as the basal group of either Trachylina or Hydroidolina. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>However, it was eventually placed at the base of the subclass Trachylina rather than among the hydroidolinan groups according to the molecular data of mitochondrial 16 S and nuclear small and large subunit ribosomal genes [2], [5], [27], [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Our ML analyses based on the 13 energy pathway protein genes from mtDNA placed the limnomedusans at the base of Hydrozoa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Considering limnomedusans possess the gene order of AMGO and the shared ancestral characters of Trachylina and Hydroidolina, together with phylogenetic analyses in previous studies, we suggest that Limnomedusae be the earliest diverging lineage among Hydrozoa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>However, this suggestion needs to be further examined by analyzing more mitogenomes from other hydrozoans, especially from other trachyline hydrozoans (Narcomedusae, Trachymedusae and Actinulida). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>As indicated in previous studies also employing mitogenomic data, the paraphyly of Anthozoa is further confirmed in the present analyses with octocorallians being closer to the medusozoans than to the hexacorallians [6], [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>The evolutionary positions of the four medusozoan classes showing in our ML trees, were largely consistent with the speculation based on mitogenome organizations [7] and the phylogenetic analyses based on nuclear and mitochondrial ribosomal data [2], [5] in general. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>The monophyletic clade of hydrozoans was clustered as a sister group to the monophyletic discomedusan Scyphozoa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Hydrozoa appears to be composed of two well supported groups, Hydroidolina and Trachylina (Limnomedusae). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>In the group of Hydroidolina, our ML analyses provided strong support for a clade of capitates to the exclusion of aplanulate taxa, which supported the previous studies that divided the Capitata into clades of Aplanulata and non-Aplanulata Capitata [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>As the newly recognized class in Medusozoa, Staurozoa was removed from Scyphozoa by Marques and Collins [1] for its discrete history and features correspondingly distinct from other cnidarian classes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>In the present study we recognize that Staurozoa should be the sister group of all other medusozoans as shown in the ML tree based on amino acids with 100 bootstrap percentage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Previous studies that employed other molecular data [2], [5], [7] and morphological evidence [31] also generated similar hypothesis. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>However, the position of Cubozoa within Medusozoa has been rather contentious, with some favoring a hydrozoan affinity [33], [34] and others a closer relationship to scyphozoans [1], [35], [36], [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Molecular analyses based on large and small ribosomal genes placed Cubozoa and Scyphozoa at a clade that was the sister group of Hydrozoa [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>When referred to the mitogenome, the only cubozoan representative with eight linear mitochondrial chromosomes fell into a clade with the only representative of coronate scyphozoans in the phylogenetic analysis based on amino acids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Our analyses had Cubozoa and coronate Scyphozoa forming a clade that was the sister group of the rest scyphozoans and hydrozoans, and it seems that Coronatae is not as close to the rest scyphozoans as we supposed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>However, the very limited species from these interesting groups make the hypothesis not compelling enough and further studies including more species need to be carried out. </plain></SENT>
