</text></title><p id="P2"><text><SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The activity of RNA polymeraes II (Pol II) is regulated by the phosphorylation state of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of its largest subunit 1–5, which contains the consensus heptapeptide repeat Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7 (YSPTSPS). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While all the hydroxyl groups in this repeat can become phosphorylated, phosphorylation of Ser2 and Ser5has received the most attention to date. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For example, phosphorylated Ser5 (pSer5) is found at the promoter and during the initiation and early stages of Pol II transcription, and it mediates the recruitment of the 5′-end capping machinery and other factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>pSer5 is then dephosphorylated, and Ser2 becomes phosphorylated during the elongation and termination stages of transcription, which also facilitates 3′-end processing of the pre-mRNA transcript. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P3"><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In keeping with the importance of Ser2 and Ser5 phosphorylation, the kinases and phosphatases involved have been well studied 5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The phosphatase Fcp1 is present along the length of transcribed genes, and can dephosphorylate both pSer2 and pSer5, but prefers pSer2 6,7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ssu72 is a known CTD pSer5 phosphatase 8,9, although it is localized primarily near the 3′-end of genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Ssu72 prefers the cis configuration of the pSer5-Pro6 peptide bond 10,11, and it helps to couple transcription and polyadenylation 10. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Scp1 is another pSer5 phosphatase in metazoans, and it may function near the 5′-end of certain genes 12–14. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P4"><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It was recently reported that the yeast protein Rtr1 (regulator of transcription 15) has Pol II CTD pSer5 phosphatase activity and is required for pSer5 dephosphorylation in the early stage of transcription 16. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The human homolog of Rtr1, RPAP2 (RNA Pol II associated protein 2 17), has also been reported to have CTD pSer5 phosphatase activity18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These proteins are poorly conserved overall (Fig. 1), but they share a motif with three strictly conserved Cys residues and another residue conserved as His (in most fungi) or Cys (in animals and S. pombe, Fig. 1), suggestive of a zinc finger motif 15. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>However, the spacing among these residues (C-X4-C-Xn-C-X3-H/C, where n ranges from 30 to 50) as well as the sequences of Rtr1 homologs are distinct from known zinc finger proteins. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P5"><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In this study we report the crystal structure of Rtr1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>It reveals a new type of zinc finger protein, in fact distinct from other known protein structures in general. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, the structure lacks an apparent active site, and the zinc ion probably plays a structural role, likely stabilizing the overall structure of the protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Moreover, extensive efforts to demonstrate CTD phosphatase activity for Rtr1 from several different fungal species as well as for human RPAP2 were unsuccessful, in contrast to the earlier reports but consistent with the structural observations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Therefore, Rtr1/RPAP2 itself is unlikely a phosphatase, but perhaps plays a non-catalytic role in CTD dephosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The identity of the pSer5 phosphatase in the early stage of Pol II transcription remains to be determined. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The bacterial growth media was supplemented with zinc during protein expression, and the purified protein had nearly stoichiometric amounts of zinc 19. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence scans were carried out on the crystal at the absorption edges of Zn, Ni, Co, and Fe, and anomalous signals were observed only at the Zn edge, which were used to solve the structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The full-length protein (residues 1-211) was used for crystallization, but only residues 1-152 were observed in the structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>SDS gels of the crystals showed that the C-terminal segment of KlRtr1 was removed by proteolysis during crystallization (Supplementary Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The sequence conservation for these C-terminal residues is much weaker among Rtr1 and RPAP2 homologs (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P7"><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The structure of KlRtr1 (residues 1-152) contains five anti-parallel α-helices (αAαE, Fig. 2a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>A long loop (residues 70-112) connects helices αD and αE, and the three strictly conserved Cys residues (73, 78 and 111) are located in this loop. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Residues 88-100 at the tip of this loop are disordered in the current structure (Fig. 2a), and this loop may have also been proteolyzed in some of the Rtr1 molecules in the crystal (Supplementary Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The fourth ligand to the zinc ion, His115 or Cys, is in the first turn of helix αE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>This helix is followed by another long loop (residues 126-152) that wraps around one side of the structure (Fig. 2a). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P8"><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>We also obtained crystals of Ashbya gossypii Rtr1 (AgRtr1), although the best diffraction data set extended only to 3.5 Å resolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>By combining the structural information from KlRtr1 and primary phase information from Zn anomalous signals, we were able to observe another helix in the C-terminal region of AgRtr1, likely equivalent to residues 154-166 of KlRtr1 (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>This helix is projected away from the rest of the protein and is stabilized by crystal packing interactions in the AgRtr1 crystal (Supplementary Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>S3), suggesting that the C-terminal region of Rtr1 may function independently of the N-terminal region. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>2a, 2b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The zinc binding site is located near the surface, but there are no prominent features in this region of the protein (see below). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The main-chain carbonyl oxygen atoms of the first two ligands, Cys73 and Cys78, are hydrogen-bonded to the guanidinium group of Arg67, one of the few other conserved residues among these proteins (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The hydrogen-bonds stabilize the two Cys residues as well as the loop connecting them, which is hydrophobic in nature and contributes to the formation of the hydrophobic core of Rtr1 (Fig. 2a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>The zinc ion therefore appears to play a structural role, likely stabilizing the overall conformation of Rtr1. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P10"><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>We have identified Rtr1 as a new type of zinc finger protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>A search through the Protein Data Bank with DaliLite 20 did not identify any close structural homologs, with the highest Z score being 3.3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The overall fold of Rtr1 is somewhat reminiscent of the HEAT repeats, although the positions of the helices are different compared to these repeats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The topology of the zinc ligands in Rtr1, with the first three located in loops and the last one in the beginning of a helix, has some similarity to the A20 family of zinc finger proteins 21, as illustrated by the structure of Rabex-5, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab5 that also binds monoubiquitin 22,23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>The overall conformations of the protein backbone near the first two zinc ligands are similar between Rtr1 and Rabex-5 (Fig. 2c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the loop connecting them, and especially the loop connecting to the third ligand, has different numbers of residues (the zinc ligands in Rabex-5 have the motif C-X3-C-X11-C-X2-C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>In addition, the orientation of the helix containing the fourth ligand differs by nearly 90° between the two structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Finally, the zinc binding site in Rtr1 is part of a much larger structure, with 150 residues (Fig. 2a), whereas the zinc finger domain of Rabex-5 contains only 35 residues. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>To test the possibility that Rtr1 in the absence of zinc or in complex with a different metal ion could be catalytically active, we used protein samples purified from E. coli cells that were grown without additional zinc in the medium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>The zinc occupancy ranged between 10 and 80%, but other metal ions could be present in these samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>We also expressed and purified residues 1-332 of human RPAP2, as a His-tagged and GST-fusion proteins, and full-length RPAP2 as a GST-fusion protein 18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Despite extensive efforts and using a large collection of different substrates (Supplementary Table S1), we failed to detect CTD pSer5 phosphatase activity for Rtr1 and RPAP2 under any of the conditions tested, while robust activity was observed with Ssu72. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The substrates used include a CTD peptide Ser7″-Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7-Tyr1′-Ser2′ phosphorylated at the Ser5, Ser5 and Ser7, or Ser2, Ser5 and Ser7 positions, as it has been shown that RPAP2 requires Ser7 phosphorylation to interact with the CTD 18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>These assays monitored the release of free phosphate from the reactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>We also used as the substrate the entire CTD purified as a GST-fusion protein 10 and either phosphorylated with HeLa cell nuclear extract or purified Cdk7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>The reactions were monitored bywestern blotting with an antibody specific for pSer5. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P12"><text><SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>The lack of phosphatase activity for Rtr1 is consistent with our structure, which does not indicate the presence of an active site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>An analysis of the surface features that are conserved among Rtr1 and RPAP2 homologs does not reveal any pockets that are lined with conserved residues and could function as an active site (Fig. 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>The C-terminal segment that is missing in the current structure is unlikely to form an active site, due to its poor conservation (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>The zinc binding site cannot be an active site either, as the zinc ion is tetrahedrally coordinated by the four ligands and is not capable of binding and activating a water molecule for hydrolytic activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the zinc binding site corresponds to a small protrusion on the surface of Rtr1 (Fig. 4), and there is no pocket nearby that could bind the CTD substrate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Mutation of one of the Zn ligands in ScRtr1 (Cys73) was reported to abolish the dephosphorylation of pSer5 in yeast cells 16. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>It is more likely that this mutation disrupted zinc binding and thereby the overall structure of the protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>We do not know why phosphatase activity was observed in vitro in the earlier reports 16,18. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Rtr1 is found primarily in the cytoplasm, but can shuttle into the nucleus 15. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Recent reports suggest that Rtr1 and RPAP2 may have an important role in the assembly and transport of Pol II from the cytoplasm into the nucleus 24–26. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>These and other 15–18 data establish that Rtr1 interacts with Pol II, and therefore it is likely that Rtr1 could mediate interactions among various proteins in the Pol II complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Given the evidence that Rtr1/RPAP2 is important for pSer5 dephosphorylation in vivo 16,18, an attractive possibility is that Rtr1/RPAP2 is required for recruitment and/or activation of the actual phosphatase that dephosphorylates pSer5 during the early stages of Pol II transcription. </plain></SENT>
