Antimicrobial peptide discovery from feces of normal healthy silkworms provides with a logistical option towards invigorating drugs of biological origin that shows &#8220;drug-likeness and biological friendliness&#8221; in comparison to synthetic drug candidates and would be eco-friendly and aqua-soluble, preventing the residual anxiety and toxicity.

Additionally, the drug toxicity to the host tissue remains a contentious issue with its obvious cost at the market, which leads to inequality in the distribution and procurement. This would guarantee a surplus for the sericulture farms as the drug candidates would be obtained as a by-product of seri-farming practices. It could also be envisioned that the drug candidate can be used as an effective antimicrobial agent in silk insect producing farms.</p><p>So far, literature is sparse in relation to antiviral substances isolated and purified from silkworm excrement.

Novel bioactive proteins were subsequently purified by conventional biochemical techniques, such as 40% ammonium sulphate precipitation, silica column chromatography and GFC with Sephadex G-75. GFC with Sephadex G-75 resin as matrix resolved the column chromatography purified fractions into two peaks A and B. Peak A was resolved as a sharper peak, whereas peak B was observed as a broader peak and assumed to contain low molecular weight proteins/peptides.

The dendrogram analysis defines that germins/Glps could be divided into major groups of true germins and Glps. It is also appropriate to subdivide the Glps into three main subfamilies (I, II and III). Ma-Glp has been strategically placed in subfamily 3 of Glps that is certainly the largest of the three groups. Though the functional significance of Ma-Glp is yet to be established, studies have extensively reported the existent correlation between phylogenesis and functional properties of these groups and subgroups.

<italic>Ma-Glp</italic> belongs to the cupin superfamily of proteins, named on the basis of a conserved &#946;-barrel fold (classic jelly-roll beta-barrel structural domain) and was originally discovered using a conserved motif found within germin and Glps <xref rid="pone.0050900-Dunwell1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. It would belong to monocupins subgroup having a single cupin domain at the centre of the protein, mostly comprising of OXO enzymes in plants, along with proteins such as microbial phosphomannose isomerases and AraC-type transcriptional regulators. Also, cupin superfamily can bind a number of metal ions including manganese, iron, zinc and copper.

The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein extracted from silkworm fecal matter was found exactly similar to the deduced amino acid sequence (without the transit peptide sequence) of the full length cDNA from the food plant <italic>M. alba</italic>. The protein was found stable at extreme temperature and showed activity against some critical bacterial and fungal strains. The activity was maintained at high temperatures that conform to the character of Glps as thermally resistant proteins showing intricate functions in both biotic and abiotic stresses in plant system. It may have evolutionary significance in the insect system as forming structural components of the digestive system. The Ma-Glp had the primary and secondary structure attributes similar to other germins/Glps and was classified under subfamily 3 of Glps. It is important to note further the OXO or SOD enzyme activity of the novel germin to act as a important factor in resistance to pathogenic fungus and other herbivores insects.Excretion of processed active form of Glp from <italic>B. mori</italic>, leads to the hypothesis that insect feces may provide a rich source of material in which to identify other defense-related proteins. It is therefore concluded that, proteomic analysis of fecal extracts would provide with a robust experimental approach towards identification of hyperstable (as well as alkaliphilic) plant proteins that serves important roles in defense as well as to demonstrate the fate of plant proteome interacting with the components of the insect gut. Additionally, the fecal extract accumulating plant proteins can be exploited for commercial interest as industrial biocatalysts.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0050900-Ponnuvel1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
