Furthermore, many biotechnological applications are made possible by such an engineering approach, ranging from biosensors to the design of custom enzyme catalysts. Here, we present a novel method for the computational design of protein-small ligand binding named P<sc>ocket</sc>O<sc>ptimizer</sc>. The program can be used to modify protein binding pocket residues to improve or establish binding of a small molecule. It is a modular pipeline based on a number of customizable molecular modeling tools to predict mutations that alter the affinity of a target protein to its ligand. At its heart it uses a receptor-ligand scoring function to estimate the binding free energy between protein and ligand. We compiled a benchmark set that we used to systematically assess the performance of our method. It consists of proteins for which mutational variants with different binding affinities for their ligands and experimentally determined structures exist. Within this test set P<sc>ocket</sc>O<sc>ptimizer</sc> correctly predicts the mutant with the higher affinity in about 69% of the cases. A detailed analysis of the results reveals that the strengths of P<sc>ocket</sc>O<sc>ptimizer</sc> lie in the correct introduction of stabilizing hydrogen bonds to the ligand, as well as in the improved geometric complemetarity between ligand and binding pocket. Apart from the novel method for binding pocket design we also introduce a much needed benchmark data set for the comparison of affinities of mutant binding pockets, and that we use to asses programs for <italic>in silico</italic> design of ligand binding.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft Grant HO 4022/2-1.

A particularly exciting and dynamic area is the design of interactions between proteins and small molecule ligands. This includes the design of receptors that bind ligands of choice, which for example can be used as biosensors <xref rid="pone.0052505-ValleBlisle1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, as well as the design of enzymes that do not only bind a substrate, but also contain the catalytic machinery to process it <xref rid="pone.0052505-Benson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0052505-Bolon1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In all these designs, an existing protein is used as a scaffold, and its binding pocket is altered or a new one is introduced that should interact with the target ligand.</p><p>With this approach, enzymes have been designed that catalyze chemical reactions for which no natural catalysts exist, such as a kemp eliminase <xref rid="pone.0052505-Rthlisberger1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0052505-Korendovych1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, a diels-alderase <xref rid="pone.0052505-Siegel1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, and a retro-aldolase <xref rid="pone.0052505-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. It has also been used to design a metalloenzyme by repurposing parts of the already existing catalytic machinery in the scaffold protein, namely the reactivity of a zinc metal center to hydrolyze organophosphates <xref rid="pone.0052505-Khare1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Furthermore, similar methods have been applied to change substrate specificities as well as affinities. For example human guanine deaminase was changed to bind ammelide through the remodeling of a loop that now provides a key interaction to the new target substrate <xref rid="pone.0052505-Murphy1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, the substrate specificity of gramicidin S synthetase was changed from phenylalanine to leucine <xref rid="pone.0052505-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, and mutations in dihydrofolate reductase from <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> were predicted that decrease binding to an inhibitor molecule while stabilizing native protein function <xref rid="pone.0052505-Frey1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>While these are impressive results, there is still much room for improvement in the computational methods. Specifically, it seems to be difficult to accurately design a protein for high affinity binding to a ligand or transition state <xref rid="pone.0052505-Schreier1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The majority of the enzyme designs mentioned have low affinities for their substrates when compared to naturally occurring enzymes <xref rid="pone.0052505-Baker1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0052505-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In a rare report of a failed attempt, the unsuccessful design of a high-affinity ligand binding site for a D-Ala- D-Ala dipeptide into an endo-1,4-xylanase scaffold was discussed. Designs by the employed design software R<sc>osetta</sc> did not show the predicted high affinity in the experimental tests underscoring the challenge of protein-ligand interface design <xref rid="pone.0052505-Morin1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In this respect long-range electrostatics and dynamics, accurate modeling of solvation and electrostatics at the interface, as well as the inclusion of explicit water molecules have been named as most problematic areas <xref rid="pone.0052505-Baker1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0052505-Morin2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In order to improve protein-ligand interface design and to overcome current limitations it will be necessary to test design protocols more systematically.</p><p>In this respect, we noticed that in computational design studies there is a lack of more general benchmark sets. Related molecular modeling techniques are regularly assessed using test sets. For example protein-ligand docking algorithms have been compared in detail <xref rid="pone.0052505-Plewczynski1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0052505-Cole1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>

Also the CASP and CAPRI experiments allow unbiased testing of protein structure prediction and protein-protein docking methods <xref rid="pone.0052505-Moult1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In contrast only a few computational design studies tested their employed methodology. One example is the redesign of the binding pocket of ribose binding protein for its native ligand using molecular mechanics methods. Among the resulting binding pocket sequences, the wild type sequence was ranked second best, while the first and third ranks had only a single mutation and bound ribose with tenfold decreased affinity <xref rid="pone.0052505-Boas1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Also the aforementioned algorithm to introduce one key interaction to a ligand using loop modeling techniques was tested on eight proteins. For six of them the method produced a loop of the same length and similar configuration as in the crystal structures <xref rid="pone.0052505-Murphy1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Both benchmark tests are very specific, they cannot be used to generally and systematically assess a method&#8217;s proficiency in designing binding to a small molecule. Also the broader benchmark set that was used to assess the ability of the enzyme design methods R<sc>osetta</sc>M<sc>atch</sc> and S<sc>caffold</sc>S<sc>election</sc> to identify suitable scaffold proteins that can host a desired catalytic machinery <xref rid="pone.0052505-Zanghellini1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0052505-Malisi1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> are not suited for this purpose. Such a test set, however, would be very helpful for assessing the potential and the shortcomings of available methods.</p><p>In this study, we present P<sc>ocket</sc>O<sc>ptimizer</sc>, a computational pipeline that can be used to predict mutations in the binding pocket of proteins, which increase the affinity of the protein to a given small molecule ligand. It can be used for the analysis of few mutations as well as for the design of an entire binding pocket. It uses several molecular modeling modules. Side chain flexibility is sampled by a conformer library, which we compiled following Boas and Harbury <xref rid="pone.0052505-Boas1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The use of conformer libraries has been reported to be advantageous, especially in the context of binding-site geometries <xref rid="pone.0052505-Shetty1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0052505-Lassila1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0052505-Xiang1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. A receptor-ligand scoring function is used to calculate protein ligand binding strength. The modular architecture of P<sc>ocket</sc>O<sc>ptimizer</sc> allows easy and systematic comparison of methods that perform the same task. As the first test we utilize this to examine two scoring functions in this study, the scoring function provided by CADDSuite <xref rid="pone.0052505-Schumann1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and Autodock Vina <xref rid="pone.0052505-Trott1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In order to assess the performance of P<sc>ocket</sc>O<sc>ptimizer</sc> and other methods that address the same task, we compiled a benchmark set. It consists of mutational variants of proteins and their small ligands with available experimental structural and binding affinity data. We also used this benchmark to test the enzyme design application included in the R<sc>osetta</sc> molecular modeling software. R<sc>osetta</sc> was used for the majority of the design studies mentioned earlier, and it is the most successful freely available protein design software to date <xref rid="pone.0052505-Richter1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. We find that both methods perform similarly. In our benchmark P<sc>ocket</sc>O<sc>ptimizer</sc> succeeds slightly better in predicting the correct affinity-enhancing mutations. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of our method and describe to which protein design problems it can be applied with good chances of success. The findings emphasize the merit of a systematic approach to evaluate computational protein design methodologies, to identify their strengths, and to pinpoint possibilities for improvement. And our modular program P<sc>ocket</sc>O<sc>ptimizer</sc> provides a suitable framework to test and implement these approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Computational Receptor Design Pipeline PocketOptimizer</title><p>We developed P<sc>ocket</sc>O<sc>ptimizer</sc> for the design of protein-ligand interactions.

Amino acid flexibility is modeled by a side chain conformer library, ligand flexibility is addressed by systematically sampling poses of the ligand in the binding pocket.

For this, we systematically searched the PDBbind database <xref rid="pone.0052505-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, which lists high quality crystal structures of protein-ligand complexes together with experimentally determined binding data. Each protein in our set has at least two mutational variants (usually the wild type and one or more mutants) accompanied by an affinity measure (the inhibitory constant <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0052505.e001.jpg"/></inline-formula> or dissociation constant <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0052505.e002.jpg"/></inline-formula>) for the same ligand. The positions of amino acids that differ between the variants are always located in the binding pocket or active site. For each protein, there is at least one crystal structure of a variant with the ligand, for ten of the twelve there are two or more crystal structures that allow us to compare a design model of a variant with the respective crystal structure. The proteins and ligands in our benchmark set are very diverse. All ligands are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052505-g002">Figure 2</xref>.

It can go over many alternatives. For the benchmark, however, it was necessary to restrict the sequence to the mutations for which experimental data was available. We tested the performance of P<sc>ocket</sc>O<sc>ptimizer</sc> on the benchmark set using Autodock Vina and CADDSuite receptor-ligand scores as well as R<sc>osetta</sc>&#8217;s enzyme design application. Each method was used for the same set of design calculations. Each available crystal structure was used as a scaffold for the design of each mutational variant. We obtained a design for each mutation in each scaffold structure by forcing the methods to select a particular mutation in a separate run. This allowed us to compare the predicted binding and total energy scores as well as the designed conformations with the experimental data. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052505-g003">Figure 3</xref> shows the RMSD values between the designs and the respective crystal structures. This is a measure of how well the respective method models the conformation of the binding pocket residues and the ligand pose in the pocket. R<sc>osetta</sc> performs better in modeling side chains in the binding pocket. The difference between the pocket RMSDs of R<sc>osetta</sc> and each of the two P<sc>ocket</sc>O<sc>ptimizer</sc> variants is statistically significant with a p-value &lt;0.01 according to a Mann-Whitney test. This might not come as a surprise considering that the R<sc>osetta</sc> molecular modeling software is extensively used and optimized for protein packing tasks, especially protein structure prediction. P<sc>ocket</sc>O<sc>ptimizer</sc> on the other hand focuses on the identification of residues interacting favorably with the ligand. The observed differences in ligand pose RMSD are not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052505-g003">Figure 3</xref>). To assess whether the methods can differentiate correctly between protein variants that have a large affinity difference, we looked at pairs that have an affinity difference of at least 50-fold. This cutoff translates to roughly 2.3 kcal/mole and was chosen to make sure that only pairs with clear, trustworthy affinity differences well outside experimental error are investigated. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0052505-t002">Table 2</xref> lists the number of pairs in which the order of the mutants according to energy score is the same as the order according to affinity, meaning the design method would produce the correct ranking. Here, P<sc>ocket</sc>O<sc>ptimizer</sc> performs in the same range as R<sc>osetta</sc>, with 69% correctly predicted pairs opposed to 64%. When comparing the two receptor-ligand score functions we used in our approach it seems that Autodock Vina has some advantage over the CADDSuite score. The total scores of the different methods are also listed. Based on these scores P<sc>ocket</sc>O<sc>ptimizer</sc> performs even better with 71% and 76% correctly predicted pairs. However, since we are looking at affinity prediction, the binding score appears to be more appropriate for the comparison.</p><fig id="pone-0052505-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0052505.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Differences of the ligand poses and pocket side chains in the benchmark designs compared to the crystal structures.</title><p>The upper graph shows the average RMSDs and standard deviation between the ligand pose in the designs and in the crystal structures. The lower graph shows the average RMSD and standard deviation between the binding pocket side chain heavy atoms of designs and the corresponding crystal structure. The RMSDs are calculated after superimposing the structures using the backbone to make sure that the differences come from pocket/ligand pose differences only.

This is especially noteworthy for pairs where one residue forms a hydrogen bond with the ligand, while the other does not. This was predicted correctly in seven of eight cases where the better binding variant forms an additional hydrogen bond. It also works well if the variable side chain of one mutation variant is bulkier than its counterpart in another variant, and therefore packs better against the ligand, i.e. forms more van der Waals (vdW) interactions with the ligand and shields it better from solvent, improving the solvation energy contribution. A potential downside of this effect of vdW contact improvement is that P<sc>ocket</sc>O<sc>ptimizer</sc> sometimes seems to prefer larger side chains even if they are detrimental to binding for other reasons. This tendency could lead to an overpacking of the designed pocket. When differences in binding have more complex causes, such as rearrangements in the pocket&#8217;s side chains that affect the ligand interaction indirectly by influencing other pocket side chains, the program generally fails to capture these differences.</p><p>Both scoring functions used within P<sc>ocket</sc>O<sc>ptimizer</sc>, from Autodock Vina and CADDSuite, produce results that are quite similar. The overpacking effect discussed before is less pronounced in Vina, which explains its slightly better performance in predicting which variant of a pair binds better (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0052505-t002">Table 2</xref>). Generally, the order of the designs by energy scores calculated by our method does not depend on which variant&#8217;s crystal structure was used as the scaffold. Only in a few cases a significant difference can be observed, notably for carbonic anhydrase II and trypsin.</p><p>In some cases, the P<sc>ocket</sc>O<sc>ptimizer</sc> designs did not contain a conformational configuration that avoids vdW clashes in the binding pocket. In one test case, namely for neuroaminidase, the program was unable to identify any acceptable pocket conformation. One limitation of P<sc>ocket</sc>O<sc>ptimizer</sc> and a probable cause for such problems is the assumption of a fixed backbone in our designs. An adjustment of the backbone conformation might have helped to accommodate the tyrosine. It is also conceivable that our way of systematically sampling possible ligand poses could have failed to generate a pose that is sterically compatible in the neuroaminidase case.</p><p>Rosetta&#8217;s enzyme design application does not suffer from unresolvable vdW clashes. It includes minimization steps in its algorithm that can resolve potential clashes introduced by discrete conformational sampling. However, Rosetta apparently cannot convey its superiority in modeling the binding pocket side chains to the prediction of the correct binding score order. It is unable to predict the rearrangements of side chain conformations that lead to binding affinity changes in the more complicated test cases. The energy term for hydrogen bonds in R<sc>osetta</sc> seems to have less influence on the output than in our program. This causes R<sc>osetta</sc> to miss existing hydrogen bonds between ligand and side chains. The binding scores and their differences predicted for different mutants are more dependent on the scaffold structure used in Rosetta designs than it is in P<sc>ocket</sc>O<sc>ptimizer</sc>. This can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052505-g004">Figure 4:</xref> the lines for designs of both P<sc>ocket</sc>O<sc>ptimizer</sc> variants, Vina and CADDSuite, are more similar to each other than the ones for R<sc>osetta</sc> designs.

<xref rid="pone.0052505-Malisi1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In P<sc>ocket</sc>O<sc>ptimizer</sc> receptor-ligand scoring functions are used to assess binding. For its evaluation, we compiled a benchmark set of proteins for which crystal structures and experimental affinity data are available and that can be used to test our and other methodologies. We subjected P<sc>ocket</sc>O<sc>ptimizer</sc> as well as the state-of-the-art method R<sc>osetta</sc> to our benchmark test. The overall performance of both approaches was similar, but in detail both had different benefits. R<sc>osetta</sc> handles the conformational modeling of the binding pocket better, while P<sc>ocket</sc>O<sc>ptimizer</sc> has the advantage in predicting which of a pair of mutants of the same protein binds the ligand better. This prediction was correct in 66 or 69% of the tested cases using P<sc>ocket</sc>O<sc>ptimizer</sc> (CADDSuite or Vina score, respectively) and in 64% of the cases using R<sc>osetta</sc>.</p><p>The results show that P<sc>ocket</sc>O<sc>ptimizer</sc> is a well performing tool for the design of protein-ligand interactions. It is especially suited for the introduction of a hydrogen bond if there is an unsatisfied hydrogen donor or acceptor group in the ligand, and for filling voids between the protein and the ligand to improve vdW interactions. For affinity design problems that require a more complex rearrangement of the binding pocket, e.g. a mutation making room for another side chain to interact with the ligand, none of the tested methods appear to perform well.</p><p>There are also some other obvious effects that can influence binding, but that are not addressable with the current methods, e.g. protein dynamics or rearrangements of the backbone. Such problems are probably harder to address than the more complicated test cases dealt with in this study, so that we do not expect that current methods can tackle them with much success. Some apparent problems of P<sc>ocket</sc>O<sc>ptimizer</sc>, however, such as the occurrence of unresolvable steric clashes between ligand and side chains should be mendable by better sampling of the conformational space and the introduction of backbone flexibility <xref rid="pone.0052505-Georgiev1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>

It is conceivable that a continuous minimization step at the end of the design calculation could also be beneficial.</p><p>In conclusion, it seems that although P<sc>ocket</sc>O<sc>ptimizer</sc> performs well, and even better in some respects than the state-of-the-art method R<sc>osetta</sc>, there is still room for improvement in computational design of protein-ligand binding. Our study highlights the usefulness of benchmark data sets and systematic testing in order to arrive at an informed assessment of computational design methods. In fact it would be interesting to test other available protein design schemes using our benchmark. A comparison of their performance should be very informative. Further, the benchmark will be useful in future test of parts of our modular design pipeline, e.g. by exchanging the force-field in P<sc>ocket</sc>O<sc>ptimizer</sc> its contribution can be tested rather than the overall design approach.</p><p>When we started to compile our benchmark set, we were hoping for considerably more test cases. The fact that out of the 6,005 protein structures currently contained in the PDBbind database, only ten suitable test cases could be extracted (twelve if the double cases of neuroaminidase and streptavidin are counted), was rather surprising to us. This emphasizes the need for more benchmark data. Thus, an explicit effort to systematically create experimental and structural data is required. For protein-ligand interaction design it would be desirable to have data that covers many mutations of several pocket positions, ideally also of a set of different proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Benchmark Set</title><p>The basis for the benchmark set is the PDBbind database. It contains a set of crystal structures of proteins complexed with small ligands, and the corresponding experimentally determined binding affinity. <xref rid="pone.0052505-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Our analysis is based on release 2010. First, we aligned the sequences of all proteins in the database to each other, using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm <xref rid="pone.0052505-Needleman1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> as implemented in the EMBOSS suite <xref rid="pone.0052505-Rice1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The proteins were then clustered with single linkage clustering, a link was assumed if the sequence identity was &#8805;95%. One cluster was assumed to contain structures of variants of the same protein with some mutations. Several descriptors were calculated for the protein-ligand complexes. If the crystal structure contains water molecules in the binding pocket, waters that have a high probability to play a role in binding were identified and counted. This was done with the tool W<sc>ater</sc>F<sc>inder</sc> included in CADDSuite <xref rid="pone.0052505-Schumann1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0052505-Hildebrandt1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> that estimates the strength of binding of a water molecule observed in a crystal structure to the protein. The number of rotatable bonds in the ligand is used as a measure of ligand size and flexibility. The ligands of all proteins in a cluster were pairwise compared using ligand fingerprints as implemented in OpenBabel <xref rid="pone.0052505-OBoyle1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> to measure their similarity and identity. For protein pairs of the same cluster with identical ligands, the pockets as defined by PDBbind were investigated for any mismatches corresponding to mutations. To identify suitable protein pairs, we searched our dataset for protein variants within a cluster that (1) have the same ligand bound, (2) contain at least one mutation in the binding pocket, (3) have no mutations elsewhere, (4) contain less than four water molecules potentially involved in binding, and (5) have a ligand with less than 15 rotatable bonds. As the results contained mostly single mutants, an additional search was performed looking for mutants with (1) at least two mutations in the pocket, (2) no mutations elsewhere, (3) allowing for less than 15 rotatable ligand bonds and (4) less than 7 potential binding waters molecules. The proteins identified by these searches were investigated further by visually inspecting their structure and looking at the corresponding literature. Suitable proteins were included in our set. Reasons for rejecting a protein were large conformational differences of the backbone in the binding pocket, the fact that affinity differences between variants is not caused by any protein-ligand interaction, but for example by changes in protein dynamics, and missing atoms of residues in the binding pocket in a crystal structure.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Design Pipeline PocketOptimizer</title><p>A diagram of the P<sc>ocket</sc>O<sc>ptimizer</sc> workflow is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052505-g001">Figure 1</xref>.

As we are interested in improving binding affinity, we chose to upscale the binding energies by a factor of ten for CADDSuite scores and a factor of 100 for Autodock Vina scores to arrive at absolute values that are in the same range as the AMBER packing energies.
