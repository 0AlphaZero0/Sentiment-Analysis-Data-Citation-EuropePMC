The promising role of MSCs in cell-based therapies and tissue engineering appears to be limited due to a decline of their regenerative potential with increasing donor age, their limited availability in human tissues and the need of <italic>in vitro</italic> expansion prior to treatment. We therefore aimed to determine to which degree <italic>in vitro</italic> aging and chronological aging may be similar processes or if <italic>in vitro</italic> culture-related changes at the cellular and molecular level are at least altered as a function of donor age. For that purpose we established MSCs cultures from young (yMSCs) and aged (aMSCs) rats that were cultured for more than 100 passages. These long-term MSCs cultures were non-tumorigenic and exhibited similar surface marker patterns as primary MSCs of passage 2. During <italic>in vitro</italic> expansion, but not during chronological aging, MSCs progressively lose their progenitor characteristics, e.g., complete loss of osteogenic differentiation potential, diminished adipogenic differentiation, altered cell morphology and increased susceptibility towards senescence. Transcriptome analysis revealed that long-term <italic>in vitro</italic> MSCs cultivation leads to down-regulation of genes involved in cell differentiation, focal adhesion organization, cytoskeleton turnover and mitochondria function. Accordingly, functional analysis demonstrated altered mitochondrial morphology, decreased antioxidant capacities and elevated ROS levels in long-term cultivated yMSCs as well as aMSCs. Notably, only the MSC migration potential and their antioxidative capacity were altered by <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as chronological aging. Based on specific differences observed between the impact of chronological and <italic>in vitro</italic> MSC aging we conclude that both are distinct processes.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) by funding through the BCRT and by the German Research Foundation (DFG) grant GE2512/1-1.

Their healing-promoting properties result not only from their ability to differentiate into functional mesenchymal cells, but also from their paracrine effects. For instance MSCs serve as source of cytokines and proteinases essential to angiogenesis and matrix-remodeling such as VEGF, MMPs, TGF-&#946;, and bFGF <xref rid="pone.0052700-Kasper1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052700-Kasper2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Advantageously, MSCs can be directly obtained from patient's bone marrow or adipose tissue, thereby avoiding ethical and safety issues associated with the use of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or induced pluripotent cells (iPSC). Thus, MSCs are thought to be an attractive cell source for cell-based therapies and tissue engineering. In experimental approaches the regenerative capability of MSCs has been validated for femoral head necrosis, osteogenesis imperfecta, large bone defects, infantile hypophosphatasia, GVHD, cartilage defects and tendon repair <xref rid="pone.0052700-Krampera1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0052700-Quarto1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Even though MSCs therapies have been successful <italic>in vitro</italic> and in animal settings, a broad clinical application of such therapies is still missing <xref rid="pone.0052700-Salem1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. One reason may be that in mammals the regeneration potential of mesenchymal tissues declines with age, which might be at least partially due to age-related changes in MSC quantity and quality <xref rid="pone.0052700-Gruber1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052700-Strube1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. We and other groups demonstrated that chronological aging of the donor is associated with a decline of MSC number, reduced migration potential and diminished differentiation capacity <xref rid="pone.0052700-Kasper3" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052700-Sethe1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. On the molecular level these changes in cellular function were attributed to decreased cytoskeleton turnover, lower antioxidant activity and higher susceptibility towards senescence.</p><p>Similarly, also extended MSC expansion <italic>in vitro</italic> seems to compromise their regenerative function. In this regard, earlier studies already questioned the capability of endless MSC expansion, which may result in loss of progenitor properties and in malignant transformation <xref rid="pone.0052700-Wagner1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052700-Rsland1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. This indicates that MSC-based therapeutic strategies require reliable markers for phenotypic, functional and genetic characterization of employed cell population after <italic>in vitro</italic> expansion.</p><p>Since both individual chronological (<italic>in vivo</italic>) aging and <italic>in vitro</italic> aging, due to long-term cultivation, affect MSCs characteristic, the question arises to which degree these two processes differ and in which respect they may be similar. Recently, it has been hypothesized that chronological and <italic>in vitro</italic> aging of human MSCs induce similar alterations in gene expression <xref rid="pone.0052700-Wagner2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Thus, the aims of this study are to determine a) to which extent <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> aging are related processes leading to similar cellular and molecular alterations, and b) if long-term culture-related changes are altered as a function of the chronological age.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All experiments involving the use of animals were in compliance with the German Animal Welfare Act (TierSchG &#167;4 <xref rid="pone.0052700-Kasper2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>) and were approved by State Office of Health and Social Affairs Berlin (Permit Number: IC113-Reg 0232/07).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>MSC isolation</title><p>MSCs were isolated from the bone marrow of three week and 12 months old male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Winkelmann, Germany, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.harlan.com">www.harlan.com</ext-link>), selected by plastic adherence and cultured in expansion medium (EM) <xref rid="pone.0052700-Kasper3" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.

Moreover, it is assumed that the number of cell division cycles decreases with the donor age. In our study, we observed no ultimate cell cycle arrest of the entire cell population during <italic>in vitro</italic> aging of aMSCs and yMSCs from rats. Culture of aMSCs and yMSCs occurred for more than 100 passages at relative constant proliferation rates, suggesting extension of lifespan and possibly spontaneous immortalization. Extended long-term culture might result in spontaneous immortalization of murine as well as human MSCs <xref rid="pone.0052700-Rsland1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052700-Miura1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052700-Izadpanah1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.

Notably, a non-transformed status does not exclude the occurrence of aneuploidy in long-term cultivated MSCs. Other groups have shown that MSCs with chromosomal instabilities exhibited no evidence of transformation either <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> and enter senescence <xref rid="pone.0052700-Tarte1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Accordingly, transcriptional analysis revealed an up-regulation of genes associated with the tumor suppressor p53 signaling pathway. This pathway promotes replicative and premature senescence as well as apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0052700-Muller1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052700-Artandi1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. It seems to be progressively activated during aging in response to various cellular stresses, including DNA damage and oncogene activation <xref rid="pone.0052700-Sharpless1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Correspondingly, p53 signaling is inactive in the majority of human cancer cells and partially accounts for their resistance to senescence <xref rid="pone.0052700-Muller1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.

<italic>In vitro</italic> aging negatively affects the differentiation capacity of aMSCs and yMSCs</title><p>Long-term culture not only affects aMSCs and yMSCs on a molecular level; it also alters their morphology and has functional consequences. MSCs of P30 and P100 were no longer able to differentiate into the osteogenic lineage and the ability to differentiate into the adipogenic lineage was markedly decreased. These results are consistent with several other studies showing a reduced differentiation potential in human and murine MSCs upon <italic>in vitro</italic> aging <xref rid="pone.0052700-Fehrer1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0052700-Noer1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. The mRNA expression analysis revealed a decreased expression of genes involved in Wnt and Tgf-&#946;/Bmp signaling upon long term culture. The Wnt pathway is clearly required throughout osteogenesis and substantial elevated Wnt/&#946;-catenin signaling triggers the differentiation of MSCs into the osteogenic lineage <xref rid="pone.0052700-Gaur1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0052700-Rodda1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.</p><p>A pivotal role of Bmp signaling is the induction of bone and cartilage formation <xref rid="pone.0052700-Xiao1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. BMPs induce the differentiation of mesenchymal cells and also enhance the function of osteoblasts (matrix synthesis) <xref rid="pone.0052700-Wagner4" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Some studies have pointed out that BMP signaling is also required for adipogenic differentiation of mesenchymal precursor cells <xref rid="pone.0052700-Wagner4" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Accordingly, we observed decreased adipogenic differentiation potentials of long-term cultivated MSCs and a down-regulation of genes involved in the PPAR&#947; pathway. The PPAR&#947; pathway positively regulates the adipocytic differentiation of MSCs and intracellular accumulation of lipids by modulating genes involved in their uptake and metabolism <xref rid="pone.0052700-Berger1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.</p><p>Notably, the BMP- as well as dexamethasone induced osteogenic differentiation was impaired in long-term cultivated MSCs. Also others have reported that a decreased differentiation potential upon dexamethasone-induced osteogenic differentiation is associated with altered Bmp-receptor mRNA expression <xref rid="pone.0052700-Wagner4" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0052700-Marcellini1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. This observation emphasizes the important role of down-regulated BMP signaling for the diminished differentiation potential of <italic>in vitro</italic> aged MSCs. Results from several studies have led to the assumption that the BMP pathway cooperates with other pathways, especially the canonical Wnt-signaling <xref rid="pone.0052700-Marcellini1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0052700-Gazzerro1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, to drive osteogenic differentiation. For example, the knock-out of the Wnt/&#223;-catenin antagonist Axin2 leads to enhanced nuclear accumulation of &#223;-catenin and increased levels of BMP2, BMP6 and phosphor-Smad, which further promotes osteogenic differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells and enhances bone formation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, respectively <xref rid="pone.0052700-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052700-Yan1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. In both studies, the effect of the Axin2 knockout on BMP-signaling and osteogenic differentiation could be reversed by &#223;-catenin inactivation. Collectively, there is growing evidence suggesting that osteogenic differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells is highly dependent on the cross talk between Wnt and BMP signaling <xref rid="pone.0052700-Marcellini1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Moreover, aMSCs and yMSCs exhibit exclusive expression of several genes belonging to the Notch signaling pathway upon <italic>in vitro</italic> aging. The Notch signaling pathway is known to suppress osteogenic differentiation and markedly decreases trabecular bone mass in adolescent mice <xref rid="pone.0052700-Hilton1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Thus, the observed alterations in Tgf/Bmp-, Wnt-, Ppar&#947;-, Mapk- and Notch signaling pathway might act together and lead to the loss of differentiation ability after long-term culture. Altogether, transcriptomes of <italic>in vitro</italic> aged aMSCs and yMSCs are clearly distinct from primary MSCs (approx. 85% correlation); therefore a complete loss of progenitor characteristic with long-term cultivation is reasonable to expect. In conclusion, long-term survival of MSCs in culture is achieved at the cost of differentiation potential. Furthermore, <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture conditions favor expansion of cells with high proliferation potential rather than those with high differentiation potential. Here we have shown that <italic>in vitro</italic> aged MSCs express common markers of the MSCs phenotype, which highlights the lack of reliable markers for multipotent MSCs.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Altered morphology and migration potential upon <italic>in vitro</italic> aging</title><p>Apart from the negative influence of <italic>in vitro</italic> aging on MSC differentiation potential, extended long-term culture might also lead to other functional alterations. For instance, recently we and others have shown that chronological aging has a significant impact on cell migration, cytoskeleton organization and actin turn-over <xref rid="pone.0052700-Kasper3" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052700-Shiraha1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. As MSCs for each therapeutic approach crucially rely on proper migration towards stimuli for functional engraftment, we analyzed aMSCs and yMSCs for this aspect in more detail. Random (undirected) migration potential of MSCs in our study was affected by both <italic>in vitro</italic> aging status and age of donor animals. Cellular migration, which requires coordinated contact to the extracellular substrate followed by detachment, strongly depends on local cytoskeleton organization and actin turn-over <xref rid="pone.0052700-LeClainche1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. The impact of local actin organization for migration is accented by the importance of lamellipodia, fillopodia and focal complex formation for cellular migration <xref rid="pone.0052700-Larsen1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. In line with the reduced MSC migration potential upon in vitro and chronological aging, diminished expression of genes associated with focal adhesion and actin cytoskeleton organization was observed. Differential gene regulation was more prominent between primary and long-term cultivated cells than between aMSCs and yMSCs of the same passage as reflected by a higher number of affected genes, higher degree of differential expression as well as lower p-values. By immunofluorescence analysis, we demonstrated that during long-term cultivation size of aMSCs and yMSCs as well as their filopodia and lamellipodia number decreases, while their cell roundness increases. Correspondingly, with increasing passage number we observed a donor-age independent decline in mRNA expression of specific genes subsets encoding cytoskeletal and focal adhesion proteins such as integrins, alpha-actinins, actin related protein 2/3 complex, Rho-associated coiled-coil forming kinases (ROCK), cofilin, and profilin.</p><p>Although undirected transmigration rather than chemotaxis was investigated, it needs to be highlighted that we further observed a down-regulation of mRNAs of several chemokines, cytokines and their receptors during chronological and <italic>in vitro</italic> aging, e.g. stromal cell-derived factor 1 (Sdf-1) and its receptor (Cxcr4). On molecular level, it is assumed that specific chemokines and their receptors play a critical role to direct MSCs to their desired site of action. Studies investigating skeletal repair and systemic skeletal disorders in animal models showed that CXCR4 and SDF-1 recruit MSCs to the fracture site and prevent bone loss <xref rid="pone.0052700-Kitaori1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Oxidative stress might cause the decline of MSC functionality upon <italic>in vitro</italic> aging</title><p>Transcriptome analysis revealed a passage-dependent decline in the expression of mRNA associated with mitochondria, oxidative phosphorylation, glutathione metabolism, and antioxidant defense. These expression changes were accompanied by altered mitochondria morphology, reduced antioxidant capacity, increased ROS levels, enhanced &#916;&#936;ms, and diminished intracellular ATP concentrations. Dysfunctional mitochondria, which are a natural source of free radicals and ROS, lead to increased intracellular ROS concentration, impaired ATP production and causes stress-induced senescence in normal somatic cells as well as in MSCs <xref rid="pone.0052700-Paradies1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0052700-Savitha1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. This together suggests that the higher expression of senescence markers in long-term cultured MSCs may be caused by increased intracellular stress. In human ESCs and iPSCs alterations in mitochondrial proliferation and development were associated with loss of pluripotency <xref rid="pone.0052700-Prigione1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. ESCs and iPSCs that demonstrate reduced mitochondrial number and activity suppress the mitochondrial/oxidative stress pathway. Moreover, iPSCs exhibit alterations of senescence-related p53 signaling pathway compared to their differentiated and subsequently transformed cellular origin. Furthermore, long-term cultured hESCs are characterized by dysfunctional mitochondria potentially compromising their long-term pluripotency <xref rid="pone.0052700-Xie1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Similar to our observations, the same study associated an elevated mitochondria network volume with increased &#916;&#936;m and ROS levels. These changes were attributed to a diminished removal of damaged mitochondria and/or fusion of existing mitochondria in order to compensate for mitochondrial dysfunction. Although chronological aging also affects MSCs antioxidant capacity and glutathione metabolism, we find no difference in the basal ROS levels comparing aMSCs and yMSCs. This observation is in line with other studies demonstrating unaffected ROS production in cells from aged and young adult rats <xref rid="pone.0052700-Hansford1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. Thus, our findings suggest that increased intracellular oxidative stress could be the basis for the progressive functional decline of aMSCs and yMSCs during long-term <italic>in vitro</italic> culture. Mitochondrial dysfunction marked by increased ROS concentrations may lead to DNA and protein damage, which in turn might activates p53 signaling increasing the amount of senescent and dysfunctional cells. These detrimental effects seem to occur independently of the donor age during <italic>in vitro</italic> expansion and support the idea that chronological and <italic>in vitro</italic> aging are distinct processes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Long-term <italic>in vitro</italic> culture, but not chronological aging, compromises the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation capacity of MSCs and alters their morphology, susceptibility to senescence and mitochondrial function. Accordingly, transcriptome analysis revealed that chronological and <italic>in vitro</italic> aging results to a large extent in divergent changes at the molecular level. Thus, independent from donor animal age, <italic>in vitro</italic> aging of MSCs seems to result in complete loss of their progenitor characteristics. Although, <italic>in vitro</italic> aging alters the migration potential and antioxidative capacity of MSCs as a function of the donor age, results of this study collectively suggest that both are distinct processes. Even if our present study is in some way limited by the usage of rat MSCs instead of human MSCs, it provides direct comparison between <italic>in vitro</italic> and chronological aged MSC not only at the cellular but also at the molecular level.
