<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The promising role of MSCs in cell-based therapies and tissue engineering appears to be limited due to a decline of their regenerative potential with increasing donor age, their limited availability in human tissues and the need of in vitro expansion prior to treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We therefore aimed to determine to which degree in vitro aging and chronological aging may be similar processes or if in vitro culture-related changes at the cellular and molecular level are at least altered as a function of donor age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For that purpose we established MSCs cultures from young (yMSCs) and aged (aMSCs) rats that were cultured for more than 100 passages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These long-term MSCs cultures were non-tumorigenic and exhibited similar surface marker patterns as primary MSCs of passage 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>During in vitro expansion, but not during chronological aging, MSCs progressively lose their progenitor characteristics, e.g., complete loss of osteogenic differentiation potential, diminished adipogenic differentiation, altered cell morphology and increased susceptibility towards senescence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Transcriptome analysis revealed that long-term in vitro MSCs cultivation leads to down-regulation of genes involved in cell differentiation, focal adhesion organization, cytoskeleton turnover and mitochondria function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, functional analysis demonstrated altered mitochondrial morphology, decreased antioxidant capacities and elevated ROS levels in long-term cultivated yMSCs as well as aMSCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Notably, only the MSC migration potential and their antioxidative capacity were altered by in vitro as well as chronological aging. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Based on specific differences observed between the impact of chronological and in vitro MSC aging we conclude that both are distinct processes. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are highly proliferative cells that are able to home to and engraft in different tissues and finally differentiate into functional osteoblasts, chondrocytes and/or adipocytes [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Their healing-promoting properties result not only from their ability to differentiate into functional mesenchymal cells, but also from their paracrine effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>For instance MSCs serve as source of cytokines and proteinases essential to angiogenesis and matrix-remodeling such as VEGF, MMPs, TGF-β, and bFGF [2], [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Advantageously, MSCs can be directly obtained from patient's bone marrow or adipose tissue, thereby avoiding ethical and safety issues associated with the use of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or induced pluripotent cells (iPSC). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Thus, MSCs are thought to be an attractive cell source for cell-based therapies and tissue engineering. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In experimental approaches the regenerative capability of MSCs has been validated for femoral head necrosis, osteogenesis imperfecta, large bone defects, infantile hypophosphatasia, GVHD, cartilage defects and tendon repair [4]–[7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Even though MSCs therapies have been successful in vitro and in animal settings, a broad clinical application of such therapies is still missing [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>One reason may be that in mammals the regeneration potential of mesenchymal tissues declines with age, which might be at least partially due to age-related changes in MSC quantity and quality [8], [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>We and other groups demonstrated that chronological aging of the donor is associated with a decline of MSC number, reduced migration potential and diminished differentiation capacity [10], [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>On the molecular level these changes in cellular function were attributed to decreased cytoskeleton turnover, lower antioxidant activity and higher susceptibility towards senescence. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Similarly, also extended MSC expansion in vitro seems to compromise their regenerative function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In this regard, earlier studies already questioned the capability of endless MSC expansion, which may result in loss of progenitor properties and in malignant transformation [12], [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>This indicates that MSC-based therapeutic strategies require reliable markers for phenotypic, functional and genetic characterization of employed cell population after in vitro expansion. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Since both individual chronological (in vivo) aging and in vitro aging, due to long-term cultivation, affect MSCs characteristic, the question arises to which degree these two processes differ and in which respect they may be similar. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has been hypothesized that chronological and in vitro aging of human MSCs induce similar alterations in gene expression [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Thus, the aims of this study are to determine a) to which extent in vitro and in vivo aging are related processes leading to similar cellular and molecular alterations, and b) if long-term culture-related changes are altered as a function of the chronological age. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Limitations for clinical usage of MSCs are the lack of standardized isolation protocols, reliable quality control and sufficiently high cell quantities [21], [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Thus, to achieve adequate amounts of MSCs in vitro expansion is required [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Adversely, in vitro culture has a significant influence on gene expression and functional behavior of MSCs as soluble factors and cells forming the specific niche are lacking [24]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>The proliferation capacity of the most cell types is limited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>After a certain number of cell divisions, the population expansion is slowed down, before the cells ultimately stop dividing [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it is assumed that the number of cell division cycles decreases with the donor age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>In our study, we observed no ultimate cell cycle arrest of the entire cell population during in vitro aging of aMSCs and yMSCs from rats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Culture of aMSCs and yMSCs occurred for more than 100 passages at relative constant proliferation rates, suggesting extension of lifespan and possibly spontaneous immortalization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Extended long-term culture might result in spontaneous immortalization of murine as well as human MSCs [13], [26], [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>In contrast to other studies, neither aMSCsP100 nor yMSCsP100 showed growth in a soft agar assay suggesting an untransformed status [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Notably, a non-transformed status does not exclude the occurrence of aneuploidy in long-term cultivated MSCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Other groups have shown that MSCs with chromosomal instabilities exhibited no evidence of transformation either in vitro or in vivo and enter senescence [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, transcriptional analysis revealed an up-regulation of genes associated with the tumor suppressor p53 signaling pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>This pathway promotes replicative and premature senescence as well as apoptosis [30], [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>It seems to be progressively activated during aging in response to various cellular stresses, including DNA damage and oncogene activation [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, p53 signaling is inactive in the majority of human cancer cells and partially accounts for their resistance to senescence [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Thus, in vitro aging induces increased p21WAF1/CIP1 and p16INK4A expression pointing to a higher proportion of senescent cells in long-term cultivated MSCs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>It is important to note that increased expression of senescence markers in long-term cultivated MSC population does not necessarily indicate a decline in replicative potential of each individual cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>Rather to replicative senescence, a proportion of individual cells might undergo stress-induced premature senescence in response to intracellular stress like oxidative stress, irreversible DNA damage or genomic instability [30], [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>For example, it was shown that both chemical and culture-induced oxidative stress cause DNA damages and aneuploidy in human MSCs, which subsequently undergo senescence [34]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>Long-term culture not only affects aMSCs and yMSCs on a molecular level; it also alters their morphology and has functional consequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>MSCs of P30 and P100 were no longer able to differentiate into the osteogenic lineage and the ability to differentiate into the adipogenic lineage was markedly decreased. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with several other studies showing a reduced differentiation potential in human and murine MSCs upon in vitro aging [35]–[38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>The mRNA expression analysis revealed a decreased expression of genes involved in Wnt and Tgf-β/Bmp signaling upon long term culture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>The Wnt pathway is clearly required throughout osteogenesis and substantial elevated Wnt/β-catenin signaling triggers the differentiation of MSCs into the osteogenic lineage [39]–[42]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>A pivotal role of Bmp signaling is the induction of bone and cartilage formation [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>BMPs induce the differentiation of mesenchymal cells and also enhance the function of osteoblasts (matrix synthesis) [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>Some studies have pointed out that BMP signaling is also required for adipogenic differentiation of mesenchymal precursor cells [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we observed decreased adipogenic differentiation potentials of long-term cultivated MSCs and a down-regulation of genes involved in the PPARγ pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>The PPARγ pathway positively regulates the adipocytic differentiation of MSCs and intracellular accumulation of lipids by modulating genes involved in their uptake and metabolism [45]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>Notably, the BMP- as well as dexamethasone induced osteogenic differentiation was impaired in long-term cultivated MSCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>Also others have reported that a decreased differentiation potential upon dexamethasone-induced osteogenic differentiation is associated with altered Bmp-receptor mRNA expression [44]–[46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>This observation emphasizes the important role of down-regulated BMP signaling for the diminished differentiation potential of in vitro aged MSCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>Results from several studies have led to the assumption that the BMP pathway cooperates with other pathways, especially the canonical Wnt-signaling [46]–[48], to drive osteogenic differentiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>For example, the knock-out of the Wnt/ß-catenin antagonist Axin2 leads to enhanced nuclear accumulation of ß-catenin and increased levels of BMP2, BMP6 and phosphor-Smad, which further promotes osteogenic differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells and enhances bone formation in vitro and in vivo, respectively [49], [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>In both studies, the effect of the Axin2 knockout on BMP-signaling and osteogenic differentiation could be reversed by ß-catenin inactivation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Collectively, there is growing evidence suggesting that osteogenic differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells is highly dependent on the cross talk between Wnt and BMP signaling [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>Moreover, aMSCs and yMSCs exhibit exclusive expression of several genes belonging to the Notch signaling pathway upon in vitro aging. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>The Notch signaling pathway is known to suppress osteogenic differentiation and markedly decreases trabecular bone mass in adolescent mice [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>Thus, the observed alterations in Tgf/Bmp-, Wnt-, Pparγ-, Mapk- and Notch signaling pathway might act together and lead to the loss of differentiation ability after long-term culture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>Altogether, transcriptomes of in vitro aged aMSCs and yMSCs are clearly distinct from primary MSCs (approx. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>85% correlation); therefore a complete loss of progenitor characteristic with long-term cultivation is reasonable to expect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, long-term survival of MSCs in culture is achieved at the cost of differentiation potential. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in vitro cell culture conditions favor expansion of cells with high proliferation potential rather than those with high differentiation potential. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>For instance, recently we and others have shown that chronological aging has a significant impact on cell migration, cytoskeleton organization and actin turn-over [10], [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>As MSCs for each therapeutic approach crucially rely on proper migration towards stimuli for functional engraftment, we analyzed aMSCs and yMSCs for this aspect in more detail. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>Random (undirected) migration potential of MSCs in our study was affected by both in vitro aging status and age of donor animals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>Cellular migration, which requires coordinated contact to the extracellular substrate followed by detachment, strongly depends on local cytoskeleton organization and actin turn-over [53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>The impact of local actin organization for migration is accented by the importance of lamellipodia, fillopodia and focal complex formation for cellular migration [54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>In line with the reduced MSC migration potential upon in vitro and chronological aging, diminished expression of genes associated with focal adhesion and actin cytoskeleton organization was observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>Differential gene regulation was more prominent between primary and long-term cultivated cells than between aMSCs and yMSCs of the same passage as reflected by a higher number of affected genes, higher degree of differential expression as well as lower p-values. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>By immunofluorescence analysis, we demonstrated that during long-term cultivation size of aMSCs and yMSCs as well as their filopodia and lamellipodia number decreases, while their cell roundness increases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, with increasing passage number we observed a donor-age independent decline in mRNA expression of specific genes subsets encoding cytoskeletal and focal adhesion proteins such as integrins, alpha-actinins, actin related protein 2/3 complex, Rho-associated coiled-coil forming kinases (ROCK), cofilin, and profilin. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>Although undirected transmigration rather than chemotaxis was investigated, it needs to be highlighted that we further observed a down-regulation of mRNAs of several chemokines, cytokines and their receptors during chronological and in vitro aging, e.g. stromal cell-derived factor 1 (Sdf-1) and its receptor (Cxcr4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>On molecular level, it is assumed that specific chemokines and their receptors play a critical role to direct MSCs to their desired site of action. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>Studies investigating skeletal repair and systemic skeletal disorders in animal models showed that CXCR4 and SDF-1 recruit MSCs to the fracture site and prevent bone loss [55]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>Transcriptome analysis revealed a passage-dependent decline in the expression of mRNA associated with mitochondria, oxidative phosphorylation, glutathione metabolism, and antioxidant defense. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>These expression changes were accompanied by altered mitochondria morphology, reduced antioxidant capacity, increased ROS levels, enhanced ΔΨms, and diminished intracellular ATP concentrations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>Dysfunctional mitochondria, which are a natural source of free radicals and ROS, lead to increased intracellular ROS concentration, impaired ATP production and causes stress-induced senescence in normal somatic cells as well as in MSCs [56]–[58]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>This together suggests that the higher expression of senescence markers in long-term cultured MSCs may be caused by increased intracellular stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>In human ESCs and iPSCs alterations in mitochondrial proliferation and development were associated with loss of pluripotency [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>ESCs and iPSCs that demonstrate reduced mitochondrial number and activity suppress the mitochondrial/oxidative stress pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>Moreover, iPSCs exhibit alterations of senescence-related p53 signaling pathway compared to their differentiated and subsequently transformed cellular origin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, long-term cultured hESCs are characterized by dysfunctional mitochondria potentially compromising their long-term pluripotency [59]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>Similar to our observations, the same study associated an elevated mitochondria network volume with increased ΔΨm and ROS levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>These changes were attributed to a diminished removal of damaged mitochondria and/or fusion of existing mitochondria in order to compensate for mitochondrial dysfunction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>Although chronological aging also affects MSCs antioxidant capacity and glutathione metabolism, we find no difference in the basal ROS levels comparing aMSCs and yMSCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>This observation is in line with other studies demonstrating unaffected ROS production in cells from aged and young adult rats [60]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>Thus, our findings suggest that increased intracellular oxidative stress could be the basis for the progressive functional decline of aMSCs and yMSCs during long-term in vitro culture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>Mitochondrial dysfunction marked by increased ROS concentrations may lead to DNA and protein damage, which in turn might activates p53 signaling increasing the amount of senescent and dysfunctional cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>These detrimental effects seem to occur independently of the donor age during in vitro expansion and support the idea that chronological and in vitro aging are distinct processes. </plain></SENT>
