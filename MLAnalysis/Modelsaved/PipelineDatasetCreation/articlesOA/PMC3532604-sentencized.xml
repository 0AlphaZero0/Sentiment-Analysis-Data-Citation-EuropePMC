<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Proximal symphalangism (SYM1: MIM #185800) (1) is known as an autosomal dominant disorder with high penetrance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The most common clinical features are the immobility of the proximal interphalangia (PIP) joints of the hands and toes, and congenital conductive hearing loss due to stapes ankylosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Multiple synostosis syndrome (SYNS1: MIM#186500) (1) is characterized by a more severe phenotype of the proximal symphalangism, such as progressive and expanded bony fusion of joints and unique facial manifestations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In addition, mutations in NOG have been identified in Tarsal–Carpal Coalition syndrome (TCC: MIM#186570) (2), stapes ankylosis with broad thumb and toes (MIM#184460) (Teunissen and Cremer syndrome) (3), and Brachydactyly type B2 (BDB2: MIM#611377) (4). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Otosclerosis (MIM#166800) is known as the single most common cause of progressive conductive hearing loss, characterized by abnormal bone remodeling in the otic capsule. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Although there are a small number of familial cases that are likely to be monogenic, the majority of cases are sporadic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A series of studies has suggested that this condition involves both genetic and environmental factors (5). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Typical otosclerosis was included in this study because it is an interesting question as to whether some of the typical otosclerosis is a continuum of a category of disease caused by NOG mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>We thought this may be true because (i) within SYM1, NOG mutations were found in patients with minor skeletal anomalies without symphalangism (3), and (ii) stapes ankylosis is an important phenotype of the animal model for NOG+/− mice (6). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>To date, no detailed survey was available for NOG mutations in the stapes ankylosis patients with symphalangism in Asian populations. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>One mutation was a nonsense mutation (C215X), leading to a truncated protein, and was likely to be a pathologic mutation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>The other two mutations are also likely to be pathologic rather than functionally neutral polymorphic changes because: (i) none were found in any of the controls, (ii) the alignment of NOG sequences from human, mouse, chicken, Xenopus laevis and zebrafish showed that C155 and C184 are well-conserved amino acids in all species (data not shown), and (iii) all affected subjects showed similar phenotypes. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Therefore, surgical outcome should be carefully evaluated after long-term observation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Careful explanation of possible limitations of surgical treatment and alternative treatment options such as a bone-anchored hearing aid may be appropriate for such patients with this genetic background. </plain></SENT>
