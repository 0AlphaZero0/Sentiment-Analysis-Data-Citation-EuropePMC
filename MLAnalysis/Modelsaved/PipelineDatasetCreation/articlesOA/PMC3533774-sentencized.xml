</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>So far, only a handful of studies have been published that might give an indication of the in vivo function of peroxidasins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Focusing on the enzymatic domain only, one could speculate about similar biological roles as reported for the closely related and homologous chordata peroxidases including MPO, EPO, and LPO. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>The latter are involved in innate immune-defense reactions against invading pathogens and are stored in high concentration in granules of neutrophilic (MPO) or eosinophilic leukocytes (EPO) that are recruited to sites of pathogen invasion and inflammation [31] [32], whereas secreted lactoperoxidase acts as extracellular bactericidal agent in exocrine secretions [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>These peroxidases catalyze the production of hypohalous acids or hypothiocyanate from H2O2 and (pseudo-) halide anions, but also act as efficient one-electron oxidants [2]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Another physiological role of chordata peroxidases is cell adhesion and formation of extracellular matrix (ECM). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>It has been demonstrated that the extracellular oxidants generated by cationic mammalian peroxidases (e.g., MPO) can have both damaging and protective effects on the ECM, including inactivation of metalloproteinases [34] [35] and formation of dityrosine crosslinks [36]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Among peroxidase-domain containing proteins of the same superfamily, also peroxinectins (subfamily 3 of the peroxidase-cyclooxygenase superfamily) might give some indications about the functionality of peroxidasins, although from this subfamily (that has no vertebrate representative) only very few reports can be found in the literature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>These metalloenzymes seem to be involved in the promotion of cell–ECM adhesion via their integrin-binding motifs [37]. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Regarding the overall structure and size as well as domain assembly, peroxidasins are the most complex representatives of peroxidase-domain-containing enzymes of the peroxidase-cyclooxygenase superfamily. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis clearly suggests an enzymatic functionality similar to LPO and EPO (except in short peroxidasins and group Pxd2 of Clade 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>The motifs typical of extracellular proteins (Igs, LRRs, and VWC) might contribute to association with ECM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Both the roles in innate immune defense and extracellular matrix consolidation are often addressed in various contexts in the literature. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>As already mentioned, the first peroxidasin was identified in 1994 in Drosophila melanogaster (Clade 3 peroxidasins; Fig. 2) and has shown to be associated with the function of insect hemocytes and plasmatocytes [3] [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Similar to neutrophils, hemocytes are migratory cells that phagocytose foreign and dead cells and deposit ECM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Peroxidasin expression in Drosophila is widely used as a molecular marker for the early hemocyte lineage [39], and hemocytes are crucial for a morphogenetic event known as condensation of the ventral nerve cord (VNC). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>If hemocyte migration is blocked, deposition of ECM components, including peroxidasin and type IV collagen, does not occur, leading to failure of ventral nerve cord condensation [40]. Drosophila peroxidasin was reported to be a homotrimer that catalyzes H2O2-mediated tyrosine and iodide oxidation [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>The second invertebrate model organism in which the in vivo role of peroxidasin was studied is Caenorhabditis elegans [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Two orthologs are found in C. elegans (CelPxd01 and CelPxd02; Fig. 2) with apparently antagonistic functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>CelPxd02 was identified upon screening for mutants defective in embryonic worm development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>It was found to be essential for specific stages of morphogenesis and epidermal muscle attachment as well as postembryonically for basement membrane integrity [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>The peroxidase activity (which – based on sequence analysis – should be LPO-like) was shown to be responsible for these developmental roles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>In adult worms, loss of CelPxd02 promotes regrowth of axons after injury, providing evidence that C. elegans extracellular matrix can play an inhibitory role in axon regeneration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>By contrast, loss of CelPxd01 did not cause developmental effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Moreover, CelPxd02 mutant phenotypes were suppressed by loss of function of CelPxd01 and exacerbated by its overexpression, suggesting antagonistic roles. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>The first study on a (non-mammalian) vertebrate peroxidasin was performed on group 1 peroxidasin (Fig. 3) from Xenopus tropicalis in 2005 [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>This representative is expressed in several distinct tissues during early development, including the neural tube and the tail-forming region, and has also a role in modifying extracellular matrix components necessary in morphogenesis, again suggesting a role of the peroxidase domain in catalyzing one-electron oxidation reactions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Investigations on human peroxidasins started in 1999 [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>It was demonstrated that besides the full-length mRNA of hsPxd01, also a shorter 4.5 kb mRNA version occurs in human colon EB1 cancer cells undergoing p53-dependent apoptosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Characterization of the smaller mRNA showed that the N-terminal part of hsPxd01 including the signal peptide was not present, whereas the C-terminal portion including the peroxidase domain was present. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>The authors hypothesized that the protein missing a signal sequence would accumulate in the cytoplasm, and since the peroxidase domain is intact, it could potentially increase the cellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are powerful inducers of apoptosis by inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Based on the knowledge of catalysis of homologous mammalian peroxidases [2], the effect on p53 could be mediated by hypohalous acids or hypothiocyanate released from peroxidasin rather than by activated oxygen species, since peroxidases consume H2O2 and do not release O2•− at reasonable rates. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Finally, the cloning of human and mice peroxidasins and initial characterization of hsPxd01 were reported [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Heme-containing hsPxd01was recombinantly expressed in HEK cells, and the prosthetic group of hsPxd01 was shown to be covalently attached to the protein via two ester bonds very similar to LPO or EPO [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>The protein was shown to exhibit both peroxidase activity (tetramethylbenzidine oxidation) as well as halogenation activity (two-electron oxidation of Cl−). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>However, the reported activities were very low compared to mammalian peroxidases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>The finding of chlorination activity at neutral pH, which so far was only attributed to MPO, is peculiar, since hsPxd01 cannot form the MPO-typical (e− withdrawing) sulfonium-ion linkage and thus this reactivity must be addressed in future biochemical studies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Based on its halogenation activity and localization, the role of hsPxd01 in low-density lipoprotein oxidation and endothelial cell apoptosis was investigated [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>It was demonstrated that expression of hsPxd01 in endothelial cells correlates with LDL oxidation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Activity of hsPxd01 was shown to be dependent on NADPH-oxidase activity, which initially forms O2•− that dismutates to H2O2 necessary to initiate both peroxidase and halogenation activity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Peterfi et al. [14] demonstrated the secretion of human hsPxd01 as well as the formation of peroxidasin-containing, fibril-like structures by differentiated myofibroblasts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Since myofibroblasts appear during wound healing, it is tempting to speculate that the peroxidase domain functions in an antimicrobial manner, whereas the other domains could participate in the ECM formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Stabilization of the ECM could also be achieved by the enzymatic formation of dityrosine crosslinks. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>In another study [18], homozygous mutations in the gene encoding hsPxd01were associated with a spectrum of ocular anterior segment dysgenesis phenotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Although the precise effect of these mutations is unknown, the pathogenic impact is obvious. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Finally, it was demonstrated that hsPxd01 is also expressed in various cancer cells, including breast cancer, melanoma, colon cancer, and metastatic gilomas [8] [11] [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Hence, hsPxd01 seems to be a signature gene of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) [12], an enzyme associated with tumor angiogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>A loss of the adhesion promoting effect of HO-1 in hsPxd01-silenced cells was observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>This suggests also a role of hsPxd01 in cell adhesion and invasion as well as in the transition of benign tumors to invasive and malignant cancers [12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Summing up, peroxidasins are multidomain heme peroxidases with a substrate spectrum similar to mammalian peroxidases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Based on sequence analysis and reported biochemical data, they perform one-electron oxidation reactions including tyrosine oxidation as well as two-electron oxidation reactions of (pseudo-) halides. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Hypochlorous acid formation is questionable and must be addressed in future investigations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>In any case, physiological studies have shown that the enzymatic domain is essential for the in vivo activity and might contribute to extracellular matrix consolidation as well as antimicrobial defense. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>The additional domains (Igs, LRRs, and VWC) are typical for extracellular proteins and may help in targeting the peroxidase to its site of action. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>However, a distinct function of the individual domains and their relation to the reported in vivo roles has not been demonstrated so far. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Clearly, more detailed biochemical and biophysical studies as well as the elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of peroxidasins are necessary. </plain></SENT>
