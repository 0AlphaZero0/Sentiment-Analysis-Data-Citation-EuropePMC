Over-expression of FSHD region gene 1 (<italic>FRG1</italic>) in mice, frogs, and worms perturbs muscle development and causes FSHD&#8211;like phenotypes. <italic>FRG1</italic> has been implicated in splicing, and we asked how splicing might be involved in FSHD by conducting a genome-wide analysis in <italic>FRG1</italic> mice. We find that splicing perturbations parallel the responses of different muscles to <italic>FRG1</italic> over-expression and disease progression. Interestingly, binding sites for the Rbfox family of splicing factors are over-represented in a subset of <italic>FRG1</italic>-affected splicing events. <italic>Rbfox1</italic> knockdown, over-expression, and RNA-IP confirm that these are direct Rbfox1 targets. We find that FRG1 is associated to the <italic>Rbfox1</italic> RNA and decreases its stability. Consistent with this, <italic>Rbfox1</italic> expression is down-regulated in mice and cells over-expressing <italic>FRG1</italic> as well as in FSHD patients. Among the genes affected is <italic>Calpain 3</italic>, which is mutated in limb girdle muscular dystrophy, a disease phenotypically similar to FSHD. In <italic>FRG1</italic> mice and FSHD patients, the <italic>Calpain 3</italic> isoform lacking exon 6 (<italic>Capn3 E6&#8211;</italic>) is increased. Finally, <italic>Rbfox1</italic> knockdown and over-expression of <italic>Capn3 E6-</italic> inhibit muscle differentiation. Collectively, our results suggest that a component of FSHD pathogenesis may arise by over-expression of <italic>FRG1</italic>, reducing <italic>Rbfox1</italic> levels and leading to aberrant expression of an altered Calpain 3 protein through dysregulated splicing.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Alternative splicing is a major contributor to the complexity of human cells, and its disruption can lead to a wide range of human disorders. FSHD is one of the most important muscle diseases. While muscle differentiation defects have been widely reported in the disease, the molecular mechanisms responsible are largely unknown. We found that expression of the alternative splicing factor <italic>Rbfox1</italic> is a direct FRG1 target, and its expression decreased in the muscles of a mouse model of FSHD and FSHD patients. Moreover, alternative splicing of <italic>Calpain 3</italic>, encoding for a protease involved in muscle differentiation, is regulated by Rbfox1 and is altered in the muscles of the mouse model of FSHD and FSHD patients. Interestingly, we found that Rbfox1 is required for muscle differentiation and that this activity is likely mediated by <italic>Calpain 3</italic> alternative splicing. Hence, our results suggest that decreased expression of <italic>Rbfox1</italic> and aberrant <italic>Calpain 3</italic> splicing contribute to the muscle differentiation defects of FSHD patients.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Support for the Gabellini Laboratory came from the European Research Council (ERC StG 204279, ncRNAs-Splicing-FSHD, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://erc.europa.eu">http://erc.europa.eu</ext-link>), the Italian Epigenomics Flagship Project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.epigen.it">http://www.epigen.it</ext-link>), the Italian Ministry of Health (GRO8-21, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.salute.gov.it">http://www.salute.gov.it</ext-link>), and the FSHD Global Research Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fshdglobal.org">http://www.fshdglobal.org</ext-link>).

So far, few genes have been experimentally validated as Rbfox family targets in muscle.

To investigate the molecular connections between <italic>FRG1</italic> over-expression and the impairment of muscle development and function, we took a genome-wide approach.

To identify changes that occur differently in muscles differentially affected in FSHD, we compared RNA extracted from <italic>vastus lateralis</italic> (highly affected) and <italic>biceps brachii</italic> (mildly affected) muscles of three <italic>FRG1</italic> mice and control littermates <xref rid="pgen.1003186-Gabellini2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. To follow disease progression, we analyzed 4-week-old animals (no signs of muscular dystrophy) and 13-week-old mice (fully developed muscular dystrophy) <xref rid="pgen.1003186-Gabellini2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The full results for genes investigated at transcriptional and splicing levels are displayed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003186.s009">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003186.s010">S2</xref>, respectively.</p><p>We identified 440 genes whose expression changes more than 2 fold (q&lt;0.05) in at least one of the four experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003186.s011">Table S3a</xref>). The effect of <italic>FRG1</italic> over-expression was very coherent among the four sets of samples. Indeed, all genes that changed did so in the same direction in every sample in which they changed. Upon hierarchical clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003186-g001">Figure 1</xref>), two groups of genes, those down-regulated and those up-regulated upon <italic>FRG1</italic> over-expression were clearly defined. No clear functional enrichment was observed upon GO analysis of the down-regulated genes, although there were clear signs of altered muscle development (see below). In contrast, up-regulated genes showed strong enrichment for inflammation and immune response genes (<italic>e.g.</italic> GO:0002376 P&#8202;=&#8202;3.40E-05), as well as enrichment for contractile proteins. To directly assess the presence of an inflammatory infiltrate, we performed a specific histological staining using antibodies against the pan-hematopoietic marker CD45 and a quantitative analysis of CD45 positive cells by FACS. We found no evidence of inflammation in 4-week-old FRG1 mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003186.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Hence, these results suggest that the muscle fibers are the source of the up-regulation of inflammatory genes identified by our microarray analyses performed in 4-week-old FRG1 mice. Among the genes affected by <italic>FRG1</italic> over-expression were several whose responses indicated developmental perturbations. The mRNA of <italic>Myostatin</italic>, an inhibitor of muscle development <xref rid="pgen.1003186-Walsh1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, was strongly down-regulated (7&#8211;10 fold). On the contrary, the mRNA of <italic>Myogenin</italic>, a promoter of muscle cell development <xref rid="pgen.1003186-Berkes1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, was strongly up regulated (3&#8211;7 fold). The mRNA of <italic>Nos1</italic>, a regulator of myogenic stem cells activation and differentiation frequently affected in muscular dystrophy <xref rid="pgen.1003186-FinangerHedderick1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, was down-regulated primarily in <italic>vastus</italic> (3 fold).

For example, we noted increased inclusion of a 54 nucleotide exon in the mRNA for splicing factor Mbnl2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003186-g003">Figure 3</xref>), however the significance of this change for the activity of Mbnl2 is not known. Our current lack of knowledge in general for the functional implications of most alternative splicing modifications makes it difficult to interpret the global impact for the changes identified by the microarrays.</p><fig id="pgen-1003186-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1003186.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Alternative splicing changes in muscles of mice over-expressing FRG1.</title><p>Average linkage clustering was applied to alternative cassette exon splicing events with |Sepscore|&#8805;0.3 in at least one of the four comparison datasets (<italic>q</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;0).

For Dux4, a disruption of muscle development/differentiation through competition with Pax3/Pax7 myogenic regulators has been reported <xref rid="pgen.1003186-Bosnakovski1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. Our gene expression profiling of <italic>FRG1</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003186-g001">Figure 1</xref>) and the myogenic defects caused by <italic>FRG1</italic> over-expression in C2C12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003186-g010">Figure 10</xref>) indicate that FRG1 also disrupts muscle differentiation. Surprisingly, we found that a significant number of genes involved in inflammation and immune response are up-regulated in vastus muscles of <italic>FRG1</italic> mice at 4 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003186-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This is particularly intriguing since at this age <italic>FRG1</italic> mice do not show any evidence of infiltrate/inflammation by histology, immunohistochemistry with anti-CD45 (expressed on all hematopoietic cells, except erythrocytes and plasma cells) antibodies or by FACS analysis of single cell preparations from the muscle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003186.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Moreover, at 4 weeks of age there is no sign of necrosis or muscle regeneration in <italic>FRG1</italic> mice (i.e. no increase in centrally nucleated muscle fibers) (Xynos et al., <italic>submitted</italic>). Hence, it appears that the increased expression of inflammation and immune response genes originates directly from the muscle cells themselves. In classical muscular dystrophies, inflammation is secondary to the necrosis of muscle fibers. On the contrary, our results suggest that in <italic>FRG1</italic> mice recruitment of hematopoietic cells is induced by the muscle directly expressing inflammation and immune response genes, before the appearance of muscle fiber necrosis and regeneration. This is in agreement with the fact that in FSHD, unlike classical muscular dystrophies, the inflammation is not simply an event secondary to muscle wasting but takes place early on in the disease and could triggers the disease process <xref rid="pgen.1003186-Arahata1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgen.1003186-Munsat1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Based on this, it is tempting to speculate that a spurious activation of inflammation and immune response genes within muscle cells by FRG1 (and possibly DUX4, <xref rid="pgen.1003186-Geng1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>) could play a role in FSHD onset and progression.</p><p>While the specific function of FRG1 is still unknown, an increasing body of evidence suggests a role in alternative splicing regulation <xref rid="pgen.1003186-Gabellini2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003186-Bessonov1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgen.1003186-Jurica1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003186-Makarov1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003186-Rappsilber1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In this study, we investigated this by a genome-wide accounting of alternative splicing events affected by <italic>FRG1</italic> over-expression. In both <italic>FRG1</italic> mice and in FSHD patients, different muscles are affected differentially, the disease worsens with time <xref rid="pgen.1003186-Gabellini2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, and the splicing profiles of differentially affected muscles of <italic>FRG1</italic> mice at different ages correlates with the severity of the disease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003186.s011">Table S3b</xref>). Importantly, most of these splicing alterations are already evident in pre-symptomatic <italic>FRG1</italic> mice, suggesting that they are related to disease onset and early progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003186-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Moreover, comparisons with the splicing profile of the mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy strongly indicate that the identified splicing changes are specific for the FSHD model rather than as a signature of diseased muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003186-g005">Figure 5a</xref>). Finally, most of the splicing alterations also occur in C2C12 muscle cells over-expressing <italic>FRG1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003186-g005">Figure 5b</xref>), indicating a fundamental cellular response rather than a complex and secondary tissue effect. Collectively, these data identify a large set of splicing alterations that are a primary consequence of <italic>FRG1</italic> over-expression and are involved in disease onset.</p><p>Our results suggest that the exons identified by the splicing-sensitive arrays are not direct FRG1 targets and that FRG1 function at least in part by regulating the expression of the splicing factor Rbfox1 at post-transcriptional level. We found that the Rbfox1 recognition sequence is over-represented in the alternative splicing events altered in <italic>FRG1</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003186-g004">Figure 4</xref>) and by <italic>Rbfox1</italic> knockdown, over-expression and RIP experiments we confirmed that these are direct Rbfox1 targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003186-g008">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003186.s007">Figure S7</xref>). <italic>Rbfox1</italic> expression is down-regulated in <italic>FRG1</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003186-g006">Figure 6a</xref>), C2C12 cells over-expressing <italic>FRG1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003186-g006">Figure 6c</xref>), and in FSHD patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003186-g006">Figure 6d</xref>). We also found that the level of <italic>Rbfox1</italic> down-regulation parallels the severity of the disease in different muscles of <italic>FRG1</italic> mice, while it is expressed at normal levels in the mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003186-g006">Figure 6b</xref>). Importantly, our results suggest that the <italic>FRG1</italic> over-expression down-regulates the expression of <italic>Rbfox1</italic> by decreasing the stability of its mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003186-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Collectively, these results support a role for altered <italic>Rbfox1</italic> expression in FSHD.
