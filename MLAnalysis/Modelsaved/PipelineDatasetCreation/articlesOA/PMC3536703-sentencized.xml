</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD, OMIM 158900), the third most common myopathy with an incidence of 1 in 15,000 in the human population [1], [2], is characterized by progressive wasting of a specific subset of skeletal muscles [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Myogenic defects in FSHD have been widely reported [5]–[11], but the molecular mechanism responsible for them is currently unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>While FSHD is primarily a disease of skeletal muscles, epilepsy, mental retardation and autism have also been described in severely affected FSHD infants [12]–[15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>FSHD is inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder but is caused by a peculiar molecular mutation [1], [16] involving deletion of tandemly repeated 3.3 kbp sequences, called D4Z4 [17]–[20], in the subtelomeric region of chromosome 4 (4q35). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The D4Z4 deletion causes a Polycomb/Trithorax epigenetic switch leading to increased expression of several 4q35 genes specifically in FSHD patients [21]–[23], offering an explanation for its dominant phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Since expression of multiple genes is affected, the molecular pathogenesis of FSHD has been challenging to untangle, and as yet no therapy is available for FSHD patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Among the genes up-regulated in FSHD, FRG1 (FSHD region gene 1) is a likely contributor to FSHD pathogenesis since it is required for normal muscle development [24] and its over-expression in mice, Xenopus and C. elegans causes an FSHD-like phenotype [24]–[27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The precise function of FRG1 is still unknown, but there is evidence for a role in RNA processing [25], [28]–[34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>For example, several studies reported association of FRG1 with the spliceosome [28], [30], [32], [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Moreover, FRG1 assumes a speckled nuclear distribution pattern characteristic of mammalian splicing factors [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Finally, altered splicing of the muscle-expressed genes MTMR1 and TNNT3 has been reported in FSHD [25]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Muscle tissues, like brain, are rich in their use of tissue-specific alternative splicing events to regulate gene expression and produce specialized protein isoforms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Many of these events display enrichment for putative binding sites for the evolutionary conserved, tissue-specific Rbfox family of alternative splicing regulators: Rbfox1 (Fox-1 or A2BP1), Rbfox2 (Fox-2 or Rbm9) and Rbfox3 (Fox-3 or NeuN) [35]. Rbfox1 is expressed in brain, skeletal muscle and heart [35]–[38], while Rbfox2 has a broader expression pattern, being detected in whole embryo, stem cells, hematopoietic cells and in adult brain, heart and ovary [35], [36], [39]–[42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Rbfox3 has been observed only in neurons [36], [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>So far, few genes have been experimentally validated as Rbfox family targets in muscle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we show that FRG1 over-expression in mouse muscle is associated with widespread alternative splicing perturbations that appear to delay or inhibit proper muscle development at a cellular level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>We show that FRG1 over-expression decrease Rbfox1 RNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In FRG1 mouse muscles, C2C12 myoblasts over-expressing FRG1, and in FSHD patients, down-regulation of Rbfox1 expression leads to altered splicing of Rbfox1-dependent muscle exons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>We further show that Rbfox1 is required for myogenesis and part of this requirement may involve correct regulation of Calpain 3 alternative splicing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Our results provide a molecular mechanism for myogenic defects in FSHD and identify possible therapeutic targets. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>A peculiar distribution of affected muscles and the progressive character of the disease are among the features shared between FSHD patients and FRG1 mice [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>To investigate the molecular connections between FRG1 over-expression and the impairment of muscle development and function, we took a genome-wide approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Since FRG1 is thought to function in pre-mRNA splicing [28], [30], [32], [33], we employed splicing-sensitive microarrays [44], [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>To identify changes that occur differently in muscles differentially affected in FSHD, we compared RNA extracted from vastus lateralis (highly affected) and biceps brachii (mildly affected) muscles of three FRG1 mice and control littermates [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>To follow disease progression, we analyzed 4-week-old animals (no signs of muscular dystrophy) and 13-week-old mice (fully developed muscular dystrophy) [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>The full results for genes investigated at transcriptional and splicing levels are displayed in Tables S1 and S2, respectively. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>We identified 440 genes whose expression changes more than 2 fold (q&lt;0.05) in at least one of the four experiments (Table S3a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The effect of FRG1 over-expression was very coherent among the four sets of samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Indeed, all genes that changed did so in the same direction in every sample in which they changed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Upon hierarchical clustering (Figure 1), two groups of genes, those down-regulated and those up-regulated upon FRG1 over-expression were clearly defined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>No clear functional enrichment was observed upon GO analysis of the down-regulated genes, although there were clear signs of altered muscle development (see below). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>In contrast, up-regulated genes showed strong enrichment for inflammation and immune response genes (e.g. GO:0002376 P = 3.40E-05), as well as enrichment for contractile proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>To directly assess the presence of an inflammatory infiltrate, we performed a specific histological staining using antibodies against the pan-hematopoietic marker CD45 and a quantitative analysis of CD45 positive cells by FACS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>We found no evidence of inflammation in 4-week-old FRG1 mice (Figure S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Hence, these results suggest that the muscle fibers are the source of the up-regulation of inflammatory genes identified by our microarray analyses performed in 4-week-old FRG1 mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Among the genes affected by FRG1 over-expression were several whose responses indicated developmental perturbations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>The mRNA of Myostatin, an inhibitor of muscle development [46], was strongly down-regulated (7–10 fold). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, the mRNA of Myogenin, a promoter of muscle cell development [47], was strongly up regulated (3–7 fold). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The mRNA of Nos1, a regulator of myogenic stem cells activation and differentiation frequently affected in muscular dystrophy [48], was down-regulated primarily in vastus (3 fold). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>We concluded that FRG1 overexpression has a profound effect on the muscle transcriptome, including induction of immune response and inflammatory genes, and alteration of proper muscle development. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Two 4q35 genes have been investigated as candidate FSHD genes, DUX4 and FRG1 [23], [55], [56]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Individually, each gene causes myopathic changes when over-expressed in muscle cells in vivo [25], [57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>For Dux4, a disruption of muscle development/differentiation through competition with Pax3/Pax7 myogenic regulators has been reported [58]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Our gene expression profiling of FRG1 mice (Figure 1) and the myogenic defects caused by FRG1 over-expression in C2C12 cells (Figure 10) indicate that FRG1 also disrupts muscle differentiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, we found that a significant number of genes involved in inflammation and immune response are up-regulated in vastus muscles of FRG1 mice at 4 weeks of age (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>This is particularly intriguing since at this age FRG1 mice do not show any evidence of infiltrate/inflammation by histology, immunohistochemistry with anti-CD45 (expressed on all hematopoietic cells, except erythrocytes and plasma cells) antibodies or by FACS analysis of single cell preparations from the muscle (Figure S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Moreover, at 4 weeks of age there is no sign of necrosis or muscle regeneration in FRG1 mice (i.e. no increase in centrally nucleated muscle fibers) (Xynos et al., submitted). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Hence, it appears that the increased expression of inflammation and immune response genes originates directly from the muscle cells themselves. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>In classical muscular dystrophies, inflammation is secondary to the necrosis of muscle fibers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, our results suggest that in FRG1 mice recruitment of hematopoietic cells is induced by the muscle directly expressing inflammation and immune response genes, before the appearance of muscle fiber necrosis and regeneration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>This is in agreement with the fact that in FSHD, unlike classical muscular dystrophies, the inflammation is not simply an event secondary to muscle wasting but takes place early on in the disease and could triggers the disease process [59]–[62]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Based on this, it is tempting to speculate that a spurious activation of inflammation and immune response genes within muscle cells by FRG1 (and possibly DUX4, [63]) could play a role in FSHD onset and progression. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>While the specific function of FRG1 is still unknown, an increasing body of evidence suggests a role in alternative splicing regulation [25], [28]–[30], [32], [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated this by a genome-wide accounting of alternative splicing events affected by FRG1 over-expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>In both FRG1 mice and in FSHD patients, different muscles are affected differentially, the disease worsens with time [25], and the splicing profiles of differentially affected muscles of FRG1 mice at different ages correlates with the severity of the disease (Table S3b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Importantly, most of these splicing alterations are already evident in pre-symptomatic FRG1 mice, suggesting that they are related to disease onset and early progression (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Moreover, comparisons with the splicing profile of the mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy strongly indicate that the identified splicing changes are specific for the FSHD model rather than as a signature of diseased muscle (Figure 5a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Finally, most of the splicing alterations also occur in C2C12 muscle cells over-expressing FRG1 (Figure 5b), indicating a fundamental cellular response rather than a complex and secondary tissue effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these data identify a large set of splicing alterations that are a primary consequence of FRG1 over-expression and are involved in disease onset. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the exons identified by the splicing-sensitive arrays are not direct FRG1 targets and that FRG1 function at least in part by regulating the expression of the splicing factor Rbfox1 at post-transcriptional level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>We found that the Rbfox1 recognition sequence is over-represented in the alternative splicing events altered in FRG1 mice (Figure 4) and by Rbfox1 knockdown, over-expression and RIP experiments we confirmed that these are direct Rbfox1 targets (Figure 8 and Figure S7). Rbfox1 expression is down-regulated in FRG1 mice (Figure 6a), C2C12 cells over-expressing FRG1 (Figure 6c), and in FSHD patients (Figure 6d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>We also found that the level of Rbfox1 down-regulation parallels the severity of the disease in different muscles of FRG1 mice, while it is expressed at normal levels in the mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Figure 6b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>Importantly, our results suggest that the FRG1 over-expression down-regulates the expression of Rbfox1 by decreasing the stability of its mRNA (Figure 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these results support a role for altered Rbfox1 expression in FSHD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>While FSHD is primarily a disease of the skeletal muscle, epilepsy, mental retardation and autism have also been described in severely affected patients [12]–[15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Since the same symptoms are caused by Rbfox1 mutation or down-regulation [64]–[73], it is tempting to speculate that Rbfox1 down-regulation could be involved in the neurological manifestations of FSHD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Among the transcripts displaying FRG1 and Rbfox1 dependent aberrant splicing, we focused on Capn3, as mutations in Capn3 cause LGMD2A [49], and FSHD and LGMD share clinical features [74], [75]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>The clinical spectrum of FSHD can include prominent pelvic girdle weakness and, in some individuals, only minimal facial muscle involvement, leading to confusion in diagnosis [74]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Indeed, it has been reported that ∼8% of patients with a diagnosis of LGMD may in fact have FSHD [75]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>We found that FRG1 over-expression is associated with increased expression of a Capn3 splicing isoform lacking exon 6 (Capn3 E6-) in both FRG1 mice and FSHD patients (Figure 2 and Figure 9b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, transgenic mice over-expressing Capn3 E6- display phenotypic similarities to FRG1 mice [25], [54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>The fact that Capn3 E6- is already increased in pre-symptomatic FRG1 mice (Figure 2b and Figure 9a) and that its expression is normal in the mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Figure S4) suggests that altered Capn3 splicing is a primary consequence of FRG1 overexpression and is not simply secondary to muscle wasting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>This is confirmed by the fact that FRG1 over-expression in tissue culture is sufficient to drive increased Capn3E6- expression (Figure 5b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, we found that Capn3 E6- expression correlates with the degree of muscular dystrophy in different muscles and at different ages (Figure 2 and Figure 3) suggesting that altered Capn3 E6- could explain the differential susceptibility of different muscles to FRG1 over-expression and the progression of the disease over time. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>Capn3 belongs to the Calpain family of non-lysosomal, soluble cytosolic calcium-dependent proteases [76]. Capn3 is highly expressed in the skeletal muscle and numerous data suggest a role for Capn3 in the maintenance of muscle integrity and function [76]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Capn3 presents three insertion sequences that differentiate it from all other calpains and might contribute to its muscle-specific functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>These regions, called NS, IS1, and IS2 are encoded by exons characterized by developmentally regulated alternative splicing [77]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Exon 6 encodes for IS1, a Capn3 domain involved in auto-inhibitory function through autolytic cleavage [76]. Capn3 E6-, encoding the isoform of Capn3 lacking IS1, is not expressed in healthy adult muscle and appears to be primarily important during development and muscle regeneration [76]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, Capn3 E6- over-expression in adult muscle results in muscles that appear developmentally abnormal, underlining the importance of this alternative splicing event [54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that alternative splicing isoforms of Capn3 could serve specific roles in regulating muscle differentiation [54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, we found that Capn3 E6- over-expression in C2C12 muscle cells is sufficient to cause a differentiation defect similar to FRG1 over-expression or Rbfox1 down-regulation (Figure 10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Since myogenic defects have been reported in FSHD [5]–[11], it is tempting to speculate that altered Capn3 splicing could contribute to the pathogenesis of FSHD. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our studies have provided insight on the molecular pathogenesis of one of the most important muscle diseases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our findings advance the understanding of the alternative splicing regulation of myogenic differentiation and identify possible therapeutic targets for the treatment of FSHD. </plain></SENT>
