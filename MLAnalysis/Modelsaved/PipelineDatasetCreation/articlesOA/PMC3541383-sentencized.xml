</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A major challenge in developing a protective vaccine for HIV-1 is the identification of an immunogen that can elicit potent and broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies to primary isolates [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Efforts to identify and characterize monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from humans have provided important insights into the targets and molecular mechanisms of HIV-1 neutralization [3]–[13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, using this knowledge to rationally develop an effective vaccine continues to be difficult [14], thus highlighting the need for empirical approaches in HIV-1 vaccine research. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The envelope glycoprotein (Env) of HIV-1 forms functional spikes that mediate virus entry into host cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Env engages the cellular receptor, CD4, which enhances the ability of Env to bind to the coreceptor, CCR5 or CXCR4 [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>As a gp160 precursor, Env forms trimers and is extensively modified with high mannose residues at potential N-glycosylation sites (PNGS) [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The trimer is cleaved by furin leaving the extracellular gp120 and transmembrane gp41 subunits loosely associated and subject to further processing to display more complex glycans [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Glycosylation of native Env is rich in N-linked high-mannose residues, but also involves complex modified sugars and O-linked glycans [18]–[23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Env biosynthesis [24], HIV-1 infectivity [25], pathogenesis [26], and escape from humoral immunity [16], [27], [28] are all affected by glycosylation as are the antigenic and immunogenic properties of Env [27], [29]–[36]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Eliciting neutralizing antibody to conserved epitopes on the gp120 subunit of native Env is extremely challenging. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Thus, the CD4-binding site (CD4BS) is a target of broadly neutralizing mAbs such as b12 [37] and VRC01 [7], [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>However, the CD4BS on native Env trimers is partially occluded by V1V2, V5 and/or proximal glycans [3], [8], [37]–[39], so many more CD4BS Abs including mAb b6 cannot neutralize primary isolates of HIV-1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>V1V2 and V3 contain highly conserved residues, main chain elements and glycans that are recognized by broadly neutralizing mAbs like PG9/PG16 and PGT128, respectively [9], [40]–[42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>However, V1V2 and V3 also contain highly variable residues that can shield the more conserved regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Some Abs to gp120 have only a limited capacity to neutralize because their epitopes are not fully revealed until receptor engagement, such as mAbs 17b [43] and X5 [44], [45] that target the bridging sheet of gp120, as well as mAbs 447-52D, 19b and F425-B4e8 (F425) that bind to the crown of V3 [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>One broadly neutralizing mAb, 2G12, appears to bind exclusively to a cluster of high-mannose residues on the outer domain of gp120 [47]–[49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>However, 2G12 has a unique domain-swapped topology and it is unclear whether such an antibody can be re-elicited by design [50]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Many forms of Env have been evaluated as candidate vaccines to HIV-1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Monomeric gp120 typically elicits antibodies that neutralize only sensitive or lab-adapted strains with V3 sequences similar to that of the immunogen [4], [51]–[53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Engineered gp120, gp140, or membrane-associated Env occasionally elicit neutralizing responses to V1 [54], V2 [55]–[57], variably exposed epitopes overlapping with receptor sites [58], [59], or other unidentified sites [51], [60], [61]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Virion-associated Env has elicited neutralizing antibodies of limited potency and breadth [62]–[65]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Attempts to elicit 2G12-like antibodies using synthetic glycoconjugates and hypermannosylated-yeast glycoproteins have shown that while the component glycans are immunogenic, the antibodies induced can neither neutralize primary virus nor block 2G12 binding to gp120 [21], [66]–[70]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that strong autologous neutralization of the primary isolate JR-CSF can be elicited by prime-boost immunization with gp120. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Because potent neutralization of resistant viruses such as JR-CSF [71] has not been readily achieved by immunization, understanding the neutralizing specificities elicited may assist in developing a prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>The PSVs produced in the presence of kif or in 293GnTI−/− cells showed increased sensitivity to all five rabbit sera but not to normal rabbit sera (data not shown) while also roughly preserving the rank order in serum potencies (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>In contrast, sensitivity to the CD4BS mAb b12 and to the high-mannose dependent mAb 2G12 [47], [48], [75] was less affected by virion production using kif or GnTI−/− cells (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>These latter results are largely consistent with previous data except that others had found 2G12 potency to be slightly more enhanced with kif-treatment than we observe with JR-CSF [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>The heterologous JR-FL PSV became markedly sensitive to the JR-CSF-specific rabbit sera when produced in kif-treated cells but not when produced in GnTI−/− cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>However, even with kif-treatment, JR-FL is still not as sensitive as JR-CSF and the rank-order in serum potency is different for the two isolates (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Thus, while it is possible that kif-modified PSV has become sensitive to specificities in the rabbit sera (e.g., b6-like antibodies) that are different from the autologous JR-CSF-specific ones, it is also possible that the accessibility on Env to the JR-CSF-specific antibodies is regulated at least in part by the presence (or absence) of hybrid or complex glycan. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>HIV-1 immunogens typically fail to elicit neutralizing antibody responses to panels of primary isolates [3], [90]–[92]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>However, such panels often give little information on the fine specificities of the elicited antibodies that can neutralize a particular isolate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used pseudoviruses carrying a number of variant Env proteins to investigate the specificity of rabbit sera that showed strong autologous activity against JR-CSF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the C3 and V5, C3 and V4, or V4 regions of Env and specific glycans are largely responsible for this neutralization activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Antibodies targeting regions in the outer domain of Env have been documented in other studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>The C3, V4, and V5 regions have recently been shown to participate in autologous neutralizing antibody responses that appear during early clade C HIV-1 infections [93], [94]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Binding antibodies to V4 or V5 have been experimentally elicited as evidenced by serum reactivity using immobilized peptides [63], [88], [89], [95], [96], but it is unknown if these are neutralizing antibodies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that neutralizing antibodies can be elicited to these epitopes on a primary isolate by experimental immunization. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Although JR-CSF is a primary isolate [82] that is relatively resistant to neutralization [71], we find that potent inhibition of a JR-CSF pseudovirus can be obtained when the humoral response is directed to C3 and V5, C3 and V4, or V4 regions located on the glycan-rich outer domain of gp120. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>There is no statistical difference in the autologous JR-CSF neutralization between the immunization protocols used for rabbits in Studies 32 and 41 (three DNA primes followed by one protein boost) versus Study 14 (two DNA primes followed by five protein boosts, data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Both protocols resulted in sera with IC50s against a JR-CSF pseudovirus of at least 103. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>We typically observe a wide range of IC50s against JR-CSF within a group of sera from rabbits immunized using the same conditions, but we do not understand why some rabbits elicit high titers while others show little response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>The strong neutralization of JR-CSF observed here using prime-boost immunization has not previously been described. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Rabbit serum 3844 was particularly strong and gave an IC50 of over 18,000 and 13,000 against JR-CSF when measured independently in two different systems (the PhenoSense and TZM-bl assays, respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>If the neutralizing antibody specificities in the undiluted rabbit serum were present at between 10–1,000 µg/ml [11], [97], these would have an IC50 of between 0.55–76 ng/ml, which is far lower than that of broadly neutralizing mAbs studied here. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>In other rabbit studies [88], [98], a prime-boost protocol elicited antisera that neutralized JR-FL in the TZM-bl assay with somewhat lower titers (i.e., up to 1∶160) but did not neutralize JR-CSF and were of limited breadth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>It is therefore possible to elicit potent neutralization against primary isolates as demonstrated here and elsewhere, and the development of a consistent breadth of neutralization is the major obstacle to a workable vaccine concept. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Overall, the neutralizing specificities of the rabbit sera are distinct from those of well-studied mAbs, CD4-IgG2, or a broadly neutralizing human plasma (Z23). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>However, use of the variant PSVs shows that some sera target similar regions of Env as mAbs or CD4-IgG2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>For example, PNGS mutations at N156, N197, N301, and N332 increased sensitivity to sera 3099, as well as to b6, CD4-IgG2, F425, and X5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>One possibility is that serum 3099 contains antibodies to the CD4BS with specificities similar to those of b6 or F425, as these antibodies can only neutralize when glycans are removed that would otherwise protect the CD4BS and V3, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>In support of this explanation is the observation that JR-FL N156Q (but not wild-type JR-FL) is hypersensitive to the rabbit sera as well as to b6 and F425. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>In contrast, sera 1252, 3835, and 3844 are highly active against wild-type JR-CSF but are not more potent against JR-CSF N156Q, suggesting that neutralizing antibodies directed to V3/CD4BS/CD4i are absent in these sera and/or that the C3/V4-, C3/V5- and V4-dependent antibodies dominate or mask the neutralizing activity of antibodies like F425, b6 or X5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Mutation of two glycans that comprise the 2G12 epitope (N386 and N392) also diminished the neutralizing activity of rabbit serum 3835, suggesting an overlap between the neutralizing epitopes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>We mapped the Env domains and PNGS that altered the activity of the rabbit sera or select mAbs onto the gp120 core structure (Figure S2C) including N386 and N392, which are involved in the activity of serum 3835 and 2G12. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Since the 2G12 site is preserved on outer domain constructs of gp120 and is distal to subunit interfaces, it is possible that antibodies that compete with 2G12 on monomeric gp120 would also bind to native trimers and neutralize HIV-1 [99]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>The potency of all five rabbit sera was enhanced by mutation of a PNGS at position 397. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Residue N397 follows the β18 strand in C3 just N-terminal to V4 of gp120 (Figure S2A and B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Thus, glycosylation at this residue appears able to at least partially occlude epitopes involving C3, V4 and V5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>The VRC01 epitope on the structural map is largely distinct from the regions targeted by rabbit sera; however, elements of C2, C3 and V5 could overlap between these neutralizing epitopes as well (Figure S2C) [8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>The rabbit sera interfere with binding of 2G12, VRC01, b12 and CD4-IgG2 to gp120 in competition ELISA experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>In particular, 2G12 is in a unique antibody competition class and no other immunized sera, and even very few HIV-1 patient sera, have been shown to block 2G12 binding to monomeric gp120 [66]–[70], [75], [89], [100], [101]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, several new “PGT” mAbs have recently been described with epitopes at the base of V3 that overlap the 2G12 site and show even greater breadth and potency of neutralization [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>The immunogenicity of glycans on the outer face of gp120 in the present immunization study is a significant milestone, and we suggest that competition studies using antisera against 2G12 and VRC01 can be of value for gauging progress towards eliciting similar or overlapping specificities. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>It is important to understand how sera from experimental immunizations of animals or humans can neutralize primary HIV-1 isolates in order to develop improved vaccines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>We have obtained some insight on the regions of gp120 that are targets of a neutralizing response to the primary isolate JR-CSF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Whether such autologous neutralizing specificities can be matured by specific immunization strategies into more cross-reactive antibodies remains an important and open question. </plain></SENT>
