However, phylogeographical studies are often biased towards lineages that are younger than the geological features of the landscapes they inhabit. A temporally deeper historical biogeography framework may be required to address episodes of biotic diversification associated with geologically older landscape changes. Signatures of such associations may be retained in the genomes of ecologically specialized (stenotopic) taxa with limited vagility. In the study presented here, genetic data from montane scorpions in the <italic>Vaejovis vorhiesi</italic> group, restricted to humid rocky habitats in mountains across southwestern North America, were used to explore the relationship between scorpion diversification and regional geological history.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Strong phylogeographical signal was evident within the <italic>vorhiesi</italic> group, with 27 geographically cohesive lineages inferred from a mitochondrial phylogeny. A time-calibrated multilocus species tree revealed a pattern of Miocene and Pliocene (the Neogene period) lineage diversification.

Diversification among these stenotopic scorpions appears to have occurred almost entirely within the Neogene period, and is temporally consistent with the dynamic geological history of the Basin and Range, and Colorado Plateau physiographical provinces.

Model fit was measured using AIC scores. The significance of the change in AIC scores (&#916;AICrc) between the best rate-constant and best rate-variable model was determined by creating a null distribution for &#916;AICrc. This was accomplished by simulating 1000 trees using yuleSim in LASER with the same number of nodes and same speciation rate estimated under the pure-birth model. Log likelihood and AIC values were calculated for three models (SPVAR, EXVAR, and BOTHVAR; described in <xref rid="pone.0052822-Rabosky3" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>) that permit differential extinction and speciation rates. In addition, lineage-through-time plots were generated to visualize the pattern of accumulation of log-lineages over time. Another set of analyses were performed on the mtDNA-only divergence date estimates from BEAST to assess the influence of additional genetic structure present within lineages that may have been excluded from the diversification rate analyses above. Eight additional divergences that occurred within six of the inferred geographical lineages (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0052822.s001">Fig. S1</xref>) were included for this dataset.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Genetic Data</title><p>Sequences were deposited in GenBank (JX909361&#8211;JX909616).
