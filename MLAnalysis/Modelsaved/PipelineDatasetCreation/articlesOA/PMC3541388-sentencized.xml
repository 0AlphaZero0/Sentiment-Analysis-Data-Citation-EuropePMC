</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The strength of the interplay between geological transformation and biotic diversificationâgeobiotic history [1]âis an old and contentious issue in biology [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>With the advent of molecular-based estimates of lineage relationships and ages, traditional dichotomies between views that posit either strong adherence to âEarth and life evolving togetherâ or âlife diversifying largely without dependence on Earth history eventsâ have been tempered by studies showing that species assemblages often exhibit a temporally wide range of idiosyncratic responses to Earth history events [3], [4], [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Although the age of lineages has become a fundamental datum for investigating relationships between Earth and biotic history, studies of diversification within the popular phylogeographical [6] paradigm have been biased towards relatively young lineages [7], [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Expansion of the temporal context of a study beyond the relatively recent timeframes encompassing phylogeography could capture a record of biotic diversification associated with geologically older landscape changes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Such changes may be retained in the genomes of ecologically specialized (stenotopic) taxa with limited vagility. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Owing to their antiquity, morphological, and ecological conservatism, scorpions are excellent candidates for investigating such deep geobiotic histories [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Derived from amphibious ancestors that lived more than 425 million years ago (Ma), scorpions represent an ancient radiation of terrestrial arthropods, earning the title âliving fossilsâ [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Their conserved morphology implies relative stasis in ecological requirements over time [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Many scorpions demonstrate limited vagility and a high degree of stenotopy such that the distributions of phylogenetically related taxa are often predictably restricted to a narrow range of stable habitats that may have persisted over millions of years [9], [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>As evidence, several evolutionary studies on scorpions have revealed patterns of deep species-level divergence and diversification during the Miocene and Pliocene [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The diversity and ecological specialization of North American scorpions [17], [18] makes them appropriate for exploring biogeographical patterns on the continent. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the historical diversification of montane scorpions in the Vaejovis vorhiesi group (Vaejovidae) was examined as part of a comparative approach aimed at reconstructing the paleohistory of highlands in southwestern North America [19], [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The vorhiesi group, comprising 12 described and several undescribed species, appears to be restricted to humid, rocky habitats in mixed pine-oak-juniper woodlands [21], [22] across their known distribution from central Utah southwards through Arizona and New Mexico to Sonora in northern Mexico (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Diversification in these scorpions appears to be constrained by habitat specialization, and divergence may have been promoted by allopatric speciation in isolated rocky highland habitats, as proposed for scorpion taxa in other parts of the world [9], [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>If ephemeral woodland corridors that developed during Pleistocene glacial periods and connected highland biota [20], [23] lacked suitable humid, rocky habitats, dispersal between adjacent mountain ranges inhabited by stenotopic scorpions in the vorhiesi group, would be limited. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>These scorpions may thus offer novel insights into the deeper geobiotic history of the highland landscapes of southwestern North America. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>A mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) dataset was generated from 63 samples of vorhiesi group scorpions and their relatives to explore phylogeographical structure, and a species tree reconstructed using multilocus data (mtDNA and two nuclear genes). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Geological processes that cumulatively acted to separate the Basin and Range province from the Colorado Plateau occurred during a period known as the mid-Miocene transition [53], [54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>This episode of geological activity, 24â12 Ma, probably created the landscape in which the vorhiesi group originated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>The transformation of an originally more continuous landscape to one of isolated mountain ranges associated with Basin and Range extension may have provided opportunities for rapid early diversification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>The largely unsupported basal divergences in the species tree that occurred around 18â13 Ma (Fig. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>It is difficult to resolve these specific relationships with the current dataset, and whether this represents a case of simultaneous divergence from a common ancestor (i.e., hard polytomy) or estimation uncertainty (i.e., soft polytomy) remains unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Regardless, it is clear that the early divergences within these scorpions occurred in rapid succession over a narrow window of time (Fig. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Following early diversification in the vorhiesi group, potentially linked with the mid-Miocene transition, the development of regional clades between about 12â7 Ma (Fig. 3) may have initiated in response to continued landscape deformation coincident with paleoclimatical change [55]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>This is unsurprising given their stenotopic habitat requirements [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Diversification within the vorhiesi group was probably driven by allopatry in isolated rocky highland habitats: ephemeral woodland corridors may have connected highland biota during the Pleistocene but lacked suitable humid, rocky habitats required by these scorpions for dispersal between adjacent mountain ranges. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>The persistence of separate lineages at small spatial scales suggests that a combination of ecological stenotopy and limited vagility make the vorhiesi group particularly valuable as indicators of geomorphological evolution in southwestern North America, as observed in other scorpion taxa elsewhere in the world [9], [11]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Given the restricted distributions and stenotopic requirements of vorhiesi group scorpions for insular montane habitats, this finding is consistent with studies suggesting that diversification rate slows as ecological opportunities diminish [52], [64], [65], [66], and that declining diversification rates may be caused by the saturation of geographical space [67]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>The decreased diversification rate of these scorpions is probably related to the dynamic geological history of southwestern North America previously outlined, which appears sufficient to have formed new habitats and dispersal routes, and to have isolated older habitats throughout the Neogene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Divergence times in the vorhiesi group suggest that these highland habitats were occupied and persisted throughout the Neogene and that, by the onset of Quaternary, few unoccupied habitats would have been available. </plain></SENT>
