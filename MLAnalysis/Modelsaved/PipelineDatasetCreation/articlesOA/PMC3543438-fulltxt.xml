Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), rs3077 near HLA-DPA1 region and rs9277535 near HLA-DPB1 region, have been shown to be associated with HBV persistence after acute HBV infection. However, little is known about the impact of these 2 SNPs on spontaneous HBsAg clearance in CHB patients. In this case-control study, a total of 100 male HBeAg-negative chronic HBV carriers who cleared HBsAg spontaneously (case group) and 100 age-matched HBeAg-negative male patients with persistent HBsAg positivity (control group) were enrolled. We investigated the relationship between these 2 SNPs and HBsAg clearance. There was a higher frequency of rs9277535 non-GG genotype in the case group (57% vs. 42%). Patients with rs9277535 non-GG genotype had a higher chance to clear HBsAg [Odds ratio (OR): 1.83, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04&#8764;3.21, P&#8202;=&#8202;0.034]. Compared to GG haplotype of rs3077 and rs9277535, GA haplotype had a higher chance of achieving spontaneous HBsAg loss (OR: 2.17, 95% CI: 1.14&#8764;4.16, P&#8202;=&#8202;0.030). In conclusion, rs9277535 non-GG genotype is associated with a higher likelihood of spontaneous HBsAg seroclearance in CHB patients.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The work was supported by grants from the National Taiwan University; the National Science Council, and Department of Health, Executive Yuan, Taiwan; National Taiwan University Hospital, Taiwan.

All of the 200 patients were all male and had no evidence of concomitant hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis D virus (HDV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

In this study, which focused on male chronic HBV carriers who acquired the infection perinatally, we found that carriers who had rs9277535 non-G/G genotype had a higher chance to clear HBsAg.</p><p>A plenty of studies already addressed the clinical significance of HLA-DP SNP on clearing HBsAg <xref rid="pone.0053008-Nishida1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0053008-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> in patients with acute HBV infection. All these reports compared HBV carriers (HBsAg-positive) with subjects who exposed to HBV but cleared HBsAg (HBsAg-negative but anti-HBc-positive). The main concern of such studies is to put patients who cleared HBsAg after being a chronic carrier and those who cleared HBsAg after acute infection together. In fact, the HBsAg clearance rates are totally different considering the age when HBV infection is acquired, and the mechanism may also be different <xref rid="pone.0053008-Liaw1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. HBV infection usually persists in patients who acquire the infection perinatally and HBsAg clearance during the follow-up has been shown to be a rare event <xref rid="pone.0053008-Chu2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053008-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053008-Tseng1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0053008-Tseng2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>; while the infection persists only in 1&#8211;5% of patients infected after childhood, which indicates that most of them will clear the virus after acute infection <xref rid="pone.0053008-Liaw1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. A Taiwanese pediatric study before mass vaccination showed that the seropositive rates for HBsAg were 5.1% and 10.7% in children at age of &lt;1 year and 1&#8211;2 years, respectively, and the rates remained quite constant, around 10&#8211;11%, thereafter <xref rid="pone.0053008-Hsu1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. These data suggest that most chronic HBV carriers in Taiwan acquired the infection in early life through perinatal transmission. A large-scale population-based survey in Taiwan has shown that, in 2002, the seropositive rate for HBsAg is 13.7%, which is quite similar to the prevalence rate in children; while the prevalence of positive anti-HBc but negative HBsAg is 54.8%, which is much higher than the prevalence of positive HBsAg. The former finding suggested that the chance for becoming a chronic carrier is quite limited if the infection occurs after the childhood, and the latter finding may indicate that most anti-HBc-positive patients in Taiwan are those who clear the virus after acute infection, but not after becoming chronic carriers. If the infection pattern is similar in Asia, we believe that most of prior studies investigating how HBV is cleared after an acute infection, while our study investigated how HBV is cleared 40&#8211;50 years after they acquired the infection in early life. Interestingly, although the timing of clearing virus is totally different, we found that SNPs in HLA-DP region are both important in viral clearance.</p><p>Few studies have investigated whether host genetic factors affect clearing HBsAg spontaneously in chronic HBV carriers. HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 are 2 components of MHC class II, which is important for presenting antigen and initiating the immune response <xref rid="pone.0053008-Handunnetthi1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In this study, we explored the association between HLA-DP regions and HBV clearance by studying the possible surrogate SNPs, rs3077 for HLA-DPA1 and rs9277535 for HLA-DPB1. The strong association between these 2 SNPs and HBV persistence after acute infection has been documented and validated in Asian people <xref rid="pone.0053008-Kamatani1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053008-Nishida1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0053008-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, providing us the rationale to investigate the impact of these two SNPs on clearing HBsAg in Taiwanese patients with chronic hepatitis B infection. All of previous studies have indicated that G allele of rs9277535 increased the risk of persistent infection of HBV. Although the mechanism is unclear, we may hypothesize that patients carrying G alleles have less immune response against HBV, thus are at higher risk of becoming chronic carriers after acute infection. Interestingly, our study showed that chronic HBV carriers with rs9277535 non-G/G genotype had a higher chance to clear HBsAg, which also collaborates with our hypothesis. In other words, the SNP of HLA-DPB1 is associated with clearing HBV both in acute and chronic HBV infection. It warrants more studies to elucidate the viral epitopes presented by different HLA-DPB1 genotypes and their relationship with different immune response against HBV.</p><p>This study had several unique features. HBsAg loss occurs at annual rate of 0.5&#8764;2% in HBeAg-negative patients <xref rid="pone.0053008-Chu2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053008-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053008-Tseng1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0053008-Tseng2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. A large cohort with a long-term follow-up period is mandatory to evaluate this rare event. In addition, we have a strict enrollment criterion to ensure that the include patients to fit our requirement, allowing us to understand more about HBsAg loss in Taiwanese HBV carrier. Also, our study had some limitations. First, we usually determine the HBV genotype using a PCR-based method with the lower detection limit of 100 copies/mL. In this study, chronic HBV carriers who cleared HBsAg had HBV DNA levels less than 20 IU/mL (&#8764;100 copies/mL). Therefore, we can not to investigate the interaction between HBV genotype and HBsAg seroclearance in the study. Second, spontaneous HBsAg loss occurs with a low incidence rate. It is not easy to collect a large number of patients, thus the statistical power may not be strong enough to fully address this issue. Although limitations exist in this study, our data still provide new light in the spontaneous HBsAg seroclearance in chronic hepatitis B patient.</p><p>In summary, in consistent with the relationship between HLA-DP SNP and HBsAg clearance after acute HBV infection, we found rs9277535 non-GG genotypes in HLA-DPB1 region are associated with higher chance of spontaneous HBsAg seroclearance in chronic HBV carriers.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0053008-Chen1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
