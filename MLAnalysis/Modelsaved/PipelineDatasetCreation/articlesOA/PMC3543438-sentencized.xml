<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Patients with chronic HBV infection are at risk of developing adverse outcomes, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with an estimated lifetime risk of 25–40% [1]–[4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) serves as important serological markers for the diagnosis and monitoring of chronic hepatitis B patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Although spontaneous HBsAg loss is a rare event, it usually indicates a cure for the disease [5], [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have indicated that HBsAg loss rate is around 0.5 to 1.4% per year in patients with chronic HBV infection [7]–[14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Several host and viral factors, including older age, normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, low serum levels of HBV DNA and HBsAg have been shown to be associated with a higher chance of HBsAg loss [6], [8], [11], [13]–[14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about whether host genetic factor influences spontaneous HBsAg loss in patients with chronic hepatitis B infection. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) represent a natural genetic variability at high density in the human genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Recent study using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have shown that two SNPs, rs3077 near HLA-DPA1 and rs9277535 near HLA-DPB1, are associated with persistence of HBV infection [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Since HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 code the functional subunit of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II [16], these data may suggest possible interactions between virus and host immunity. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>HBsAg loss is an important milestone in the natural history of chronic HBV infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>In this study, which focused on male chronic HBV carriers who acquired the infection perinatally, we found that carriers who had rs9277535 non-G/G genotype had a higher chance to clear HBsAg. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>A plenty of studies already addressed the clinical significance of HLA-DP SNP on clearing HBsAg [23]–[26] in patients with acute HBV infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>All these reports compared HBV carriers (HBsAg-positive) with subjects who exposed to HBV but cleared HBsAg (HBsAg-negative but anti-HBc-positive). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>The main concern of such studies is to put patients who cleared HBsAg after being a chronic carrier and those who cleared HBsAg after acute infection together. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>In fact, the HBsAg clearance rates are totally different considering the age when HBV infection is acquired, and the mechanism may also be different [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>HBV infection usually persists in patients who acquire the infection perinatally and HBsAg clearance during the follow-up has been shown to be a rare event [8], [11], [13]–[14]; while the infection persists only in 1–5% of patients infected after childhood, which indicates that most of them will clear the virus after acute infection [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>A Taiwanese pediatric study before mass vaccination showed that the seropositive rates for HBsAg were 5.1% and 10.7% in children at age of &lt;1 year and 1–2 years, respectively, and the rates remained quite constant, around 10–11%, thereafter [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that most chronic HBV carriers in Taiwan acquired the infection in early life through perinatal transmission. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>A large-scale population-based survey in Taiwan has shown that, in 2002, the seropositive rate for HBsAg is 13.7%, which is quite similar to the prevalence rate in children; while the prevalence of positive anti-HBc but negative HBsAg is 54.8%, which is much higher than the prevalence of positive HBsAg. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>The former finding suggested that the chance for becoming a chronic carrier is quite limited if the infection occurs after the childhood, and the latter finding may indicate that most anti-HBc-positive patients in Taiwan are those who clear the virus after acute infection, but not after becoming chronic carriers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>If the infection pattern is similar in Asia, we believe that most of prior studies investigating how HBV is cleared after an acute infection, while our study investigated how HBV is cleared 40–50 years after they acquired the infection in early life. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, although the timing of clearing virus is totally different, we found that SNPs in HLA-DP region are both important in viral clearance. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Few studies have investigated whether host genetic factors affect clearing HBsAg spontaneously in chronic HBV carriers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 are 2 components of MHC class II, which is important for presenting antigen and initiating the immune response [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>In this study, we explored the association between HLA-DP regions and HBV clearance by studying the possible surrogate SNPs, rs3077 for HLA-DPA1 and rs9277535 for HLA-DPB1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>The strong association between these 2 SNPs and HBV persistence after acute infection has been documented and validated in Asian people [15], [23]–[26], providing us the rationale to investigate the impact of these two SNPs on clearing HBsAg in Taiwanese patients with chronic hepatitis B infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>All of previous studies have indicated that G allele of rs9277535 increased the risk of persistent infection of HBV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanism is unclear, we may hypothesize that patients carrying G alleles have less immune response against HBV, thus are at higher risk of becoming chronic carriers after acute infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, our study showed that chronic HBV carriers with rs9277535 non-G/G genotype had a higher chance to clear HBsAg, which also collaborates with our hypothesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>In other words, the SNP of HLA-DPB1 is associated with clearing HBV both in acute and chronic HBV infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>It warrants more studies to elucidate the viral epitopes presented by different HLA-DPB1 genotypes and their relationship with different immune response against HBV. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>This study had several unique features. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>HBsAg loss occurs at annual rate of 0.5∼2% in HBeAg-negative patients [8], [11], [13]–[14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>A large cohort with a long-term follow-up period is mandatory to evaluate this rare event. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>In addition, we have a strict enrollment criterion to ensure that the include patients to fit our requirement, allowing us to understand more about HBsAg loss in Taiwanese HBV carrier. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Also, our study had some limitations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>First, we usually determine the HBV genotype using a PCR-based method with the lower detection limit of 100 copies/mL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>In this study, chronic HBV carriers who cleared HBsAg had HBV DNA levels less than 20 IU/mL (∼100 copies/mL). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we can not to investigate the interaction between HBV genotype and HBsAg seroclearance in the study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Second, spontaneous HBsAg loss occurs with a low incidence rate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>It is not easy to collect a large number of patients, thus the statistical power may not be strong enough to fully address this issue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Although limitations exist in this study, our data still provide new light in the spontaneous HBsAg seroclearance in chronic hepatitis B patient. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>In summary, in consistent with the relationship between HLA-DP SNP and HBsAg clearance after acute HBV infection, we found rs9277535 non-GG genotypes in HLA-DPB1 region are associated with higher chance of spontaneous HBsAg seroclearance in chronic HBV carriers. </plain></SENT>
