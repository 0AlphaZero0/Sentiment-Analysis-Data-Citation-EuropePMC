Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a model of common genetic heart disease attracting the interest of cardiologists, geneticists, scientists, and the public. Public interest is usually temporarily raised following the diagnosis of HCM as the cause of sudden death of a young competitive athlete [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Different population studies reported the prevalence of HCM, based on left ventricular (LV) wall thickness greater than 15&#160;mm, as 1:500 (0.2&#160;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, this frequency represents the tip of the iceberg and is probably an underestimate since it represents only the clinically manifest HCM and does not include the prehypertrophic stage represented by the genotype-positive/phenotype-negative cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Based on the reported prevalence in different populations, an estimate of at least 160,000 individuals is expected to be affected with HCM within the over 80&#160;million population of Egypt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Although the incidence of this disease appears to be constant in different parts of the world, its phenotypic and genetic features seem to be quite heterogeneous. Laboratory genetic analysis undertaken over the past two decades have detected several hundred mutations in genes encoding proteins within and associated with the sarcomere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Why various clinical manifestations are found among those who share the same sarcomeric gene mutation remains unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Factors that account for this variability are only beginning to unravel. Diversity of the causal genes and mutations are partly responsible, but modifier genes and environmental factors also play a role in the phenotypic expression of HCM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Extensive and continuous research in different populations with different genetic backgrounds is imperative to understand the heterogeneity of this disease.</p><p>Mutation in any of the sarcomeric genes (<italic>MYBPC3</italic>, <italic>MYH7</italic>, <italic>TNNT2</italic>, <italic>TPM1</italic>, <italic>TNNI3</italic>, <italic>MYL2</italic>, <italic>MYL3</italic>, <italic>ACTC</italic>, and <italic>TTN</italic>) is usually identified in approximately half of the genetically screened HCM index cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, the proportion of detection of a pathogenic mutation is population-dependent and the reported frequency ranged from &gt;50&#160;% in France [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and Italy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] to &lt;30&#160;% in Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The three most commonly involved sarcomeric genes in HCM as reported in several populations in Europe and USA are myosin binding protein C (<italic>MYBPC3</italic>), &#946;-myosin heavy chain (<italic>MYH7</italic>), and cardiac troponin T (<italic>TNNT2</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It is, therefore, reasonable to consider screening of those three genes as a first line strategy for molecular characterization of HCM patients in Egypt.</p><p>HCM diagnosis is usually delayed till complications develop and is, therefore, considered among the neglected diseases particularly in the developing world. Establishment of tertiary centers, which provide state-of-the-art management, can highly benefit these patients and allow establishment of clinical registries for systematized research and better understanding of the pathophysiology of this common genetic cardiovascular disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Establishing national programs is invaluable for sharing disease knowledge and creating networks for optimizing HCM care and encouraging research, hence, the initiative of establishing the BA HCM national program in Egypt aiming for clinical and molecular characterization of HCM among Egyptian patients through nationwide collaboration between clinical satellites extending from Alexandria in the north to Aswan in the south and all being linked to molecular genetics laboratory hosted in the Bibliotheca Alexandrina premises.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>HCM Patient Population</title><p>The present study comprised sarcomeric (<italic>MYBPC3</italic>, <italic>MYH7</italic>, and <italic>TNNT2</italic>) genotyping of 199 consecutive unrelated HCM index patients recruited from the different geographic regions of Egypt from July 2007 to June 2010 following standard clinical evaluation by 2D echocardiography at the satellite HCM clinics in Alexandria Faculty of Medicine, Cairo Faculty of Medicine, National Heart Institute, and Aswan Heart Center. The study was approved by the Alexandria Faculty of Medicine and Aswan Heart Center Research ethics committees and informed written consent was obtained from all patients following provision of pretesting genetic counseling.

The patient cohort comprised: 192 clinically diagnosed HCM patients, a single patient had LV noncompaction cardiomyopathy without hypertrophy (P76), and six patients were clinically suspected as HCM phenocopies: five patients were suspected to be infiltrative due to storage disease based on symmetrical hypertrophy and highly reflective myocardium (data not shown) and/or presence of history of parental consanguinity and presence of horizontal transmission pattern and one patient was suspected to have mitochondrial cardiomyopathy due to associated bilateral optic neuritis. Another patient was clinically suspected of LEOPARD syndrome due to associated pigmented cutaneous lesions. The fact that no further biochemical analysis was undertaken at the time of sarcomeric genetic testing, it was decided to include all enrolled patients to the three sarcomeric gene analyses. All suspected HCM phenocopies were negative for mutations in the three sarcomeric genes analyzed in the present study and were, therefore, excluded in further frequency estimation and statistical analysis.</p><p>Demographics of the 192 Egyptian HCM patients are shown in Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

There were 62 individual mutations detected in any of the three sarcomeric genes in the present cohort, the majority of which (47/62, 77&#160;%) were detected in single index patient (i.e., private) (Tables&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Most of the mutations detected in the studied cohort were novel (40/62, 65&#160;%) and were not detected in 200 alleles of age-, sex-, and ethnically matched control series nor in the 1000 Exome Variant Server (EVS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Three missense mutations detected in our HCM patients (Ala177His, Arg1138 in MYBPC3, and Arg1662His in MYH7) were found in the EVS; however, they were reported at low allele frequencies (0.003, 0.0002, and 0.00008, respectively). Additionally, seven missense mutations previously reported as pathogenic in relevance to HCM and also found in the present cohort (Ala216Thr, Clu441Lys, Gly507Arg, Glu619Lys, Val771Met, Glu1179Lys in MYBPC3, and Ala797Thr in MYH7) were also reported in the EVS. This finding should be interpreted with caution. While on the one hand, these variants might be regarded as rare polymorphic nonpathogenic variants, on the other hand, it could still have a pathogenic and/or modifier effect in a disease with the heterogeneous nature of HCM having later age of onset and reduced penetrance especially when considering controls not thoroughly evaluated by electrocardiogram (ECG) and echo. Further screening in a larger number of ethnic-matched controls with thorough cardiologic evaluation is warranted.</p><sec id="d30e3273"><title><italic>MYBPC3</italic> Mutation Spectrum</title><p><italic>MYBPC3</italic> was the most commonly involved in the present cohort (47 patients were <italic>MYBPC3</italic>-genopositive, 47/192, 24&#160;%). Thirty-five individual mutations were detected in <italic>MYBPC3</italic>, 18 mutations were missense, seven were nonsense, eight were deletion mutation of which six caused frameshift effect resulting in premature stop codon and two mutations caused in-frame deletion of a single or more amino acids (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p>In addition, two mutations were detected in introns 32 and 7, namely, c.3627&#8201;+&#8201;2delT (PU2) and c.821&#8201;+&#8201;3G&#8201;&gt;&#8201;T (PU1), respectively (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). These variants are likely to result in splice site error since both were absent in 200 chromosomes of unrelated healthy subjects and the former is affecting the conserved 5&#8242; donor splice site dinucleotide GT of intron 32 and the latter (c.821&#8201;+&#8201;3G&#8201;&gt;&#8201;T) was predicted to result in splice error by in silico modeling and was found to cosegregate with the HCM phenotype in a HCM family member (PU1&#8242;a), thus, in favor of its potential pathogenicity.

Initial screening of commonly involved sarcomeric genes is a justifiable first line approach of HCM genotype analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The frequency of positive sarcomeric genotyping detected among the Egyptian HCM index patients (40&#160;%) is comparable to the frequency reported by Van Driest et al. in an earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], in which eight sarcomeric genes were analyzed in 389 HCM patients (38&#160;% were genopositive). Also, recently, Curila et al. reported a similar frequency (40&#160;%) analyzing four sarcomeric genes (<italic>MYBPC3</italic>, <italic>MYH7</italic>, <italic>TNNT2</italic>, and <italic>TNNI3</italic>) in 100 HCM patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].

This variation in frequency of positive genetic yield may probably relate to the proportion of familial cases included in the different cohorts. The positive sarcomeric genetic yield detected in the present cohort was significantly associated with presence of family history of HCM and/or occurrence of sudden cardiac death (<italic>p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.002) and with young age of presentation (<italic>p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.004).</p><p><italic>MYBPC3</italic> was the most commonly involved sarcomeric gene (24&#160;%) and was twice as common as <italic>MYH7</italic> (12&#160;%), and <italic>TNNT2</italic> was the least commonly involved in the present cohort. <italic>MYBPC3</italic> and <italic>MYH7</italic> accounted for 87&#160;% of all genotype-positive patients. A similar genotype pattern was also observed in several European HCM cohorts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p>HCM is considered a highly heterogeneous disease not just at the phenotype but also showing marked genetic heterogeneity.

However, different ethnic cohorts including the present study revealed repetitive particular genotype association that may relate to a founder effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], highlighting the importance of genetic screening in different populations.</p><p>A high proportion of the mutations detected in the present cohort were novel (65&#160;%) and assessment of their potential pathogenicity was undertaken based on the practice guidelines for interpretation of unclassified variants in clinical molecular genetics, and the overall conclusion was based on more than a single line of evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Accordingly, novel variants in the present study were classified as: uncertain, likely pathogenic, and pathogenic. This molecular stratification of variants was always considered in genetic counseling. An example is of a family pedigree with a novel variant (<italic>MYH7</italic>: Asp309Asn) in index patient (PA8). This novel variant, according to in silico bioinformatic analysis, was predicted as probably damaging by PolyPhen-2 (score 0.963) and was considered as unlikely to be damaging by other in silico tools (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). It has not been detected in 200 chromosomes of matched healthy controls and was tested for cosegregation within the family. The mutation was detected in two sibs who were phenonegative by standard echocardiographic screening. Thus, confirmation of pathogenicity is not possible at the current stage; however, follow-up of the phenonegative sibs is warranted since the mutation pathogenicity is uncertain and reduced penetrance is a possibility.</p><p>Single nucleotide substitution was the most commonly encountered mutation type (51/62, 82&#160;%). These substitutions were analyzed in context of the reference GenBank sequence of the three sarcomeric genes to determine whether deamination of five methyl cytosine and transition to thymine represented a common cause of mutagenesis in sense or antisense DNA strands of sarcomeric genes in our HCM cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].

This is in agreement with the frequency of C&#8201;&gt;&#8201;T and G&#8201;&gt;&#8201;A transition reported by Meures and Mealey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] in substitution mutations found in HCM in the literature (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab7"><label>Table 7</label><caption><p>Frequency of different substitution modes within CpG in the present cohort in comparison to previously reported mutations in the 3 analyzed sarcomeric genes</p></caption><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>This observation probably explains the theory behind some mutation recurrence in several HCM cohorts of different ethnicity: such as the functionally characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] Arg92codon mutation of TNNT2 reported in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], the E258K mutation of MYBPC3 reported with a founder effect among the Italian population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and the Ala797Thr reported with a possible founder effect in South Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. All such missense mutations involve CpG sites and are, therefore, likely to be hypermutable spots and hence, were also detected in other studies including the present. The hypothesis of considering codon Arg92 as a putative hot spot with high mutation rate rather than recurrence among different populations due to a common founder effect was earlier proposed by Forissier et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. It is worth mentioning that other reported founder mutation resulting from deletion or insertion such as the Dutch 2373insG (Q791fs) in MYBPC3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] was not detected in the current study. The high mutability at the CpG sites within the sarcomeric genes probably explains also the high frequency of novel mutations detected in different studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] including that observed in the present study (65&#160;%).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusion and Future Directions</title><p>This study is the first to provide genetic data of HCM among Egyptians.
