</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of genetic basis of inherited heart muscle disease is a prerequisite for further population, phenotypic, and mechanistic studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a model of common genetic heart disease attracting the interest of cardiologists, geneticists, scientists, and the public. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Public interest is usually temporarily raised following the diagnosis of HCM as the cause of sudden death of a young competitive athlete [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Different population studies reported the prevalence of HCM, based on left ventricular (LV) wall thickness greater than 15 mm, as 1:500 (0.2 %) [2, 3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, this frequency represents the tip of the iceberg and is probably an underestimate since it represents only the clinically manifest HCM and does not include the prehypertrophic stage represented by the genotype-positive/phenotype-negative cases [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Based on the reported prevalence in different populations, an estimate of at least 160,000 individuals is expected to be affected with HCM within the over 80 million population of Egypt [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Although the incidence of this disease appears to be constant in different parts of the world, its phenotypic and genetic features seem to be quite heterogeneous. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Laboratory genetic analysis undertaken over the past two decades have detected several hundred mutations in genes encoding proteins within and associated with the sarcomere [6–8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Why various clinical manifestations are found among those who share the same sarcomeric gene mutation remains unknown [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Factors that account for this variability are only beginning to unravel. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Diversity of the causal genes and mutations are partly responsible, but modifier genes and environmental factors also play a role in the phenotypic expression of HCM [10, 11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Extensive and continuous research in different populations with different genetic backgrounds is imperative to understand the heterogeneity of this disease. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Mutation in any of the sarcomeric genes (MYBPC3, MYH7, TNNT2, TPM1, TNNI3, MYL2, MYL3, ACTC, and TTN) is usually identified in approximately half of the genetically screened HCM index cases [12, 13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>However, the proportion of detection of a pathogenic mutation is population-dependent and the reported frequency ranged from &gt;50 % in France [12] and Italy [14] to &lt;30 % in Sweden [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The three most commonly involved sarcomeric genes in HCM as reported in several populations in Europe and USA are myosin binding protein C (MYBPC3), β-myosin heavy chain (MYH7), and cardiac troponin T (TNNT2) [6, 16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>It is, therefore, reasonable to consider screening of those three genes as a first line strategy for molecular characterization of HCM patients in Egypt. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>HCM diagnosis is usually delayed till complications develop and is, therefore, considered among the neglected diseases particularly in the developing world. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Establishment of tertiary centers, which provide state-of-the-art management, can highly benefit these patients and allow establishment of clinical registries for systematized research and better understanding of the pathophysiology of this common genetic cardiovascular disorder [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Establishing national programs is invaluable for sharing disease knowledge and creating networks for optimizing HCM care and encouraging research, hence, the initiative of establishing the BA HCM national program in Egypt aiming for clinical and molecular characterization of HCM among Egyptian patients through nationwide collaboration between clinical satellites extending from Alexandria in the north to Aswan in the south and all being linked to molecular genetics laboratory hosted in the Bibliotheca Alexandrina premises. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Initial screening of commonly involved sarcomeric genes is a justifiable first line approach of HCM genotype analysis [12, 14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>The frequency of positive sarcomeric genotyping detected among the Egyptian HCM index patients (40 %) is comparable to the frequency reported by Van Driest et al. in an earlier study [6], in which eight sarcomeric genes were analyzed in 389 HCM patients (38 % were genopositive). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>This variation in frequency of positive genetic yield may probably relate to the proportion of familial cases included in the different cohorts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>The positive sarcomeric genetic yield detected in the present cohort was significantly associated with presence of family history of HCM and/or occurrence of sudden cardiac death (p = 0.002) and with young age of presentation (p = 0.004). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>MYBPC3 was the most commonly involved sarcomeric gene (24 %) and was twice as common as MYH7 (12 %), and TNNT2 was the least commonly involved in the present cohort. MYBPC3 and MYH7 accounted for 87 % of all genotype-positive patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>A similar genotype pattern was also observed in several European HCM cohorts [12, 14, 25, 37]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>HCM is considered a highly heterogeneous disease not just at the phenotype but also showing marked genetic heterogeneity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>This is reflected as a high frequency of novel mutations reported in different population studies [6, 12, 14] limiting the possibility of screening for specific genes or particular mutations in research and clinical practice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>However, different ethnic cohorts including the present study revealed repetitive particular genotype association that may relate to a founder effect [14, 38–40], highlighting the importance of genetic screening in different populations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>A high proportion of the mutations detected in the present cohort were novel (65 %) and assessment of their potential pathogenicity was undertaken based on the practice guidelines for interpretation of unclassified variants in clinical molecular genetics, and the overall conclusion was based on more than a single line of evidence [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, novel variants in the present study were classified as: uncertain, likely pathogenic, and pathogenic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>This molecular stratification of variants was always considered in genetic counseling. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>This novel variant, according to in silico bioinformatic analysis, was predicted as probably damaging by PolyPhen-2 (score 0.963) and was considered as unlikely to be damaging by other in silico tools (Table 4). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>These substitutions were analyzed in context of the reference GenBank sequence of the three sarcomeric genes to determine whether deamination of five methyl cytosine and transition to thymine represented a common cause of mutagenesis in sense or antisense DNA strands of sarcomeric genes in our HCM cohort [42–45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>It was found that C &gt; T and G &gt; A transitions constituted 78 % (21/27) of the substitutions occurring within the CpG dinucleotides in the present cohort (as shown in Table 5). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>This observation probably explains the theory behind some mutation recurrence in several HCM cohorts of different ethnicity: such as the functionally characterized [47] Arg92codon mutation of TNNT2 reported in several studies [34, 35, 48], the E258K mutation of MYBPC3 reported with a founder effect among the Italian population [14], and the Ala797Thr reported with a possible founder effect in South Africa [49]. </plain></SENT>
