</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Cysteine proteases, which are responsible for the processes of intra- and extra-cellular protein degradation and turn-over [1], are widely distributed in bacteria, plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The papain family of cysteine proteases is one of the largest groups of proteases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This family includes lysosomal cathepsins B, C, H, L, and S, and the more recently described cathepsins F, K, O, V, W, and X [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Cathepsins are associated with various clinical conditions such as bone disorder pycnodysostosis [4], bone resorption [5], arthritis [6], and tumor metastases [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Recent research has shown that cathepsin activity also regulates the long-term memory formation of Drosophila melanogaster [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The relationship between cathepsins and a number of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, is also emerging as an important subject [9]–[11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Given the involvement of cathepsins in many physiological processes, they have become attractive targets for drug development and other therapeutic applications [3], [12]–[21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Research over the past two decades has reported several propeptide-like cysteine protease inhibitors [22]–[27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Other research has determined their sequences and structural homology with respect to the proregions of their targeted proteases [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Propeptide-like cysteine protease inhibitors have the ability to inhibit cathepsins, and many researchers have investigated their functional and structural properties [22], [24]–[29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>One of these inhibitors, crammer from D. melanogaster, also known as Drosophila cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-2 (CTLA-2)-like protein, (D/CTLA-2), is of particular interest [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Crammer is a small protein of 79 amino acids that shares approximately 37% of its sequence with other cathepsin proregions and propeptide-like cysteine protease inhibitors [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>This crammer is involved in the long-term memory formation of D. melanogaster [8], [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Crammer functions as a strong, competitive inhibitor against CTSL-like cathepsins, and requires a molten globule-to-ordered structure transition to inhibit cathepsins [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In addition, we have determined the solution structure of a crammer variant, C72S (a Cys to Ser point mutation at position 72), the first of a propeptide-like cathepsin inhibitor that has been reported in the literature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Under acidic conditions (pH 4.0), C72S behaves like wild type crammer (designated as WT hereafter) which forms a molten globule. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>At pH 6.0, C72S adopts a structure that resembles the structure of cathepsin-bound WT crammer, encompassing two hydrophobic cores and four salt bridges that may contribute to crammer’s folding stability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The structure of crammer highly resembles that of human cathepsin propeptides, suggesting its potential inhibitory activity toward human cathepsins [28]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Multiple sequence alignment of crammer with its homologs indicates that several aromatic residues in the hydrophobic cores and charged residues of the salt bridges in crammer are highly conserved among cathepsin propeptides and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-2α and β (CTLA-2α and 2β). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Using site-directed mutagenesis, Wiederanders et al. showed that W28, W31, and W52 of human cathepsin S propeptide are essential for the inhibition of mature cathepsin S, and that the aromatic stacking of these residues stabilizes the core structure of the propeptide domain [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Yamamo et al. also showed that W12, W15, and W35 of CTLA-2α play important roles in rat cathepsin L inhibition by maintaining the correct structure of CTLA-2α [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Although these studies have shed some light on the importance of tryptophan residues in cathepsin inhibition, little is known about the roles of these conserved residues within the hydrophobic cores and salt bridges of the propeptides and the propeptide-like cysteine protease inhibitors in the context of protein folding and cathepsin inhibition. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Based on structural information obtained previously [28], this study systematically examines the contributions of individual residues in crammer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>This study uses alanine scanning to investigate the structure-function relationship of the hydrophobic cores and salt bridges in the disorder-to-order transition and CTSB inhibition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Far-UV CD, intrinsic fluorescence, and multidimensional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopies are used to examine the effects of alanine substitution on the structures and folding stabilities of crammer variants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Comparative enzymatic activities provide valuable information on the individual amino acids and their abilities to inhibit cathepsins and folding transition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>These structural and functional insights present valuable data for the future development of therapeutic protease inhibitors. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Using alanine substitutions, this study systematically investigates the importance of the aromatic residues in crammer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>We found that W9, Y12, F16, Y20, and Y32 in the hydrophobic Core 1 make important contributions to folding transition and CTSB inhibition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Mutations on these residues in crammer substantially altered the proper conformation of α1 and α2-helices, significantly decreased the structural stability, and increased the population of the denatured state at 20°C (Figure S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>This helical conformation serves as a nucleus for the formation of the ordered tertiary structure of crammer at pH 6.0. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>The disruption of the molten globule-to-ordered structure transition in crammer reduces the inhibition potency against CTSB. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>The activation of human cathepsin requires the cleavage of its proregion under acidic condition [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>The cleaved proregion exists as a molten globule [45] with poor inhibitory activity against cathepsin [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Unlike the proregion of human cathepsin, the propeptide-like crammer is a strong inhibitor against cathepsin under acidic conditions and the tight binding of crammer is associated with a molten globule-to-ordered structure transition [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>The disruption of this structure transition (such as in the case of the W9A mutant) causes poor inhibitory ability and triggers W9A proteolysis through CTSB (Figure S5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>These results suggest the importance of folding coupled binding (i.e., induced fit) and inhibition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>The inefficient inhibition of the cleaved disordered proregion against cathepsin may result from defects of pH- or target binding-dependent disordered-to-ordered transition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>This in turn renders the propeptides more susceptible to cathepsin proteolysis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Crammer has a high sequence homology (&gt;36%) with the propeptides of cysteine proteases (Figure 1), and its hydrophobic Core 1 contains five conserved aromatic residues (W9, Y12, F16, Y20, and Y32). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>The first and the fourth residues for all propeptide-like inhibitors and propeptides are tryptophan and tyrosine, respectively (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this study proposes a conserved aromatic motif, WX2(F/Y/W)X3(F/Y)X3YX12(F/Y/W) (Figure 1A) that is essential for the formation of the hydrophobic Core 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>More importantly, this study presents an analysis of the π–π interactions among the aromatic residues of the hydrophobic cores in crammer and the propeptides of human cathepsins L, K, and S using the Protein Interactions Calculator (PIC) [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>The first aromatic residue of crammer, W9, is located at the center of hydrophobic Core 1, and its bulky indole ring serves as an anchor for interacting with other aromatic residues through π–πinteractions ( and Table S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the corresponding entity in the propeptides of human cathepsins L, K, and S is the second tryptophan residue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Although these propeptides have different arrangements and orientations at this unique tryptophan, they also share π–πinteractions similar to those of crammer to promote the formation of a hydrophobic core. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>This tryptophan residue also exhibits van der Waals interactions with the surrounding charged or hydrophobic residues in the hydrophobic core (Table S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Therefore, mutation at any of the aromatic residues in the hydrophobic Core 1 of crammer can destroy these interactions and the core formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>Consequently, this would lead to the disruption of the molten globule-to-ordered structure transition. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Crammer has two tryptophan residues in its primary sequence (W9 and W53), but these two residues have different effects on the Trp fluorescence emission. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>C72S/W53A apparently exhibits a larger blue-shift than C72S/W9A (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>This suggests that C72S/W9A displays a higher degrees of solvent exposure of the Trp side chains in the structure of crammer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Moreover, C72S/W9A has lower protein stability and higher population of the denatured state (Figure S1 and Table S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Hence, we propose that the replacement of W9 with alanine causes greater disruption of π–π interactions, thereby significantly disturbing the protein stability and structure folding, as well as the disorder-to-order transition in crammer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>In contrast, C72S/W53A maintains the similar structure and stability with that of C72S, indicating that the packing of W53 at the hydrophobic Core 2 is less critical to protein folding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>However, W53A also remarkably decreased CTSB inhibition, indicating that the loss of function is not because of folding deficiency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>The exposed indole ring of W53 may be involved in CTSB binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Given the sequence similarity (Figure 1), crammer and the propeptides seem to share similar binding modes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>The complex structure of procathepsin S shows that the propeptide side chain of W58 is in contact with the side chain of W153 of the pro-segment binding loop (PBL) [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>In procathepsin L, F56 of the propeptide makes close contacts with Y151 of the PBL [49] (Figure S7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>This study uses homology modeling to generate the structure of Drosophila procathepsin B to clarify the role of W53 in crammer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>This model was superimposed to the structures of procathepsins S (CTSS), K (CTSK), and crammer (Figure S7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Results show that the indole ring of W53 in crammer adopts a similar orientation as the propeptides and may interact with Y261 of the PBL of Drosophila CTSB. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>In rat cathepsin B propeptide, alanine substitution at this residue also apparently reduces cathepsin inhibition [50]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>This study also investigates the importance of the salt bridges in crammer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>The proposed double mutant cycle analysis shows that D6-R29 and R28-E67 are critical for crammer stability (Figure S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>The replacement of the charged residues E8, R28, R29, and E67 with alanine considerably reduces their CTSB inhibition activity, whereas the replacement of D6, E24, and K36 does not. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>C72S/E8A and C72S/R29A lose the disorder-to-order transition, thus reducing their inhibitory activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Likewise, C72S/R28A only has the partial folded structure at pH 6.0 and, therefore exhibits lower cathepsin inhibition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Although E8 and R29 form salt bridges with K36 and D6, respectively, only the former two residues contribute significantly to protein folding and CTSB inhibition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>These asymmetric contributions can be rationalized in terms of the relative positions of individual residues in the 3D structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>D6 is located in loop 1, E8 in α-helix 1, E24 in loop 2, R28 and R29 in α-helix 2, K36 in the middle of α-helix 2, distant from the hydrophobic Core 1, and E67 is located in α-helix 4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Because α-helices 1 and 2 form the backbone of the hydrophobic Core 1, mutations at these two helices are likely to have greater effect on core formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>C72S/E67A exhibits thermostability and structure transition results similar to those of C72S, but its CTSB inhibition activity is poor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Multiple sequence alignment (Figure 1A) shows that this glutamic acid is highly conserved among crammer, CTLA-2α, CTLA-2β and propeptides of human cathepsins L, K, and S. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>The salt bridge between R28 and E67 of crammer is structurally equivalent to the salt bridges R31-E70, R3-E70, and R33-E72 of the propeptides of human cathepsins L [49], K [51], [52], and S [48], respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>The R33-E72 salt bridge in human cathepsin S contributes to the proper orientation of the α-helix toward the active site cleft [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this study proposes that the R28-E67 salt bridge, connecting α-helices 2 and 4 in crammer, is essential for the proper orientation of α-helix 4 with respect to the active site of CTSB. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>Therefore, mutation on E67 may cause misalignment of α-helix 4, leading to a weaker binding affinity and lower CTSB inhibition activity. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>This study uses alanine scanning to identify the critical amino acids of Drosophila crammer in terms of CTSB inhibition, structure, stability, and disorder-to-order transition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>The results of this study show that the conserved aromatic residues W9, Y12, Y20, and Y32 at the hydrophobic Core 1 are critical for folding transition and CTSB inhibition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>These residues form π-π interactions and van der Waals contacts to maintain the integrity of the hydrophobic core. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>This in turn promotes the pH-dependent molten globule-to-ordered structure transition in crammer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>The propeptides of human cathepsins adopt different steric arrangements at these corresponding residues, but they still adopt similar π-π stacking interactions to stabilize the hydrophobic core and the overall folding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>Hence, this π-π stacking is required for the propeptides and crammer to trigger efficient inhibition activity against cysteine protease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>The solvent-exposed W53 at the hydrophobic Core 2 of crammer probably directly interacts with PBL of Drosophila CTSB to express its CTSB inhibition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>Finally, the conserved charged residues in crammer provide an interaction network to promote the helix formation and maintain thermostability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Specifically, the disruption of the R28-E67 salt bridge in crammer apparently disturbs the structure transition, thus reducing CTSB inhibition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>These results provide an insight into the structural and functional roles of key amino acids in crammer, which is useful for the development of cysteine protease inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
