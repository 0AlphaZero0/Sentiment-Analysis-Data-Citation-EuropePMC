Current typing methods include phenotypic (monoclonal antibody subgrouping<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>) and genotypic (sequence-based typing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>) methods, which typically take 1&#8211;2&#8197;days. High-throughput sequencing technology has the potential to rapidly provide information on organism identity and genetic relatedness and has been shown to provide a high degree of discrimination for a range of other bacteria such as methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>

Active case-finding identified two further cases in the local hospital and a formal outbreak investigation was carried out. Twenty-four further cases of LD were identified over the next three weeks. All cases had a positive <italic>L pneumophila</italic> urinary antigen test, and three patients&#8217; samples were culture-positive for <italic>L pneumophila</italic> serogroup 1. Epidemiological and environmental investigations were undertaken to determine possible sources. A total of 142 environmental samples were collected from potential sources, which included 50 cooling towers on 11 premises. <italic>L pneumophila</italic> serogroup 1 was isolated from samples collected at three cooling towers at two different locations (sites A and B) and a domestic spa pool Clinical and environmental isolates were referred to the Respiratory and Systemic Infection Laboratory, Health Protection Agency, London, for <italic>L pneumophila</italic> monoclonal antibody (mAb) subgrouping followed by a three-allele DNA-sequence-based typing (SBT<sub>3</sub>) method then in use. The SBT<sub>3</sub> profiles for two of the clinical isolates and isolates from two of the cooling towers were indistinguishable, suggesting that the cooling towers were the likely environmental source. The strains were subsequently re-examined using the current seven-allele SBT method,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> with the same outcome.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>DNA extraction and whole genome sequencing</title><p>Seven <italic>L pneumophila</italic> isolates (three clinical and four environmental) were obtained from the reference laboratory where they had been stored at &#8722;80&#176;C with minimal passage since the outbreak.

These five isolates were therefore considered to be the outbreak isolates, though it was not possible to obtain directional information from this analysis owing to the low number of SNPs differentiating isolates; in total, there were less than 15 SNP differences within the outbreak strain cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012002175F1">figure 1</xref>B). Furthermore, the genetic variability between isolates from two cooling tower isolates on site A, and the observation that these intermingled with the clinical isolates on the tree, suggested that some diversity existed in the source population before the onset of the outbreak.

Both strains were located within the outbreak cluster in the phylogenetic tree. The third clinical isolate (LP617) was obtained from a patient who had initially been linked to the outbreak. The original epidemiological investigation found, however, that this patient was a lorry driver, who had passed through Hereford at the time of the outbreak, and had likely acquired his infection elsewhere. This isolate was located distant to the outbreak cluster on the phylogenetic tree, and was therefore not considered to be linked to the outbreak. Thus, for the clinical isolates, the genomic data supported the results of the previous epidemiological investigation.</p><p>Three environmental isolates were located within the outbreak cluster. Two of these (LP056 and LP427) had been collected from two cooling towers at the same location (Site A) while the third environmental isolate (LP467) had been collected from a spa pool in local domestic premises. Given the small number of SNP differences between these three isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012002175F1">figure 1</xref>B), it was not possible to determine which of these isolates represented the source of the outbreak using genomic data alone. The original epidemiological investigation had, however, concluded that the cooling towers on site A were the most likely source.</p><p>The fourth environmental isolate (LP423) was obtained from a cooling tower at a different site (site B), which was considered epidemiologically unlikely to be the source of the outbreak; a view supported by the typing data. This isolate was located away from the outbreak cluster and was most closely related (906 SNPs different) to the Paris strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012002175F1">figure 1</xref>A).</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Comparison of conventional typing and genomic analysis</title><p>We also compared the results of the conventional typing (monoclonal antibody typing and sequence-based typing) with WGS. All of the isolates included in this analysis were <italic>L pneumophila</italic> serogroup 1, apart from the ATCC 43&#8197;290 strain, which was serogroup 12. All of the outbreak strains belonged to the mAb subgroup &#8216;Philadelphia&#8217;, and were ST37. The clinical non-outbreak isolate belonged to the mAb subgroup &#8216;Allentown/France&#8217; and was ST47, whereas the environmental non-outbreak isolate belonged to the mAb subgroup &#8216;Oxford/OLDA&#8217; and was ST1. Thus, in this outbreak, the performance of WGS sequence was equivalent to conventional SBT in differentiating the outbreak from the non-outbreak strains. WGS was unable to distinguish the epidemiologically most likely source of the outbreak (site A cooling towers) from the domestic spa pool.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we have demonstrated the feasibility of using WGS to perform an investigation of a <italic>Legionella</italic> outbreak. Using genomic analysis, we were readily able to distinguish outbreak from non-outbreak <italic>Legionella</italic> isolates, and to identify probable environmental sources, thus supporting the findings of the previous epidemiological investigation. The main advantage of WGS over other typing techniques such as monoclonal antibody typing,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> amplified fragment length polymorphism,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> pulsed-field gel electrophoresis,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> and sequence-based typing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> is that it interrogates the whole genome, thus giving maximum resolution, even within individual sequence types. Current barriers to routine implementation of WGS include the inability to sequence directly from clinical specimens, the lack of availability of comprehensive open-access genomic databases to compare isolates to, the lack of automated data interpretation software to deliver clinically relevant information and the need for cost-benefit analyses of WGS versus the current typing methods.</p><p>We acknowledge several limitations to our study. The study was performed retrospectively and was hampered by the small number of stored <italic>L pneumophila</italic> isolates available for WGS. In the original investigation, we examined multiple isolates from each environmental sample to confirm their phenotype (species, serogroup and monoclonal antibody subgroup). Each sample (and source) contained a single phenotype&#8212;hence only a single colony for each sample was characterised genotypically and archived for later use. For the clinical samples, five colonies were taken from each positive patient sample and characterised phenotypically. Again, only a single phenotype was identified in each patient and hence only a single colony from each was characterised genotypically. This issue remains a challenge for contemporaneous outbreak investigations for two reasons. First, the diagnosis of LD is usually made by the detection of <italic>L pneumophila</italic> urinary antigen, and is often not confirmed by culture of the organism from clinical specimens, which takes 2&#8211;3&#8197;days. Second, environmental samples can take even longer to culture than clinical specimens, and are usually not processed in the same laboratory. Thus, the number of clinical and environmental samples available for typing from <italic>Legionella</italic> outbreaks is likely to be limited.</p><p>Our analysis was also constrained by the limited available information on the genetic variation and population structure of <italic>L pneumophila</italic> at the whole genome level. Environmental and clinical isolates are not evenly distributed in the environment, based on sequence-based typing observations, suggesting that clinical isolates are a distinct subpopulation of environmental strains. Humans are continuously exposed to environmental <italic>Legionellae</italic> and it is not clear why certain sequence types predominate in human disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> One hypothesis is that disease only occurs in those who have increased susceptibility to infection, for example, the elderly, and the immunosuppressed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> Whenever a <italic>Legionella</italic> outbreak occurs, it usually reflects the breakdown of <italic>Legionella</italic> control measures, with human infections occurring as a consequence.</p><p>The genetic diversity of <italic>Legionella</italic> strains within an environmental source, as seen in this analysis, could potentially undermine our ability to link environmental and clinical isolates in an outbreak situation. Thus, a detailed epidemiological investigation accompanied by thorough environmental sampling, sequencing and comparison with patient isolates will continue to be required to confirm the likely source of an outbreak.</p><p>Despite these caveats, our work here demonstrates that this WGS approach can provide highly discriminatory information within a clinically relevant time frame, but requires a parallel epidemiological investigation to rule in or rule out potential environmental sources. This heralds the opportunity of conducting combined epidemiological and genomic outbreak investigations in real-time, as has been performed for other pathogens.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d34e271" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-002175.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d34e272" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-002175.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to acknowledge the authors of the original outbreak investigation and the staff of the Respiratory and Systemic Infection Laboratory, Health Protection Agency, London.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> MET, SJP and TGH conceived and designed the study.
