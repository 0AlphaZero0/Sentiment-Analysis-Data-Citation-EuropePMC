</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Legionella pneumophila causes outbreaks of respiratory infection in community settings and results in significant morbidity and mortality.1 The organism is common in aquatic environments and is spread by aerosol from a contaminated source, often cooling towers and other aerosol-producing devices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Nosocomial outbreaks that are related to contaminated water supplies have also been widely reported.2–4 The diagnosis of Legionnaires’ disease (LD) is based on a compatible clinical syndrome and detection of L pneumophila urinary antigen5 or isolation of the organism from respiratory specimens, which requires culture on selective media.6 Most cases of human infection are caused by L pneumophila serogroup 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>During Legionella outbreaks, clinical and environmental isolates are collected and sent to the reference laboratory for typing.7 Epidemiological investigations are dependent on the rapid identification and typing of the associated organisms in order to identify and control the source of infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Current typing methods include phenotypic (monoclonal antibody subgrouping8) and genotypic (sequence-based typing9) methods, which typically take 1–2 days. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>High-throughput sequencing technology has the potential to rapidly provide information on organism identity and genetic relatedness and has been shown to provide a high degree of discrimination for a range of other bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus,10Mycobacterium tuberculosis,11 Escherichia coli 0104:H412 and Klebsiella pneumoniae.13 We hypothesised that WGS could be used to discriminate outbreak from non-outbreak isolates of L pneumophila in a comparable time frame, and with a higher level of discrimination, when compared with current typing methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we conducted a pilot study to determine the feasibility of using a rapid bench-top sequencing platform (Illumina MiSeq) to retrospectively investigate a Legionella outbreak. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In 2003, an outbreak of LD occurred in Hereford, UK.14 The outbreak started with two community cases that presented with clinical features of infection within a few days of each other, one of whom died. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Active case-finding identified two further cases in the local hospital and a formal outbreak investigation was carried out. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological and environmental investigations were undertaken to determine possible sources. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>A total of 142 environmental samples were collected from potential sources, which included 50 cooling towers on 11 premises. L pneumophila serogroup 1 was isolated from samples collected at three cooling towers at two different locations (sites A and B) and a domestic spa pool Clinical and environmental isolates were referred to the Respiratory and Systemic Infection Laboratory, Health Protection Agency, London, for L pneumophila monoclonal antibody (mAb) subgrouping followed by a three-allele DNA-sequence-based typing (SBT3) method then in use. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The SBT3 profiles for two of the clinical isolates and isolates from two of the cooling towers were indistinguishable, suggesting that the cooling towers were the likely environmental source. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>The sequencing data from the seven samples were mapped to a reference genome, L pneumophila-type strain Philadelphia-1,16 and compared with eight other publicly available L pneumophila genomes (table 1). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>These five isolates were therefore considered to be the outbreak isolates, though it was not possible to obtain directional information from this analysis owing to the low number of SNPs differentiating isolates; in total, there were less than 15 SNP differences within the outbreak strain cluster (figure 1B). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Here, we have demonstrated the feasibility of using WGS to perform an investigation of a Legionella outbreak. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Using genomic analysis, we were readily able to distinguish outbreak from non-outbreak Legionella isolates, and to identify probable environmental sources, thus supporting the findings of the previous epidemiological investigation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>The main advantage of WGS over other typing techniques such as monoclonal antibody typing,8 amplified fragment length polymorphism,19 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis,3 and sequence-based typing9 is that it interrogates the whole genome, thus giving maximum resolution, even within individual sequence types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Current barriers to routine implementation of WGS include the inability to sequence directly from clinical specimens, the lack of availability of comprehensive open-access genomic databases to compare isolates to, the lack of automated data interpretation software to deliver clinically relevant information and the need for cost-benefit analyses of WGS versus the current typing methods. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>We acknowledge several limitations to our study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>The study was performed retrospectively and was hampered by the small number of stored L pneumophila isolates available for WGS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>In the original investigation, we examined multiple isolates from each environmental sample to confirm their phenotype (species, serogroup and monoclonal antibody subgroup). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Each sample (and source) contained a single phenotype—hence only a single colony for each sample was characterised genotypically and archived for later use. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>For the clinical samples, five colonies were taken from each positive patient sample and characterised phenotypically. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Again, only a single phenotype was identified in each patient and hence only a single colony from each was characterised genotypically. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>This issue remains a challenge for contemporaneous outbreak investigations for two reasons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>First, the diagnosis of LD is usually made by the detection of L pneumophila urinary antigen, and is often not confirmed by culture of the organism from clinical specimens, which takes 2–3 days. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Second, environmental samples can take even longer to culture than clinical specimens, and are usually not processed in the same laboratory. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Thus, the number of clinical and environmental samples available for typing from Legionella outbreaks is likely to be limited. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>Our analysis was also constrained by the limited available information on the genetic variation and population structure of L pneumophila at the whole genome level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Environmental and clinical isolates are not evenly distributed in the environment, based on sequence-based typing observations, suggesting that clinical isolates are a distinct subpopulation of environmental strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>Humans are continuously exposed to environmental Legionellae and it is not clear why certain sequence types predominate in human disease.20 One hypothesis is that disease only occurs in those who have increased susceptibility to infection, for example, the elderly, and the immunosuppressed.21 Whenever a Legionella outbreak occurs, it usually reflects the breakdown of Legionella control measures, with human infections occurring as a consequence. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>The genetic diversity of Legionella strains within an environmental source, as seen in this analysis, could potentially undermine our ability to link environmental and clinical isolates in an outbreak situation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Thus, a detailed epidemiological investigation accompanied by thorough environmental sampling, sequencing and comparison with patient isolates will continue to be required to confirm the likely source of an outbreak. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Despite these caveats, our work here demonstrates that this WGS approach can provide highly discriminatory information within a clinically relevant time frame, but requires a parallel epidemiological investigation to rule in or rule out potential environmental sources. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>This heralds the opportunity of conducting combined epidemiological and genomic outbreak investigations in real-time, as has been performed for other pathogens.18 </plain></SENT>
