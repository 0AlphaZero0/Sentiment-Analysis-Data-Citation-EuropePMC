</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Imatinib mesylate (IM) is used as a front-line therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) as it is highly effective in the treatment and management of Philadelphia (Ph) positive CML patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>IM is a selective inhibitor of tyrosine kinase that binds competitively to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) docking site of tyrosine kinase proteins, including ABL itself and the hybrid BCR-ABL proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It also inhibits other tyrosine kinases, such as platelet-derived growth factor receptors KIT and ARG.1 As IM binds to the ATP binding site at the tyrosine kinase active site, it inhibits the transfer of terminal phosphate from ATP to tyrosine residues on its substrates, thus inhibiting the enzyme activity of the tyrosine kinase protein semi-competitively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain can cause resistance to IM by shifting its equilibrium toward the open or active conformation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Some other mutations interfere with a critical hydrogen bond that forms between the ABL 1 kinase domain and inhibitor molecule thus impairing the ability of the BCR-ABL protein to bind to the inhibitor molecule.2 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Even though IM has become the gold standard in front-line treatment of CML, resistance to this drug is a daunting problem. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Develop -ment of resistance to IM has been a setback for patients, as well as for treating physicians in the clinical management of CML patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A patient with CML could display either a primary or secondary resistance to IM therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Primary resistance is defined as inability to achieve any initial landmark response, and secondary response is defined as achieving a good initial response but subsequently losing any relevant response.3 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Development of resistance to IM is a multi-factorial phenomenon in patients with CML and may be mediated by a range of different mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>However, there are 2 broad mechanisms of resistance: BCR-ABL dependent and BCR-ABL independent pathways.4,5BCR-ABL dependent pathways have been reported to be the most common cause of IM resistance which commonly involve mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) of the BCR-ABL gene,6 as well as amplification and overexpression of the BCR-ABL gene locus.7 The present study was designed to clarify the mechanisms of resistance involving BCR-ABL dependent pathways. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>So far, more than 100 mutations have been identified in the tyrosine kinase domain of the BCR-ABL gene.8 Different studies have reported a broad range of frequencies of mutations and this is probably due to the different composition of study cohorts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>But no reports are available from Malaysia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Apart from BCR-ABL mutation, few studies have reported on the amplification of the BCR-ABL gene locus that is associated with IM resistance among CML patients.9 In these rare cases, the presence of multiple copies of the BCR-ABL gene in interphase nuclei were reported in IM resistant patients using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the frequency and pattern of BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations using dHPLC and BCR-ABL gene amplification by FISH on 40 Malaysian CML patients who showed resistance to IM. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>This unique chromosome arrangement, known as Philadelphia chromosome translocation, generates a BCR-ABL fusion gene that encodes a constitutively active tyrosine kinase protein. BCR-ABL fusion gene has now become the universally accepted molecular signature and the transforming event in CML pathogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>The mRNA molecules transcribed from BCR-ABL fusion gene usually contain one of the two BCR-ABL junctions designated as b2a2 (e13a2) and b3a2 (e14a2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>However, both mRNAs translate into p210 Kda fusion protein that may up-regulate the tyrosine kinase activity. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we aimed to examine the frequency distribution and nature of ABL kinase domain mutation in CML patients treated with IM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>The ability to detect mutations in the BCR-ABL1 gene varies depending on the technique used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we used the dHPLC technique for mutation analysis, followed by sequencing to characterize the mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>The dHPLC assay provided a much faster and less expensive method for mutation screening. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Taking advantage of the dHPLC based assay for ABL mutational screening, as well as a sequencing technique, we screened 40 patients who showed resistance to IM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that ABL kinase mutations are a relevant mechanism of resistance to IM in 32.5% of Malaysian CML patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Worldwide, researchers have detected quite a number of mutations within the BCR-ABL fusion domain among IM resistant CML patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>In the present study on 40 Malaysian CML patients showing IM resistance, we detected a total of five different point mutations all leading to amino acid substitutions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Most of these mutations were found to be located at the functional fraction of the BCR-ABL fusion protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Point mutations in ABL kinase domain have been characterized into two groups:13 1) mutations that impede contact between BCR-ABL and IM; and 2) mutations that alter the spatial conformation of the protein.7 The BCR-ABL structure contains two flexible loop structures, the adenosine triphosphate-binding phosphate loop and the activation loop, which have specific arrangement in the inactive conformation of BCR-ABL that stabilizes the structure.9 According to Litzow, IM mutations in these loops destabilize their arrangement such that the kinase domain cannot assume the inactive conformation required for IM binding.9 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Mutations located in the IM contact point were reported to significantly reduce IM sensitivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Normally, these amino acids make hydrogen bonds with IM; therefore, the mutations occurring in one of the amino acids might be causing resistance.2 This type of mutation was found in 8 of our patients who showed T315I mutation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>From the literature reviewed, T315I was found to be the most common mutation reported worldwide and it also happened to be the most common mutation (70%) among the IM resistant CML patients in the present study.14â16 In T315I mutation, a polar amino acid that participated in hydrogen bonds (threonine) is substituted with isoleucine, which is the hydrophobic amino acid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Thus, this single amino acid substitution has been reported to interfere with a critical hydrogen bond that forms between the ABL 1 kinase domain and IM.2 This allocated binding prevented the IM inhibition of BCR-ABL1 and conferred resistance to IM. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>The detection of BCR-ABL T315I mutation in the present study is clinically relevant. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>Indeed, residue 315 seems to be critical for binding most adenosine triphosphate-competitive kinase inhibitors because BCR-ABL T315I confers resistance to 2nd generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as nilotinib and many other drugs.17 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>The residues of nucleotide binding loop (p-loop) were reported to be from 247 to 256.19 In our study, 2 patients showed different p-loop mutations which were Y253H and E255K mutations, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Both of these mutations were predicted to be possibly damaging by using the PolyPhen2 program. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Patients with mutated p-loop BCR-ABL domain have been reported to be 70 to 100-fold less sensitive to IM compared to native BCR-ABL.20 Other than that, mutations at the activation loop (a-loop) that include the residues from 381 until 402 in ABL have also been reported to cause different levels of IM sensitivity among CML patients.21 However, none of our patients harbored this type of mutation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Location of a mutation in a protein sequence may reflect the effect to the protein functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Due to evolution, some proteins that play a similar biological function in different species may have significantly different protein sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>However, part of the protein sequences in most species is preserved to retain the 3-dimensional structure, as well as the structure that is critical for conducting the biological function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Thus, these parts of protein sequences are usually conserved across species.22 The multi-alignment of human ABL1 protein with its orthologs among various species, using the ClustalX program (version 2.0.12), showed that all five mutations (T315I, M351T, E255K, Y253H and V289F) that we identified in our patients are conserved among species in a highly conserved block (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>From this, it is reasonable to presume that these mutations may lead to alteration of the BCR-ABL protein structure or important structure for its biological function that may affect the action of IM on this protein. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>The RT-PCR amplification of the TKD domain of the BCR-ABL gene in this study was performed by employing the primers described by Soverini et al. which covers only codon 206â421.12 Even though most of BCR-ABL mutations reported worldwide occurred in the TKD, mutations in the region of codon 421â500 which encode C-terminal lobe (i.e. E453K, Y456C and K459Q) have also been reported.23 Apart from the c-terminal, it has been reported that mutations could also occur at the SH2âSH3 domain (i.e. A196V, R47C and K84N).24 Unfortunately, in the current study, these 2 regions were not included in mutation screening. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Had these 2 regions also been screened for mutations, it is probable that the mutation frequency would have been higher. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Thus, for a better overview of the BCR-ABL mutation, apart from the tyrosine kinase domain, both c-terminal and SH2âSH3 domain regions should also be taken into consideration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>From these results, it is clear that the BCR-ABL mutations contributed at least in part to resistance to IM in 32.5% of our patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>However, in those patients without kinase domain mutations, it is likely that additional factors may also contribute to resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 27 patients who did not show any mutations, the contribution of BCR-ABL gene amplification in mediating resistance was investigated using FISH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>But none of these 27 patients showed any BCR-ABL gene amplification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>It is presumed that in these 27 CML patients, the mechanism of resistance to IM might be due to BCR-ABL independent pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Another possibility could be the lower sensitivity of the FISH method. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>The FISH probes used are significantly larger than the BCR-ABL fusion region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the gene amplification of BCR-ABL might not always be visible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the usage of quantitative PCR performed on DNA is highly recommended to detect BCR-ABL gene amplification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that BCR-ABL mutations are not the only major mechanisms of resistance to IM in Malaysian CML patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Additional factors besides kinase domain mutations may also contribute to resistance to IM and this means we need to find out what other predominant mechanisms of IM resistance are involved. </plain></SENT>
