</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common childhood viral infection characterized by mucocutaneous papulovesicular lesions on the hands, feet, mouth and buttocks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The disease is primarily caused by human enterovirus group A (HEV-A) members, which belong to the Picornaviridae family. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>HEV-A consists of many viruses, including Coxsackievirus A (CA) 2, CA3, CA4, CA5, CA6, CA7, CA8, CA10, CA12, CA14, CA16 and Enterovirus (EV) 71. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Of these, EV71 and CA16 are the major etiologic agents of HFMD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In general, typical HFMD cases are mild and self-limited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>However, during recent years, it was frequently reported that patients with EV71 infection had severe complications such as acute flaccid paralysis, myocarditis, aseptic meningitis, brainstem encephalitis, neurogenic pulmonary edema and fatal encephalitis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>CA16-associated HFMD with severe complications is rarely observed in clinics [1], [2], [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>EV71 outbreaks have occurred in the Asia-Pacific region and have become an important public health concern since 1997 [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The earliest known case of HFMD in China was diagnosed in Shanghai in 1981, and there were subsequently a number of reports of HFMD in most Chinese provinces. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>A retrospective seroepidemiologic study suggested that EV71 and CA16 had widely circulated in mainland China for a long time [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The first HFMD outbreak caused by EV71 was reported in 2007 [6] and it was closely followed by the nationwide HFMD epidemics, which started in Anhui Province in 2008 and subsequently spread quickly to other provinces [7], . </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Since then there have been annual increases in the number of cases reported, with 1.8 million cases and 905 deaths in 2010 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chinacdc.cn/tjsj/fdcrbbg/">http://www.chinacdc.cn/tjsj/fdcrbbg/</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>EV71-associated HFMD has received considerable attention from clinicians and public health officials in China, and HFMD was classified as a category C notifiable infectious disease by the Ministry of Health of China in May 2008. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In the Beijing area, a low incidence of HFMD lasted for over 20 years until the nationwide epidemics in 2008, and many HFMD cases have been reported. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>However, the cause for the sudden national outbreaks remains unclear, and there are currently no effective drugs or vaccines to treat or prevent HFMD. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In the Asia-Pacific region, the dominant EV71 strains circulating in different countries and regions vary genetically, suggesting that different genetic lineages are undergoing rapid evolutionary change [10], [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Additionally, almost all outbreaks reported in the Asia-Pacific region during the last decade were caused by previously unidentified EV71 subgenotypes or variants of re-emerging subgenotypes [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidence suggested that recombination events could drive the evolution of new genetic lineages [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>However, in China, nearly all of the related reports have focused on EV71 C4, which is believed to have been circulating predominantly and persistently in China since 1998 [6], [7], [8], [9], [14], [15], [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>This circulating pattern of unique subgenotype of EV71 C4 differed significantly from the situation of neighboring areas, in which there has been co-circulation or transition of several genotypes during the EV71 epidemics [13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze HFMD pathogens circulating in the Beijing area and their genetic features. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Clinical specimens were collected from HFMD patients between 2007 and 2009 in Beijing, China, and etiologic agents of the disease were identified by RT-PCR specific to the 5â²UTR and a partial region of VP1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic analysis on complete VP1 sequences of the EV71 Beijing strains was performed to investigate their evolution and molecular epidemiology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Our results may provide useful information to explain the sudden outbreak of HFMD and provide insights into disease control. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>In this study, the EV71 genotype A strains appeared to be separated into two lineages, suggesting that the Chinese EV71 genotype A strains might circulate in mainland China and evolve through two evolutionary chains. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>VP1 is an important protein for viral pathogenicity and is involved in the constitution of the canyon on the surfaces of picornaviruses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Variations in the amino acids of VP1, especially on the inter-surface of the canyon, can likely influence the binding of the virus to its receptor and thus change virus pathogenicity. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Nishimura et al found that 145E of VP1 might be exposed on the surface of the capsid VP1 protein and could affect receptor binding [23], which has been identified as a major virulence determinant in mouse models [24], [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>A recent molecular analysis for the virulent determinants of EV71 indicated that 145G/145Q/145R and 164E, located in the DE and EF loops at the surface of the canyon of VP1, could enhance EV71 virulence in humans [26]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>In combination with previous reports, our results may imply that these amino acids (31N, 145E and 164G) of VP1 in all genotype A strains, except for BrCr, might influence the binding ability of virus to the host, and the mutations might link to the central nervous system tropism of EV71. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Since 1998, almost all reports of EV71 strains in mainland China have been associated with subgenogroup C4 [6], [7], [8], [9], [14], [15], [16], [27], [28], [29], [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>This is quite different from that observed in neighboring countries and regions including Malaysia, Singapore, Japan, and Taiwan, where co-circulation and/or transition of different subgenotypes of EV71 strains occurred during the epidemics [2], [11], [31], [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>In the phylogenetic tree, we observed that the Chinese EV71 subgenotype C4 strains displayed predominant, independent and endemical evolution over the past 14 years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Based on genome analysis, it was found that the EV71 C4 stains circulating in mainland China since 1998 were recombinants of EV71 and CA16 G10 [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Tee et al proposed that CA16 is the probable ancestor of EV71 [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Some recent reports indicated that the Chinese C4 EV71 strains evolve persistently in mainland China since they occurred as a novel subgenotype from around 1992 to 1993 [12], [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Our phylogenetic analysis suggested that the Chinese EV71 subgenotype C4 strains evolve endemicity with probable occasional lineage migration among global locations due to travel or business activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>For instance, some EV71 C4 strains were also distributed in European countries in 2004 and 2005 and some Asian countries and regions from 1997 to 2008. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>The Chinese EV71 strains with the available locality and time distribution exhibited a step-wise evolutionary trajectory through time and the subgenotype C4 EV71 BJ strains did not appear to localize to Beijing; rather, these strains displayed a nationwide pattern, as reported in Guangdong Province [8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>In the phylogenetic tree, the subdivision of subgenotype C4 correlated with the time of virus isolation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>C4 viruses displayed 3 phases during their persistent evolution: the early phase, C4b, from 1997 to 2008; the intermediate phase, C4a-1, from 2003 to 2009; and the last phase, C4a-2, from 2007 to 2011. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Most members of the C4b group were similar to the C4b subgenotype reported by Zhang [6], while the C4a cluster tended to be further divided into two parts in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>The results implied that genetic changes persisted during the circulation of subgenotype C4 EV71 strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>In addition to a few strains from the 2007 HFMD Shandong outbreak and the Neimeng epidemic, the proposed C4a-2 lineage mostly consists of strains that were detected during and after the 2008 HFMD national outbreaks, including some BJ strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>This clustering indicated that some EV71 strains circulating in mainland China actually had a tendency to group into a new clade C4a-2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Recent reports revealed that there was exponential growth of the EV71 virus population in 2007 and 2008 in mainland China [16], [33] and the continued replacement of viral lineages occurred through time [33] as we found in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>We speculate that the potential new cluster transition may have occurred during the 2007 local outbreak in Shandong Province. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the viruses of the new C4a-2 strains spread throughout the nation and gradually replaced the intermediate strains of the C4a-1 to become the predominant virus circulating in mainland China since the 2008 national HFMD outbreaks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Previous epidemiology surveys have demonstrated that certain novel EV71 subgenogroups may play a major role in the epidemic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we suggest that the potential new evolutionary sublineage C4a-2 might be correlated with the widespread HFMD outbreaks in mainland China that have occurred since 2008. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>This is supported by a recent study by Tan X., who considered that the most recent descendant from C4a was chiefly responsible for the current large outbreaks [16]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>In 2008, EV71 had a detection rate of 56% compared to the 22% detection rate for CA16. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>This was consistent with a report [8] in which EV71 (59%) and CA16 (26%) were considered to be the major pathogens involved in the large HFMD outbreak in Guangdong Province of China in 2008. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>The similar detection rates recorded from Beijing and Guangdong Province indicated that during the 2008 national HFMD outbreak, EV71 may have replaced CA16 to become the major causative agent primarily responsible for the 2008 Beijing HFMD outbreak. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>In 2009, the EV71 subgenotype C4 co-circulated with the emerging genotype A members in this city, while EV71 and CA16 were still the major pathogens of HFMD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Increases in genetic diversity are correlated with the onset of epidemics [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Similar to what was found in other cities in mainland China [6], [7], [28], [34], the co-circulation of other types of EVs and different genotypes of EV71 also recently increased in the Beijing area. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of genetic recombination is a common event when multiple epidemic strains are circulating simultaneously and the reverse mutations of some amino acid residues in EV71 VP1 protein are also found recently [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to the causative agents that co-circulate during HFMD outbreaks to track the potential emergence and spread of novel recombinants or reverse mutants and the probable related epidemics. </plain></SENT>
