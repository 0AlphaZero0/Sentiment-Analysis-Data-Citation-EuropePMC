</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The bovine pancreatic RNase A superfamily comprises a group of homologous proteins that has been intensely targeted in biochemical, structural, enzymatic and evolutionary studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Angiogenin (Ang, a 14-kDa protein), an unusual member of the superfamily, is a potent inducer of blood vessel formation that was first isolated from the conditioned medium of cultured HT-29 human colon adenocarcinoma cells based solely on its angiogenic activity 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The overall structure of human Ang (hAng), as determined by Acharya et al. 2, not only showed it to have a structural fold similar to that of RNase A 3, but also revealed it to be markedly different in several distinct areas. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>It can stimulate angiogenesis and, although the ribonucleolytic activity of the protein is rather weak, it is critical for its angiogenic properties 4,5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Studies with Ang antagonists in athymic mice pointed to a critical role played by this protein in the formation of some human tumours 6–9 and its increased expression has been correlated with diverse cancers in several clinical studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The ang gene was the first loss-of-function gene identified in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the selective destruction of motor neurons 10–13. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>More recently, ang has also been shown to be implicated in Parkinson's disease 13. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The different mutations identified and characterized so far have all proven to be loss-of-function mutations 14–16. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>A detailed structure–function study by Thiyagarajan et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>2012 on several of these Ang-ALS variants provided the first insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying their role in ALS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Ang, however, has a nonpathological function to play as well, being a constituent of normal plasma 18 and a secreted product of a wide variety of normal cells 19,20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Indeed, endogenous Ang is a general requirement for cell proliferation and angiogenesis 21. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>It has been observed that four different aspects of Ang are required for its angiogenicity: (a) ribonucleolytic activity; (b) stimulation of basement membrane degradation; (c) stimulation of signal transduction; and (d) nuclear translocation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Both the enzymatic and angiogenic activities of hAng are inhibited by its interaction with a 50-kDa leucine-rich repeat protein, human placental RNase inhibitor (hRI) (Ki &lt; 1 fm) 22. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The crystal structure of hRI–hAng 23, in conjunction with mutagenesis studies 24–26, provided insight into the residues involved from both hAng and hRI with respect to forming this extremely tight association. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Despite a wealth of information already gathered for the role of human Ang, there are practical limitations in studying the role of the human protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The murine Ang system, on the other hand, offers an alternative route for studying the physiological and developmental roles of Ang in greater depth. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The murine Ang family, over the course of evolution, has expanded to accommodate six members: mAng (the murine orthologue of hAng), mAng-2 (also known as mAngRP or mAng-related protein), mAng-3, mAng-4, mAng-5 and mAng-6 27–31 (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Evolutionary studies by Codoñer et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>2010 suggest that there is functional divergence amongst the mAng paralogues even though the 3D models for the proteins are extremely similar. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Experiments have shown that mAng, mAng-3 and mAng-4 have angiogenic activities comparable to that of hAng, whereas mAng-2 is not angiogenic 33–35. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>It has also been shown mAng-4 functions as a Paneth cell-derived antimicrobial peptide important in epithelial host defence in the small intestine 36. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>mAng-4 is also expressed by the goblet cells of the large intestine after bacterial infection and this expression is controlled by interleukin-3 37. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>At present, only the crystal structures of mAng and mAng-4 35,38 are known, and the topologies of the two murine enzymes are highly similar to those of hAng and RNase A 2,3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Previously, we presented in-depth analysis of the structure–function relationships of mAng and mAng-4 by means of site-directed mutagenesis 35,38. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we present the X-ray crystal structures of mAng-2 and mAng-3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>We have examined the similarities and differences that these two structures have with the structures of the other two murine paralogues, as well as that of human Ang. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Insights gained through comparative analyses of the available structural and functional data provide a means for probing the structure–function relationships amongst the different Ang homologues. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>In this regard, the fortuitous positioning of the sulfate ions in mAng-2 may provide some clues to the possible mode of heparin binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>The above findings suggest that hAng might form dimers to interact with the anionic heparin chain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>The cell-binding site is critical for nuclear translocation of angiogenin and it may be that internalization of angiogenin is inhibited upon interaction with heparin as a result of the recruitment of residues from the cell-binding region. </plain></SENT>
