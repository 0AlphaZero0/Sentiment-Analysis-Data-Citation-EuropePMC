Folate degradation products para-aminobenzoylglutamate (pABG) and para-acetamidobenzoylglutamate (apABG) in 24 hour urine have recently been shown to correlate with blood folate.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim</title><p>Since blood sampling and collection of 24 hour urine are cumbersome, we investigated whether the determination of urinary folate catabolites in fasted spot urine is a suitable non-invasive biomarker for folate status in subjects before and during folic acid supplementation.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Design and Methods</title><p>Immediate effects of oral folic acid bolus intake on urinary folate catabolites were assessed in a short-term pre-study. In the main study we included 53 healthy men. Of these, 29 were selected for a 12 week folic acid supplementation (400 &#181;g). Blood, 24 hour and spot urine were collected at baseline and after 6 and 12 weeks and PF, RCF, urinary apABG and pABG were determined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Intake of a 400 &#181;g folic acid bolus resulted in immediate increase of urinary catabolites. In the main study pABG and apABG concentrations in spot urine correlated well with their excretion in 24 hour urine. In healthy men consuming habitual diet, pABG showed closer correlation with PF (r<sub>s</sub>&#8202;=&#8202;0.676) and RCF (r<sub>s</sub>&#8202;=&#8202;0.649) than apABG (r<sub>s</sub>&#8202;=&#8202;0.264, ns and 0.543). Supplementation led to significantly increased folate in plasma and red cells as well as elevated urinary folate catabolites, while only pABG correlated significantly with PF (r<sub>s</sub>&#8202;=&#8202;0.574) after 12 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Quantification of folate catabolites in fasted spot urine seems suitable as a non-invasive alternative to blood or 24 hour urine analysis for evaluation of folate status in populations consuming habitual diet. In non-steady-state conditions (folic acid supplementation) correlations between folate marker (RCF, PF, urinary catabolites) decrease due to differing kinetics.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported financially by the &#8220;Kompetenznetz Adipositas&#8221; (&#8220;Competence Network for Adiposity&#8221;) funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (FKZ: 01GI1126).

RCF is considered as a long term marker as the red blood cell folate pool turns over slowly <xref rid="pone.0056194-Daly1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0056194-Pietrzik1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.

In contrast, circulating PF changes rapidly after folate intake <xref rid="pone.0056194-PrinzLangenohl2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Gregory et al. <xref rid="pone.0056194-Gregory1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and McPartlin et al. <xref rid="pone.0056194-McPartlin1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> demonstrated that folates are catabolized in the liver to para-aminobenzoylglutamate (pABG), which is excreted in urine predominantly after acetylation to para-acetamidobenzoylglutamate (apABG). Folate catabolite excretion in urine decreases with low dietary folate intake and increases after folate supplementation <xref rid="pone.0056194-Wolfe1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Thus, similar to RCF and PF, the urinary folate catabolites pABG and apABG might reflect folate status.</p><p>Only limited data are currently available comparing blood folate contents with urinary folate catabolite excretion. Kim et al. <xref rid="pone.0056194-Kim2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> analyzed folate catabolite excretion, blood folate status markers and dietary folate intake and found significant correlations between these markers. Wolfe et al. <xref rid="pone.0056194-Wolfe1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> determined blood and urine markers in postmenopausal women on controlled diets with deficient and adequate folate content and found a significant correlation between the sum of pABG and apABG excretion in urine and PF. While these findings suggest a close relationship between blood folate and urinary catabolite excretion during low folate intake, the correlation has not been fully investigated during folic acid supplementation.</p><p>Wolfe et al. and Kim et al. <xref rid="pone.0056194-Wolfe1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0056194-Kim2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> studied relations between folate catabolite excretion in 24 hour urine and blood folates.</p><p>Collection of blood samples as well as 24 hour urine are laborious, costly and invasive and 24 hour urine collection may be impaired by loss of volume or degradation of analytes over time <xref rid="pone.0056194-Mann1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0056194-Harris1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Therefore we studied the relation between urinary folate catabolite concentrations relative to creatinine in spot urine samples and folate levels in plasma and red blood cells. Although diurnal variations are averaged out by 24 hour collection, there are still indications that daily excretion of urinary pABG and apABG may not only be determined by long-term folate storage but also influenced by short-term folic acid intake <xref rid="pone.0056194-Mnch1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Thus, we evaluated the relationship between urinary folate catabolites and blood folate markers in healthy males before (baseline) and during a 12 week period of folic acid supplement intake. Prior to this, short-term effects of a folic acid bolus on urinary catabolite concentrations were studied to evaluate limitations that have to be observed for collection of eligible spot urine. The calculated ratio between folate catabolites pABG and apABG (ratio<sub>p/ap</sub>) was furthermore used to detect potentially biased spot urine.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Participants</title><p>The sample size estimation was performed for the baseline study.

Thus, 53 apparently healthy men were enrolled into the baseline study to compensate for eventually later detected exclusion criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056194-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

The research protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Munich and the study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov under NCT00689949. Requirements for inclusion into the study were no reported diagnosis of intestinal, renal or thyroid disease, normal full blood count, no alcohol or drug abuse (max 1 alcoholic drink per day), and no concurrent participation in other clinical studies. Medication during the last three month, which was assumed to interfere with folate status, was an exclusion criterion. Test persons having a regular consumption of vitamin supplements (including folate) were not excluded, since we aimed to cover a wide range of folate levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study Design and Sample Collection</title><p>Data were collected between May and October 2008. The baseline study included two examinations, 21 days apart. Each examination was arranged in the morning after &#8805;12 hours of fasting. After discarding the first morning void urine at home, the second fasted spontaneous urine was collected in urine containers (70 mL, Sarstedt, Germany) at the study center (Division of Metabolic and Nutritional Medicine, Dr. von Hauner Children&#8217;s Hospital, Medical Center of Ludwig Maximilians University, Munich, Germany). Directly after collection urines were centrifuged (2000&#215;g, 5 min) or filtered (syringe filter 25 mm, 0.2 &#181;m nylon membrane, VWR, Germany), then aliquoted and stored at &#8722;80&#176;C. Previous experiments in our laboratory had shown that folate catabolites were stable in urine for more than five days at room temperature. (Niesser et al., submitted) At the same time blood samples were collected in tubes containing EDTA and heparin (EDTA-, Heparin Monovette, Sarstedt, Germany). For determination of whole blood folate, 100 &#181;L of heparinized, whole blood was mixed with 900 &#181;L fresh ascorbic acid solution (1%) for hemolyzation in the dark (30 min) and stored at &#8722;80&#176;C. After centrifugation of Heparin-Monovettes (1700&#215;g, 5 min), the plasma was aliquoted into Eppendorf tubes and stored at &#8722;80&#176;C until analysis of PF.</p><p>24 hour urine was collected during the day and night preceding the second examination in a light protecting urine bottle (Urisafe, 3.0 L PP, VWR, Germany) prefilled with 30 mL hydrochloric acid (1N) for limitation of microbial growth and preservation of sample quality. Total urine volume was recorded for each participant. After centrifugation or filtration, urine aliquots were stored at &#8722;80&#176;C until analysis.</p><p>From the participants of the baseline study the fifteen participants having the lowest RCF concentration and the fourteen subjects having the highest RCF concentration, determined in the baseline study, were included in the subsequent intervention with folic acid (intervention study) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056194-g001">Figure 1</xref>). They consumed 400 &#181;g folic acid (Folverlan, 0.4 mg, Verla-Pharm, Germany) daily for twelve weeks. Morning spot urine and blood samples were collected after 6 and 12 weeks of supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056194-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>For the investigation of urinary folate catabolite excretion shortly after folate ingestion, a two day short-term study was conducted, including seven apparently healthy, lean volunteers. At day one, participants delivered urine samples four times during a fasting period of three hours, starting with the second fasted urine, taken in the morning after an overnight fasting period. Urine samples two, three and four were collected one, two and three hours after the first urine collection. Experimental conditions on day two were identical to day one, but after collection of the first urine sample a 400 &#181;g folic acid tablet (Folverlan, 0.4 mg, Verla-Pharm, Germany) was ingested.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Urine Analysis</title><p>Urine folate catabolites pABG and apABG were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass-spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (Niesser et al., submitted). Briefly, 80 &#181;L urine were transferred into a well plate which was pre-filled with acetonitrile, methanol and hydrochloric acid containing (<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>)apABG (synthesized according to Sokoro et al. <xref rid="pone.0056194-Sokoro1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>) and (<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>)pABG (synthesized according to Niesser et al., submitted) as internal standards. The well plate was shaken and cooled for protein precipitation before centrifugation. The supernatants were transferred into a second well plate and dried under nitrogen. For derivatization samples were re-dissolved in 3N-butanolic hydrogen chloride and incubated at 60&#176;C for 10 min. Derivatization was stopped by cooling on crushed ice, butanolic hydrogen chloride was evaporated under nitrogen and after taking up the derivates into methanol, water and formic acid (50&#8758;50&#8758;0.1), samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS (Agilent Technologies 1200SL series HPLC system, Germany; API 4000 QTrap, AB Sciex, Germany). Chromatography was performed on an Agilent Zorbax SB C18 column (2.1&#215;50 mm, particle size 1.8 &#181;m, Agilent, Germany). Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization with mass transitions 379 &#8594; 120, 381 &#8594; 120, 384 &#8594; 120, 421 &#8594; 162, 426 &#8594; 165, were used for detection of pABG, (<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>)pABG, (<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>)pABG, <bold><italic>apABG and</italic></bold> (<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>)apABG, respectively.

The lowest calibrator concentration was considered as the lower limit of quantification of folate in the assay (PF: 2.3 nmol/L; urinary folate: 2.9 nmol/L). RCF was calculated from whole-blood and plasma folate concentrations and hematocrit. Analyses described below were performed at the Institute for Clinical Chemistry, University of Munich, Medical Center. Determination of hematocrit was done using a Sysmex XT 1800i fluorescence flow cytometer (Sysmex, Germany). Concentrations of homocysteine in EDTA-plasma and Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> in serum were determined using a fully automated competitive chemiluminescence immunoassay on an AVIDA Centaur XP immunoassay System (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Germany). Vitamin B<sub>6</sub> was analyzed as pyridoxal-5&#8242;-phosphate from EDTA-blood using a chromatographic method (Vitamin B<sub>6</sub> reagent kit for HPLC analysis, Chromsystems, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Criteria for Exclusion of Baseline and Intervention Study Data</title><p>Two of the initially recruited 53 participants were excluded from statistical analysis because of elevated liver enzymes (serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) &gt;60 U/L <xref rid="pone.0056194-Bozbas1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>). For technical reasons RCF concentrations from six participants at the second baseline examination were not available and concentrations from the first examination were used instead of means. Only the first examination was included for two participants, as a ratio<sub>p/ap</sub>&gt;0.7 was found at the second examination indicating potential bias of urinary folate catabolite concentrations by folate intake shortly before sampling (see paragraph on short-term study). Accordingly, also the 24 hour urines of these two participants were excluded. Data of four participants at week 6 and three at week 12 of the intervention were excluded from statistical analysis for the same reason. One subject did not participate at the week 12 examination. Finally, 51 subjects were statistically analyzed at baseline and 25 at weeks 6 and 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056194-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Means per participant were calculated as baseline concentration for all determined blood and urine analytes from examination one and two if valid results were available for both time points.

For evaluation of folate catabolites concentrations in 24 hour urine were correlated with those in spot urine and both with blood folate concentrations at baseline and during supplementation in the intervention study, respectively. As data was not normally distributed, Spearman&#8217;s non-parametric rank correlation was used to analyze relations of biochemical parameters within the baseline and intervention study. (Spearman&#8217;s rank correlation coefficient hereinafter is abbreviated as r<sub>s</sub>.) Wilcoxon&#8217;s rank test was applied for evaluating changes by supplementation in the short-term study and in the intervention study.

Thus, the 300% increase of urinary pABG concentration after folic acid ingestion in the short-term study could be mainly due to fast breakdown of folic acid.

The lowest observed ratio<sub>p/ap</sub> in dosed state was 0.65 and the highest in non-dosed state was 0.70.

PF and RCF concentration were significantly correlated to urinary folate in spot urine and 24 hour urine at baseline (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0056194-t001">Table 1</xref>). After 12 week of folic acid supplementation, PF correlated with urinary folate in spot urine (r<sub>s</sub>&#8202;=&#8202;0.420, p&lt;0.05). Compared to urinary folate catabolites, measuring urine folate for estimation of folate status has several important disadvantages: Urinary folates are much less stable than folate catabolites <xref rid="pone.0056194-Hannisdal1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> and therefore determination in large-scale studies is likely to be severely biased by sampling conditions. Urinary folates are also much more influenced by immediate dietary intake of folates <xref rid="pone.0056194-KownackiBrown1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> warranting very strict control of sample timing. On the other hand, folate catabolites, namely apABG, are better correlated to mid-term folate storage pools (RBC folate, tissue folate <xref rid="pone.0056194-Stites1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, in contrast to urinary folate which follows short-term variations in plasma folate.</p><p>82.4% of all participants had homocysteine levels lower than 15 &#181;mol/L, which is recommended for adults <xref rid="pone.0056194-Refsum1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0056194-Herrmann1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Only one participant showed a homocysteine level above 30 &#181;mol/L, which indicated hyperhomocysteinemia <xref rid="pone.0056194-Refsum1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. While significant negative correlation (r<sub>s</sub>&#8202;=&#8202;&#8722;0.420; p&lt;0.001) between PF and homocysteine was found, there was no significant correlation between RCF and homocysteine in plasma at baseline. As observed previously <xref rid="pone.0056194-Wald1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, homocysteine levels decreased significantly (p&lt;0.05) during supplementation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0056194-t002">Table 2</xref>). Wald et al. <xref rid="pone.0056194-Wald1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> reported lately that the higher a subject&#8217;s initial homocysteine level, the larger it&#8217;s decrease in response to folic acid supplementation. According to that we also detected slightly higher response to the 12 week daily folic acid intake in a subgroup with elevated homocysteine levels at baseline (homocysteine &gt;15 &#181;mol/L), while subjects with normal baseline values (&lt;15 &#181;mol/L) exhibited only minor changes of plasma homocysteine during intervention. As Lobo et al. <xref rid="pone.0056194-Lobo1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> already observed in a group taking 400 &#181;g folic acid per day, decrease of homocysteine levels directly after starting supplementation in our subjects was higher (p&lt;0.05) than those between week 6 and 12 of daily folic acid intake (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0056194-t002">Table 2</xref>).

Since no significant correlations between vitamins B<sub>6</sub> and B<sub>12</sub> and blood and urine based markers of folate status were detected, we assumed that these vitamins did not influence the relationship between folate status markers.</p></sec><sec id="s3i"><title>Limitations of the Study</title><p>A major shortcoming of the current study, which only studied well-nourished Europeans (Germans), was that none of the subjects exhibited clearly in-adequate folate status, i.e. all individuals had RBC folate concentrations &gt;400 nmol/L. Due to this limitation, we were not able to determine cut-of values of urinary folate catabolites indicating inadequate folate status.</p><p>Further investigations in populations with insufficient folate intake might provide information for determining such cut-off points.</p><p>The inclusion of healthy middle-aged men only, which somewhat limits generalizability of results, was guided by the intention of providing the most homogenous study population for systematically addressing baseline variation and intervention effects. Including women might have led to a more inhomogeneous group (due to folate-containing oral contraceptives <xref rid="pone.0056194-Bart1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, pregnancy or lactation <xref rid="pone.0056194-West1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>) and studying children seemed ethically inappropriate.</p><p>Using LC-MS/MS for analysis of folate catabolites might seem to limit availability of the proposed assay to specialized laboratories, but this technology stands out in delivering an unprecedented combination of sensitivity and selectivity with relatively low costs per sample. Furthermore, LC-MS/MS has become more and more widely available in recent years, since it has already been introduced into routine laboratories <xref rid="pone.0056194-Schulze1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3j"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results in non-folic acid supplemented subjects show that urinary pABG normalized to creatinine in spot urine is more closely related to PF than apABG whereas urinary concentrations of both folate catabolites showed comparable correlations with RCF. This suggests that pABG/creatinine in spot urine is suitable as a non-invasive biomarker for folate status. A fasting period of more than 12 hours before sampling of the second fasted morning spot urine is recommended to exclude overestimation of folate status due to recent folate intake. The property of folate catabolites to be stable at ambient temperature in urine samples for several days makes collection of urine samples an attractive choice for non-invasive field studies. In general, measuring folate catabolites instead of folates involves much less variation due to sampling and measurement errors since folate catabolites do not share the well-known chemical instability of folate species. The ratio of pABG to apABG in urine appears to be a suitable marker of sampling conditions compliance. This ratio is rapidly increased by oral intake of folates enabling identification and exclusion of biased urine samples not suitable for reliable estimation of folate status. Folic acid supplementation up to 12 weeks attenuates correlations between urinary and blood folate markers. Thus, only the fast adapting folate compartment PF can be probed non-invasively during supplementation by pABG determination in urine while RCF and apABG seem to reflect different slowly adapting pools.</p><p>Our results suggest further investigation of the relationship between folate status-related disease risks and pABG and apABG in spot urine of subjects with habitual folate intake, since it potentially may replace invasive blood sampling as well as error-prone 24 hour urine collection in medical diagnosis and clinical trials.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s4"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0056194.s001"><label>Document S1</label><caption><p>
