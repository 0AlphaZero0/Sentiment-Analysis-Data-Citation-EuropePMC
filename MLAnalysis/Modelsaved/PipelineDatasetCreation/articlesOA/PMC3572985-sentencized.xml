</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Suboptimal folate status is related to higher risks of neural tube defects [1], [2], decline of cognitive performance in dementia and Alzheimer’s disease [3], depression [4], heart diseases, increased homocysteine levels [5], [6], [7] and cancer risks [8], [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Recently higher folate status has been associated with growth and progression of preexisting cancerous lesions [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], which raises concerns in respect to excessively high folate intakes and underscores the relevance of the determination of folate status for the identification of increased disease risks. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Red blood cell folate (RCF) and plasma folate (PF) levels are widely accepted direct biochemical indicators of folate status, but determination requires blood sampling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>RCF is considered as a long term marker as the red blood cell folate pool turns over slowly [2], [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>It represents folate stores [2], [15] and is widely used as a marker of folate status. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In contrast, circulating PF changes rapidly after folate intake [16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Gregory et al. [17] and McPartlin et al. [18] demonstrated that folates are catabolized in the liver to para-aminobenzoylglutamate (pABG), which is excreted in urine predominantly after acetylation to para-acetamidobenzoylglutamate (apABG). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Folate catabolite excretion in urine decreases with low dietary folate intake and increases after folate supplementation [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Thus, similar to RCF and PF, the urinary folate catabolites pABG and apABG might reflect folate status. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Only limited data are currently available comparing blood folate contents with urinary folate catabolite excretion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Kim et al. [20] analyzed folate catabolite excretion, blood folate status markers and dietary folate intake and found significant correlations between these markers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Wolfe et al. [19] determined blood and urine markers in postmenopausal women on controlled diets with deficient and adequate folate content and found a significant correlation between the sum of pABG and apABG excretion in urine and PF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>While these findings suggest a close relationship between blood folate and urinary catabolite excretion during low folate intake, the correlation has not been fully investigated during folic acid supplementation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Wolfe et al. and Kim et al. [19], [20] studied relations between folate catabolite excretion in 24 hour urine and blood folates. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Collection of blood samples as well as 24 hour urine are laborious, costly and invasive and 24 hour urine collection may be impaired by loss of volume or degradation of analytes over time [21], [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Therefore we studied the relation between urinary folate catabolite concentrations relative to creatinine in spot urine samples and folate levels in plasma and red blood cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Although diurnal variations are averaged out by 24 hour collection, there are still indications that daily excretion of urinary pABG and apABG may not only be determined by long-term folate storage but also influenced by short-term folic acid intake [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Thus, we evaluated the relationship between urinary folate catabolites and blood folate markers in healthy males before (baseline) and during a 12 week period of folic acid supplement intake. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Prior to this, short-term effects of a folic acid bolus on urinary catabolite concentrations were studied to evaluate limitations that have to be observed for collection of eligible spot urine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The calculated ratio between folate catabolites pABG and apABG (ratiop/ap) was furthermore used to detect potentially biased spot urine. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>We aimed to detect a correlation of at least 0.35 between urinary folate catabolites and blood folate as corresponding correlations had been observed between various measures of dietary folate intake and blood folate markers [24], [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>To detect such a correlation as statistically significant with a power 80% and α of 0.05, samples from 49 subjects have to be analyzed [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Thus, 53 apparently healthy men were enrolled into the baseline study to compensate for eventually later detected exclusion criteria (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The subsequent 12 week intervention of 29 subjects with an intake of 400 µg folic acid per day was accomplished based on an explorative design without explicit power calculation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>There were fast and slow turnover pools within the body [36], thus urinary excretion may be determined by rapid and slow excretion rates which may explain both urinary folate catabolite increase shortly after folate intake in the short-term study and increased catabolite excretion after long-term supplementation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>NAT1 is widely distributed in the body including the cytoplasm of epithelial cells [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Phenotypes with low or higher than normal acetylation activity in some tissues have been reported, which result in inter-personal variation of pABG acetylation [39] and may explain inter-individual differences of fasted apABG levels and variations of the apABG increase after the ingestion of folic acid in the short-term study. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this finding would be consistent with the assumption that the red cell folate pool followed different kinetics than tissue folate pools, which has been shown in rats [36] but not studied in humans so far. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>It is of importance to note that different turnover of folate in red cells and major folate containing tissues such as liver, does not contradict with the well proven suitability of RCF to indicate body folate status in steady state. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Thus, recent onset of bolus doses of folic acid in subjects with relatively low folate status seems to preclude reliable estimation of RCF from urinary folate catabolites, but the situation may be different after periods of more than 3 months of continuous supplement intake. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Compared to urinary folate catabolites, measuring urine folate for estimation of folate status has several important disadvantages: Urinary folates are much less stable than folate catabolites [49] and therefore determination in large-scale studies is likely to be severely biased by sampling conditions. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>A major shortcoming of the current study, which only studied well-nourished Europeans (Germans), was that none of the subjects exhibited clearly in-adequate folate status, i.e. all individuals had RBC folate concentrations &gt;400 nmol/L. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>Due to this limitation, we were not able to determine cut-of values of urinary folate catabolites indicating inadequate folate status. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Further investigations in populations with insufficient folate intake might provide information for determining such cut-off points. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>The inclusion of healthy middle-aged men only, which somewhat limits generalizability of results, was guided by the intention of providing the most homogenous study population for systematically addressing baseline variation and intervention effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Including women might have led to a more inhomogeneous group (due to folate-containing oral contraceptives [54], pregnancy or lactation [55]) and studying children seemed ethically inappropriate. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Using LC-MS/MS for analysis of folate catabolites might seem to limit availability of the proposed assay to specialized laboratories, but this technology stands out in delivering an unprecedented combination of sensitivity and selectivity with relatively low costs per sample. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, LC-MS/MS has become more and more widely available in recent years, since it has already been introduced into routine laboratories [56]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="s3j"><title><text><SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Our results in non-folic acid supplemented subjects show that urinary pABG normalized to creatinine in spot urine is more closely related to PF than apABG whereas urinary concentrations of both folate catabolites showed comparable correlations with RCF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>This suggests that pABG/creatinine in spot urine is suitable as a non-invasive biomarker for folate status. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>A fasting period of more than 12 hours before sampling of the second fasted morning spot urine is recommended to exclude overestimation of folate status due to recent folate intake. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>The property of folate catabolites to be stable at ambient temperature in urine samples for several days makes collection of urine samples an attractive choice for non-invasive field studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>In general, measuring folate catabolites instead of folates involves much less variation due to sampling and measurement errors since folate catabolites do not share the well-known chemical instability of folate species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>The ratio of pABG to apABG in urine appears to be a suitable marker of sampling conditions compliance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>This ratio is rapidly increased by oral intake of folates enabling identification and exclusion of biased urine samples not suitable for reliable estimation of folate status. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Folic acid supplementation up to 12 weeks attenuates correlations between urinary and blood folate markers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Thus, only the fast adapting folate compartment PF can be probed non-invasively during supplementation by pABG determination in urine while RCF and apABG seem to reflect different slowly adapting pools. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest further investigation of the relationship between folate status-related disease risks and pABG and apABG in spot urine of subjects with habitual folate intake, since it potentially may replace invasive blood sampling as well as error-prone 24 hour urine collection in medical diagnosis and clinical trials. </plain></SENT>
