It is considered as one of the medically important arboviruses, and developing a preventive or therapeutic solution remains a top priority in the medical and scientific community. Drug discovery programs for potential dengue antivirals have increased dramatically over the last decade, largely in part to the introduction of high-throughput assays. In this study, we have developed an image-based dengue high-throughput/high-content assay (HT/HCA) using an innovative computer vision approach to screen a kinase-focused library for anti-dengue compounds. Using this dengue HT/HCA, we identified a group of compounds with a 4-(1-aminoethyl)-<italic>N</italic>-methylthiazol-2-amine as a common core structure that inhibits dengue viral infection in a human liver-derived cell line (Huh-7.5 cells). Compounds CND1201, CND1203 and CND1243 exhibited strong antiviral activities against all four dengue serotypes. Plaque reduction and time-of-addition assays suggests that these compounds interfere with the late stage of viral infection cycle. These findings demonstrate that our image-based dengue HT/HCA is a reliable tool that can be used to screen various chemical libraries for potential dengue antiviral candidates.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Dengue, a re-emergent human disease that places nearly half of the world's population at risk, threatens to further expand in geographical distribution. The lack of an available effective dengue vaccine has encouraged the search for antiviral drugs as an alternative approach. In recent years, drug discovery through high-throughput screening has become a trend in the search for dengue antivirals. In this study, we developed an image-based dengue high-throughput/high-content assay using prevalent viral strains of three dengue serotypes (DENV1, DENV2 and DENV3) isolated from dengue outbreaks in South America and a laboratory-adapted strain of DENV4. We demonstrated the usefulness of our image-based dengue HT/HCA in identifying potential dengue antivirals by screening a small subset of chemical compounds for inhibition of dengue virus infection in a human-derived host cell line (Huh-7.5), and partially characterized their activities against dengue infection in a mosquito host cell line (C6/36), a distantly-related virus (hepatitis C virus), and an unrelated virus that is transmitted by the same mosquito vector (chikungunya virus).</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>A.C.

The presence of more than 1 dengue serotype in a geographical area contribute to the persistence of epidemics, as immunity acquired against one dengue serotype does not confer long-term protective immunity against heterologous serotypes <xref rid="pntd.0002073-Whitehead1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Conversely, individuals that have acquired humoral immunity against one dengue serotype may be pre-disposed to DHF/DSS when subsequently infected with a heterologous serotype through antibody-dependent enhancement <xref rid="pntd.0002073-Halstead1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002073-Guzman2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Since its re-emergence in 1953, DENV has spread rapidly across 5 continents and more than 100 countries, mostly in tropical and subtropical regions.

Although ADE is the most widely accepted theory for the occurrence of DHF/DSS, several studies have suggested higher viremia titers, virus serotype and host genetic background as determinants of DHF/DSS <xref rid="pntd.0002073-Vaughn1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002073-Kalayanarooj1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.

However, its long-term efficacy and safety has not been established and mass production of this vaccine candidate to meet the growing demand remains a daunting task. A new approach that is gradually gaining interest is the development of dengue antivirals. For the last 6 years, several drug candidates for HCV and other RNA viruses have been pursued for repositioning as potential drug candidates for dengue <xref rid="pntd.0002073-Canard1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.

In the work reported here, we describe the development of an image-based high-throughput/high-content assay (HT/HCA) screening method for anti-dengue compounds using an infectious virus system and an innovative approach in image analysis. Using this dengue HT/HCA system, we screened a BioFocus kinase inhibitor library of 4,000 small molecules against DENV1-4 to identify compounds that possess antiviral activity against all 4 serotypes during infection of a human host cell. We counter-screened the primary hits against DENV infection in <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> clone C6/36, hepatitis C virus (Family <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, genus <italic>Hepacivirus</italic>) infection, and chikungunya virus (Family <italic>Togaviridae</italic>, genus <italic>Alphavirus</italic>) infection to partially characterize the compounds as having a host-specific or virus-specific target. The dengue hit compounds were clustered based on their chemical structures and, together with the activity profile, used to identify scaffolds whose antiviral activity against the 4 serotypes vary depending on the chemical substituents. These scaffolds identified from our dengue HT/HCA screening could be used as potential starting points for the development of dengue antivirals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cells and Viruses and Antibodies</title><p>The mosquito cell line C6/36 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> clone (CRL-1660), mouse hybridoma cells D1-4G2-4-15 (HB-112), and human hepatocyte Huh-7.5 (PTA-8561, U.S. Patent Number 7455969) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.

Briefly, cells were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 min at room temperature (Rm T). PFA-fixed cells were treated with 0.25% (v/v) Triton-X for 20 min at Rm T. DENV-infected cells were detected by probing with 4G2 mAb prepared in blocking buffer: DPBS containing 5% FBS for 30 min at 37&#176;C, followed by AlexaFluor-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Invitrogen Molecular Probes, USA) prepared in blocking buffer for 30 min at 37&#176;C.

After the final washing, digital images were acquired using a high-throughput confocal fluorescence imaging system (Evotec Technologies High-Throughput Cell Analyzer Opera, Perkin Elmer, USA). The digital images were taken from 3 different fields of each well at 20&#215; magnification.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Image Analysis Software Development</title><p>Acquired images were analyzed using our in-house developed image-mining platform (IM). This platform is designed to do high-content screening and directly access the database of images that were sequentially analyzed with specially designed algorithms developed as a customized plug-in to the IM platform. The results of all the analyses were stored in a centralized database. The IM plug-in for dengue HT/HCA works by independently analyzing two separate channels acquired with the Evotec Technologies High-Throughput Cell Analyzer Opera using different algorithms and converging these results to yield the final readout. One channel (DAPI-channel) captures the signal emitted by DAPI-stained nuclei at 450 nm, while the other channel (A488-channel) captures the signal emitted by the AlexaFluor 488 dye bound to the dengue E protein-antibody complexes confined in the cytoplasm of dengue-infected cells at 540 nm. To define the percentage of dengue-infected cells and, conversely the non-infected cells, a modified watershed method was applied. Compared to the original watershed algorithm <xref rid="pntd.0002073-Vincent1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> that uses the morphological gradient image, a weighted gradient image is used for the topographic surface, whose weights are defined as the ridge values computed from the eigen values of the original image.

For data normalization and quality control of the screening, each test compound plate contained 16 replicates of the positive and negative controls. After dispensing the test compounds IFN-&#945;2A and DMSO vehicle in the 384-well plates, Huh-7.5 was mixed with DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, or DENV4 to achieve a M.O.I. of 0.5 and dispensed at 5&#215;10<sup>3</sup> cells/well using the Thermo Scientific WellMate automated liquid dispenser.

Another target-based HTS approach using enzymatic assay has identified BP2109 as a potential inhibitor of NS2B/NS3pro complex <xref rid="pntd.0002073-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. One drawback of <italic>in silico</italic>-based HTS is that predicted chemical interactions do not take into account other biological factors. This often results in selection of compounds with high binding properties <italic>in silico</italic>, but weak activities once tested <italic>in vitro</italic>. Similarly, target-based enzymatic assays are performed in a highly controlled environment that facilitates optimum enzymatic function of the target, which can be dramatically different from its biological setting. Thus, compounds found to be highly active against the target using this approach may not exhibit the same effect when tested using a cell-based assay, since the assays do not factor in cellular uptake, availability of the target, and other environmental conditions <xref rid="pntd.0002073-Hymel1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. The <italic>in silico</italic> and target-based HTA approaches are designed to find active compounds against a specific target. While this helps to simplify the process of identifying the probable mechanism of action, it is inherent in the assays to exclude compounds that may be active against other targets involved in viral infection. Hence, their application to the comprehensive screening of active compounds against viral infection is limited.</p><p>In contrast to target-based HTA, cell-based HTA is more robust as it covers a wider aspect of the viral infection process. This type of HTA uses either infectious viruses to follow one or multiple rounds of viral infection, or viral replicons to observe the events surrounding viral replication. Cell-based dengue HTA takes advantage of the various intracellular and intercellular events that occur during viral infection. Hence, antiviral properties can be attributed to either compound activity against viral or cellular targets. Cell-based flavivirus immunodetection (CFI), which measures viral protein expression after infection by ELISA, and luciferase reporter viral replicon assay were used to identify inhibitors of viral RNA synthesis namely, the adenosine nucleoside inhibitor NITD008 <xref rid="pntd.0002073-Yin1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, NS4B inhibitor NITD-618 <xref rid="pntd.0002073-Xie1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> and NITD-982, an inhibitor of host dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) <xref rid="pntd.0002073-Wang3" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. A modified type of the viral replicon assay using dengue-1 virus-like particles (DENV1-VLP) assembled by packaging the dengue viral replicon tagged with a <italic>Renilla luciferase 2A</italic> reporter gene (<italic>Rluc</italic>2A) in DENV1 structural proteins generated using the Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) expression system was reported to be useful in identifying inhibitors of dengue viral entry, translation and replication <xref rid="pntd.0002073-Qing1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. In addition to the expression of viral proteins during infection or replication, other indications of viral infection can be used to assess compound activity such as cell death and reduced metabolic activity. A dengue cytopathic effect (CPE)-based HTA that uses luminescence assay to determine cellular viability by measuring cellular ATP was previously reported <xref rid="pntd.0002073-Che1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. These cell-based HTA are described as &#8220;single-readout&#8221; assays, since a single value is generated during the assay corresponding to the effect of a particular treatment.</p><p>Image-based high-content assay (HCA) is also a form of cell-based assay. Unlike CFI and replicon-based luciferase reporter assays however, it requires more sophisticated equipment like a high-throughput confocal microscope for acquiring images and special software for analyzing image data. When adapting image-based HCA for high-throughput screening, it is more labor intensive and requires more stringent criteria for data analysis. Nonetheless, image-based HCA has one clear advantage over single-readout assays &#8211; the amount of information that can be generated from images of a single treatment is not limited to a single value. Aside from the degree of viral infection and cell viability, other interesting information can be extracted from images such as morphological changes in host cell, protein localization, among others <xref rid="pntd.0002073-Gtte1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Like other cell-based HTA, image-based assay can be used to screen compounds with diverse modes of activity. This was demonstrated in an image-based HCA screening of 5,362 compounds with diverse chemical structures against DENV2, revealing 73 active compounds, most of which have previously characterized cellular interactions <xref rid="pntd.0002073-Shum1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Dasatinib, a c-Src kinase inhibitor that disrupts the assembly of dengue virions in virus-induced membranous replication complexes, was also identified after screening a kinase inhibitor library using image-based HCA <xref rid="pntd.0002073-Chu1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>.</p><p>The image-based dengue HT/HCA developed in this study was used to screen 4,000 compounds belonging to the BioFocus kinase inhibitor library. Primary screening against all four dengue serotypes required 16,000 experiment points (4,000 compounds&#215;4 dengue serotypes), excluding the positive and negative controls. The entire primary screening took 11 days in total: 3 days for expansion of Huh-7.5 from a single T175 tissue culture (TC) flask to 8 T175 TC flasks, 4 days for host cell plating and virus infection in the 384-well plates containing the compounds, 2 days for image acquisition, 1 day for image analysis using the IM platform, and 1 day for data analysis. Two previous image-based screening campaigns for dengue antivirals were conducted with lab-adapted DENV2 (New Guinea C) whole virus <xref rid="pntd.0002073-Shum1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002073-Chu1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. One of these campaigns <xref rid="pntd.0002073-Chu1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> further investigated the hit compounds by testing the antiviral activities against other lab-adapted dengue serotypes. Our image-based dengue HT/HCA screening campaign differs from the previous image-based HTA in three aspects: First, we used a novel target-focused chemical library (BioFocus kinase inhibitor library) whose collection of small molecules has not been thoroughly screened and characterized. Second, the compounds were screened against low passage strains of field isolated dengue viruses (with the exception of DENV4 tvp360), which allows the identification of compounds that may be active towards prevalent strains. Third, the entire 4,000 compound subset of the BioFocus kinase inhibitor library was screened against all four dengue serotypes. By screening all the compounds of the library against the four dengue serotypes, we can identify novel compounds that may be active against all four serotypes or specific toward any of the serotypes. Such findings can have biological implications on the differences between the viral infection process of the 4 serotypes at the cellular and molecular level. This offers an advantage over the primary screening using the DENV2 serotype and subsequent confirmation of activity with the other serotypes since the latter is already biased towards compounds active against DENV2, resulting in the &#8220;loss&#8221; of potential hit compounds that do not inhibit this particular serotype.</p><p>Screening of the BioFocus kinase inhibitor library using our image-based dengue HT/HCA resulted in the identification of 4 major clusters exhibiting inhibitory properties against dengue virus infection <italic>in vitro</italic>. Among them, one cluster consisting of 11 compounds having a 2-aminothiazole as a core scaffold, showed antiviral activities of varying degrees against the infection of DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, DENV4 in the human hepatoma cell line Huh-7.5. The inability of these compounds to inhibit dengue infection in C6/36 initially suggests that the target is most likely a factor involving dengue virus infection in human cells. However, this discrepancy may also be attributed to other factors, such as difference in membrane permeability between the two different host cells or molecule uptake of the compounds into the host cell. Such differences in the physiology between the human and insect cells may affect the efficacy of these compounds in inhibiting dengue viral infection, but has not been thoroughly investigated in this study. Interestingly, none of the hit compounds from the 2-aminothiazole cluster significantly inhibited the infection of HCV and CHIKV in hepatoma cells, suggesting that the inhibitory property is more specifically directed towards dengue virus infection.</p><p>One major drawback when using cell-based assays in high-throughput screening is the effect of toxicity to the host cells, and by extension, viral infection. Compound toxicity can have a profound effect in the viral infection process, and may lead to inaccurate assessment of the antiviral activity. Since the HTS is conducted using only a single concentration of the compounds, it is impossible to avoid encountering those that exhibit moderate to high level of toxicity. Hence, a confirmatory assay that tests a range of concentration is necessary to verify if these hit compounds indeed have antiviral activities. In addition, secondary assays are used to confirm compound activity and predict the mechanism of action. For cell-based assays that utilize image-based technology, determining compound toxicity with high certainty is more difficult. In the absence of biological markers that detect mitochondrial activity, cell apoptosis, cell starvation, the only indicator of compound toxicity is the relative cell number compared with non-treated controls. This can be misleading if the toxicity does not result in abolition of the cells or degradation of the cell nuclei since the cell number will not reflect the actual number of viable cells. Thus, it is essential to confirm compound toxicity by measuring production of ATP or relative oxygen species as an indicator of cell viability <xref rid="pntd.0002073-OBrien1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>.</p><p>Time-of-addition assay, a strategy to determine the stage of inhibition during the viral infection cycle, has been used to characterize the mode of action of some inhibitors of dengue viral entry (NITD Compound 6), viral replication (NITD-982) and early translation (NITD-2636) <xref rid="pntd.0002073-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002073-Wang3" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002073-Wang4" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. The inhibitor is added at different time points during viral infection and monitored for expression of the viral proteins, replication of the genome or production of infectious progeny virions. Among the 2-aminothiazole hit compounds identified in this study, CND1203 exhibited a strong antiviral activity against all 4 dengue serotypes, and blocked the formation of dengue virus plaques in Huh-7.5 at 25 &#181;M in the plaque reduction assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002073-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Compound CND1203 was used for the time-of-addition assay, adding 25 &#181;M at different time points (&#8722;2 hpi, 0 hpi, 0.5 hpi, 1 hpi, 2 hpi, 4 hpi) of the dengue virus infection (M.O.I. 5) in Huh-7.5. In contrast to the strong inhibition of compound CND1203 against dengue viruses in the plaque reduction assay, none of the treatments inhibited dengue infection in the time-of-addition assay, suggesting that the compound does not interfere with viral entry (data not shown). Aminothiazole-based compounds have previously been implicated in the inhibition of HCV replication by binding to an allosteric site on the viral polymerase <xref rid="pntd.0002073-Shipps1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. However, the structure of these active anti-HCV compounds differ from the 2-aminothiazole hit compounds reported in this study in terms of the substitutions on the scaffold. As a consequence, it is unlikely that our hit compounds interact with the viral polymerase.</p><fig id="pntd-0002073-g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0002073.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Plaque reduction assay.</title><p>Huh-7.5 cells grown in 24-well tissue culture plate were inoculated with 30 pfu DENV1, DENV2, DENV3 and DENV4 per well and incubated for 7 days in the presence of compound CND1203 at various concentrations. MOCK-infected wells were inoculated with VM only.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pntd.0002073.g005"/></fig><p>Although compound CND1203 did not inhibit DENV entry, its ability to inhibit the spread of DENV infection and formation of virus plaques in Huh-7.5 clearly suggest that the mode of action is at the post-entry stages. Two kinase inhibitors were previously reported to block virus assembly of dengue virions: Dasatinib, a thiazolyaminopyrimidine that inhibit c-Src protein kinase, did not interfere with dengue RNA replication, but disrupted the proper assembly of dengue virions within virus-induced cell membranous replication complex <xref rid="pntd.0002073-Chu1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. SFV785, a trifluorinated <italic>N</italic>-methylanaline derivative that selectively inhibits NTRK1 and MAPKAPK5 kinase activity, altered the distribution of structural envelope protein from the reticulate network to enlarged discrete vesicles, consequently affecting the co-localization with the DENV replication complex and disrupting the assembly of progeny virions <xref rid="pntd.0002073-Anwar1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Interestingly, the 2-aminothiazole hit compounds identified in this study shares the aminothiazole moiety of Dasatinib, as well as the rings on each of the molecule. Based on the structural similarity with Dasatinib, c-Src kinase may be a candidate target of the 2-aminothiazole hit compounds, which would imply a post-genomic replication mode of action. Further investigation is necessary to support this hypothesis.</p><p>The persistence of dengue outbreaks around the world, and the lack of an available dengue vaccine reinforce the need to find and develop therapeutic drugs to address this major health concern. The use of HT/HCA screening technologies can expedite the drug discovery of potential dengue antivirals by facilitating the screening of large chemical libraries. The work reported here features an innovative image-based HT/HCA system that can be used as a reliable tool in screening for antiviral compounds against all four DENV serotypes. Furthermore, the compounds identified in the present study can serve as a potential starting point for the development of dengue antivirals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0002073.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Development of the dengue HT/HCA.
