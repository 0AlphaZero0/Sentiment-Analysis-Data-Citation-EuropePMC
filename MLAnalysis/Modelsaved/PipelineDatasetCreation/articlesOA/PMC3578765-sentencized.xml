</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Dengue virus (DENV) is an important mosquito-borne pathogen responsible for causing dengue fever (DF) and the more severe, life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever/shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>DENV is a small, enveloped virus belonging to the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae. [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Dengue virions are approximately 50 nm in diameter [3], containing a single-stranded positive RNA of ∼11 kilobase with a genomic organization: 5′-C-preM-E-NS1-NS2A/B-NS3-NS4A/B-NS5-3′, and flanked by the 5′ and 3′ UTRs (untranslated regions) [4], [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>There are 4 serotypes of dengue (DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, DENV4), with two or more serotypes commonly found to co-circulate in many dengue endemic areas [6], [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The presence of more than 1 dengue serotype in a geographical area contribute to the persistence of epidemics, as immunity acquired against one dengue serotype does not confer long-term protective immunity against heterologous serotypes [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Conversely, individuals that have acquired humoral immunity against one dengue serotype may be pre-disposed to DHF/DSS when subsequently infected with a heterologous serotype through antibody-dependent enhancement [9], [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Since its re-emergence in 1953, DENV has spread rapidly across 5 continents and more than 100 countries, mostly in tropical and subtropical regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Present estimates by the World Health Organization place nearly 2.5 billion people at risk of dengue, with approximately 50 million cases of dengue infection and 20 thousand mortalities occurring annually [11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Due to the global burden of dengue, numerous studies have been done to elucidate the nature of dengue infection and the underlying mechanisms of DF and DHF/DSS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Although ADE is the most widely accepted theory for the occurrence of DHF/DSS, several studies have suggested higher viremia titers, virus serotype and host genetic background as determinants of DHF/DSS [12], [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Extensive genetic, cellular and immunological studies have investigated the role of host innate immunity in the events leading to DHF/DSS [14]–[16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>However, a clear understanding on the immunopathology of dengue infections remains elusive. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>With the number of DHF/DSS cases rising every year, the demand for a preventive, prophylactic, or therapeutic measure against DENV is growing rapidly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Significant progress has been achieved in the development of a dengue vaccine, including one vaccine candidate (ChimeriVax) that has passed through Phase II clinical trials [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>However, its long-term efficacy and safety has not been established and mass production of this vaccine candidate to meet the growing demand remains a daunting task. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>A new approach that is gradually gaining interest is the development of dengue antivirals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>For the last 6 years, several drug candidates for HCV and other RNA viruses have been pursued for repositioning as potential drug candidates for dengue [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Though at present, none of these compounds have gone beyond pre-clinical trials. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Recent advancements in high-throughput screening (HTS) technologies have contributed to increasing efficiency in the drug discovery process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>These include in silico HTS, in vitro enzymatic assays, cell-based reporter assays, image-based whole infection assays, among others [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In the work reported here, we describe the development of an image-based high-throughput/high-content assay (HT/HCA) screening method for anti-dengue compounds using an infectious virus system and an innovative approach in image analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Using this dengue HT/HCA system, we screened a BioFocus kinase inhibitor library of 4,000 small molecules against DENV1-4 to identify compounds that possess antiviral activity against all 4 serotypes during infection of a human host cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>We counter-screened the primary hits against DENV infection in Aedes albopictus clone C6/36, hepatitis C virus (Family Flaviviridae, genus Hepacivirus) infection, and chikungunya virus (Family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus) infection to partially characterize the compounds as having a host-specific or virus-specific target. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The dengue hit compounds were clustered based on their chemical structures and, together with the activity profile, used to identify scaffolds whose antiviral activity against the 4 serotypes vary depending on the chemical substituents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>These scaffolds identified from our dengue HT/HCA screening could be used as potential starting points for the development of dengue antivirals. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>From the time of its re-emergence 60 years ago, dengue has spread across the globe, placing nearly 40% of the world's population at risk of infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>Coincidentally, the geographical distribution of the four serotypes has also expanded, with all serotypes reported to co-circulate in most of the dengue-endemic countries [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>This has serious implications in the rise of DHF/DSS cases, as it is presently understood that antibody-dependent enhancement combined with elevated cytokine responses resulting from subsequent infection with a heterologous serotype are involved in disease severity [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>The most advanced dengue vaccine candidates try to address this issue by constructing chimeric YF/DENV virus (ChimeriVax-DEN), incorporating the prM and E genes of each DENV serotype in the yellow fever (YF) 17D backbone, and used these to prepare tetravalent cocktails [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>However, while the tetravalent ChimeriVax-DEN vaccine has shown good immunological responses in clinical trials [17], its long-term safety and efficacy has not been fully established. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the dengue vaccine approach, therapeutic drug approach circumvents the immunopathological complication of dengue, and directly addresses the acute viral infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>The work reported here describes the development of a high-throughput/high-content assay screening for potential anti-dengue drugs using image-based quantitation of inhibition of dengue virus infection in vitro as a measure of antiviral activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>This dengue HT/HCA was used to screen 4,000 small molecules from the BioFocus kinase inhibitor library against DENV1-4, and revealed a number of compounds that inhibit more than 80% infection of all 4 serotypes of dengue in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>More than 60% of these compounds were also found to inhibit more than 80% infection of HCV genotype 2a infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, most of the compounds belonging to the 4-(1-aminoethyl)-N-methylthiazol-2-amine cluster exhibited measurable antiviral activities against dengue viruses in Huh-7.5, but did not demonstrate strong inhibition of HCV genotype 2a infection in the same host cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Recently, high throughput assays (HTA) have been used to find several drug candidates with anti-dengue properties [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Structure-based dengue virtual screening (i.e. in silico high-throughput screening or HTS) is a target-based HTA that analyzes the binding potential of chemical compounds against a target dengue viral protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Using combinatorial libraries and docking programs that predict the chemical interactions, binding potentials of the compounds with known crystal structures and associated ligands of the target protein are computed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>This approach has been used extensively in discovering potential inhibitors of DENV E protein binding and fusion [38], [39] NS5 2′O-Methyltransferase [40], NS3 protease [41], [42] and its complex, NS2B/NS3protease (NS2B/NS3pro) [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Another target-based HTS approach using enzymatic assay has identified BP2109 as a potential inhibitor of NS2B/NS3pro complex [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>One drawback of in silico-based HTS is that predicted chemical interactions do not take into account other biological factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>This often results in selection of compounds with high binding properties in silico, but weak activities once tested in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Similarly, target-based enzymatic assays are performed in a highly controlled environment that facilitates optimum enzymatic function of the target, which can be dramatically different from its biological setting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Thus, compounds found to be highly active against the target using this approach may not exhibit the same effect when tested using a cell-based assay, since the assays do not factor in cellular uptake, availability of the target, and other environmental conditions [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>The in silico and target-based HTA approaches are designed to find active compounds against a specific target. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>While this helps to simplify the process of identifying the probable mechanism of action, it is inherent in the assays to exclude compounds that may be active against other targets involved in viral infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Hence, their application to the comprehensive screening of active compounds against viral infection is limited. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>In contrast to target-based HTA, cell-based HTA is more robust as it covers a wider aspect of the viral infection process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>This type of HTA uses either infectious viruses to follow one or multiple rounds of viral infection, or viral replicons to observe the events surrounding viral replication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Cell-based dengue HTA takes advantage of the various intracellular and intercellular events that occur during viral infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Hence, antiviral properties can be attributed to either compound activity against viral or cellular targets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Cell-based flavivirus immunodetection (CFI), which measures viral protein expression after infection by ELISA, and luciferase reporter viral replicon assay were used to identify inhibitors of viral RNA synthesis namely, the adenosine nucleoside inhibitor NITD008 [14], NS4B inhibitor NITD-618 [46] and NITD-982, an inhibitor of host dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>A modified type of the viral replicon assay using dengue-1 virus-like particles (DENV1-VLP) assembled by packaging the dengue viral replicon tagged with a Renilla luciferase 2A reporter gene (Rluc2A) in DENV1 structural proteins generated using the Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) expression system was reported to be useful in identifying inhibitors of dengue viral entry, translation and replication [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>In addition to the expression of viral proteins during infection or replication, other indications of viral infection can be used to assess compound activity such as cell death and reduced metabolic activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>A dengue cytopathic effect (CPE)-based HTA that uses luminescence assay to determine cellular viability by measuring cellular ATP was previously reported [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>These cell-based HTA are described as “single-readout” assays, since a single value is generated during the assay corresponding to the effect of a particular treatment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>Image-based high-content assay (HCA) is also a form of cell-based assay. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Unlike CFI and replicon-based luciferase reporter assays however, it requires more sophisticated equipment like a high-throughput confocal microscope for acquiring images and special software for analyzing image data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>When adapting image-based HCA for high-throughput screening, it is more labor intensive and requires more stringent criteria for data analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, image-based HCA has one clear advantage over single-readout assays – the amount of information that can be generated from images of a single treatment is not limited to a single value. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Aside from the degree of viral infection and cell viability, other interesting information can be extracted from images such as morphological changes in host cell, protein localization, among others [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>Like other cell-based HTA, image-based assay can be used to screen compounds with diverse modes of activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>This was demonstrated in an image-based HCA screening of 5,362 compounds with diverse chemical structures against DENV2, revealing 73 active compounds, most of which have previously characterized cellular interactions [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>Dasatinib, a c-Src kinase inhibitor that disrupts the assembly of dengue virions in virus-induced membranous replication complexes, was also identified after screening a kinase inhibitor library using image-based HCA [51]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>The image-based dengue HT/HCA developed in this study was used to screen 4,000 compounds belonging to the BioFocus kinase inhibitor library. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>Primary screening against all four dengue serotypes required 16,000 experiment points (4,000 compounds×4 dengue serotypes), excluding the positive and negative controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>The entire primary screening took 11 days in total: 3 days for expansion of Huh-7.5 from a single T175 tissue culture (TC) flask to 8 T175 TC flasks, 4 days for host cell plating and virus infection in the 384-well plates containing the compounds, 2 days for image acquisition, 1 day for image analysis using the IM platform, and 1 day for data analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>Two previous image-based screening campaigns for dengue antivirals were conducted with lab-adapted DENV2 (New Guinea C) whole virus [30], [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>One of these campaigns [51] further investigated the hit compounds by testing the antiviral activities against other lab-adapted dengue serotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>Our image-based dengue HT/HCA screening campaign differs from the previous image-based HTA in three aspects: First, we used a novel target-focused chemical library (BioFocus kinase inhibitor library) whose collection of small molecules has not been thoroughly screened and characterized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>Second, the compounds were screened against low passage strains of field isolated dengue viruses (with the exception of DENV4 tvp360), which allows the identification of compounds that may be active towards prevalent strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>Third, the entire 4,000 compound subset of the BioFocus kinase inhibitor library was screened against all four dengue serotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>By screening all the compounds of the library against the four dengue serotypes, we can identify novel compounds that may be active against all four serotypes or specific toward any of the serotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>Such findings can have biological implications on the differences between the viral infection process of the 4 serotypes at the cellular and molecular level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>This offers an advantage over the primary screening using the DENV2 serotype and subsequent confirmation of activity with the other serotypes since the latter is already biased towards compounds active against DENV2, resulting in the “loss” of potential hit compounds that do not inhibit this particular serotype. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Screening of the BioFocus kinase inhibitor library using our image-based dengue HT/HCA resulted in the identification of 4 major clusters exhibiting inhibitory properties against dengue virus infection in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>Among them, one cluster consisting of 11 compounds having a 2-aminothiazole as a core scaffold, showed antiviral activities of varying degrees against the infection of DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, DENV4 in the human hepatoma cell line Huh-7.5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>The inability of these compounds to inhibit dengue infection in C6/36 initially suggests that the target is most likely a factor involving dengue virus infection in human cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>However, this discrepancy may also be attributed to other factors, such as difference in membrane permeability between the two different host cells or molecule uptake of the compounds into the host cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>Such differences in the physiology between the human and insect cells may affect the efficacy of these compounds in inhibiting dengue viral infection, but has not been thoroughly investigated in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, none of the hit compounds from the 2-aminothiazole cluster significantly inhibited the infection of HCV and CHIKV in hepatoma cells, suggesting that the inhibitory property is more specifically directed towards dengue virus infection. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>One major drawback when using cell-based assays in high-throughput screening is the effect of toxicity to the host cells, and by extension, viral infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>Compound toxicity can have a profound effect in the viral infection process, and may lead to inaccurate assessment of the antiviral activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>Since the HTS is conducted using only a single concentration of the compounds, it is impossible to avoid encountering those that exhibit moderate to high level of toxicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>Hence, a confirmatory assay that tests a range of concentration is necessary to verify if these hit compounds indeed have antiviral activities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>In addition, secondary assays are used to confirm compound activity and predict the mechanism of action. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>For cell-based assays that utilize image-based technology, determining compound toxicity with high certainty is more difficult. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>In the absence of biological markers that detect mitochondrial activity, cell apoptosis, cell starvation, the only indicator of compound toxicity is the relative cell number compared with non-treated controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>This can be misleading if the toxicity does not result in abolition of the cells or degradation of the cell nuclei since the cell number will not reflect the actual number of viable cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is essential to confirm compound toxicity by measuring production of ATP or relative oxygen species as an indicator of cell viability [52]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>Time-of-addition assay, a strategy to determine the stage of inhibition during the viral infection cycle, has been used to characterize the mode of action of some inhibitors of dengue viral entry (NITD Compound 6), viral replication (NITD-982) and early translation (NITD-2636) [39], [47], [53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>The inhibitor is added at different time points during viral infection and monitored for expression of the viral proteins, replication of the genome or production of infectious progeny virions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>Among the 2-aminothiazole hit compounds identified in this study, CND1203 exhibited a strong antiviral activity against all 4 dengue serotypes, and blocked the formation of dengue virus plaques in Huh-7.5 at 25 µM in the plaque reduction assay (Figure 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>Compound CND1203 was used for the time-of-addition assay, adding 25 µM at different time points (−2 hpi, 0 hpi, 0.5 hpi, 1 hpi, 2 hpi, 4 hpi) of the dengue virus infection (M.O.I. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>5) in Huh-7.5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the strong inhibition of compound CND1203 against dengue viruses in the plaque reduction assay, none of the treatments inhibited dengue infection in the time-of-addition assay, suggesting that the compound does not interfere with viral entry (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>Aminothiazole-based compounds have previously been implicated in the inhibition of HCV replication by binding to an allosteric site on the viral polymerase [54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>However, the structure of these active anti-HCV compounds differ from the 2-aminothiazole hit compounds reported in this study in terms of the substitutions on the scaffold. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, it is unlikely that our hit compounds interact with the viral polymerase. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>SFV785, a trifluorinated N-methylanaline derivative that selectively inhibits NTRK1 and MAPKAPK5 kinase activity, altered the distribution of structural envelope protein from the reticulate network to enlarged discrete vesicles, consequently affecting the co-localization with the DENV replication complex and disrupting the assembly of progeny virions [55]. </plain></SENT>
