Introduction</title><p>Fidaxomicin is an oral, narrow-spectrum antibacterial that is being developed by Optimer Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infections. The compound was previously being jointly developed by Optimer and Par Pharmaceuticals; the latter had exclusive rights to fidaxomicin in the US and Canada, but this agreement has been terminated. Fidaxomicin, an RNA polymerase inhibitor, is proposed to address the growing clinical problem of <italic>Clostridium difficile-</italic>associated diarrhea (CDAD). It is a naturally occurring 18-membered macrocycle, which is derived from the fermentation of <italic>Dactylosporangium aurantiacum</italic> subspecies <italic>hamdenesis</italic>. The product is undergoing phase III development for CDAD in the US and the EU, and phase I development in the US as prophylaxis for CDAD and vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) infections.</p><p>Antibacterial disturbance of normal anaerobic gut flora allows the overgrowth of toxigenic strains of <italic>C. difficile</italic> and the production of toxins A and B by this strain. Reactions to these toxins can result in lesions and severe damage to the epithelial lining of the colon. <italic>C. difficile</italic> accounts for approximately 20% of cases of antibacterial-associated diarrhea and the majority of cases of antibacterial-associated colitis. The active metabolite of fidaxomicin, OP 1118, selectively targets <italic>C. difficile</italic> to a similar degree as vancomycin, limiting its impact on the normal intestinal flora.</p><p>Optimer believes that fidaxomicin may have some advantages relative to established agents for the treatment of <italic>C. difficile</italic> infections, including demonstrated activity against <italic>C. difficile</italic> (including the hypervirulent strain NAP1/027), a low rate of drug resistance in <italic>C. difficile</italic>, minimal systemic exposure, a twice daily dosing regimen and minimal effect on normal gut flora.</p><p>Optimer is seeking collaborative partners to commercialize its programs.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>1.1 Company Agreements</title><p>Par Pharmaceuticals entered into a joint development agreement with Optimer for fidaxomicin (as PAR 101) in May 2005. However, in February 2007, Par returned all marketing rights for the product to Optimer. Optimer paid a termination fee of $US20 million to Par, as it was Optimer&#8217;s decision to terminate the agreement. Under the terms of the previous collaboration, Par had the exclusive rights to market, sell and distribute the product in the US and Canada. Under the terms of the termination agreement, Par will receive royalties on future global product sales in addition to upfront and milestone payments.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]</p><p>Optimer has an arrangement with Biocon for manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient of fidaxomicin tablets.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>1.2 Key Development Milestones</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>1.2.1 Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea (CDAD)</title><p>Optimer Pharmaceuticals reported in March 2009 that it was beginning preparations to file a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) with the European Medicines Agency for oral administration of fidaxomicin to treat <italic>C. difficile</italic> infection. The filing is based on results of the first phase III trial.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] Positive results have been reported from the second phase III trial of fidaxomicin and Optimer plans to use data from this trial to support a New Drug Application (NDA) submission in the US in the second half of 2010.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]</p><p>In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial (NCT00314951), the efficacy and safety of a 10-day course of oral fidaxomicin (200 mg every 12 h) was compared with that of oral vancomycin (125 mg every 6 h) in 629 patients with <italic>C. difficile</italic> infection.

Following a positive recommendation from the Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and the US FDA&#8217;s agreement with this decision, Optimer advanced fidaxomicin into the phase III portion of the trial. The company also increased the number of study sites in order to meet the targeted patient enrollment. Enrollment for this first pivotal phase III trial was completed in July 2008. A second pivotal phase III trial (NCT00468728), having an identical design as the first, was initiated in the US and the EU in 2007, and completed patient enrollment in November 2009. This trial enrolled a total of 536 patients. Data reported in February 2010 showed that the trial met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority of fidaxomicin to vancomycin.

The $US1 million grant is renewable each year until August 2010 to a maximum of $US3 million over a 3-year funding period. The award will allow the examination of the gut flora as a supplementary study to the ongoing fidaxomicin trials, in order to confirm narrow spectrum activity and potency of the agent against hypervirulent epidemic CDAD strains. Funds will also be used to conduct additional toxicology and microbiological studies, as well as a surveillance study of <italic>C. difficile</italic> isolates across North America to compare the activity of fidaxomicin with existing agents. The NIAID previously awarded the company a grant to progress development of the agent in October 2005.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]</p><p>During 2005, Optimer secured $US34.2 million in financing, which was to be used for further development of fidaxomicin for this indication in the North American market.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]</p><p>Results from phase Ib and phase IIa studies in CDAD were reported in December 2005. The phase Ib study was designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, tolerance and safety of fidaxomicin in healthy volunteers. The phase IIa study was conducted in order to select an appropriate dose for further clinical development.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]</p><p>Optimer Pharmaceuticals is also developing an oral suspension formulation to complement the existing tablet form of fidaxomicin.

Recurrence rates in the strain type BI/NAP1/027 subgroup were similar between agents (25.0%, 24.1%).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] Additional subgroup analysis showed that there were lower recurrence rates for fidaxomicin recipients than for vancomycin recipients with regard to risk factors such as serum albumin levels, white blood cell (WBC) count and body temperature (BT), and non-BI (NAP1/027) strain types. Recurrence rates by subgroup for fidaxomicin recipients versus vancomycin recipients were: WBC of &lt;15 000 per &#956;L and BT of &lt;38&#176;C, 10.7% versus 22.4% (17/159 vs 35/156); WBC of 15 000&#8211;25 000 per &#956;L or BT of 38&#8211;39&#176;C, 12.0% versus 20.0% (3/25 vs 6/30); WBC of &gt;25 000 per &#956;L or BT of &gt;39&#176;C, 33.3% vs 40.0% (1/3 vs 2/5); serum albumin levels of &#8804;25 mg/mL, 22.2% versus 31.5% (8/36 vs 17/54); serum albumin levels of 26&#8211;35 mg/mL, 10.0% versus 23.3% (9/90 vs 20/86); strain type non-BI (NAP1/027), 7.8% versus 25.5% (8/103 vs 27/106).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]</p><p><bold><italic>Phase II:</italic></bold> In a phase IIa study, fidaxomicin therapy (50, 100 or 200 mg bid for 10 days) successfully treated 41/45 patients (&gt;91% cured overall) with mild-to-moderate CDAD. Two patients transferred to conventional therapy. Of the 41 patients who completed therapy, two patients (5%) experienced recurrent symptoms within the 6-week follow-up. All of the 16 subjects in the top dosing group (200 mg twice daily) achieved clinical cure.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr"
