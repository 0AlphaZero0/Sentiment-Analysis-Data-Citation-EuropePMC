<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fidaxomicin is an oral, narrow-spectrum antibacterial that is being developed by Optimer Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The compound was previously being jointly developed by Optimer and Par Pharmaceuticals; the latter had exclusive rights to fidaxomicin in the US and Canada, but this agreement has been terminated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fidaxomicin, an RNA polymerase inhibitor, is proposed to address the growing clinical problem of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is a naturally occurring 18-membered macrocycle, which is derived from the fermentation of Dactylosporangium aurantiacum subspecies hamdenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The product is undergoing phase III development for CDAD in the US and the EU, and phase I development in the US as prophylaxis for CDAD and vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) infections. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Antibacterial disturbance of normal anaerobic gut flora allows the overgrowth of toxigenic strains of C. difficile and the production of toxins A and B by this strain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reactions to these toxins can result in lesions and severe damage to the epithelial lining of the colon. C. difficile accounts for approximately 20% of cases of antibacterial-associated diarrhea and the majority of cases of antibacterial-associated colitis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The active metabolite of fidaxomicin, OP 1118, selectively targets C. difficile to a similar degree as vancomycin, limiting its impact on the normal intestinal flora. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Optimer believes that fidaxomicin may have some advantages relative to established agents for the treatment of C. difficile infections, including demonstrated activity against C. difficile (including the hypervirulent strain NAP1/027), a low rate of drug resistance in C. difficile, minimal systemic exposure, a twice daily dosing regimen and minimal effect on normal gut flora. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Optimer is seeking collaborative partners to commercialize its programs. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Par Pharmaceuticals entered into a joint development agreement with Optimer for fidaxomicin (as PAR 101) in May 2005. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, in February 2007, Par returned all marketing rights for the product to Optimer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Optimer paid a termination fee of $US20 million to Par, as it was Optimer’s decision to terminate the agreement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Under the terms of the previous collaboration, Par had the exclusive rights to market, sell and distribute the product in the US and Canada. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Under the terms of the termination agreement, Par will receive royalties on future global product sales in addition to upfront and milestone payments.[1–4] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Optimer has an arrangement with Biocon for manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient of fidaxomicin tablets. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Optimer Pharmaceuticals reported in March 2009 that it was beginning preparations to file a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) with the European Medicines Agency for oral administration of fidaxomicin to treat C. difficile infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The filing is based on results of the first phase III trial.[5] Positive results have been reported from the second phase III trial of fidaxomicin and Optimer plans to use data from this trial to support a New Drug Application (NDA) submission in the US in the second half of 2010.[6] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial (NCT00314951), the efficacy and safety of a 10-day course of oral fidaxomicin (200 mg every 12 h) was compared with that of oral vancomycin (125 mg every 6 h) in 629 patients with C. difficile infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Cured patients were followed up for a subsequent 4-week period to evaluate recurrence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Results from this trial were favorable.[7–11] The trial had been initiated as a phase IIb/III trial in May 2006 in the US; approximately 100 patients with CDAD were enrolled in the initial phase IIb trial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Following a positive recommendation from the Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and the US FDA’s agreement with this decision, Optimer advanced fidaxomicin into the phase III portion of the trial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The company also increased the number of study sites in order to meet the targeted patient enrollment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Enrollment for this first pivotal phase III trial was completed in July 2008. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>A second pivotal phase III trial (NCT00468728), having an identical design as the first, was initiated in the US and the EU in 2007, and completed patient enrollment in November 2009. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>This trial enrolled a total of 536 patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Data reported in February 2010 showed that the trial met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority of fidaxomicin to vancomycin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The drug was well tolerated in the study.[6,12–14] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Fidaxomicin completed proof-of-principle phase IIa trials for CDAD; fast track status has been granted by the FDA for this indication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Preliminary results showed that fidaxomicin appeared to be efficacious in patients with CDAD.[3,15] The FDA also selected fidaxomicin for participation in a Continuous Marketing Applications (CMA) Pilot 2 Program; this was to include continuous FDA feedback that was designed to streamline the development process. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is sponsoring an initiative to find a new treatment for CDAD and has awarded Optimer a grant to fund the project. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The $US1 million grant is renewable each year until August 2010 to a maximum of $US3 million over a 3-year funding period. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The award will allow the examination of the gut flora as a supplementary study to the ongoing fidaxomicin trials, in order to confirm narrow spectrum activity and potency of the agent against hypervirulent epidemic CDAD strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Funds will also be used to conduct additional toxicology and microbiological studies, as well as a surveillance study of C. difficile isolates across North America to compare the activity of fidaxomicin with existing agents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The NIAID previously awarded the company a grant to progress development of the agent in October 2005.[16,17] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>During 2005, Optimer secured $US34.2 million in financing, which was to be used for further development of fidaxomicin for this indication in the North American market.[18] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Results from phase Ib and phase IIa studies in CDAD were reported in December 2005. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The phase Ib study was designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, tolerance and safety of fidaxomicin in healthy volunteers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The phase IIa study was conducted in order to select an appropriate dose for further clinical development.[19] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Optimer Pharmaceuticals is also developing an oral suspension formulation to complement the existing tablet form of fidaxomicin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The suspension formulation is for use in intensive care unit and elderly patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The oral suspension formulation is in the preclinical stage of development. </plain></SENT>
