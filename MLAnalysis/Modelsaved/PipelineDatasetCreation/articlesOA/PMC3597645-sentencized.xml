</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide studies of gene expression throughout the cell division cycle have revealed several genes that are differentially expressed (1–9), but have also indicated that the set of cycling genes differs between primary and cancer cells (3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Primary cells are, however, inherently difficult to synchronize, for example, only 40–50% of foreskin fibroblast cells in culture can be synchronized by serum starvation or double thymidine block (3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although sophisticated statistics may partially overcome lack of synchronization (3), a large population of asynchronous or arrested cells results in high background gene expression noise. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Consequently, more cycling genes can be detected in a highly synchronous culture than in a culture where at most 50% of the cells are synchronized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, as the only human cell line—in addition to primary fibroblasts (1,3,4)—profiled for cell cycle expression so far is the cervical cancer cell line HeLa (2,5), it is unclear to what extent cell type-specific factors affect reported differences in cycling genes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We have used the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT to address this question. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Specifically, by measuring the gene expression profiles of double thymidine synchronized HaCaT cells, we identified three major groups of cycling genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>First, a set of genes with housekeeping characteristics, strong enrichment for known cell cycle functions and overlap with previously identified cell cycle genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Second, a set of genes with cell type-specific characteristics, enrichment for HaCaT-specific functions and poor overlap with previously identified cell cycle genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Third, a set of genes that has the mark for Polycomb silencing: histone H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>We show that this third set of genes is expressed in a replication-dependent manner, as the genes are upregulated during S phase in a pattern related to DNA replication timing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Consistent with being epigenetically silenced in other cell cycle phases, these genes are generally lower expressed than are other cell cycle expressed genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>We also find similar patterns in foreskin fibroblasts synchronized by serum starvation, indicating that replication-dependent expression of Polycomb-silenced genes is a prevalent but unrecognized regulatory mechanism. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Using a double thymidine block to arrest and, subsequently, release HaCaT cells at the G1/S boundary resulted in ∼90% of the cells re-entering the cell cycle and continuing as a uniform cohort through the cell cycle (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gks1336/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Although the cells gradually lost synchrony, such that 70% instead of 90% of the cells were synchronously entering the second S phase, the results were reproducible across three independent experiments. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Conceptually, this PLS analysis projects the time profile for all genes onto a plane described by the sine and cosine of the cell cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>As a result, genes that are periodically expressed with high amplitude will be far from the origin, whereas genes that vary little or randomly will be close to the origin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the phase angle of the cyclic variation will determine the direction from the origin such that genes that have the same temporal expression patterns will lie in the same direction from the origin on the plane. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>By profiling RNA isolated from the synchronized cells at 3 h intervals for 33 h, and combining PLS analyses with resampling to compute false discovery rates (21), we identified 1249 Entrez genes that had significant periodic expression patterns during the HaCaT cell cycle (Figure 1, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gks1336/-/DC1">Supplementary Dataset S1</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>In HaCaT cells, replication-dependent transcription may, therefore, be a regulatory mechanism for coordinating cell–cell signalling with the cell cycle. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>Lanzuolo et al. (36) have earlier reported that two Polycomb-repressed homeotic genes show replication-dependent expression in Drosophila S2 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Our results extend this observation to humans and show that many other genes with Polycomb-repressive marks have replication-dependent expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>We also note that cis-encoded RNAs do play a role in Polycomb-mediated targeting and regulation (37–39). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Given that Polycomb regulates all transcripts in targeted loci, replication-dependent expression may be a mechanism for expressing such cis-encoded Polycomb-associated RNAs at existing Polycomb-regulated loci. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>When comparing our list of HaCaT cell cycle genes with the cell cycle genes from the previous HeLa (2) and primary foreskin fibroblast studies (3), we found several differences, such that only 125 genes were common for all three studies (Figure 3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Several technical factors, such as differences in microarray technology, analytical approach and experimental design, likely contributed to these differences, for example, the genes that were common for all three studies were highly expressed, whereas the genes that were exclusive for our study were lowly expressed in HaCaT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>We could detect these HaCaT-specific genes because our three matched biological replicates gave increased statistical power to identify weak, but consistent, cyclic expression patterns. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>In addition to these technical differences, our results also show that underlying biological differences between the cells can explain some of the differences in cell cycle expressed genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Specifically, our results show that in addition to the core genes that have cell cycle-dependent expression in multiple cell types, some genes related to the cell type’s specific functions and characteristics also have cyclic expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>This is in contrast to a previous report, which indicated that such cell-type specific expression mostly reflects differences between primary and cancer cells (3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>These cancer-related differences are evident in our analyses as well, but we also find that genes and pathways important to keratinocyte function, such as cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction (25) and vitamin D receptor binding, (27) have cell cycle-dependent expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Both functions are important for normal keratinocyte proliferation, which makes it unlikely that these results are an artifact of HaCaT’s transformed state or technical differences between the studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Instead, the cell cycle-dependent expression of these genes likely reflects that processing of proliferative signals from the extracellular environment should be coordinated with the cell cycle. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>We should note that as we have measured expression changes in total cellular RNA, some of the expression changes we have detected could potentially be explained by cell cycle-dependent changes in RNA processing or RNA stability instead of RNA transcription. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our approach of chemically synchronizing cells can likely explain some of the changes in gene expression in our data, as the synchronization procedure likely triggers stress-related responses that could both give false-positive cyclic profiles and mask the cell-cycle-dependent expression of some true cell cycle genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>This masking effect could potentially explain why we did not detect the known cell-cycle genes CDKN1A and VEGFC to have cell cycle-dependent expression in HaCaT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gks1336/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>C and D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Our analyses, including the good overlap between the genes we identified and known cell-cycle-expressed genes, strong enrichment for cell-cycle-related functions and overlap with previous studies, do suggest, however, that the majority of the genes we identified are true cell cycle genes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>In summary, by combining robust statistics with the power of matched biological replicates, we have identified a set of genes that show consistent cell cycle-dependent expression in HaCaT cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>These genes include both general cell cycle genes and genes specific for HaCaT function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Some of the cell cycle genes also have H3K27me3 marks—a histone modification commonly associated with Polycomb-silenced genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>We show that in both HaCaT and primary foreskin fibroblasts, these genes are upregulated during DNA replication, which is consistent with a mechanism where DNA replication can open some Polycomb-repressed loci for transcription. </plain></SENT>
