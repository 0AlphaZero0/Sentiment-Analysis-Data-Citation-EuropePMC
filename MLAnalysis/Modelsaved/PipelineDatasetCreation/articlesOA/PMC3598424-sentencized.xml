</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Drought is a major problem that affects wheat production worldwide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Tolerance to water stress is a quantitative trait with a complex phenotype that is often confounded by plant phenology (Fleury et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Because of the complexity of water stress tolerance and the effect of other harsh environmental factors in the field, improvement of this trait has largely relied on direct phenotypic selection for improved performance under drought conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the application of genomic tools in Arabidopsis has produced large datasets of gene expression profiles that result from exposure to water stress (Seki et al., 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Experimental validation of candidate genes identified from such transcript profiling studies has identified genes that appear to contribute to plant performance under limiting water conditions in greenhouse studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Two such genes are Era1 and Cyp707a, which are both involved in abscisic acid (ABA) regulation in the abiotic stress pathway. Era1 is a gene that encodes the β-subunit of farnesyltransferase (Cutler et al., 1996), whose loss of function in Arabidopsis thaliana caused greater ABA-induced guard cell S-type anion-channel activation and a rapid increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. Era1 mutation resulted in significantly tighter stomatal closure at a wide range of physiologically relevant ABA concentrations (Pei et al., 1998; Allen et al., 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Transgenic Brassica napus silenced for Era1 showed enhanced ABA sensitivity as well as significant reduction in stomatal conductance and water transpiration under drought stress conditions (Wang et al., 2005). Cyp707a is a catabolic gene encoding ABA 8’-hydroxylase, an enzyme playing a key role in ABA catabolism and in controlling ABA levels in various aspects of the plant life cycle (Kushiro et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The Cyp707a gene reportedly degrades ABA during seed imbibition and dehydration stress (Kushiro et al., 2004; Saito et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>A T-DNA insertion mutant of Cyp707a3, which is the most abundantly expressed gene among the four Cyp707a members under stress conditions, exhibited elevated drought tolerance with a concomitant reduction in transpiration rate (Umezawa et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>A third gene is Sal1, an inositol polyphosphate1-phosphatase-encoding gene. Sal1 was originally isolated from Arabidopsis for its ability to complement a salt-sensitive yeast strain (Quintero et al., 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In Arabidopsis, mutation of this gene has shown increased drought tolerance (Wilson et al., 2009). Sal1 acts as a negative regulator of predominantly ABA-independent and also ABA-dependent stress response pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>As far as is known, none of these three genes have been experimentally proven to have a role in drought tolerance in wheat. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, wheat homologues for Sal1 have not been identified prior to this study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p content-type="indent"><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Homologous genes in different species may not have the same function due to the different course of evolution that each species has taken. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The high frequencies of duplication and deletion events in the wheat genome make it difficult to predict the function of a gene in one species based on the function of the homologous gene in the other species (Dubcovsky and Dvorak, 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it has been shown that while common regulatory mechanisms exist across species in response to abiotic stress, the conservation of the molecular response to dehydration across experiments (Mohammadi et al., 2007; Aprile et al., 2009) is low due to variation in stress dynamics, stage of development and tissue analysed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p content-type="indent"><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Functional validation of the role of genes in stress can be studied either by overexpression or downregulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>For gene overexpression studies, full-length sequence information and an efficient genetic transformation protocol are required. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>However, wheat has been the most recalcitrant cereal species to culture in vitro (Shah et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Transformation in wheat is still confined mainly to a few responsive varieties with quite different transformation frequencies such as the model spring genotype ‘Bobwhite’ (Cheng et al., 1997, 2003; Hu et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>For downregulation studies, knockout mutants are used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Not only will this require a transformation step, but the functional redundancy of homeologous genes present in the other wheat genomes could complement the absence of gene expression resulting from a single gene knockout (Lawrence and Pikaard, 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>This limitation can be overcome by generating double and triple mutants, although this process is cumbersome and time consuming. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Therefore, faster alternatives are required for functional gene analysis in polyploid wheat. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p content-type="indent"><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) provides an alternative strategy for gene functional analysis through the simultaneous knockdown of expression of multiple related gene copies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>This is a technique that was first developed in dicots (Burch-Smith et al., 2006) and is based on post-transcriptional gene silencing of host sequences that are complementary to host-derived sequences contained in a recombinant viral vector inoculated on plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>VIGS was developed in barley using barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV), a natural pathogen in this species and consisting of a tripartite genome (Holzberg et al., 2002; Lu et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The usefulness of VIGS in wheat was first demonstrated by Scofield et al. (2005) and has now been used to study genes for resistance to pathogens and the Russian wheat aphid (Scofield et al., 2005; Cloutier et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2007; Van Eck et al, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>VIGS has not been used for characterization of water stress response genes in wheat. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p content-type="indent"><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The main objective of this study was to evaluate the roles of Era1, Cyp707a, and Sal1 in the response of wheat to limiting water conditions using VIGS. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to test whether single genes that have been shown to enhance drought tolerance in Arabidopsis when mutated would have similar effects in wheat. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>Three genes, namely Era1, Cyp707a, and Sal1, that represent different abiotic stress pathways were selected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>The VIGS technique offered the best approach for testing the function of these genes in wheat for several reasons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>The most important reason is that VIGS does not require a transformation step, which is still technically challenging in wheat. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>The potential of homologous copies of a gene to compensate for the absence of a homologue that has been silenced can be overcome in VIGS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>All endogenous mRNA with at least 80% similarity to the host-derived sequence contained in the viral vector are targets for degradation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>While this is an advantage of VIGS, it is also a disadvantage in that the specific gene responsible for the effect is not known and would require further experiments. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p content-type="indent"><text><SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>One concern of using VIGS for evaluating putative drought tolerance genes is the fact that environmental conditions used for stress induction might not favour viral replication leading to poor silencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>The stress protocol used in the present study involved initial exposure of silenced plants to an acclimation stress prior to exposure to severe stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>The viral inoculation was done at late evening on well-watered healthy plants and water stress was imposed gradually over 4 dpi by gradually withholding water. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>The initial adjustment time was important as the virus also imparts some level of stress on the plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>The protocol to characterize genes involved in the stress-recovery response involved inoculation of VIGS vector 4 days prior to water stress induction to coincide with higher transcript downregulation of targeted genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>The levels of silencing (from 2.6- to 22-fold) achieved for the targeted genes were comparable to other VIGS wheat studies (Scofield et al., 2005; Bruun-Rasmussen et al., 2007; Van Eck et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>The consistent phenotype across the silenced plants also neutralized the concern of the stress response to BSMV masking the effect of water stress effects, suggesting that drought trait functional studies can be carried out by VIGS in wheat. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p content-type="indent"><text><SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Of the three genes tested, only Era1 and Sal1 showed similar phenotypes in wheat upon loss of function as has been reported in Arabidopsis (Wang et al., 2005; Wilson et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>A possible role of regulation of stomatal conductance was indicated for the improved performance of Era1- and Sal1-silenced plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Closed stomata has been suggested to lead to decreased photosynthesis and therefore decreased productivity for the plant in well-watered conditions (Farquhar and Sharkey, 1982; Schulze, 1986). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>The present experiment observed improved WUE compared to the viral control water-stressed BSMV0-inoculated plants, indicating better dry weight production under limiting water condition for BSMVEra1- and BSMVSal1-treated plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>A likely explanation is that plants which regulate the stomatal opening ‘efficiently’ and conserve water can achieve larger biomass per gram of water used (Farquhar and Richards 1984; Araus et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p content-type="indent"><text><SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>In the case of Sal1, loss of function was reported to yield shorter and rounder leaves in Arabidopsis with an enhanced drought tolerance (Umezawa et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Down-regulation of Sal1 leads to constitutively increased ABA content in A. thaliana (Wilson et al., 2009). Sal1 acts as a negative regulator of predominantly ABA-independent as well as ABA-dependent stress response pathways, such that its inactivation results in altered osmoprotectants, higher leaf RWC, and maintenance of viable tissues during prolonged water stress (Wilson et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>This study also showed that reduced expression of Sal1 in wheat resulted in increased RWC, and increased WUE, as well as improved vigour, suggesting a similar function of Sal1 in wheat. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>No other unusual phenotype was observed except increased/accelerated tillering, which is difficult to interpret at this point due to limited understanding of the mode of action of Sal1. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Loss of function of Cyp707a was reported to enhance drought tolerance in A. thaliana (Umezawa et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Cyp707a-silenced wheat plants did not show any improvements in terms of dry weight, WUE, or RWC of silenced plants compared to water-stressed BSMV0-treated control plants under water stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>The differences in response between Arabidopsis and wheat plants to loss of function of Cyp707a may be due to differences in stress adaptation pathways between wheat and Arabidopsis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Another possible reason for the observed difference may have to do with the structure of the Cyp707a gene family in the two species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>In A. thaliana, the Cyp707a gene family consists of Cyp707a1–Cyp707a4, all of which are upregulated in response to dehydration and subsequent rehydration, suggesting that the function of Cyp707a genes is redundant (Kushiro et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Although there is only one Cyp707a cDNA sequence reported for wheat (accession EU430344.1), with three copies amplified by PCR in hexaploid wheat in this study, it is possible that other copies of Cyp707a exist in wheat. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>The DNA sequences of these other copies could potentially be different enough to cause ineffective silencing using the VIGS construct used in this study, leading to compensation of gene function by the remaining active genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>This emphasizes the importance of having the wheat genome sequence information in attempts to functionally test Arabidopsis gene homologues in wheat. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p content-type="indent"><text><SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Out of the three genes tested in this study, Era1 appeared to be the most promising as a potential target for drought tolerance breeding in wheat. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Mutations in Era1 could be readily identified through TILLING, taking advantage of resources that already exist in wheat (Slade and Knauf, 2005; Uauy et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Because of the role of ABA in germination and dormancy, the present study tested Era1-silenced plants for germination rates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Indeed, Era1-silencing done at the booting stage resulted in a 6–10-day delay in germination compared to non-silenced plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>This trait may provide a solution for tackling pre-harvest sprouting in wheat. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>Pre-harvest sprouting is a consequence of ABA deficiency and leads to loss of grain weight and a reduction in end-use quality of wheat (Fang and Chu, 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>While Era1 has also been suggested to play a role in basal defence against bacteria and oomycytes (Goritschnig et al., 2008), the Era1-silenced wheat plants showed similar phenotypes in response to bacterial infection as non-silenced wheat plants under both water stress and well-watered conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>This implies that there is no fitness cost to Era1-silenced plants under favourable conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>It would be interesting to further study the differences in the function of Era1 in pathogen susceptibility between wheat and Arabidopsis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p content-type="indent"><text><SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study showed the involvement of Era1 and Sal1 in response to water deficit stress tolerance in wheat. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of VIGS being successfully used in wheat to functionally characterize genes thought to be involved in drought tolerance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>The transient nature of VIGS did not deter from generating valuable observations for screening potential drought tolerant genes in wheat. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Results from the present study indicate that downregulation of genes which reduce stomatal conductance may be a useful strategy for enhancing drought tolerance in wheat, if the same results hold in the field. </plain></SENT>
