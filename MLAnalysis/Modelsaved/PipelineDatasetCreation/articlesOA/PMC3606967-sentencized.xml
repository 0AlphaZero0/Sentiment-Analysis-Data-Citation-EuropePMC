</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Among grain legumes, common bean (dry bean, Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is dominant for direct human consumption. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Like other grain legumes, its protein quality is limited by the sub-optimal levels of the essential sulfur amino acids, Met, and Cys. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Common bean accumulates high levels of a non-protein sulfur amino acid in seed, S-methyl-Cys, partly in the form of a γ-Glu dipeptide (Giada et al., 1998; Taylor et al., 2008). γ-Glu-S-methyl-Cys accumulates exclusively in seed and not in other tissues (Watanabe et al., 1971). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The non-protein amino acid, S-methyl-Cys, cannot substitute for Met or Cys in the diet (Padovese et al., 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The taxonomic distribution of S-methyl-Cys encompasses all Phaseolus and several Vigna species, notably cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), and mung bean (Vigna radiata), but excludes black gram (Vigna mungo) and adzuki bean (Vigna angularis), two Asian Vigna species (Baldi and Salamini, 1973; Evans and Boulter, 1975; Kasai and Larsen, 1980; Kasai et al., 1986). V. mungo accumulates the dipeptide γ-Glu-Met rather than γ-Glu-S-methyl-Cys (Otoul et al., 1975). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>While S-methyl-Cys may be formed by direct methylation of Cys in radish, this does not appear to be the case in common bean (Thompson and Gering, 1966). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Rather, it was proposed to be formed by the condensation of O-acetylserine and methanethiol, catalyzed by O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (also designated as Cys synthase), a member of the β-substituted Ala synthase (BSAS) family of enzymes. O-Acetylserine sulfhydrylase partially purified from common bean seedlings catalyzes this reaction in vitro (Smith and Thompson, 1971). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>This reaction also takes place in Arabidopsis cell cultures grown in the presence of a high concentration of Met (Rébeillé et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The detection of small amounts of S-methylhomoglutathione in V. radiata seeds suggests that homoglutathione synthetase may accept to some extent γ-Glu-S-methyl-Cys as substrate (Kasai et al., 1986). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In common bean, a deficiency of the major seed storage proteins, the 7S globulin phaseolin, and the lectin phytohemagglutinin results in a shift of sulfur from S-methyl-Cys to the Cys and Met pools in protein (Taylor et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Lack of the major storage proteins is compensated by increased levels of several sulfur-rich proteins, including the 11S globulin legumin, albumin-2, defensin D1, albumin-1, and Bowman–Birk type proteinase inhibitor (Marsolais et al., 2010; Yin et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Analysis of microarray data revealed increased levels of transcripts for two additional types of sulfur-rich proteins, the basic 7S globulin and Kunitz trypsin inhibitor, and a general up-regulation of transcripts coding for sulfate transporters and enzymes of sulfur amino acid metabolism (Liao et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Up-regulation of SERAT1;1 and -1;2 expression indicated an activation of cytosolic O-acetylserine biosynthesis, while down-regulation of SERAT2;1 encoding a predicted plastidic enzyme suggested that Cys and S-methyl-Cys biosynthesis may take place in different subcellular compartments, providing an explanation for their opposite regulation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In the present study, Roche 454 Genome Sequencer FLX pyrosequencing was utilized to profile the developing seed transcriptome of the two closely related species, P. vulgaris and V. mungo, both members of subtribe Phaseolinae, which differ by the accumulation of γ-Glu-S-methyl-Cys and γ-Glu-Met, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In P. vulgaris, this technology has been used to investigate transcripts from leaf, flower, root, and pod (Kalavacharla et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2012), whereas Illumina’s sequencing by synthesis technology has been used to profile the seed transcriptome (Young et al., 2011; Zhai et al., 2011) and identify microRNAs (Peláez et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Transcript profiling data generated by high-throughput sequencing has not been reported yet from V. mungo but is available from V. radiata and V. unguiculata (Barrera-Figueroa et al., 2011; Kido et al., 2011; Moe et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Differences in the expression of sulfate transporters and enzymes of sulfur amino acid metabolism suggest adaptations which may be related to the accumulation of distinct sulfur amino acid γ-Glu dipeptides in developing seed. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>A prior study focusing on gene expression analysis between a pair of related P. vulgaris genotypes contrasted in the accumulation of Cys and S-methyl-Cys indicated that increased levels of Cys were associated with enhanced gene expression of cytosolic SERAT1;1 and -1;2, while lower levels of S-methyl-Cys were associated with decreased transcript levels for plastidic SERAT2;1 (Liao et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>This finding suggested a spatial separation of Cys and S-methyl-Cys biosynthesis in different subcellular compartments, the cytosol, and plastids, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>These data appeared consistent with the fact that legume seeds rely primarily on cytosolic de novo Cys biosynthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Indeed, overexpression of a cytosolic O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase in soybean seed led to increased Cys levels (Kim et al., 2012), whereas overexpression of a plastidic SERAT did not alter sulfur amino acid concentration in chickpea seed (Tabe et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>In agreement with these findings, BSAS1;1, encoding a cytosolic O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase, was among the most highly expressed members of the BSAS family. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the member with the highest expression, BSAS4;1 encodes a cytosolic Cys desulfhydrase. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>The largest difference in expression between species was observed for BSAS3;1 encoding a β-cyanoalanine synthase predicted to be localized in plastids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, β-cyanoalanine synthase purified from aerial tissues of Lathyrus latifolius and from leaves of Spinacia oleracea catalyzed the formation of S-methyl-Cys from Cys and methanethiol at a relatively low rate corresponding to 1–4% of β-cyanoalanine synthase activity (Ikegami et al., 1988a,b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>This activity reached 13% for the β-cyanoalanine synthase purified from developing seeds of Vicia angustifolia (Ikegami et al., 1989). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the previous implication of plastidial SERAT2;1, the approximately 10-fold higher expression of BSAS3;1 in P. vulgaris as compared with V. mungo, encoding a plastidic β-cyanoalanine synthase, and the fact that this enzyme may catalyze a similar reaction with methanethiol as with hydrogen cyanide, leading to the formation of S-methyl-Cys suggests that BSAS3;1 may be responsible for the formation of S-methyl-Cys in P. vulgaris seed. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>This suggests that some S-methyl-Cys may accumulate in S-methylated phytochelatins, which may account, at least in part, for the discrepancy between concentrations measured for γ-Glu-S-methyl-Cys and total S-methyl-Cys in P. vulgaris seed (Taylor et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
