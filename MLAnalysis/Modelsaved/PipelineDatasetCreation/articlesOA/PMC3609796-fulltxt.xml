In this study, we performed an expression profiling screen and detected 1312 genes that were differentially expressed (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 and fold change &gt;1.5) in PE placentas, including <italic>LEP</italic> and <italic>SH3PXD2A</italic>. After validating the microarray results, we conducted the quantitative methylation analysis of <italic>LEP</italic> and <italic>SH3PXD2A</italic> in preeclamptic (n&#8202;=&#8202;16) versus normal placentas (n&#8202;=&#8202;16). Our results showed that many CpG sites close to the transcriptional start site (TSS) of <italic>LEP</italic> gene were hypomethylated in placentas from pregnancies with PE compared with those of in controls, including the TSS position (<italic>p</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;0.001), the binding sites of Sp1 (<italic>p</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;1.57&#215;10<sup>&#8722;4</sup>), LP1 (<italic>p</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;0.023) and CEBP&#945; (<italic>p</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;0.031). Luciferase reporter analysis confirmed the aberrant methylation of <italic>LEP</italic> promoter and CEBP&#945; co-transfection had a role in the regulation of gene expression. Our results indicated the aberrant <italic>LEP</italic> promoter methylation was involved in the development of PE. We did not find a significant methylation differences between groups in the promoter region of <italic>SH3PXD2A</italic>, however, a CGI region in the gene body (CGI34) presented a higher methylation in preeclamptic placentas (<italic>p</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;1.57&#215;10<sup>&#8722;4</sup>), which might promote the efficiency of gene transcription. We speculated that SH3PXD2A may take part in the pathogenesis of PE through its role in the regulation of trophoblast cell invasion in the period of placenta formation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the 973 Program (2009825606, 2010CB529600), the National Key Technology R&amp;D Program (2012BAI01B09), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (30800616, 81000256, 81121001), the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Science and Technology Program (09DJ1400601), the Shanghai Rising-Star Program (09QA1400500) and the Mingdao Program of Medical Student (MDJH2012027).

A great deal of researches have been conducted to explore the precise etiology of PE over the past decades. Some progress has been made toward the emerging consensus that PE is a heterogenic multisystem disorder and that a variety of theories such as endothelial dysfunction <xref rid="pone.0059753-Maynard1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059753-Roberts1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, maternal-fetal (paternal) immune maladaptation <xref rid="pone.0059753-Hennessy1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059753-Saito1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and dysregulated inflammatory factors <xref rid="pone.0059753-Ramma1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> have been suggestive of being the contributors to PE occurrence. To date, no definitive therapeutic interventions have been identified; and the only effective cure to treat PE is delivery of the placenta <xref rid="pone.0059753-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, which would lead to low birth-weight infant that brings about long-term adverse health effects such as cardiovascular disease <xref rid="pone.0059753-Barker1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Hence, it is of great significance to understand the underlying pathogenesis of the disease.</p><p>DNA methylation, the most extensively studied epigenetic modification, has been indicated to be involved in the development of human diseases <xref rid="pone.0059753-Feinberg1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0059753-Urdinguio1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Consequently, it is essential to understand the roles of DNA methylation in disease processes. Numerous studies have indicated high homocysteine in the plasma of pregnancies with PE <xref rid="pone.0059753-Guven1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0059753-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, while multivitamin supplements containing folic acid and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> are correlated with reduced risk of PE <xref rid="pone.0059753-Kulkarni1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059753-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, which indicate the potential role of DNA methylation in the pathophysiology of PE. Furthermore, to acquire a deep insight into PE at the molecular level, the association of DNA methylation with PE has been intensively studied both in the gene-specific pattern <xref rid="pone.0059753-Chelbi1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0059753-Muller1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and in the genome-wide level <xref rid="pone.0059753-Kulkarni1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059753-Yuen1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.

Given all that, DNA methylation appears to be a significant factor in the development of PE.</p><p>The causal relationship between promoter DNA methylation aberrations and gene expression differences has been well established. Promoter hypermethylation has been shown to associate with transcriptional repression and hence decreases expression and functional gene dosage; while demethylation in the promoter region will increase the transcription. Given the association of DNA methylation with PE mentioned above, we want to make an investigation of genes and functional networks with regard to epigenetics. So far, comparative gene expression profiling analyses of normal and pathological placentas have identified subsets of genes with altered expression <xref rid="pone.0059753-Louwen1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>; however, few studies have been performed to explore the mechanisms that underlie the differential gene expression. Consequently, it is valuable to estimate the relative contribution of changes in DNA methylation levels to gene expression differences.</p><p>In the current study, we have performed a global gene expression profiling via oligonucleotide microarrays of placental tissue from preeclamptic pregnancies and uncomplicated pregnancies to explore genes with differential expression.

However, among the differentially expressed genes, our current study and previous microarray analysis share a series of common genes listed in supplementary material <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0059753.s004">Table S2</xref>.

Among the genes with expression difference, <italic>LEP</italic> showed significant differences in DNA methylation in the CpG sites in the vicinity of TSS including the binding sites of transcription factors Sp1, LP1 and CEBP&#945; in preeclamptic placentas compared with that in controls. Previous study in adipose cells <xref rid="pone.0059753-Melzner1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and our luciferase reporter assay in JEG-3 cells both pointed out that CEBP&#945; expression was needed for stimulation of <italic>LEP</italic> promoter transcriptional activity and the methylation patterns of the CpG in the binding site of CEBP&#945; participated in the regulation of <italic>LEP</italic> expression. As a result, we speculated that the demethylation in the corresponding CpG sites might influence the binding of the transcription factors, thereby led to the altered LEP expression in placentas from pregnancies with PE.</p><p>Leptin, the encoding protein of the <italic>LEP</italic> gene <xref rid="pone.0059753-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, which possesses pleiotropic effects with regulatory function in reproductive maturity and fertility such as regulation of ovarian function and implantation by promoting proliferation and survival of trophoblastic cells <xref rid="pone.0059753-Cervero1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, has been repeatedly proven to be up-regulated not only in preeclamptic placentas <xref rid="pone.0059753-Enquobahrie1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0059753-Varkonyi1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, but also in the maternal plasma of pregnancies with PE <xref rid="pone.0059753-Nakatsukasa1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. In this regard, leptin must have played an important role in the development of PE, and it is necessary to reiterate the need for further research dedicated to elucidating its role in PE. Our study is so far the first report about the significant relationship between <italic>LEP</italic> proximal promoter methylation and PE. The small correlation coefficient between the DNA methylation and gene expression data is partially due to the small sample size used in the correlation study, which may also suggest that other mechanisms besides DNA methylation may involve in the regulation of gene expression. Previous studies have demonstrated that the hormone hCG <xref rid="pone.0059753-Maymo1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, estrogens <xref rid="pone.0059753-ONeil1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, cAMP <xref rid="pone.0059753-Maymo2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> and glucocorticoid response elements <xref rid="pone.0059753-Maymo3" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> are also confirmed to be responsible for the regulation of leptin expression. As a result, we have predicted that DNA methylation was a potential approach in the regulation of <italic>LEP</italic> expression.</p><p>
<italic>SH3PXD2A</italic>, also known as <italic>FISH</italic>, <italic>TKS5</italic> or <italic>SH3MD1</italic>, located on 10q24.33, is predicted with several transcriptive isoforms. Researches have stated that the distribution of the CGI is obligatory for understanding the functions of DNA methylation <xref rid="pone.0059753-Jones2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Consequently, current study measured the methylation level of 3 CGIs (CGI74, CGI18 and CGI34) of <italic>SH3PXD2A</italic> in the gene body besides the one (CGI71) in the proximal promoter region. Interestingly, our results presented that nearly all the CpG sites were significantly hypermethylated in the preeclamptic placentas with high methylation (methylation level in all CpG sites &gt;0.6) in CGI34 region. Prior research has pointed out that the methylation in gene body CGI, unlike the CGI in TSS, is positively correlated with gene expression <xref rid="pone.0059753-Jones3" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Hence, the hypermethylated CGI34 perhaps participated in the upregulation of SH3PXD2A expression in placentas from pregnancies with PE.</p><p>The encoding product of <italic>SH3PXD2A</italic> is a scaffolding protein and Src kinase substrates comprised of an amino-terminal Phox homology (PX) domain and five Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, as well as multiple motifs for binding both SH2 and SH3 domaincontaining proteins <xref rid="pone.0059753-Abram1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. As yet, there are no reports concerning SH3PXD2A for PE. Of all the published data about <italic>SH3PXD2A</italic>, it is worthy to note the role of the encoding protein by <italic>SH3PXD2A</italic> in invadopodia or podosome formation that promotes cell metastasis <xref rid="pone.0059753-Seals1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0059753-Weaver1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Placenta is of pseudo-malignant nature, and trophoblast invasion is important for its formation. Patel <italic>et al.</italic> have reported the extravillous trophoblasts regulated extracellular matrix degradation through formation of atypical podosomes <xref rid="pone.0059753-Patel1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, which are of protrusive structures formed on the trophoblasts, and are also actin-rich and are able to degrade the extracelluar matrix during the invasion. The degradation ability and dynamics of the structures have the characteristics of both podosome and invadopodia. The product encoding by <italic>SH3PXD2A</italic> may participated in the invasion of trophoblast cells in the formation of placenta, and PE is hallmarked by the deregulation of the trophoblast invasion, in this regard, we therefore speculated that the encoding protein by SH3PXD2A might take part in the development of PE.</p><p>It is worthy to note that the placentas used in our present study were all from pregnancies after delivery. Consequently, the differentially expressed genes in the microarray analysis were either responsible for the origin of PE or the consequence of the disease after the onset of PE. In summary, we adopted the gene expression microarray analysis between groups to search for the candidate genes for following DNA methylation analysis. The aberrant methylation of the interesting gene candidates <italic>LEP</italic> and <italic>SH3PXD2A</italic> might partially contribute to the deregulation of their expression. We are the first to report the relationship between <italic>LEP</italic> proximal promoter methylation and PE and our results firstly proposed an unexpected link between <italic>SH3PXD2A</italic> and the development of PE.
