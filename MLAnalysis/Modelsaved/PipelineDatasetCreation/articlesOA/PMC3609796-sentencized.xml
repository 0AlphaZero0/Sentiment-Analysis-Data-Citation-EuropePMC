</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Pre-eclampsia (PE; MIM 189800), a devastating pregnancy-associated disorder, is characterized by de-novo hypertension and proteinuria at or after 20 weeks’ gestation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The disease has a prevalence of 5–8% in nulliparous pregnancies and has been a leading cause of perinatal materno-foetal morbidity and mortality worldwide [1]–[3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The World Health Organization (WHO) Nations has proposed the goals of PE treatment by reducing maternal mortality by 75% between 1990 and 2015 [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A great deal of researches have been conducted to explore the precise etiology of PE over the past decades. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Some progress has been made toward the emerging consensus that PE is a heterogenic multisystem disorder and that a variety of theories such as endothelial dysfunction [5], [6], maternal-fetal (paternal) immune maladaptation [7], [8] and dysregulated inflammatory factors [9] have been suggestive of being the contributors to PE occurrence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>To date, no definitive therapeutic interventions have been identified; and the only effective cure to treat PE is delivery of the placenta [3], which would lead to low birth-weight infant that brings about long-term adverse health effects such as cardiovascular disease [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Hence, it is of great significance to understand the underlying pathogenesis of the disease. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation, the most extensively studied epigenetic modification, has been indicated to be involved in the development of human diseases [11]–[15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Consequently, it is essential to understand the roles of DNA methylation in disease processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Numerous studies have indicated high homocysteine in the plasma of pregnancies with PE [16]–[19], while multivitamin supplements containing folic acid and vitamin B12 are correlated with reduced risk of PE [17], [19], which indicate the potential role of DNA methylation in the pathophysiology of PE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, to acquire a deep insight into PE at the molecular level, the association of DNA methylation with PE has been intensively studied both in the gene-specific pattern [20]–[22] and in the genome-wide level [17], [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In addition to the well-defined SERPINA3 [22], APC [21] and TIMP3 [23], [24], a series of genes with differential methylation related to collagen metabolism, angiogenesis and blood vessel development have also been identified to be involved in PE with aberrant methylation patterns [17], [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Given all that, DNA methylation appears to be a significant factor in the development of PE. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The causal relationship between promoter DNA methylation aberrations and gene expression differences has been well established. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Promoter hypermethylation has been shown to associate with transcriptional repression and hence decreases expression and functional gene dosage; while demethylation in the promoter region will increase the transcription. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Given the association of DNA methylation with PE mentioned above, we want to make an investigation of genes and functional networks with regard to epigenetics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>So far, comparative gene expression profiling analyses of normal and pathological placentas have identified subsets of genes with altered expression [26]; however, few studies have been performed to explore the mechanisms that underlie the differential gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Consequently, it is valuable to estimate the relative contribution of changes in DNA methylation levels to gene expression differences. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we have performed a global gene expression profiling via oligonucleotide microarrays of placental tissue from preeclamptic pregnancies and uncomplicated pregnancies to explore genes with differential expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Among the differentially expressed genes in our study, we picked up LEP, the gene with biggest expression difference, and SH3PXD2A, the gene with the most significant p value, for further analysis to explore the relevance of DNA methylation in the development of PE as increasing studies suggested that aberrant DNA methylation was considered as a pathogenic factor in the onset of PE [20], [27], [28]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we applied gene expression microarray analysis to PE and control groups to search the candidate genes for following DNA methylation analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>To control the maternal age and body mass index of pregnancies, the sample size used in the expression profile is small (5 placentas with PE and 7 controls), which might contribute to so many differentially expressed genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>However, among the differentially expressed genes, our current study and previous microarray analysis share a series of common genes listed in supplementary material Table S2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>The homogeneity identified in our study suggested the effectiveness of our microarray analysis and the value to take further research. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Based on the bioinformatics analysis, significantly enriched gene sets and pathways, including cell adhesion, immune response and pathways in cancer were identified through gene ontology (GO) database (Figure 1b) and KEGG database. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>They functionally suggested that the disease was heterogeneous and multi-factorial, that previous mentioned pathogenic theories such as the immune maladaptation between the mother and the fetus [7], [8] and the impaired invasion of the extravillous trophoblast [35] are contributive to the occurrence of PE. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>It is widely accepted that promoter DNA methylation plays a role in the regulation of gene expression in mammalian cells and is considered as an important contributor to disease states [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Among the genes with expression difference, LEP showed significant differences in DNA methylation in the CpG sites in the vicinity of TSS including the binding sites of transcription factors Sp1, LP1 and CEBPα in preeclamptic placentas compared with that in controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Previous study in adipose cells [34] and our luciferase reporter assay in JEG-3 cells both pointed out that CEBPα expression was needed for stimulation of LEP promoter transcriptional activity and the methylation patterns of the CpG in the binding site of CEBPα participated in the regulation of LEP expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>As a result, we speculated that the demethylation in the corresponding CpG sites might influence the binding of the transcription factors, thereby led to the altered LEP expression in placentas from pregnancies with PE. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Leptin, the encoding protein of the LEP gene [37], which possesses pleiotropic effects with regulatory function in reproductive maturity and fertility such as regulation of ovarian function and implantation by promoting proliferation and survival of trophoblastic cells [38], has been repeatedly proven to be up-regulated not only in preeclamptic placentas [39]–[43], but also in the maternal plasma of pregnancies with PE [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>In this regard, leptin must have played an important role in the development of PE, and it is necessary to reiterate the need for further research dedicated to elucidating its role in PE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Our study is so far the first report about the significant relationship between LEP proximal promoter methylation and PE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>The small correlation coefficient between the DNA methylation and gene expression data is partially due to the small sample size used in the correlation study, which may also suggest that other mechanisms besides DNA methylation may involve in the regulation of gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated that the hormone hCG [45], estrogens [46], cAMP [47] and glucocorticoid response elements [48] are also confirmed to be responsible for the regulation of leptin expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>As a result, we have predicted that DNA methylation was a potential approach in the regulation of LEP expression. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Prior research has pointed out that the methylation in gene body CGI, unlike the CGI in TSS, is positively correlated with gene expression [50]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>The product encoding by SH3PXD2A may participated in the invasion of trophoblast cells in the formation of placenta, and PE is hallmarked by the deregulation of the trophoblast invasion, in this regard, we therefore speculated that the encoding protein by SH3PXD2A might take part in the development of PE. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>It is worthy to note that the placentas used in our present study were all from pregnancies after delivery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the differentially expressed genes in the microarray analysis were either responsible for the origin of PE or the consequence of the disease after the onset of PE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>In summary, we adopted the gene expression microarray analysis between groups to search for the candidate genes for following DNA methylation analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>The aberrant methylation of the interesting gene candidates LEP and SH3PXD2A might partially contribute to the deregulation of their expression. </plain></SENT>
