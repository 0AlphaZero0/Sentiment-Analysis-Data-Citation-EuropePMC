<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the results of a draft genome analysis targeting Nodularia spumigena sp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CCY9414 (from here on N. spumigena CCY9414), a toxin-producing, N2-fixing, filamentous cyanobacterium isolated from the brackish waters of the southern Baltic Sea. N. spumigena as member of the Nostocales has a complex lifestyle, capable of cell differentiation within their long trichomes [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>This cyanobacterium can differentiate vegetative cells into akinetes, heterocysts or hormogonia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Heterocysts are specialized cells for N2-fixation, which develop a thick cell wall and have lost photosystem II in order to decrease the internal oxygen concentration to a level that allows nitrogenase activity during the day time (for reviews see [3], [4]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Heterocysts are usually only formed when combined nitrogen is not available, but in N. spumigena AV1 heterocyst differentiation appeared to be uncoupled from the nitrogen supply [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Akinetes are cell types that serve the long-term survival of the organism under stress and non-growth permitting conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>It is thought that N. spumigena forms akinetes in the Baltic Sea during autumn. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The akinetes sink and overwinter in the bottom sediments from where they may be mixed back into the water column during spring and as such serve as the inoculum for a new population [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Hormogonia are short motile trichomes consisting of small-sized vegetative cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>They are formed from akinetes or from vegetative cells and serve the dispersal of the organism. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Heterocystous cyanobacteria of the group Nostocales can be divided into two major groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>There are several genome sequences available for the clade encompassing species such as Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133, Anabaena sp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>PCC 7120 (from here Anabaena PCC 7120) and Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413, whereas for the other clade, including Nodularia ( Fig. 1 ), genome-level studies have only recently been started [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The strain N. spumigena CCY9414 was isolated from brackish surface waters of the Baltic Sea (near Bornholm). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>This isolate is a typical representative of the bloom-forming planktonic filamentous N2-fixing cyanobacteria and an important component in an ecological context. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>These cyanobacteria release considerable amounts of the ‘new’ nitrogen fixed into the nitrogen-poor surface waters, thereby feeding the rest of the community with a key nutrient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>They contribute an estimated annual nitrogen input almost as large as the entire riverine load and twice the atmospheric load into the Baltic Sea proper [8], [9]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>For instance, N. spumigena produces the potent hepatotoxin nodularin [10] but it is still unclear to what extent the toxic blooms impact on related food chains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>High phosphorus combined with low to undetectable nitrogen concentrations during the summer season (hence low N∶P ratios) are principal factors favouring growth and bloom formation of Nodularia in the stratified Baltic Proper and Gulf of Finland [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon is particularly pronounced under periods of stably stratified warm water conditions when its gas vesicles provide buoyancy leading to the formation of large surface scums in the absence of mixing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The decomposition of such blooms causes depletion of dissolved oxygen contributing to anoxic bottom waters across large areas of the Baltic. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Thus, as a diazotroph, N. spumigena has a selective advantage under the virtually nitrogen-free, stably stratified warm brackish water conditions of the Baltic Sea with its salinity gradient from 28 practical salinity units (PSU, equivalent to permille) to almost freshwater conditions in the surface waters above the pycnocline. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>In the central Baltic Sea, the preferred habitat of N. spumigena, the salinity varies between 1–2 PSU. N. spumigena is found at similar locations throughout the world, where brackish water conditions prevail, for instance in the Peel-Harvey inlet (Western Australia [15], [16]), or the Neuse River estuary (USA, [17]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>In Australian brackish waters, N. spumigena blooms usually form between spring and autumn. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The primary motivation for this study was to obtain genomic information from brackish-water-adapted, bloom-forming and toxic cyanobacteria, in order to gain insights into adaptations permitting it to dominate in brackish water environments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>The draft genome sequence of N. spumigena CCY9414 allows a comparative genome analysis of its physiological capabilities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>The genome analysis was complemented by a transcriptome-wide mapping of transcriptional start sites (TSS) to be able to set its regulatory complexity in the context of previously studied cyanobacteria Synechocystis 6803 and Anabaena 7120 [18], [19] and to identify the suite of putative non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) [20], [21]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>The 16S rRNA-based phylogenetic tree of cyanobacteria shows two clades containing representatives from the Nostocales, clade I and clade II ( Fig. 1 ). N. spumigena CCY9414 is located in clade I as opposed to clade II containing the much better studied Nostocales Anabaena PCC 7120 and N. punctiforme ATCC 29133 (PCC 73102). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>These 16S rRNA genes are associated with two distinct ribosomal RNA operons characterized by their different intergenic transcribed spacer types, one also containing the tRNA-IleGAT and tRNA-AlaTGC genes, whereas the other is lacking these tRNA genes, as also previously described for the section V cyanobacterium Fischerella sp. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>From these, one major scaffold of 5,462,271 nt length and several short scaffolds (&lt;2 kb) were assembled. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>With this length, the genome appears smaller than those of several other Nostocales sequenced before (6.34, 6.41, 7.75 and 8.23 Mb for Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413, Anabaena 7120, Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101 and Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102) but larger than the minimal Nostocales genomes of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii CS-505 and Raphidiopsis brookii D9 (3.9 and 3.2 Mb [23]) and is comparable to the genome of Anabaena sp. strain 90 [7]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>The tRNA-LeuUAA gene contains a group I intron, which has been suggested as being of ancient origin [24], while the gene for the initiator tRNA, tRNA-fMetCAT, is intron-free, different from its ortholog in some other cyanobacteria [25]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>These transposases were identified by BLASTp searches against the ISfinder [26] requiring a BLASTp value of ≤1e10−5 and were assigned to 11 different families, each containing 1–32 identical copies, with highest copy numbers found for the IS200/IS605, IS607 and IS630 families of IS elements (Table S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>The large number, the high sequence similarity and the fact that active promoters were detected for many of the transposases indicate that a large part of the mobile genetic elements associated with them are active. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, when normalized to the genome size, the number of transposase genes is similar to many other cyanobacteria, for instance, 70 transposase genes are present in Synechocystis PCC 6803 with 3.7 Mb genome size. </plain></SENT>
