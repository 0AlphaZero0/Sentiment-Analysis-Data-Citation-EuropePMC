</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Chagas disease (CD) occurs in 18 different countries, mostly throughout South and Central America, and affects approximately 15 million people worldwide [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>CD pathogenesis, caused by the flagellated protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is still poorly understood and there is no available marker that indicates the progression to the different clinical forms or prognosis of chronic disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that approximately 50% of the individuals infected by T. cruzi stay in the indeterminate or asymptomatic form throughout their lives, which in general present good prognosis, each year about 2–5% of them progress to symptomatic forms of the disease, presenting irreversible cardiac and/or digestive and/or disorders [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>A plausible presumption is that individuals who remain asymptomatic are able to reduce parasite numbers in the early phase of infection, and down modulate the immune response, limiting the development of pathology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, individuals who will develop cardiac disease, although capable of parasite control, may not be capable of mounting efficient immunoregulatory mechanisms, thus leading to establishment of persistent inflammation [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The complement system has been shown to play an important role in the control of experimental T. cruzi infection, as well in clinical evolution of CD [4]–[8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Ficolins are pattern-recognition proteins which bind to specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) on microorganism surfaces, promoting activation of the complement cascade through the lectin pathway thereby triggering the innate immune response [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Other putative functions of ficolins include binding to late apoptotic cells, apoptotic bodies and necrotic cells, enhancing their uptake by macrophages [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The ficolins are synthesized as a single polypeptide containing N-collagen-tails and C-terminal fibrinogen-like binding domains, which are oligomerized into higher oligomeric forms [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In humans, three ficolin genes have been identified: FCN1, FCN2 and FCN3, which encode M-ficolin (ficolin-1), L-ficolin (ficolin-2) and H-ficolin (Hakata antigen or ficolin-3), respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of the FCN2 gene have been associated with the variability in the individual serum concentrations of the protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Studies have shown that the presence of the nucleotide adenine (A) at positions −986 A&gt;G and −602 A&gt;G as well as the nucleotide guanine (G) at the position −4G&gt;A are related to higher L-ficolin serum levels [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In addition, two polymorphisms located in exon 8, encoding the fibrinogen-like domain (containing T236M and A258S) are associated with decreased and increased ability of binding to acetylated residues, respectively [11]–[13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>L-ficolin levels and FCN2 polymorphisms have been reported to be associated with different diseases [14]–[20]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Both L-ficolin and H-ficolin are able to interact with the mannan-binding lectin (MBL)-associated serine proteases, promoting activation of the complement cascade [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>L-ficolin recognizes N-acetylated molecules, including N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) or N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) [22], [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The surface of T. cruzi contains a large diversity of N-linked and O-linked carbohydrate-rich molecules and it was recently demonstrated that T. cruzi activates the lectin pathway [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The authors have shown that a fast binding of L-ficolin occurs on the surface of T. cruzi and that the depletion of these molecules in the serum leads to failure of parasite clearance by the complement, indicating that the lectin pathway obviously plays an important role in host defense against this pathogen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Although it has been demonstrated that L-ficolin is involved in the host defense against T. cruzi infection, there are no studies on ficolins and chronic CD so far. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In this study we aim to evaluate whether L-ficolin levels and FCN2 polymorphisms could be possible prognostic markers for susceptibility to the different clinical forms of CD. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>In this study, L-ficolin levels were measured in plasma of the Chagas patients and controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>L-ficolin levels in the controls were within the range reported for healthy European adults in the early studies [29], [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>A decreased L-ficolin plasma level were observed in the Chagas patients when compared to controls, and a similar trend was observed between symptomatic patients and indeterminate, however, this difference was not significant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Importantly, serum L-ficolin concentrations were also lower in Bronchiectasis patients than controls from the UK [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>In contrast to our previous work with the same patients, where MBL levels increased gradually according to age, L-ficolin levels were higher in the group with 45 to 59 years of age, compared with those aged above 60 years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>There was also a trend to increased L-ficolin concentration in the healthy adults (P = 0.072), but others did not find any relationship between L-ficolin concentration and age in healthy Scottish adults [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between L-ficolin levels according to the gender of patients and controls, as expected [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>In addition, the difference of L-ficolin levels was observed among the different groups of cardiac commitment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Of which individuals with the less severe B form had higher L-ficolin levels than the C and D forms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, median L-ficolin levels are higher in acute than in chronic hepatitis B conditions [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>They are also higher in acute malaria, compared with the levels after treatment [16], but lower in Schistosoma haematobium-infected individuals from Nigeria, compared to controls [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Our results contrast with those found by our group in the same patients regarding MBL levels, which were much higher (above 1000 ng/ml) in patients with chagasic cardiomyopathy and did not differ between the B C and D stages [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a weak correlation between mannose-binding lectin and L-ficolin levels was observed in the indeterminate patients, but not in the other disease stages. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Allele and haplotype frequencies in the controls did not differ from those reported for European-derived populations [11], [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>No significant difference of haplotype distribution was observed between different groups, nevertheless, −4 A/G heterozygotes was observed to associate with the disease when compared cardiac patients to the controls as well as cardiac to the indeterminate patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>In addition, the AGG promoter haplotype, whose presence is obligatory in −4 A/G heterozygotes, was also associated with protection against HBV infection in Vietnamese [15], but with susceptibility to schistosomiasis in Nigeria [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Our group found the AGA haplotype to be associated with protection against clinical leprosy and rheumatic fever [14], [18], whereas others found it associated with susceptibility to cutaneous leishmaniasis [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Ficolin-2 seems to be, as MBL, a double-edged sword in immunity, explaining the contrasting results in association studies with different infectious diseases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>We also found an association of the allelic frequency of the 258S variant with cardiodigestive Chagas disease (Tables 3 and 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>The 258S variant was also found associated by others with earlier onset of Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization in cystic fibrosis patients [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>In contrast to our findings, homozygosity for this variant was associated with protection against cutaneous leishmaniasis in Syria [32] and the presence of this allele, with protection against cytomegalovirus, but not bacterial infections, after orthotopic liver transplantation [33], [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>It was not associated with respiratory tract infections in Dutch children [35], nor with invasive pneumococcal disease [36], rheumatoid arthritis [37] and Behçet’s disease in Japan [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, FCN2*258S, also known as FCN2-C, has increased N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) binding capacity [11] and O-linked GlcNAc moieties constitute a common epitope between cruzipain, a major T. cruzi antigen, and either myosin or other cardiac O-GlcNAc-containing proteins [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Higher GlcNAc binding capacity of this variant may thus correlate with complement activation and destructive deposition of membrane attack complexes (MAC) on muscle tissues of patients with cardiodigestive manifestations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>At least for chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy, increased MAC deposition has been observed, in contrast to patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy or controls [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Additionally, our study also showed that there are associations between 258S variant and L-ficolin level in the patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>The association between low L-ficolin levels and the 258S variant has also formerly been observed in other settings: healthy Danish individuals [13], Polish children with recurrent infections [12], Gabonese malaria patients (but not controls) [16], Vietnamese HBV-infected patients and controls [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this is the first report on L-ficolin levels and FCN2 polymorphisms in patients with chronic CD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Activation of the lectin and alternative complement system is a crucial defense mechanism for the control of T. cruzi parasitemia [7] and L-ficolin has been shown to bind metacyclic trypomastigotes [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Decreased levels of L-ficolin in chagasic patients reflect, in part, the higher frequency of the 258S variant in those with cardiodigestive symptoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>However, since most of the FCN2 genotypes did not associate with L-ficolin levels, reduction may also be due to the disease process itself, since L-ficolin can bind to T.cruzi antigens [7], to pentraxin 3 [41] and to the C-reactive protein [42], which might affect circulating levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>In addition, inflammatory activity and the resulting tissue fibrosis could be further exacerbated by the higher capacity of GlcNAc binding to the 258S variant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>L-ficolin levels and consumption could thus be used as markers of disease activity, but further experiments should be performed to prove this hypothesis. </plain></SENT>
