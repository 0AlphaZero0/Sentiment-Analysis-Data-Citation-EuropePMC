<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified two transcripts in host tissues (E. scolopes cry1 [escry1] and escry2) that encode cryptochromes, proteins that influence circadian rhythms in other systems. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, escry1 expression cycled in the symbiont-colonized light organ with 8-fold upregulation coincident with the rhythms of bacterial luminescence, which are offset from the day/night light regime. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Colonization of the juvenile light organ by symbionts was required for induction of escry1 cycling. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Biologists have studied the role of endogenous circadian rhythms in a wide array of biological processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Although direct evidence is not yet available, recent data hint that a host’s bacterial partners may affect or be affected by these rhythms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>For example, numerous studies have demonstrated that immune competence requires intact circadian rhythms (see, e.g., references 1 to 4), and recent discoveries have shown that the normal function of an animal’s immune system relies on interactions with the microbiota (reviewed in reference 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In addition, the gut, where most bacterial partners reside, has strong circadian rhythms for an array of processes from peristaltic activity to underlying molecular mechanisms (6, 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Transcriptomic data have shown that gene expression patterns of cells of the mucosal immune system of the gut and the epithelial cells that line the gut are strongly circadian (8, 9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Since the gut microbes provide a principal and critical input to this system, they likely impact and/or are impacted by the associated rhythms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Further, disease states, such as obesity and diabetes, have strong connections to both aberrant circadian rhythms of the gut and imbalances of the gut microbiota—although possible interactions between these two features have not been studied (10–13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="?"><plain>In this study, using the model association between the Hawaiian squid Euprymna scolopes and the luminous symbiont Vibrio fischeri (strain ES114) (Fig. 1A and B), we asked the following: can microbial symbionts directly influence daily rhythms of a host animal? </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>One family of proteins implicated in the control of light entrainment of circadian rhythms in animals is the group of blue-light receptors called cryptochromes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>They occur as components of the central oscillator, which resides in the animal brain, and in peripheral oscillators, such as in gut tissues (14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Cryptochromes are evolutionarily derived from the photolyases, which are DNA repair enzymes (Fig. 1D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Whereas all vertebrate cryptochromes arose from the same evolutionary event, invertebrate cryptochromes typically fall into one of two clades, each of which is the product of an independent evolutionary derivation of photolyases (15, 16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Studies of these proteins have demonstrated that members of one clade (Cry1) are light responsive and lead to degradation of repressors of the core clock machinery, and the others (Cry2) are light-independent transcriptional repressors of the core clock genes (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>All cryptochromes have the conserved amino acids critical for function, as well as the characteristic domain structure of photolyases (18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>However, cryptochromes have a defining C-terminal extension that does not occur in the photolyases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Whereas the role of cryptochromes in circadian rhythms has been well studied for many invertebrate groups (15, 19–24), the identification of cry gene sequences and in one case the expression pattern of a single cryptochrome (25) is the only information available for these genes in the Lophotrochozoa, the superphylum of animals that contains the squid host E. scolopes and its relatives. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>V. fischeri occurs as an extracellular symbiont in deep crypt spaces of the light organ of E. scolopes (Fig. 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The host animal has strong rhythms in its behavior; as a nocturnal predator, it remains buried in the sand during the day and emerges at night to forage in the water column (Fig. 1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Host and symbiont cells within the adult light organ have rhythmic patterns of gene expression that underlie day/night activities of the partners in the symbiosis (26). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Some behavioral evidence suggests that the night-active host animal uses the luminescence of the bacterial symbiont as an antipredatory camouflage in a process known as counterillumination (27). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Studies of the juvenile light organ have shown that the animal has molecular mechanisms by which to detect and respond to the bacterial luminescence (28). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Mutant symbionts defective in light emission are incapable of sustaining a symbiosis (29). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Such mutants are also defective in inducing full light-organ development (29), which is principally triggered by derivatives of symbiont MAMPs (microbe-associated molecular patterns). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>MAMPs are a class of molecules specific to microbes that trigger host animal responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>In the development of the squid-vibrio system, the lipid A moiety of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the peptidoglycan monomer TCT (or tracheal cytotoxin) are the MAMPs known to be active in inducing host light-organ morphogenesis (30). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Further, transcriptomic studies of the juvenile light organ revealed that colonization by luminous V. fischeri cells is required for normal symbiont-induced changes in host gene expression (31). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Particularly relevant here is the finding that the luminescence output of the animal is on a daily rhythm (Fig. 1C), which has key features of a circadian rhythm (32). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>In this rhythm, luminescence peaks at night, when the animal is active. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>As such, light presentation by symbionts in the organ occurs with timing nearly opposite to that of the exogenous cues of environmental light. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Transcriptional databases of the light organ (33) have revealed the expression of two genes that encode proteins with high sequence similarity to the known invertebrate cryptochromes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>This finding offered the opportunity to investigate and compare the role of cryptochromes in host squid rhythms in response to exogenous (environmental light) and endogenous (bioluminescence) light cues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Of broader significance, the presence of cryptochromes offered the opportunity to determine whether bacterial symbionts and their luminescence can operate as critical features in the elaboration of host rhythms. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Here we characterize phylogenetic relationships of the two cryptochrome genes identified in E. scolopes and activities of these host genes in response to interactions with the bacterial partner. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and subsequent BLAST and alignment analyses showed that the two transcripts are likely homologs of known cryptochromes (Fig. 1D; see also Fig. S1 and S2 in the supplemental material). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>The derived amino acid sequences of full-length transcripts have the typical structure of cryptochrome (Cry) proteins, with photolyase and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-binding domains characteristic of members of this protein family (34). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>In addition, both protein sequences have the conserved tryptophan residues that coordinate flavin binding (18) and conserved serine residues, whose phosphorylation is implicated in protein-protein interactions (35). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>To characterize the regulation of expression of the E. scolopes cry (escry) genes in the light organ, we performed real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) with symbiont-colonized juvenile light organs, ~2 days posthatch, at four times over the day/night cycle (Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>These points were chosen to avoid the daily, noncircadian venting of symbionts that occurs with a dawn light cue (36) and to capture the extremes of the luminescence cycle of the light organs (32). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>To compare patterns of cry expression in the light organ with those occurring in other invertebrates (37), we also performed qRT-PCR on the heads of the same juvenile animals, which contain tissues that typically have cycling cry expression in animals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Whereas the patterns of message levels for escry1 and escry2 showed statistically significant variation over the day in the head, as observed in other systems (37), i.e., in synchrony with environmental light, only escry1 mRNA levels varied over the day/night cycle in the light organ (Fig. 2A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Further, peak mRNA levels in the light organ were observed in periods of high light-organ luminescence, i.e., shifted ~6+ h from that observed in the head (Fig. 2A) (32). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Light organs extracted in the field from mature wild-caught animals show an expression profile similar to that of the lab-raised symbiotic juveniles, providing evidence that the pattern of escry1 expression is neither life stage specific nor due to laboratory conditions (Fig. 2B). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>The data presented in this study provide evidence that bacterial symbionts in the E. scolopes light organ influence the expression of a single cryptochrome gene and that luminescence of the symbionts may therefore provide input to a circadian oscillator in the host. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>In the larger context, these data suggest the possibility that the microbial partners of a symbiosis can be integrated into the biology of the host through an influence on daily rhythms. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>The cephalopod E. scolopes belongs to the phylum Mollusca, which occurs in the Lophotrochozoa, one of the three superphyla of animals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>No previous studies of the presence of cryptochromes have been reported for other cephalopods, and while they have been reported for other lophotrochozoans (25), none of these identified transcripts have been characterized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>The data presented here, along with the identification of cryptochrome genes from full-genome sequences from other species of this group, suggest that the lophotrochozoans typically have two genes encoding cryptochromes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>However, because of the small number of species examined thus far, other members of this superphylum may have fewer or more cry genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Our data for the phylogenetic relationships of the E. scolopes cry genes inside and outside the Lophotrochozoa agree with previous studies on cryptochrome radiation (15, 16), showing support for two main cryptochrome clades within the invertebrates. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>With the finding that symbiont luminescence entrains host rhythms, this study expands the known roles for cryptochrome proteins with the finding both that bacterial symbionts entrain rhythms and that luminescence is the critical feature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>As in E. scolopes, the different cryptochrome genes of an animal species often have different expression patterns in response to external stimuli (34). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>For example, only one of two cryptochromes is regulated by the cycles of the moon in moonlight-responsive corals (40). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Also, in migrating monarch butterflies, only the expression of one of two cryptochromes (cry2) is regulated during sun compass orientation (41), and the regulation and biochemistry behind these differences in input response are currently being studied in this system (19, 42, 43). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>In E. scolopes, both cry genes cycle with environmental light in the head, and both cry genes are expressed in the light organ, but only escry1 cycles in response to bioluminescence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Thus, further study in the squid-vibrio system is needed to determine the mechanism of function and downstream effects of these proteins on central and peripheral oscillators. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>The data presented here suggest the possibility that EsCry1 localizes specifically to the apical surfaces of cells interacting directly with symbionts and that presentation of symbiont MAMPs enables cry responses to luminescence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which MAMP presentation primes the light-organ crypt cells to interact with light remains to be determined, but the system apparently ensures that the crypt cells respond solely to light presented in the context of the bacterial symbiont and not to environmental light presented on the day/night cycle. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>The data presented here suggest a number of areas for future research efforts in the squid-vibrio system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>A likely fruitful area will be to determine the extent to which escry1 influences the various daily rhythms that have been described. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>In addition to the early studies of rhythms of bioluminescence (32), recent analyses of the transcriptomes of the symbiont and its supporting host epithelium at several points over the day/night cycle revealed a profound daily rhythm of gene expression in both partners (26). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>The data showed that 9.6% of the total available host transcriptome is regulated over the day-night cycle, similar to the proportion (~8%) of the total transcriptome controlled by the circadian clock in the tissues of other animals (1, 44). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>The transcriptomic rhythms in the squid-vibrio system reflected cyclic changes in the ultrastructure of crypt epithelial cells and in symbiont metabolism (26). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Finally, the cryptochromes are not the only blue-light receptors in the host light organ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>An earlier study of the system demonstrated that the light organ expresses the genes encoding rhodopsin as well as other key members of the visual transduction cascade and that the light organ has the physiological potential to respond to light similarly to the eye (28). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>How light perception by rhodopsin and cryptochrome function and are integrated in the same organ remains to be determined. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>An influence of bacterial symbionts on host rhythms is unlikely to be unique to the squid-vibrio system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>The conservation of both bacterium-epithelium interactions and circadian gene regulation across the metazoa suggests that symbiont-induced circadian rhythms may be widespread. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>For example, although such influences have not been studied directly as yet, evidence is mounting that the microbiome of mammals is critical to host rhythms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>For example, in the epithelium-immune-microbiota axis of the gut, the transcriptomes of both immune and epithelial components of the gut (1, 8, 9) are on a profound circadian rhythm controlled by the clock genes (e.g., cry [10, 45]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>It would be surprising if these critical oscillations of gut function had no impact on the activity of the microbiota, and perhaps, as in the squid-vibrio system, the microbiota are actually essential for normal entrainment of biological rhythms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>An early suggestion of this connection was that the gut-associated circadian clocks are entrained by food (46, 47), and the microbiota are essential for the speed and efficiency of digestion (13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Most recently, certain disease states, such as diabetes (48), obesity (49), depression (50), and sleep disorders (51), have become linked not only to perturbations in the circadian rhythms but, significantly, to imbalances in the microbiota (52). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>An emerging hypothesis is that the host and its microbiota work together to develop and maintain biological rhythms that are essential to the homeostasis of the symbiosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>The complexity of the mammalian systems presents a significant challenge to the study of their rhythms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>The study of simpler systems, such as the squid-vibrio system and the Drosophila gut community, may provide valuable insight into the rules governing symbiont influence on host rhythms. </plain></SENT>
