</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Antibiotic resistance in bacterial strains has become a major clinical concern.[1] Bacteria have several strategies to combat against β-lactam antibiotics[23] including production of β-lactamases enzyme which hydrolyze the β-lactam ring of lactam antibiotics.[4–6] The β-lactamases are classified into four groups (1, 2, 3 and 4) on the basis of function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Moreover, based on molecules (nucleotides and amino acid sequences) β-lactamases are classified into four groups (A, B, C and D) comprising two families: Serine-β-lactamases (SBLs) and metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs).[78] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) belongs to the subclass B1 of MBL, in which two zinc ion (s) are required for the activity, where the tightly bound zinc is referred to as Zn1 and the loosely bound zinc is called as Zn2.[910] In Zn1, a tetrahedral geometry is coordinated by three histidine residues and one solvent molecule in the crystal structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>While, a distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry is the coordination of Zn2 by three amino acids (His, Cys, Asp), a water molecule and a solvent molecule (glycerol) that serves as a ligand to Zn1 too.[11] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The MBL was first identified in a Swedish patient of Indian origin, from New Delhi, who was suffering from urinary tract infection, caused by carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The multi-drug-resistant bacteria K. pneumoniae containing NDM-1 was named as ‘superbug’.[1213] NDM-1 is mainly found in K. pneumoniae, but recently NDM-1 activity is also observed in many other bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter baumannii,[14] which causes antibiotic resistance due to its hydrolyzing tendency for β-lactam antibiotics. β-lactam antibiotics resistance was restricted geographically, and restricted to specific bacterial species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, such species-specific barrier was maintained due to the gene coding for NDM-1 is present as mobile genes on plasmids, therefore, such gene can readily spreaded through bacterial populations.[15] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>There is still a lack of clinically potent inhibitors of NDM-1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Hence, it would be a promising choice to block the NDM-1 with suitable inhibitor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>To reveal the resistance mechanism of bacteria to β-lactam antibiotics, we selected a series of 35 different natural antibacterial compounds from various literary sources, and successively docked with the active site of NDM-1 [Table 1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Some of the selected natural compounds show a good binding affinity at the active site of NDM-1, particularly Nimbolide and Isomargololone, produce lower binding energy than the β-lactam antibiotics with NDM-1 and also have appreciable IC50 value. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>These findings may provide useful insights for designing new potent drugs to fight against the antibiotic resistance of NDM-1. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>In order to identify the novel classes of NDM-1 inhibitors by means of structure-based drug design, prediction of protein-ligand interaction is essential for virtual screening approaches.[26] This process requires docking tools to produce suitable conformations of a ligand within a protein-active site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a reliable energy evaluation can easily indicate the quality of a receptor-ligand putative complex and provide insights for biomedical science and drug development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Since the active site of NDM-1 may bind to different classes of the carbapenem family of antibiotics, it can be useful to consider the differences in binding affinity of the selected inhibitors and their natural substrate, that is carbapenem antibiotics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we performed the docking analysis of 14 β-lactam antibiotics with NDM-1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>We observed that the Piperacillin (antibiotic 3) had lowest binding energy (-6.98 Kcal/mol) and IC50 (6.45 μM) value as well. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Here our aim is to identify a potent inhibitor to block the lactamase activity of NDM-1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>We selected 35 natural compounds from various plant sources and subsequently docked in the active site of NDM-1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Binding affinity calculation suggests that sorted ligands strongly interact to the NDM-1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>A representative set of 14 antibiotics of the β-lactam family was selected from different sub-families like Penicillins (penams), Penems, Carbapenem, Cephalosporins, Monobactams, β-lactamase inhibitors and combinations as shown in Table 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>The docking analysis of β-lactam antibiotic with NDM-1 revealed that Piperacillin (Antibiotic 3) antibiotic have lowest binding energy of -6.9 Kcal/mol and IC50 value (6.45 μM). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the docking analysis of the antibacterial natural compounds showed that Nimbolide (1.34 μM), Margolone (5.25 μM), Margolonone (5.34 μM), Isomargolonone (1.25 μM), Acetyl Aleuritolic acid (0.2772 μM) and Harmane (4.32 μM), had IC50 value lower then β-lactam antibiotics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, Isomargololone (-7.49 kcal/mol) and Nimbolide (-8.01 kcal/mol) showed lesser binding energy than the β-lactam antibiotics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Moreover, their IC50 values are quite good to consider as drug molecule [Table 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, both these compounds are devoid of β-lactam ring therefore, they can easily resist the hydrolase activity of NDM-1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>All these results clearly indicate that Isomargololone and Nimbolide, and their derivative compounds may block NDM-1, however, further work is needed to optimize these compounds for specificity, efficacy and experimental validation. </plain></SENT>
