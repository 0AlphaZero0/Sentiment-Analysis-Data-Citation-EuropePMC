Due to their economical importance and the difficulties involved in the experimental study of these obligate pathogens, genome sequencing and comparative analysis have been utilized as powerful tools to understand phytoplasma biology. To date four complete phytoplasma genome sequences have been published. However, these four strains represent limited phylogenetic diversity. In this study, we report the shotgun sequencing and evolutionary analysis of a peanut witches'-broom (PnWB) phytoplasma genome. The availability of this genome provides the first representative of the 16SrII group and substantially improves the taxon sampling to investigate genome evolution. The draft genome assembly contains 13 chromosomal contigs with a total size of 562,473 bp, covering &#8764;90% of the chromosome. Additionally, a complete plasmid sequence is included. Comparisons among the five available phytoplasma genomes reveal the differentiations in gene content and metabolic capacity. Notably, phylogenetic inferences of the potential mobile units (PMUs) in these genomes indicate that horizontal transfer may have occurred between divergent phytoplasma lineages. Because many effectors are associated with PMUs, the horizontal transfer of these transposon-like elements can contribute to the adaptation and diversification of these pathogens. In summary, the findings from this study highlight the importance of improving taxon sampling when investigating genome evolution. Moreover, the currently available sequences are inadequate to fully characterize the pan-genome of phytoplasmas. Future genome sequencing efforts to expand phylogenetic diversity are essential in improving our understanding of phytoplasma evolution.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding for this work was provided by research grants from the National Science Council of Taiwan (NSC 99-2313-B-001-006-MY2) and Academia Sinica to CHK.

The first and the most basal clade (highlighted by a blue background in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062770-g001">Figure 1</xref>) contains groups such as aster yellows (16SrI), stolbur (16SrXII), sugarcane yellow leaf syndrome (16SrXVI), papaya bunchy top (16SrXVII), and American potato purple top wilt (16SrXVIII).

Among the proteins that lack specific COG assignments, 81 (19% of total) were annotated as hypothetical proteins. This proportion of proteins lacking specific description is typical among currently available bacterial genomes. However, a sizable portion of proteins that lack COG assignments do have specific functional annotation. For example, the PnWB phytoplasma genome encodes for 48 putative effectors (assigned to 42 homologous gene clusters; accounting for 11% of total). These putative effectors are similar to known pathogenicity factors of phytoplasmas (see below) but are not included in the COG database.

Inspection of gene content reveals that the PnWB phytoplasma has limited metabolic capacity (see below).

For example, although several known genes in the glycolysis pathway (<italic>pgi</italic>, <italic>pfkA</italic>, <italic>fba</italic>, and <italic>tpiA</italic>) and transporters (<italic>metN</italic>, <italic>metQ</italic>, and <italic>metI</italic>) were absent in the current PnWB phytoplasma genome annotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062770-g004">Figure 4</xref>), they may be located in the unassembled regions of this genome. It is therefore difficult to conclude whether the glycolysis pathway is complete in the PnWB phytoplasma. A total of 29 putative pseudogenes with disrupted open reading were identified in our first version of annotation (e.g., <italic>gpmI</italic>, <italic>mesJ</italic>, <italic>metK</italic>, <italic>polA</italic>, <italic>trmE</italic>, etc). It is unclear if functional copies of these genes exist in the unassembled regions or not.</p><p>Notably, genome-specific genes account for &#8764;22&#8211;30% of gene content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062770-g003">Figures 3A and 3B</xref>). These estimates are quite high considering that two closely related strains of &#8216;<italic>Ca</italic>. P. asteris&#8217; are included in the comparison. This finding suggests that acquisition of novel genes is important in the diversification of phytoplasmas and may contribute to their adaptation to different ecological niches. For example, the PnWB phytoplasma genome contains several genes related to citrate fermentation (i.e., <italic>citE</italic>, <italic>citF</italic>, <italic>citC</italic>, and <italic>citG</italic>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062770-g004">Figure 4</xref>) that are not found in the other four phytoplasmas compared. Considering that citrate and malate are the predominant organic acids in phloem sap, the ability to utilize citrate may provide more versatile metabolism for this obligate pathogen. However, because most of the genes involved in the TCA cycle are not found in the PnWB phytoplasma genome (as well as the other four), it is unlikely that this pathogen can rely on the TCA cycle for energy production. Rather, the uptake and utilization of citrate and malate may provide the major sources for carbohydrate metabolism.</p><p>In addition to the metabolic genes, a large fraction of putative effectors are genome-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062770-g003">Figures 3C and 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0062770.s003">Table S3</xref>).

More importantly, several experimentally characterized effectors are associated with such PMUs <xref rid="pone.0062770-Sugio1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, suggesting that these mobile units may contribute to the evolution of phytopathogenicity. Our draft assembly of the PnWB phytoplasma genome contains one PMU (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0062770.s004">Table S4</xref>). Although it is possible that additional copies exist in the unassembled regions, the raw read coverage patterns for this PMU from both sequenced libraries are similar to those for single-copy genes (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <italic>dnaN</italic>), suggesting that this PMU is likely to be single-copy as well.</p><p>The molecular phylogenies of the three longest PMU-associated genes support the hypothesis for horizontal transfer of these putative transposons.

Examination of gene order provides further support to the molecular phylogeny results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0062770.s004">Table S4</xref>).

The point that horizontal gene transfer may be important in the phytoplasma genome evolution has been proposed previously <xref rid="pone.0062770-Saccardo1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Through molecular phylogenetic inference of PMU-related genes and comparative analysis of gene orders in PMUs, this study further establishes that gene transfers among phytoplasmas may be facilitated by these transposon-like elements. Given the tight association between effectors and PMUs <xref rid="pone.0062770-Sugio1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062770-Bai2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, the horizontal transfer of PMUs can provide these pathogens with novel weaponry against their hosts and contribute to their adaptation.</p><p>In summary, the PnWB phytoplasma genome sequence from this study provides the first representative of a major group (i.e., 16SrII) that was previously uncharacterized at genome-scale. Despite the fact that this genome was not sequenced to completion, the current assembly covers &#8764;90% of the genome. This high quality draft can serve as a reference for gene cloning to facilitate functional studies of this uncultivated bacterium. The comparative analysis of gene content among available phytoplasma genomes indicates that the 22&#8211;30% of the genes appear to be genome-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062770-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). This finding suggests that the pan-genome of these phytopathogenic bacteria is quite large and future improvements in taxon sampling (particularly for the 16S groups such as 16SrIV-16SrIX and 16SrXIV-16SrXVIII; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062770-g001">Figure 1</xref>) are required to further investigate their genome diversity. Additionally, PMU-mediated horizontal gene transfers among divergent phytoplasmas are likely to be an important factor in the evolution of pathogenicity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Strain source and DNA preparation</title><p>The PnWB phytoplasma was initially collected from naturally infected peanut plants on the Penghu Islands of Taiwan in 1975 (I.-L.
