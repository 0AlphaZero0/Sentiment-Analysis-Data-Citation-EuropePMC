<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Both groups are unique among bacteria in their lack of cell wall and are assigned to the class Mollicutes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>However, unlike mycoplasmas that can be cultured and are amenable to genetic manipulations, the in vitro cultivation of phytoplasmas has remained unsuccessful despite decades of effort [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The inability to culture phytoplasmas outside of their hosts has resulted in the designation of the ‘Candidatus (Ca.)’ status in their taxonomic assignment [2] and also greatly hampered the research progresses in characterizing these plant pathogens. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>With the recent advancements in genomic sciences, genome sequencing has been adopted as a powerful tool to characterize the gene content of these uncultivated bacteria [5]–[9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>More importantly, comparative analyses of the available phytoplasma genome sequences have improved our knowledge of their evolutionary history and facilitated experimental works to investigate the mechanisms of pathogenicity [10]–[13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In this study, we performed whole genome shotgun sequencing of a peanut witches'-broom (PnWB) phytoplasma. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>According to the molecular phylogeny inferred from the 16S ribosomal RNA genes, the genus ‘Ca. Phytoplasma’ contains three major clades (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The first and the most basal clade (highlighted by a blue background in Figure 1) contains groups such as aster yellows (16SrI), stolbur (16SrXII), sugarcane yellow leaf syndrome (16SrXVI), papaya bunchy top (16SrXVII), and American potato purple top wilt (16SrXVIII). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The second clade (highlighted by a green background in Figure 1) is mainly composed of the apple proliferation group (16SrX). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The third clade (highlighted by a yellow background in Figure 1) is the most diverse one and contains the highest number of 16S rRNA groups [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Prior to this study, three of the four published phytoplasma genomes belong to the first clade, including two strains of ‘Ca. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>P. asteris’ [5], [6] in the aster yellows group (16SrI) and one strain of ‘Ca. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>P. australiense’ [7] in the stolbur group (16SrXII). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The remaining one is a ‘Ca. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>P. mali’ [8] in the apple proliferation group (16SrX) from the second clade. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Although four draft genomes from the 16SrIII group have been published recently [9], these assemblies are highly fragmented (each containing 158–272 contigs with a median length of ∼0.7–1.7 kb) and do not have annotation yet (as of November, 2012; GenBank accession numbers AKIK00000000.1, AKIL00000000.1, AKIM00000000.1, and AKIN00000000.1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Thus, the PnWB phytoplasma reported in this study is the first representative of the 16SrII group and provides a high quality draft for the third clade. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Despite the utilization of two Illumina libraries and extensive efforts devoted to gap closing, we were not able to sequence the genome to completion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Because no method exists for in vitro cultivation of this obligate pathogen, host DNA contaminations, particularly those from the chloroplast genome, introduced a high level of noise in the assembly process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a large number of repetitive elements (size range  = 30–300 bp) exist in the PnWB phytoplasma genome, which complicated the use of short Illumina reads for de novo assembly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Finally, the PnWB phytoplasma genome has a very low GC content (genome average  = 24.3%; see Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>This strong nucleotide composition bias is associated with the abundance of long homopolymers and low complexity sequences, which resulted in several unresolvable problems in gap filling using PCR and Sanger sequencing. </plain></SENT>
