The results of a complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) assay revealed that the strongest antibody was ofatumumab, followed by BM-ca, with rituximab being the weakest. Ofatumumab and BM-ca were effective not only against rituximab-sensitive SU-DHL-4 cells but also against rituximab-resistant RC-K8 cells. In an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) assay, although the effective concentrations against SU-DHL-4 cells were almost the same among these three antibodies, the maximum cytotoxic level was the highest for BM-ca. In an anti-cell proliferation assay using SU-DHL-4 cells, BM-ca was the most effective and ofatumumab, the weakest. Against RC-K8 cells, only BM-ca was effective. When combined with each of four cancer chemotherapeutics (prednisolone, vincristine, hydroxydaunorubicin, and cisplatin), BM-ca exerted the most effective combinatorial anti-cell proliferation activity. To assess the in vivo effect of BM-ca, we intravenously administered BM-ca into cynomolgus monkeys and found that the peripheral B-cell levels did not decrease in half of the animals. Sequencing of cDNA encoding CD20 of cynomolgus monkeys revealed that the responders and nonresponders had Leu/Pro (hetero) and Leu/Leu (homo) at amino acid (a.a.) position 160, respectively, suggesting that the epitope recognized by BM-ca was around this a.a. By analyzing reactivity to synthetic peptides, the epitope recognized by BM-ca was estimated to be a.a.'s 156&#8211;166, not shared with rituximab and ofatumumab. These results suggest BM-ca to be a promising anti-CD20 antibody having superior properties and recognizing a unique epitope.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Anti-CD20 antibody</kwd><kwd>cancer chemotherapeutics</kwd><kwd>epitope</kwd><kwd>lymphoma</kwd><kwd>ofatumumab</kwd><kwd>rituximab</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>CD20 is a promising target molecule of antibody drugs for treating a variety of B-cell-related diseases, including B-cell lymphoma, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, etc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Rituximab, which is the top runner of anti-CD20 antibody drugs, was launched in 1997 in the United States and is now used worldwide for a variety of indications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. After the remarkable success of rituximab, many other attempts to develop other anti-CD20 antibodies were made <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Over 15 years have passed since the debut of rituximab, but up to now only a single anti-CD20 antibody, ofatumumab, has been approved, and it for only a single indication, chronic lymphocytic leukemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Many anti-CD20 antibodies under development have characteristics different from those of rituximab, for example, potentiated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, stronger complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, no chimeric structure but rather a humanized or fully human structure, recognition of different epitopes, etc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. However, such superiorities in vitro do not always reflect clinical efficacy. In other words, even now we do not sufficiently understand the key properties that allow these newer anti-CD20 antibodies to be more effective in vivo than the current champion, that is, rituximab.</p><p>BM-ca is a novel humanized anti-CD20 antibody having properties of both type-I and -II antibodies; that is, it has not only CDC but also direct cell death activities in addition to common ADCC activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. BM-ca is now in a clinical phase-I study in Japan. In previous studies, some comparisons had been made with other anti-CD20 antibodies, but most of these studies were qualitative rather than quantitative <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. In this study, we quantitatively compared the activity of BM-ca with that of the two approved anti-CD20 antibodies, rituximab and ofatumumab, in vitro, that is, their CDC, ADCC, and direct anti-cell proliferation activities. Furthermore, we compared their anti-cell proliferation activities in combination with cancer chemotherapeutic drugs. To know the molecular basis of the differences among these anti-CD20 antibodies, the epitope on CD20 recognized by BM-ca was extensively characterized. In the course of this study, we became aware of the molecular heterogeneity of CD20 in the cynomolgus monkey (<italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>), which heterogeneity significantly affected the binding of BM-ca, but not that of rituximab, to this monkey's B cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cells and cell culture</title><p>Two human B-cell lymphoma cell lines, RC-K8 and SU-DHL-4, were obtained from DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany).

These cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Roswell Park Memorial Institute-1640) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; for RC-K8 and SU-DHL-4) or in CHO-S-SFM II medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 0.4 mg/mL G418 (for CHO-CD20) at 37&#176;C in a humidified chamber under a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere.</p></sec><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>BM-ca was produced by a recombinant CHO cell line and purified by a combination of several column chromatographies. Rituximab, ofatumumab, and infliximab, which are the ones used in clinical practice, were obtained from Hoffman-La Roche, GlaxoSmithKline, and Johnson &amp; Johnson, respectively. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-non-human primate CD20 (clone 2H7) was purchased from BD Biosciences (Franklin Lakes, NJ). FITC-labeled BM-ca and rituximab were synthesized by using a Fluorescein Labeling Kit-NH<sub>2</sub> manufactured by DOJINDO (Kumamoto, Japan).</p></sec><sec><title>Complement-dependent cytotoxicity</title><p>CDC activity was assayed by an AlamrBlue-based method that monitors the amount of viable cells. For this assay, 50,000 (SU-DHL-4) or 10,000 (RC-K8) cells in 50 &#956;L of culture medium were seeded into each well of a 96-well black plate, into which 100 &#956;L of premixed normal human serum complement (Quidel, San Diego, CA) and various concentrations of each antibody in culture medium were added. The final concentration of normal human serum complement was 1/16 of the original one.

As the effector cells for the ADCC assay, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were prepared from three healthy volunteers after having obtained informed consent. In this assay, 20,000 (SU-DHL-4) or 40,000 (RC-K8) cells were seeded into each well of a 96-well U-bottom plate after the cells had been prelabeled with Calcein-AM by incubating them with 10 &#956;mol/L Calcein-AM for 30 min. Then various concentrations of antibodies and effector cells (E:T ratio = 30:1) were added and mixed to elicit ADCC. After incubation of the cells for 3 h at 37&#176;C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> humidified incubator, the fluorescence of the culture supernatant was measured at 528 nm (with excitation at 480 nm).</p></sec><sec><title>Anti-cell proliferation activity</title><p>The direct effect of each antibody on cell proliferation of B-lymphoma cells was studied by using AlamarBlue.

Next, various concentrations of antibodies (50 &#956;L) were added to each well, and the cultures were incubated for 3 days.

Six (three males and three females), six (three males and three females), and 10 (five males and five females) cynomolgus monkeys purchased from Japan Laboratory Animals, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan) were administered i.v. with BM-ca at a dose of 10, 20, and 50 mg/kg, respectively, once a week &#215; four times (days 1, 8, 15, and 22). Before the first administration, and at day-8 (before administration), -9, -15 (before administration), -16, and -23 for all animals, and additionally at day-10 and -29 for four animals of the 50 mg/kg group, blood was withdrawn, and the percentage of CD20-positive cells in the lymphocyte population was determined by flow cytometry with aFACSCalibur-4S (BD Biosciences) after the cells had been stained with FITC-labeled anti-non-human primate CD20 (for method see below).</p></sec><sec><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Reactivity of anti-CD20 antibody against monkey's peripheral lymphocytes was determined by flow cytometry after the cells had been stained with FITC-labeled anti-CD20 antibodies. For analyzing B-cell levels after BM-ca administration, FITC-labeled anti-non-human primate CD20 was used. For comparing reactivity of BM-ca and rituximab against monkey's B cells, FITC-labeled BM-ca and rituximab were used. For this comparison study, not only cynomolgus monkeys (<italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>) but also rhesus monkeys (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) were used. Whole blood withdrawn from healthy monkeys was firstly stained with FITC-labeled anti-CD20 antibodies, and red blood cells were lysed with BD FACS lysing solution. After the residual cells had been washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 4% FBS, the samples were subjected to flow cytometry. In most of the studies, we employed the FACSCalibur-4S described above; but in some studies a Guava (Millipore, Billerica, MA) was used as the flow cytometer.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA sequence analysis of cynomolgus monkey's CD20 molecule</title><p>Primers were designed based on the predicted cDNA sequence of rhesus monkey CD20 (RefSeq: XM_001086364.1), since no corresponding sequence for cynomolgus monkeys had been available when this study was performed. Forward and reverse primers for cDNA cloning were TP81 (ATG ACA ACA CCC AGA AAT TCA GTA AA) and TP82 (TTA AGG AGA GCT GTC ATT TTC TAT TG), respectively, and the forward and reverse primers for sequencing were TP83 (ATG ACA ACA CCC AGA AAT TCA) and TP84 (TTA AGG AGA GCT GTC ATT TTC), respectively. In this study, since the primary purpose of sequencing CD20 was to assess the heterogeneity in both small and large extracellular loops, primers for DNA sequencing were not necessarily set outside of the open reading frame (ORF). After total RNA had been purified from whole blood by using Ribo-Pure Blood (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), cDNAs encoding CD20 were amplified by RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) with primers TP81 and TP82. Their DNA sequences were determined at Macrogen Japan (Tokyo, Japan) with primers TP83 and TP84.</p></sec><sec><title>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</title><p>For examination of the ability of the anti-CD20 antibodies to bind to the potential epitope of BM-ca, 10 different 27-mer peptides corresponding to amino acid (a.a.) 140&#8211;166 with single a.a. replacement from human sequence were synthesized at Sigma-Aldrich (Hokkaido, Japan). At their N-termini, a biotin residue was added to anchor the peptides to the surface of NeutrAvidin-coated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates (Reacti-Bind NeutrAvidine Bindings High Binding Capacity Coated 96-well Plate, Thermo, Waltham, MA).

The B-cell ratio was determined by flow cytometry after gating the lymphocyte population based on the front and side scatterings (Fig. S5). The resulting histograms are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>, and the calculated percentages of B cells are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> (see column for FACS Calibur).

On the contrary, although peripheral lymphocytes obtained from 6 cynomolgus monkeys (No. 7&#8211;12) bound to rituximab, those from three of them (No. 8, 10, and 12) did not bind BM-ca. Five of them (No. 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12) and one other cynomolgus monkey (No. 13) were analyzed with the other instrument (Guava, Millipore), and the resultant data confirmed the existence of two populations of cynomolgus monkeys having different binding properties with respect to BM-ca (see column for Guava). The apparent difference in the percentage values between FACS Calibur and Guava is thought to be caused by the difference in the instruments, and the difference in the percentage values in positive individuals between BM-ca and rituximab is thought to be derived from the difference in the quality of FITC-labeled antibodies.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Flow cytometric analysis of B cells in monkey's blood</p></caption><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>N.T., not tested.</p></fn><fn id="tf1-1"><label>1</label><p>B cell% was determined by the analysis using FACS calibur as a flow cytometer.</p></fn><fn id="tf1-2"><label>2</label><p>B cell% was determined by the analysis using guava as a flow cytometer.</p></fn><fn id="tf1-3"><label>3</label><p>Reactivity is categorized as positive (+), when B-cell% value is above 1% (FACS Calibur) and/or 10% (Guava).</p></fn><fn id="tf1-4"><label>4</label><p>Amino acid at position 160 of CD20 molecule determined by sequencing cDNAs encoding CD20 (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig id="fig06" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Flow cytometry analysis of reactivity to BM-ca of peripheral blood lymphocytes in rhesus (No. 1&#8211;6) and cynomolgus (No. 7&#8211;12) monkeys.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Figure 8</xref>A, only BM-ca bound to these peptides dose dependently. Since all of these three anti-CD20 antibodies strongly bound to natural human CD20 antigen under the same assay conditions (Fig. S7), this result clearly indicates that this region was the epitope seen by BM-ca and was not shared with rituximab or ofatumumab. To know more details about the sites in CD20 important for binding to BM-ca, some amino acids (positions 154, 156, 158, 159, 162, 163, and 166), which are different from the corresponding amino acids of mouse CD20, were replaced by the mouse-type ones, since BM-ca does not bind to mouse CD20 (unpubl. results of ourselves). The results are described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Figure 8</xref>B. Among them, replacement at position 156, 163, or 166 resulted in decreased binding, whereas the replacement at 162 increased it. The change at position 154, 158, or 159 did not change the binding. We also examined the replacement at position 160 from Pro to Leu. Surprisingly, BM-ca bound to the peptide having Leu at position 160 instead of Pro stronger than to the original human sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8</xref>B), in spite of the observation of a dramatic decrease in the binding of BM-ca to B cells in cynomolgus monkeys having Leu/Leu homo CD20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). These results suggest that positions 156, 157, 162, 163, and 166 are especially important in the large extracellular loop of CD20 for binding to BM-ca.</p><fig id="fig08" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Epitope analysis of BM-ca by use of synthetic peptides.

This is the first quantitative study showing the superiority of BM-ca in these two assays. On the contrary, in this study, the order of efficacy of these anti-CD20 antibodies in the CDC assay was ofatumumab &gt; BM-ca &gt; rituximab; although in the previous study, we had reported that BM-ca was stronger than ofatumumab when tested by this assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. This discrepancy might be attributable to the different quality of ofatumumab used in the previous and present studies, because in the previous study, we produced ofatumumab by ourselves by using a recombinant DNA technology based on the reported sequence of ofatumumab <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. In this study, however, we used ofatumumab that is utilized in the clinical situation, so it may be that the activity of ofatumumab in this study was stronger than that in the previous one.</p><p>In all of the cellular assays performed in this study, we used both SU-DHL-4 and RC-K8 as the target cells for comparison, and found that BM-ca was effective in RC-K8 cells as well as in SU-DHL-4 cells. Although it has been reported that RC-K8 cells are resistant to rituximab <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, the underlying mechanism by which the cells become resistant to rituximab has not yet been fully elucidated. Concerning the resistance of RC-K8 cells to rituximab in the CDC assay, one possibility is their higher expression of CD55 and/or CD59 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, which are cell surface inhibitors of complement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Also in our study, a relatively larger amount of complement was required for full CDC activity in RC-K8 cells. However, the observed resistance of RC-K8 cells in the direct cell proliferation inhibition assay might not be explained by the overexpression of CD55 and CD59. The fact that BM-ca could overcome the resistance to rituximab in RC-K8 cells in both CDC and anti-cell proliferation assays would suggest greater efficacy of BM-ca also in the clinical situation. On the contrary, because the resistance of RC-K8 cells to rituximab was not observed in the ADCC assay, the resistance mechanism might not be related to an ADCC-specific pathway. Since we used only two typical B-cell lymphoma cell lines in this study, same kind of quantitative comparison using other B-cell lymphoma and leukemia cell lines might be helpful to know the mechanisms underlying the differences in the activities among different anti-CD20 antibodies.</p><p>The anti-cell proliferation activity of anti-CD20 antibodies including BM-ca was mild in this study (maximum inhibition was 37&#8211;57% depending on the runs of experiments; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>; Tables S1 and S2, and Figs. S1&#8211;S4), which is in consistent with the results of previous studies (maximum inhibition was about 30&#8211;70%) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Although some apoptotic activity of BM-ca has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, addition of BM-ca to the cell culture medium did not kill the cells for several days even if affecting the cell proliferation rate (data not shown), suggesting that induction of direct cell death (or apoptosis) might occur only in the conditions suffering from additional stresses, for example, low serum concentration, hypoxia, and coexistence of anti-cancer drugs.</p><p>Through three different quantitative cellular assays, we noticed differences among them in terms of the effective concentration of BM-ca. Namely, CDC required the highest concentration of BM-ca, whereas ADCC and anti-cell proliferation activity required only about a 1/10 to 1/100 lower concentration. These results suggest that larger fraction of CD20 molecules must be occupied by BM-ca for CDC activity than for the two other activities. In the clinical setting, this might mean that CDC activity would not endure after the blood concentration of BM-ca decreased, whereas ADCC and anti-cell proliferation activity would continue. Since BM-ca was effective at a lower concentration than rituximab or ofatumumab in terms of anti-cell proliferation activity, this effect of BM-ca would possibly continue longer after the blood concentration of anti-CD20 antibodies decreased. Furthermore, BM-ca was the most effective when combined with cancer chemotherapeutic drugs in the anti-cell proliferation assay, thus indicating this antibody to be promising for combination therapy as well. One dependable way to speculate the clinical superiority of BM-ca might be a study with mouse xenograft model inoculated with human lymphoma cell lines, for example, SU-DHL-4 and RC-K8. However, the results will not be straightforward because the effector cells and complement factors are not of human origin in mice. In fact superiority observed in xenograft model of anti-CD20 antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> has not led to the superiority in human. So we think that future clinical studies are necessary to know whether BM-ca is superior in human as well.</p><p>Although the molecular basis for the differences in biological activities between BM-ca and the other anti-CD20 antibodies still remains unclear, one key factor would be the epitope on CD20. Pro160 was strongly suggested to play a critical role for BM-ca to bind to cell surface CD20 based on the result of DNA sequencing of cDNA encoding CD20 of cynomolgus monkeys, since the probability of accidental coincidence between no-binding of BM-ca and absence of Pro160 in six animals is thought to be very low (0.5<sup>6</sup> = about 1.6%). We expect that this hypothesis will be confirmed by additional analysis of other cynomolgus monkeys. In addition to this, the peptide experiment suggested that the region of a.a. 156&#8211;166 (including Pro160) is the potential epitope of BM-ca not seen by rituximab or ofatumumab. However, the replacement of Pro160 with Leu in peptide did not reproduce the result of cellular experiment. We think that this apparent inconsistency between cellular and peptide experiments can be explained as follows. Namely, it can be thought that although peptides having Leu160 can freely vend to fit to the groove on BM-ca which recognizes CD20, Pro160 might be necessary to keep the vended structure in restricted circumstances of protein molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">Fig. 9</xref>). More concrete conclusion about the epitope of BM-ca will be obtained by further dedicated experiments with systematic site-directed mutagenesis of cell surface CD20 molecules including Pro160, although such a full-scale recombinant study might be beyond the scope of this manuscript. These differences in the epitope might bring about differential activation of signaling pathways that trigger different biological activities.</p><fig id="fig09" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p>Schematic drawings of the interaction between BM-ca and its epitope. A hypothesis explaining the role of Pro160 is illustrated. In peptide, the amino acid chain can vend freely to fit the groove on BM-ca, even if Leu160 instead of Pro160. On the contrary, in cell surface CD20, Pro160 might be necessary to keep the vended structure in restricted circumstances of protein molecule.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cam40002-0130-f9"/></fig><p>The differential biological activity found in cynomolgus monkeys was a clue indicating the epitope of BM-ca to be around a.a. 160. The heterogeneity in amino acid at position 160 (Pro or Leu) in cynomolgus monkeys was found for the first time in this study. One sequence of cynomolgus CD20 is now present in the GenBank DNA database (EHH56190.1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, and it is the more abundant Leu160 type. Since Leu is not found in other monkeys, primates or humans at position 160 of CD20 (NCBI blastp search against EHH56190.1 on 3 August 2012), we cannot consider this change from an evolutional point of view for now. By extensively analyzing the sequence of CD20 molecules of various monkeys and primates, we should be able to obtain insight into the evolutional implication of this mutation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Drs.
