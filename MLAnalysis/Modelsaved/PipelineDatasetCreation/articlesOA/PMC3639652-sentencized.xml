<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Rituximab, which is the top runner of anti-CD20 antibody drugs, was launched in 1997 in the United States and is now used worldwide for a variety of indications 1,2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>After the remarkable success of rituximab, many other attempts to develop other anti-CD20 antibodies were made 3,4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Over 15 years have passed since the debut of rituximab, but up to now only a single anti-CD20 antibody, ofatumumab, has been approved, and it for only a single indication, chronic lymphocytic leukemia 5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Many anti-CD20 antibodies under development have characteristics different from those of rituximab, for example, potentiated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) 6, stronger complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) 7, no chimeric structure but rather a humanized or fully human structure, recognition of different epitopes, etc 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>However, such superiorities in vitro do not always reflect clinical efficacy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In other words, even now we do not sufficiently understand the key properties that allow these newer anti-CD20 antibodies to be more effective in vivo than the current champion, that is, rituximab. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In previous studies, some comparisons had been made with other anti-CD20 antibodies, but most of these studies were qualitative rather than quantitative 8,9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In this study, we quantitatively compared the activity of BM-ca with that of the two approved anti-CD20 antibodies, rituximab and ofatumumab, in vitro, that is, their CDC, ADCC, and direct anti-cell proliferation activities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we compared their anti-cell proliferation activities in combination with cancer chemotherapeutic drugs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>To know the molecular basis of the differences among these anti-CD20 antibodies, the epitope on CD20 recognized by BM-ca was extensively characterized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In the course of this study, we became aware of the molecular heterogeneity of CD20 in the cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis), which heterogeneity significantly affected the binding of BM-ca, but not that of rituximab, to this monkey's B cells. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, in this study, the order of efficacy of these anti-CD20 antibodies in the CDC assay was ofatumumab &gt; BM-ca &gt; rituximab; although in the previous study, we had reported that BM-ca was stronger than ofatumumab when tested by this assay 9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>This discrepancy might be attributable to the different quality of ofatumumab used in the previous and present studies, because in the previous study, we produced ofatumumab by ourselves by using a recombinant DNA technology based on the reported sequence of ofatumumab 9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>In this study, however, we used ofatumumab that is utilized in the clinical situation, so it may be that the activity of ofatumumab in this study was stronger than that in the previous one. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Although it has been reported that RC-K8 cells are resistant to rituximab 11, the underlying mechanism by which the cells become resistant to rituximab has not yet been fully elucidated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Concerning the resistance of RC-K8 cells to rituximab in the CDC assay, one possibility is their higher expression of CD55 and/or CD59 19, which are cell surface inhibitors of complement 20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Also in our study, a relatively larger amount of complement was required for full CDC activity in RC-K8 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>However, the observed resistance of RC-K8 cells in the direct cell proliferation inhibition assay might not be explained by the overexpression of CD55 and CD59. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>The fact that BM-ca could overcome the resistance to rituximab in RC-K8 cells in both CDC and anti-cell proliferation assays would suggest greater efficacy of BM-ca also in the clinical situation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, because the resistance of RC-K8 cells to rituximab was not observed in the ADCC assay, the resistance mechanism might not be related to an ADCC-specific pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Since we used only two typical B-cell lymphoma cell lines in this study, same kind of quantitative comparison using other B-cell lymphoma and leukemia cell lines might be helpful to know the mechanisms underlying the differences in the activities among different anti-CD20 antibodies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>The anti-cell proliferation activity of anti-CD20 antibodies including BM-ca was mild in this study (maximum inhibition was 37–57% depending on the runs of experiments; see Fig. 3; Tables S1 and S2, and Figs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>S1–S4), which is in consistent with the results of previous studies (maximum inhibition was about 30–70%) 12–15. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Although some apoptotic activity of BM-ca has been reported 8, addition of BM-ca to the cell culture medium did not kill the cells for several days even if affecting the cell proliferation rate (data not shown), suggesting that induction of direct cell death (or apoptosis) might occur only in the conditions suffering from additional stresses, for example, low serum concentration, hypoxia, and coexistence of anti-cancer drugs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Through three different quantitative cellular assays, we noticed differences among them in terms of the effective concentration of BM-ca. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Namely, CDC required the highest concentration of BM-ca, whereas ADCC and anti-cell proliferation activity required only about a 1/10 to 1/100 lower concentration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that larger fraction of CD20 molecules must be occupied by BM-ca for CDC activity than for the two other activities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>In the clinical setting, this might mean that CDC activity would not endure after the blood concentration of BM-ca decreased, whereas ADCC and anti-cell proliferation activity would continue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Since BM-ca was effective at a lower concentration than rituximab or ofatumumab in terms of anti-cell proliferation activity, this effect of BM-ca would possibly continue longer after the blood concentration of anti-CD20 antibodies decreased. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, BM-ca was the most effective when combined with cancer chemotherapeutic drugs in the anti-cell proliferation assay, thus indicating this antibody to be promising for combination therapy as well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>One dependable way to speculate the clinical superiority of BM-ca might be a study with mouse xenograft model inoculated with human lymphoma cell lines, for example, SU-DHL-4 and RC-K8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>However, the results will not be straightforward because the effector cells and complement factors are not of human origin in mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>In fact superiority observed in xenograft model of anti-CD20 antibodies 6,21 has not led to the superiority in human. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>So we think that future clinical studies are necessary to know whether BM-ca is superior in human as well. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Although the molecular basis for the differences in biological activities between BM-ca and the other anti-CD20 antibodies still remains unclear, one key factor would be the epitope on CD20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Pro160 was strongly suggested to play a critical role for BM-ca to bind to cell surface CD20 based on the result of DNA sequencing of cDNA encoding CD20 of cynomolgus monkeys, since the probability of accidental coincidence between no-binding of BM-ca and absence of Pro160 in six animals is thought to be very low (0.56 = about 1.6%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>We expect that this hypothesis will be confirmed by additional analysis of other cynomolgus monkeys. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>However, the replacement of Pro160 with Leu in peptide did not reproduce the result of cellular experiment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>We think that this apparent inconsistency between cellular and peptide experiments can be explained as follows. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Namely, it can be thought that although peptides having Leu160 can freely vend to fit to the groove on BM-ca which recognizes CD20, Pro160 might be necessary to keep the vended structure in restricted circumstances of protein molecule (Fig. 9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>More concrete conclusion about the epitope of BM-ca will be obtained by further dedicated experiments with systematic site-directed mutagenesis of cell surface CD20 molecules including Pro160, although such a full-scale recombinant study might be beyond the scope of this manuscript. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Since Leu is not found in other monkeys, primates or humans at position 160 of CD20 (NCBI blastp search against EHH56190.1 on 3 August 2012), we cannot consider this change from an evolutional point of view for now. </plain></SENT>
