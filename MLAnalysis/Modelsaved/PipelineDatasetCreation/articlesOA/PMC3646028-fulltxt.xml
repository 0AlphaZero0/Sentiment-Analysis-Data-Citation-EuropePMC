We studied the community of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in a tropical mountain rain forest and in neighbouring reforestation plots in the area of Reserva Biol&#243;gica San Francisco (South Ecuador). The arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were analysed with molecular methods sequencing part of the 18 S rDNA. The sequences were classified as Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). We found high fungal species richness with OTUs belonging to Glomerales, Diversisporales and Archaeosporales. Despite intensive sampling, the rarefaction curves are still unsaturated for the pristine forest and the reforestation plots. The communities consisted of few frequent and many rare species. No specific interactions are recognizable. The plant individuals are associated with one to ten arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and mostly with one to four. The fungal compositions associated with single plant individuals show a great variability and variety within one plant species. Planted and naturally occurring plants show high similarities in their fungal communities. Pristine forest and reforestation plots showed similar richness, similar diversity and a significantly nested structure of plant-AMF community. The results indicate that small-scale fragmentation presently found in this area has not destroyed the natural AMF community, at least yet. Thus, the regeneration potential of natural forest vegetation at the tested sites is not inhibited by a lack of appropriate mycobionts.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The study was funded by DFG (Research Unit 816, HA2029/2-1).

A special focus is put on highly complex and species-rich ecosystems, the so-called hotspots of biodiversity. One example of a biodiversity hotspot is the tropical mountain rain forest in southern Ecuador <xref rid="pone.0063524-Myers1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063524-Brummitt1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063524-Brehm1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. These forests harbour tens of thousands of species that interact with each other. It is impossible to understand an ecosystem without knowing the composition and interactions of its community. Even though arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) play an important role in the nutrition of nearly all plants, there are only few molecular studies about AMF in tropical forests <xref rid="pone.0063524-Husband1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063524-Husband2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Composition of AMF and their interactions with the diverse tropical plant community are not well known <xref rid="pone.0063524-pik1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Theories on biodiversity and ecosystem stability of multispecies assemblages only recently integrated mutualistic interactions <xref rid="pone.0063524-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. During the last decade, network theories were applied to analyse species-rich, mutualistic interactions and emphasized plant-animal assemblages such as pollinator and seed disperser webs <xref rid="pone.0063524-Mello1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063524-Fortuna1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063524-Medan1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063524-Joppa1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Analyses revealed general features in network architecture of fundamental importance for community formation, biodiversity persistence and stability of ecosystems <xref rid="pone.0063524-Mello1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063524-Bastolla1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In contrast to antagonistic interactions arranged in compartments, mutualistic interactions show a nested structure: rare species tend to interact with a subset of species that generalists interact with <xref rid="pone.0063524-Bascompte1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Nestedness reduces effective interspecific competition, enhances the number of coexisting species &#8211; especially rare species - and increases robustness against loss of species <xref rid="pone.0063524-Mello1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063524-Bastolla1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Studies on network architecture of mycorrhizae have so far only addressed one orchid genus in Europe <xref rid="pone.0063524-Jacquemyn1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, epiphytic versus terrestrial orchids on La R&#233;union <xref rid="pone.0063524-Martos1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and the structure of two communities of plant-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi <xref rid="pone.0063524-MontesinosNavarro1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063524-Chagnon1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Preliminary network analyses for our study site will be presented in <xref rid="pone.0063524-Kottke1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, but with a limited data set. Except for the orchid-mycorrhizal networks on La R&#233;union, the mycorrhizal associations showed significantly nested assemblages.</p><p>In this study, we compiled a broad, culture independent molecular data set of AMF mycobionts in a tropical area by sampling mycorrhizae of seedlings and mature trees from the pristine forest. Additionally we sampled mycorrhizae of grasses, shrubs, trees and planted indigenous tree seedlings on neighbouring reforestation sites. Preliminary results were published in <xref rid="pone.0063524-Haug1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, showing that diversity at the reforestation plots was unexpectedly high and comparable to the pristine forest. However, AMF community composition differed. For the current study, methodology was improved and the sampling expanded. In consequence, species richness is now higher but distinctness of the AMF communities could not be verified. Many OTUs were found in only one plant individual. With this study we want to test whether singleton OTUs form isolated associations with plants or if these OTUs are embedded in an overall network. Therefore, in addition to increased sampling, we applied network theories to assess nestedness and modularity of the AMF community. This is of interest, because it has been shown that a nested network structure contributes to high diversity <xref rid="pone.0063524-Bastolla1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and robustness of community against extinction <xref rid="pone.0063524-Memmott1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and habitat loss <xref rid="pone.0063524-Fortuna2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. We also assessed the level of specialisation between plants and AMF. We estimated AMF species richness and compared the similarity of AMF communities in the pristine forest and the reforestation sites. We analysed AMF communities of plant individuals and species and in particular for <italic>Cedrela montana</italic> Moritz ex Turcz. and <italic>Tabebuia chrysantha</italic> (Jacq.) G.Nicholson (&#8202;=&#8202;<italic>Handroanthus chrysanthus</italic> (Jacq.) S.O.Grose) seedlings. These indigenous tree seedlings offer a good opportunity to study potential specificities of AMF. Our main goal was to investigate whether reforested and natural sites at Reserva Biol&#243;gica San Francisco are similar and if plants and AMF in these sites are part of the same network. This is particularly interesting with respect to reforestation efforts. Therefore, the question whether the natural AMF community is still intact on the reforestation sites and could potentially provide a basis for regeneration of the natural plant vegetation was also of interest.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All necessary permits were obtained for the described field studies (Autorizacion de investigaci&#243;n cient&#237;fica by Ing.

The annealing temperature for the first PCR was 40&#176;C, and for the nested PCR we used a TOUCH program that reached an annealing temperature of 50&#176;C starting from 60&#176;C. Amplified PCR products were cloned with the Invitrogen TA Cloning Kit (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer's instructions, but using a third of the indicated volumes. Inserts were re-amplified from clones with primers M13F/M13R by picking eight bacterial clones with a toothpick and placing it directly to a PCR reaction mixture. Inserts were digested with restriction enzymes HinfI or AfaI. Digested products were examined on a 0.7% agarose gel. Two clones of the same RFLP pattern were cleaned either with ExoSAP-IT&#174; (Affymetrix,Great Britain), PureLink PCR Purification Kit (Life Technologies) or peqGOLD Cycle-Pur Kit (Peqlab,Germany) and sequenced on an in-house ABI 3100 (Applied Biosystems, Germany) sequencer or by GATC Biotech (Konstanz, Germany).

We chose a cut-off value of 97% to delineate OTUs because this value is commonly used. In addition, we analysed our data set with a cut-off value of 99% sequence similarity because the 18 S is relatively conserved and thus this delineation might correspond better to species than the 97% cut-off value. The linkage fraction was 0.5, which combines two clusters if the distances between 50% of the sequences in each cluster are equal or below the cut-off value <xref rid="pone.0063524-Gker1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.

Fortuna and coauthors <xref rid="pone.0063524-Fortuna1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> found a correlation between low nestedness and high modularity, when connectivity values are low. However, the differing results could also have been influenced by the different parameters used.</p><p>We could not detect a single main driver for the modules detected at the 99% similarity level. Some modules appear to be determined by the environment and others by potential preferences for specific partners. However, for many modules no obvious reason could be detected. Most modules were well-embedded into the network and showed as many links to other modules as to nodes within the same module. Considering the fact that the rarefaction curves are unsaturated, even more links between the modules are likely to occur and we would expect that modularity would rather decrease than increase.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Comparison pristine forest &#8211; reforestation sites</title><p>Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities of the pristine forest and reforestation plots share many features: Similar richness and diversity, similar expected richness, similar numbers of OTUs per plant individual, and most of all a nested network structure and high similarity of OTU composition. This suggests that in our study area, mycobionts of the forest vegetation have been adopted by the new flora. Thus, a similar AMF community in composition and richness could be maintained over 36 years of anthropogenic use and several fire events. Size of the disturbed sites might play a critical role for maintenance of AMF communities. Disturbed sites in our study were intercepted by ravines with more or less natural forest vegetation. In addition, the pristine forest was in close reach. Therefore, input of AMF inoculum from the adjacent forests to the disturbed sites is another plausible explanation on how high diversity and similar composition of AMF could be maintained.</p><p>The results indicate that in our study sites, regeneration potential of the natural forest vegetation is not inhibited by a lack of appropriate mycobionts. The highly diverse flora on the human influenced sites most likely serves as a provider of the diverse generalist mycobionts. Forest management by planting native tree seedlings can foster the ongoing process of rehabilitation. Further research is being carried out to examine and fine-tune these hypotheses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0063524.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
