<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We studied the community of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in a tropical mountain rain forest and in neighbouring reforestation plots in the area of Reserva Biológica San Francisco (South Ecuador). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were analysed with molecular methods sequencing part of the 18 S rDNA. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No specific interactions are recognizable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The plant individuals are associated with one to ten arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and mostly with one to four. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>How to maintain biodiversity increasingly draws attention in connection with ecological devastation and climate change. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>A special focus is put on highly complex and species-rich ecosystems, the so-called hotspots of biodiversity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>One example of a biodiversity hotspot is the tropical mountain rain forest in southern Ecuador [1], [2], [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>These forests harbour tens of thousands of species that interact with each other. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>It is impossible to understand an ecosystem without knowing the composition and interactions of its community. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Even though arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) play an important role in the nutrition of nearly all plants, there are only few molecular studies about AMF in tropical forests [4], [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Composition of AMF and their interactions with the diverse tropical plant community are not well known [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Theories on biodiversity and ecosystem stability of multispecies assemblages only recently integrated mutualistic interactions [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>During the last decade, network theories were applied to analyse species-rich, mutualistic interactions and emphasized plant-animal assemblages such as pollinator and seed disperser webs [8], [9], [10], [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Analyses revealed general features in network architecture of fundamental importance for community formation, biodiversity persistence and stability of ecosystems [8], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In contrast to antagonistic interactions arranged in compartments, mutualistic interactions show a nested structure: rare species tend to interact with a subset of species that generalists interact with [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Nestedness reduces effective interspecific competition, enhances the number of coexisting species – especially rare species - and increases robustness against loss of species [8], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Studies on network architecture of mycorrhizae have so far only addressed one orchid genus in Europe [14], epiphytic versus terrestrial orchids on La Réunion [15] and the structure of two communities of plant-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi [16], [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Preliminary network analyses for our study site will be presented in [18], but with a limited data set. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Except for the orchid-mycorrhizal networks on La Réunion, the mycorrhizal associations showed significantly nested assemblages. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>In this study, we compiled a broad, culture independent molecular data set of AMF mycobionts in a tropical area by sampling mycorrhizae of seedlings and mature trees from the pristine forest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Additionally we sampled mycorrhizae of grasses, shrubs, trees and planted indigenous tree seedlings on neighbouring reforestation sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Preliminary results were published in [19], showing that diversity at the reforestation plots was unexpectedly high and comparable to the pristine forest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>However, AMF community composition differed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>For the current study, methodology was improved and the sampling expanded. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In consequence, species richness is now higher but distinctness of the AMF communities could not be verified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Many OTUs were found in only one plant individual. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>With this study we want to test whether singleton OTUs form isolated associations with plants or if these OTUs are embedded in an overall network. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in addition to increased sampling, we applied network theories to assess nestedness and modularity of the AMF community. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>This is of interest, because it has been shown that a nested network structure contributes to high diversity [12] and robustness of community against extinction [20] and habitat loss [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>We also assessed the level of specialisation between plants and AMF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>We estimated AMF species richness and compared the similarity of AMF communities in the pristine forest and the reforestation sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>We analysed AMF communities of plant individuals and species and in particular for Cedrela montana Moritz ex Turcz. and Tabebuia chrysantha (Jacq.) G.Nicholson ( = Handroanthus chrysanthus (Jacq.) S.O.Grose) seedlings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>These indigenous tree seedlings offer a good opportunity to study potential specificities of AMF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Our main goal was to investigate whether reforested and natural sites at Reserva Biológica San Francisco are similar and if plants and AMF in these sites are part of the same network. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>This is particularly interesting with respect to reforestation efforts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the question whether the natural AMF community is still intact on the reforestation sites and could potentially provide a basis for regeneration of the natural plant vegetation was also of interest. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Many other studies [51], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65] report that this cosmopolitan species complex is very abundant at other sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Though, it is likely that the Rhizophagus intraradices/vesiculiferus/irregularis complex is not globally distributed, but rather consists of different strains with a restricted distribution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>However, phylogenetic analyses could not fully resolve this lineage so far [66]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>The five most frequent OTUs in our study represent 50/31.5% of all sequences in the data set. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Ninety-nine/sixty-two percent of all investigated plant individuals are associated with one or several of these fungi. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Such a high level of generalisation of the plant-AMF community may have network-stabilizing functions and serve as a buffer against coextinction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Other benefits of having different symbiotic partners and the question why some fungi are rare and others frequent are as yet unexplored. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Differences in propagation or growth rates may have an influence, but are difficult to demonstrate in field studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Kiers and coauthors [67] experimentally showed that plants are able to select those fungi that supply the most phosphate and reward them with more carbohydrates in return. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Thus, plants and fungi with the most efficient associations may eventually become the most frequent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, different species may have different requirements, which could be the reason why dominant fungi differ in Cedrela and Tabebuia. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>In general, we did not identify plant species with specific OTUs but we did observe preferences within the multi-sampled Cedrela and Tabebuia. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>However, OTUs 2 and 66 are not species specific – they occur with many other plant species at our sampling sites and worldwide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>We also found no indication for specificity of AMF, even at the 99% similarity level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Frequently sampled OTUs always occurred on several different plant species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>Low specificity of plants and fungi in the study area is also supported by low H2′ and d2′ values. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>Only few OTUs were found either in the pristine forest or on reforestation plots and further sampling need to show if this holds true. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>Networks of AMF and plants in our study show significant nested structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>In our study, NODF values were lowest for the pristine forest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>Low network connectivity (or matrix fill) is likely the reason for these low values, because Almeida-Neto and coauthors [68] found a correlation between low connectivity and low nestedness values. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>These lower values might also be due to the fact that in the species-rich, pristine forest more as twice as much plant species were investigated as at the reforestation site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the higher values of the reforestation site may be based on the high sampling numbers of Cedrela, which shows a very species-rich AMF community. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>It is still under discussion which sampling strategy is more representative data set[16], [69]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>Thus, we do not want to over-interpret the different NODF values between pristine forest and reforestation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>We only want to point out that at both sites rare AMF OTUs are integrated in the overall network. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>Higher plant nestedness found in the pristine forest was also verified for the plant-AMF community in a semi-arid region in Mexico [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>Our analyses show that rare AMF OTUs are associated with plant species that again are allied with other, frequent OTUs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>Rare species may enhance the stability of a complex community by providing characteristics favoured in a changing environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Thus, rare species can turn into frequent species depending on environmental conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>Complementarity and convergence in evolution of bidirectional nutrient exchange and recognition processes favour generalist partnerships in mycorrhizae and maintain phylogenetically closely related species in the networks [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>This may explain the great diversity of closely related Glomerales in the same habitat. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>It is likely that the non-modularity of the 97% similarity network is due to high nestedness and connectivity because these values were considerably higher than for the network at the 99% similarity level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>Fortuna and coauthors [9] found a correlation between low nestedness and high modularity, when connectivity values are low. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>However, for many modules no obvious reason could be detected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>Most modules were well-embedded into the network and showed as many links to other modules as to nodes within the same module. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities of the pristine forest and reforestation plots share many features: Similar richness and diversity, similar expected richness, similar numbers of OTUs per plant individual, and most of all a nested network structure and high similarity of OTU composition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>This suggests that in our study area, mycobionts of the forest vegetation have been adopted by the new flora. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>Thus, a similar AMF community in composition and richness could be maintained over 36 years of anthropogenic use and several fire events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>Size of the disturbed sites might play a critical role for maintenance of AMF communities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>Disturbed sites in our study were intercepted by ravines with more or less natural forest vegetation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>In addition, the pristine forest was in close reach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>Therefore, input of AMF inoculum from the adjacent forests to the disturbed sites is another plausible explanation on how high diversity and similar composition of AMF could be maintained. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that in our study sites, regeneration potential of the natural forest vegetation is not inhibited by a lack of appropriate mycobionts. </plain></SENT>
