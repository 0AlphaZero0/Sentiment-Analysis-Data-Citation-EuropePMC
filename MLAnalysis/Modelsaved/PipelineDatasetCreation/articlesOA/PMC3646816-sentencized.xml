</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Acute erythroid leukemia (AEL) is an uncommon (5%) type of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>AEL or AML FAB M6 is characterized by a predominantly erythroid cell proliferation in the bone marrow. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>According to the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) classification [1] there are two subtypes: 1) The erythroleukemia subtype, which is the most common and is defined by the presence in the marrow of 50% or more erythroid precursors and 20% or more blasts in the nonerythroid component, and 2) The pure erythroid leukemia subtype in which more than 80% immature erythroblasts are seen in the marrow. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>AEL can overlap morphologically with other, clinically distinct myeloid malignancies such as, AML with myelodysplasia-related changes, and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) [2], [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Also for this reason it is of interest to distinguish these entities genetically, if indeed genetically distinct they are. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The Mitelman database of chromosome aberrations in cancer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Chromosomes/Mitelman">http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Chromosomes/Mitelman</ext-link>; database last update February 18, 2013) lists 632 cases of AEL with abnormal karyotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The most frequent aberrations, which are found also in other AML subtypes, are structural and numerical changes of chromosomes 5 and 7 as well as trisomy 8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Fusion genes brought about by chromosomal translocations have also been reported in acute erythroid leukemias: NPM1/MLF1 resulting from t(3;5)(q25;q35), RPN1/PRDM16 from t(1;3)(p36;q21), PCM1/JAK2 from t(8;9)(p22;p24), and NUP98/HOXD13 from t(2;11)(q31;p15) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Chromosomes/Mitelman">http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Chromosomes/Mitelman</ext-link>; database last update February 18, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Recently we described a chimeric NFIA/CBFA2T3 gene in a 15-month-old boy with acute erythroid leukemia carrying the chromosomal translocation t(1;16)(p31;q22) [5], [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we report the fusion of the genes ZMYND8 and RELA in the bone marrow cells from an infant with erythroid leukemia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Infant leukemia is characterized by a high leukocyte count, hepatosplenomegaly and frequent central nervous system involvement [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The most common (cyto)genetic event in infant leukemias is rearrangement of the MLL gene in chromosome band 11q23 which, depending on the applied methodology, may be as high as 85% [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The chromosome translocations t(1;22)(p13;q13) which gives rise to the RBM15-MKL1 fusion gene and t(7;12)(q36;p13) resulting in the formation of the MNX1-ETV6 fusion or overexpression of the MNX1 gene have also been exclusively reported in infant leukemias [8]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>On admission, the patient had high fever and hepatosplenomegaly, but otherwise normal physical findings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>No congenital abnormalities or dysmorphic features were seen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Initial blood tests showed hemoglobin 6.7 g/dl, white blood cell count 24.9×109/L, platelet count 116×109/L, hemoglobin F 12%, and lactate dehydrogenase 8400 U/L. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood smears demonstrated polychromasia and circulating dysplastic erythroblasts of all maturation stages, some metamyelocytes and myelocytes, but no myeloblasts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Examination of a bone marrow (BM) aspirate revealed erythroid hyperplasia and dysplasia with binucleated and multinucleated forms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The aspirate smear count displayed 4% myeloblasts, 38% proerythroblasts, 25% polychromatic erythroblasts, and 22% orthochromatic erythroblasts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Histological examination of the BM revealed high cellularity, dysplastic megakaryocytes, and slight fibrosis around sinusoids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The number of CD34+ cells in the biopsy was around 8%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric immunophenotyping of consecutive bone marrow aspirates showed a marked increase of CD45 negative erytroblasts, ranging from 30-60% of total cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>They expressed CD71, glycophorin, and CD36, but were negative for other cell lineage markers such as CD13, CD33, CD11b, T-and B-cell markers as well as HLA-DR antigens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The CD34+ cells comprised 1.5% of total cells, and were mainly CD34+ B-cell precursor cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The CD34+ myeloid precursor cells displayed a normal expression of CD34, CD117, HLA-DR antigens, CD13, and CD33. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Granulopoiesis revealed a normal maturation pattern as revealed by the expression of CD13 and CD11b. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis of BM cells showed the abnormal karyotype 46,XY,t(11;20)(p11;q11) in 8 out of 10 metaphases (Figure 1A and 1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>A myeloid malignancy, either myelodysplastic syndrome or an early phase of AML, possibly with an infection superimposed, was suspected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Prior to the cytogenetics, congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) was considered and ruled out. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Slides of the patient´s bone marrow were also evaluated at the CDA Diagnostic Service and Research Laboratory, MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, Oxord, UK. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The morphological appearance was not diagnostic for CDA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>During an observational period the child's general condition deteriorated, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) was assumed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Hemophagocytosis was present in the bone marrow. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>In addition, HLH was suggested due to a combination of clinical criteria (splenomegaly, fever) and the laboratory constellation with cytopenia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperferritinemia, and neurological symptoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>No infectious agents were detected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Cytology of the cerebrospinal fluid and brain-MRI were normal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Treatment according to an HLH-protocol [9] was initiated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>However, repeated BM investigations now demonstrated 100% cellularity and &gt; 70% CD71+ erythroblasts, indicative of a transition to acute erythroid leukemia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>The patient did not completely fullfill the criteria “more than 80% erythroblasts” (M6b), nor “more than 20% blasts in the nonerythroid compartment” (M6a) as required by the WHO definition of pure erythroid leukemia [1], which might simply be due to the fact that treatment was started before he reached the appropriate counts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Concurrently, cytogenetic analysis showed clonal evolution to a more complex karyotype: 48,XY,+7,t(11;20)(p11;q11),+17[4]/48,XY,+del(7)(p11)t(11;20)(p11;q11),+17[9]/46,XY[2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Therefore, HLH-treatment was stopped and AML treatment according to the current Nordic AML protocol begun instead [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Morphological bone marrow remission was achieved after the first of two induction courses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>After the first consolidation course, the patient was transplanted in cytogenetic remission from a matched unrelated donor after conditioning with busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and melphalan [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>He is now in complete remission 8 months after the transplantation. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Using FusionMap on the raw sequencing data obtained by the Norwegian Sequencing Centre, more than 1000 fusion genes were found. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>The ZMYND8-RELA fusion transcript was ranked first with 179 seed counts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Because of this and because of the translocation between chromosomes 11 and 20 detected by karyotyping (ZMYND8 and RELA map to chromosome bands 20q13 and 11q13, respectively), we decided to investigate further the ZMYND8-RELA fusion transcript. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>No other fusions were examined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>PCR and direct sequencing verified the presence of a ZMYND8-RELA chimeric transcript in which exon 21 of ZMYND8, from sub-band 20q13.12 (nt 3406 insequence with accession number NM_183047 version 1), was fused in frame to exon 2 of RELA from sub-band 11q13.1 (nt 148 in NM_021975 version 3) (Figure 1E and F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>FISH showed that part of the probe RP11-702E03 for ZMYND8 as well as the entire probe CTD-2382C11 for RELA had moved to band p12 of the derivative chromosome 11 (Figure 1B).The data suggested that the ZMYND8-RELA fusion gene was located on the p12 band of der(11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>To further characterize the location of the ZMYND8-RELA fusion gene on the derivative chromosome 11, more chromosome 11-specific BAC clones from the Human “32K” BAC Re-Array library were used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>We found that the BACs RP11-357P03 and RP11-365J23 had moved to the q arm of der(20), whereas the probe RP11-701A18 had moved to the q arm of the derivative chromosome 11 (Figure 2A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Taken together the FISH data suggest that the fusion ZMYND8-RELA gene is localized between BACs RP11-365J23 and RP11-701A18 (Figure 2B), and thus that a small pericentromeric inversion between bands 11p12 and 11q13 not detected with banding cytogenetics (G-banding had been used for karyotyping), had occurred. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>The ZMYND8 protein contains a Zinc-PHD finger domain, a bromodomain, a PWWP domain, and a MYND type of zinc finger (Figure 3, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org">www.ensembl.org</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>It functions as a receptor for activated C-kinase (RACK) protein [13] but is also a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma-associated antigen (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23613">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23613</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>The RELA protein is related to c-Rel and its oncogenic avian derivative v-Rel protein, contains an RHD domain (Figure 3), and forms complexes with the most abundant form NFKB1 of the transcription factor NF-kappa-B [14] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>NF-kappa-B plays a key role in inflammatory and innate immune responses and its role in oncogenesis is being investigated [15], [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>NF-kappa-B was found to be constitutively activated in CD34+ AML cells but not in the normal CD34+ hematopoietic cells [17], [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Supershift experiments identified both NFKB1 and RELA proteins in the myeloid blast nucleous and the presence of NFKB1/RELA heterodimer as well as NFKB1 and RELA homodimers [17], [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Constitutive activation of NFKB in AML cells may be caused by various mechanisms such as alterated kinase activity, receptor overexpression autocrine cytokine production, and viral infections [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>So far, no structural aberrations or locus amplification of RELA have been found [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>The present study is therefore the first in which a rearrangement of RELA was detected and perhaps the ZMYND8-RELA fusion gene might be another novel mechanism of constitutive activation of NFKB in AML cells since the RELA gene is under control of the ZMYND8 promoter. </plain></SENT>

</text></title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0063663.g003"/></fig></SecTag><p><text><SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>The putative ZMYND8-RELA fusion protein contains the Zinc-PHD finger domain, a bromodomain, a PWWP domain, a MYND type of zinc finger of ZMYND8, and the entire RELA protein (Figure 3), indicating that it might influence several cellular processes including the NF-kappa-B pathway [15], [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Fusion genes caused by chromosomal aberrations often seen as the sole change at cytogenetic analysis are assumed to represent primary tumorigenic events, the paradigmatic example being BCR-ABL and the Philadelphia chromosome [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>Thus, the combination of karyotyping by banding cytogenetics with next generation RNA sequencing is a powerful tool to detect such fusion genes in cancer as demonstrated both here and in our previous report [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>The patient in this study presented initially with an MDS-like morphology, but evolved rapidly into a picture that morphologically resembled acute erythroid leukemia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>The rapid increase in erythroid blasts was indicative of a true de novo AML (TDN-AML) biology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>However, we cannot exclude the possibility that our patient may have evolved from MDS into an myelodysplasia-related AML (MDR-AML). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>The finding of a ZMYND8/RELA fusion as the central pathogenetic event does not shed more light on the early phenotypic features since no prior knowledge is at hand linking this fusion gene to any of the two said modes of disease presentation. </plain></SENT>
