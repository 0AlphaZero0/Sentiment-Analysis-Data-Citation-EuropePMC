In 7 patients a mutation was identified on only 1 allele. Novel mutations were detected on 1.7% of alleles (5 of 306). Rare mutations were found on 2.3% of alleles (7 of 306). For further analysis, patients were categorized into CYP21A2 mutation groups according to predicted residual enzyme function: null (n = 34), A (n = 42), B (n = 36), C (n = 34), and D (n = 7). Daily glucocorticoid dose was highest in group null and lowest in group C. Fludrocortisone was used more frequently in patients with more severe genotypes. Except for lower female height in group B, no statistically significant associations between genotype and clinical parameters were found.

The underrepresentation of males with nonclassic CAH may reflect that milder genotypes result in a milder condition that is neither diagnosed nor followed up in adulthood. Overall, our results suggest that the impaired health status of adults with CAH coming to medical attention is acquired rather than genetically determined and therefore could potentially be improved through modification of treatment.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD) is an autosomal recessive disorder and one of the most frequent inborn conditions. Inactivating mutations in the 21-hydroxylase (<italic>CYP21A2</italic>) gene account for approximately 95% of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency is clinically classified into classic CAH, comprising the salt-wasting (SW) and the simple virilizing (SV) forms, and nonclassic CAH. The classic form occurs in a frequency of approximately 1 in 10 000 to 1 in 15 000 in the general population, whereas the nonclassic form is more frequent with an estimated incidence of about 1 in 1000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The classic form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency is characterized by androgen excess, glucocorticoid deficiency, and, in two thirds of CAH patients, mineralocorticoid deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p><p>In more than 95% of patients with 21OHD, common <italic>CYP21A2</italic> mutations are detected. Approximately 20%&#8211;25% of mutant alleles in 21OHD are <italic>CYP21A2</italic> gene deletions and <italic>CYP21A1P/CYP21A2</italic> chimeric genes (traditionally termed large gene conversions) caused by unequal crossing-over events within the RCCX locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The transfer of genetic material from the <italic>CYP21A1P</italic> pseudogene into the <italic>CYP21A2</italic> gene accounts for about 70%&#8211;75% of <italic>CYP21A2</italic> disease-causing mutations, including 7 point mutations, a deletion of 8 base pairs in exon 3, and a cluster of 3 point mutations in exon 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In addition, more than 100 pseudogene-independent mutations are listed by the Human Cytochrome P450 allele Nomenclature Committee (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cypalleles.ki.se/cyp21.htm">http://www.cypalleles.ki.se/cyp21.htm</ext-link>). <italic>CYP21A2</italic> genotypes have been categorized into different mutation groups based on their in vitro 21-hydroxylase activity; using these categories, a strong genotype-phenotype correlation has been established with high positive predictive value for salt wasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and impairment of adrenomedullary function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Definition of mutation groups and their distribution in the cohort.

Our recent cohort study [United Kingdom Congenital adrenal Hyperplasia Adult Study Executive (CaHASE)] of 203 adults with congenital adrenal hyperplasia demonstrated their suboptimal health status with a poor metabolic profile, impaired fertility, and reduced quality of life (QOL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), but the cause for these poor outcomes remains to be elucidated. We hypothesized that the severity of the disease-causing <italic>CYP21A2</italic> mutation might influence the outcome and health status in adults with CAH. To this end we have carried out a comprehensive genotype-phenotype analysis in the UK CaHASE cohort.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Patients were recruited from 17 centers into this nationwide study as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).

All patients were 18 years old or older and had a confirmed diagnosis of CAH. The recruitment started August 2004 and ended July 2007. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p><sec><title>General procedures</title><p>All participants were seen at the center routinely responsible for their clinical care in the morning after fasting overnight and taking their regular medication. After medical history and physical examination, fasting blood samples were taken. Thereafter patients were served breakfast and psychometric questionnaires were completed. The physical examination included recording of blood pressure (BP) (3 seated and 1 standing, separated by 5 minutes), height, weight, waist circumference, presence and degree of stretch marks, and in females hirsutism and in males testicular volume (orchidometer) and presence of masses.</p><p>The following biochemical parameters were assessed: renal and liver function, fasting plasma glucose, serum insulin, cholesterol (total, low density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein), triglycerides, plasma renin activity, and steroid hormones including 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP), androstenedione, testosterone, and SHBG. The median (interquartile range) for the time from intake of last glucocorticoid dose until blood sampling was 3.75 (2.25&#8211;12.5) hours. All biochemical measurements were performed at local laboratories. The results were recorded as below, within, or above the local reference range, apart from 17OHP, androstenedione, and plasma renin, for which absolute values were compared with previously recommended target ranges for patients with CAH and adrenal insufficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). All laboratories participate in the United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Service scheme for quality control of steroid immunoassays. Serum insulin was measured in a single laboratory using an ultrasensitive ELISA (DRG Instruments, Marburg, Germany) and used for calculation of homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Psychometric evaluation was carried out using self-administered questionnaires, including 2 validated questionnaires for the assessment of subjective health status [36 item short form health survey (SF-36)].</p></sec><sec><title>Mutation analysis, mutation groups, and in vitro analysis of <italic>CYP21A2</italic> mutations</title><p>DNA was available for mutation analysis of the <italic>CYP21A2</italic> gene in 153 of 203 patients from the UK CaHASE cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). <italic>CYP21A2</italic> gene deletion and chimeric genes were detected using a commercially available multiplex-ligation probe amplification strategy following the manufacturer's protocol (mrc-Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).

The distribution of mutations in our cohort is similar to population studies analyzing the allele frequency of <italic>CYP21A2</italic> mutations in CAH patients from published cases series (Supplemental Table 1, published on The Endocrine Society's Journals Online web site at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcem.endojournals.org">http://jcem.endojournals.org</ext-link>). In 7 patients a mutation was identified on only 1 allele. Novel mutations were detected on 1.7% of alleles (5 of 306) and rare mutations were detected on 2.3% of alleles (7 of 306). Mutations were classified according to their published in vitro activity; for novel variants and mutations without published activities activity was measured using in vitro expression assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The 5 novel mutations included 1 missense mutation (g.752C&gt;T, p.R124C), 1 nonsense mutation (g.803C&gt;T, p.Q141X), 1 splice site mutation (IVS9 +1G&gt;C), and 2 frame shift mutations (g.2047delG, p.V334<italic>fxX28</italic>; g.2674dupC, p.R483P<italic>fsX40</italic>). The p.R124C mutation had a residual activity for the conversion of progesterone to deoxycorticosterone of 16% (&#177;0.6 SEM) and was classified as a mutation group B variant. The previously published L308F mutation showed a residual activity of approximately 3% (3.2% &#177;0.6 SEM) for 21-hydroxylation of progesterone and was categorized into mutation group B, which is in line with a previous prediction that this variant should lead to moderate functional impairment as it was found in a patient with simple virilizing CAH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The previously published variant p.R435C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) had a residual activity of approximately 7% (6.5% &#177; 0.9 SEM) for the conversion of progesterone to deoxycorticosterone.</p><p>Patients were categorized into <italic>CYP21A2</italic> mutation groups for further analysis: null 34 (19 females, 15 males), A 42 (24 females, 18 males), B 36 (25 females, 11 males), C 34 (29 females, 5 males), and D 7 (6 females, 1 male) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B).

In contrast, more than half of patients in group B had tried to have children and 36% of patients with group B mutations had been pregnant. About 60% of females with group C mutations had tried to be, and about half of all patients had been, pregnant in this group. There was a clear age dependency. Most women younger than 30 years had never tried to get pregnant, whereas a significantly higher proportion of older women when trying achieved by a higher success rate of pregnancies (Supplemental Table 3).</p><p>Most men in all mutations groups did not have children (87% of null, 77% of A, 90% of B), and of these, 79% had never tried to have children (73% of null, 91% of A, 78% of B). The data set was insufficient to analyze any relation to testicular adrenal rest tumors.</p></sec><sec><title>Subjective health status</title><p>We previously demonstrated significantly impaired subjective health status in our CAH patients in comparison with healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).

In children, there is a correlation between genotype and renal salt loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and impairment of adrenomedullary function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The correlation between virilization of the external genitalia in 46,XX individuals and the <italic>CYP21A2</italic> genotype has been variably reported, with more severe <italic>CYP21A2</italic> gene mutations tending to be associated with more severe virilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Here we investigated whether outcome measures in adults with CAH related to the severity of the genotype.</p><p>Our CAH patient cohort is genetically representative because we found the same distribution pattern of genotypes previously described in studies analyzing the spectrum of <italic>CYP21A2</italic> mutations in CAH. We, like others, observed a reduced number of men, in particular those with a milder genotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>We observed that higher glucocorticoid doses tended to be used in patients with more severe mutations, which was significantly different only in patients on hydrocortisone replacement. The lack of statistical significance might well be caused by the small sample size and heterogeneity of glucocorticoid use, which included hydrocortisone, prednisolone, and dexamethasone. However, the possibility remains that either substantially different glucocorticoid doses are not required in patients with contrasting genotypes or that the treatment might not be well adjusted to individual requirements. In all mutation groups, only a low percentage of patients had parameters of hormonal control in the desired target ranges (Supplemental Figure 1).</p><p>It seems that in general, patients were often treated with insufficient doses of mineralocorticoids. Importantly, patients with all disease severities may benefit from renin measurement to assess whether they benefit from tailored mineralocorticoid replacement. This is supported by our findings in a few patients within mutation group C, which is normally associated with nonclassic CAH. However, several patients had increased renin levels at least 1-fold above the normal range and were not on fludrocortisone (Supplemental Table 2).</p><p>The strong correlation between renal salt loss phenotype and genotype in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) is reflected in our findings that use of fludrocortisone and fludrocortisone dose correlated with the underlying genotype (Supplemental Table 2). The use of mineralocorticoids in patients with mutation group C can be explained by the fact that even some patient with nonclassic CAH may have subclinical signs of salt loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Thus, the overall correlation between genotype and salt loss in adults with CAH seems to be similar to children, in whom a higher degree of subclinical and clinical salt loss is observed in individuals with the more severe genotype.</p><p>Variable outcomes have been described for most cardiovascular and metabolic parameters in adult patients with CAH. Higher prevalence of obesity and lower levels of insulin sensitivity in comparison with the general population are commonly reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Our previous report on the UK CaHASE cohort illustrated suboptimal outcome and several health problems in adults with CAH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). However, we did not find any relation between the underlying genotype and the metabolic outcome in our patient cohort. This may well be explained, as outlined above, by a significant proportion of patients receiving suboptimal management with glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids.</p><p>The age of menarche did not differ between mutation groups, suggesting a similar course of pubertal development in females. Most women with null and A mutations in our study had never tried to have children, which is a similar finding to reports from Sweden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). In contrast to the Swedish study, we observed 1 patient with null mutations, who had 1 child. An increasing number of children were born in patients with less severe genotypes and females with milder genotypes had tried for fertility more commonly (Supplemental Table 3). Using our data set, we are able to report only on fertility, but importantly, some recent studies established almost normal fecundity in women with CAH who wish to have children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). We did not assess whether ovulation frequency differed between patients with different genotypes. However, factors other than hormonal control may well play an important role in decreased fertility in women with CAH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Unfortunately, we did not explore sexual orientation or behavior in our patients, which would have provided insights into the effect of the underlying genotype on potential differences in cerebral masculinization caused by androgen effects on the female brain. Others have described higher rates of homosexual and bisexual orientation in women with CAH with increasing frequency in those with severe underlying genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>Patients from all mutation groups showed impaired subjective heath status compared with normal controls for most items. However, outcome between patients from different mutation groups did not differ, and subjective health status was similarly impaired when comparing men and women and patients younger and older than 30 years of age. Comparing the different disease severities suggests that impaired subjective health status is caused by exogenous factors such as treatment or noncompliance rather than by predetermined genetic factors. Chronic conditions are generally associated with several difficulties potentially affecting QOL. Impaired subjective health status has been described in our UK CaHASE cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). This impairment was similar to if not greater than previously observed in patients with adrenal insufficiency on current standard replacement therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). The situation in CAH appears to be more complex because CAH features not only adrenal insufficiency but also the additional problem of androgen excess. It is, however, unclear why different studies on subjective health status in CAH have led to variable results. Interestingly, most studies applying the SF-36 showed an impaired subjective health status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). However, adults with CAH in the multicenter study from the United Kingdom had a worse subjective health status than controls and patients with adrenal insufficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), whereas a study including 2 specialized centers from Germany showed only mild impairment compared with control and better QOL than patients with adrenal insufficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Other studies including adult CAH patients did find normal QOL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) or even better QOL in CAH patients compared with normal controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Differences in health care provision may account for such differences, but clear evidence for such assumptions is lacking. In a recent paper on an American cohort of CAH patients, similar findings to ours were described, with most patients showing suboptimal biochemical control of CAH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). In conclusion, most current health problems in adult CAH patients with 21OHD under medical follow-up do not correlate with the severity of the underlying genetic <italic>CYP21A2</italic> genotype. This was observed at an equal level in both sexes and all mutation severity groups. The only exemption is men with nonclassic CAH, who were underrepresented in the current study. The most likely common nongenetic influences on health in different patients are the prescribed steroid hormone replacement regimen and general health care provision. Thus, the future improvement of care provision requires improved individualized treatment strategies tailored to the needs of individual patients. It is possible that differences between different <italic>CYP21A2</italic> mutation groups will be unmasked consequent to future improvements of health care provision for adult patients with CAH.</p></sec>
