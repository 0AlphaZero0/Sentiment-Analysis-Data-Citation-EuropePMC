<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Inactivating mutations in the 21-hydroxylase (CYP21A2) gene account for approximately 95% of cases (1–3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency is clinically classified into classic CAH, comprising the salt-wasting (SW) and the simple virilizing (SV) forms, and nonclassic CAH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The classic form occurs in a frequency of approximately 1 in 10 000 to 1 in 15 000 in the general population, whereas the nonclassic form is more frequent with an estimated incidence of about 1 in 1000 (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The classic form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency is characterized by androgen excess, glucocorticoid deficiency, and, in two thirds of CAH patients, mineralocorticoid deficiency (1, 2). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The transfer of genetic material from the CYP21A1P pseudogene into the CYP21A2 gene accounts for about 70%–75% of CYP21A2 disease-causing mutations, including 7 point mutations, a deletion of 8 base pairs in exon 3, and a cluster of 3 point mutations in exon 6 (1, 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In addition, more than 100 pseudogene-independent mutations are listed by the Human Cytochrome P450 allele Nomenclature Committee (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cypalleles.ki.se/cyp21.htm">http://www.cypalleles.ki.se/cyp21.htm</ext-link>). CYP21A2 genotypes have been categorized into different mutation groups based on their in vitro 21-hydroxylase activity; using these categories, a strong genotype-phenotype correlation has been established with high positive predictive value for salt wasting (5) and impairment of adrenomedullary function (6) (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>The CYP21A2 genotype has not been correlated previously with health outcomes in adults with CAH, except in relation to outcome of surgical procedures (20) and gender typical behavior (21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>In children, there is a correlation between genotype and renal salt loss (5) and impairment of adrenomedullary function (6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>The correlation between virilization of the external genitalia in 46,XX individuals and the CYP21A2 genotype has been variably reported, with more severe CYP21A2 gene mutations tending to be associated with more severe virilization (14–16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Here we investigated whether outcome measures in adults with CAH related to the severity of the genotype. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Our CAH patient cohort is genetically representative because we found the same distribution pattern of genotypes previously described in studies analyzing the spectrum of CYP21A2 mutations in CAH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>We, like others, observed a reduced number of men, in particular those with a milder genotype (16, 22, 23). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>We observed that higher glucocorticoid doses tended to be used in patients with more severe mutations, which was significantly different only in patients on hydrocortisone replacement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>The lack of statistical significance might well be caused by the small sample size and heterogeneity of glucocorticoid use, which included hydrocortisone, prednisolone, and dexamethasone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>However, the possibility remains that either substantially different glucocorticoid doses are not required in patients with contrasting genotypes or that the treatment might not be well adjusted to individual requirements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>In all mutation groups, only a low percentage of patients had parameters of hormonal control in the desired target ranges (Supplemental Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>It seems that in general, patients were often treated with insufficient doses of mineralocorticoids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Importantly, patients with all disease severities may benefit from renin measurement to assess whether they benefit from tailored mineralocorticoid replacement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>This is supported by our findings in a few patients within mutation group C, which is normally associated with nonclassic CAH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>However, several patients had increased renin levels at least 1-fold above the normal range and were not on fludrocortisone (Supplemental Table 2). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>The strong correlation between renal salt loss phenotype and genotype in children (5) is reflected in our findings that use of fludrocortisone and fludrocortisone dose correlated with the underlying genotype (Supplemental Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>The use of mineralocorticoids in patients with mutation group C can be explained by the fact that even some patient with nonclassic CAH may have subclinical signs of salt loss (24). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Thus, the overall correlation between genotype and salt loss in adults with CAH seems to be similar to children, in whom a higher degree of subclinical and clinical salt loss is observed in individuals with the more severe genotype. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Variable outcomes have been described for most cardiovascular and metabolic parameters in adult patients with CAH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Higher prevalence of obesity and lower levels of insulin sensitivity in comparison with the general population are commonly reported (7–9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Our previous report on the UK CaHASE cohort illustrated suboptimal outcome and several health problems in adults with CAH (10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>However, we did not find any relation between the underlying genotype and the metabolic outcome in our patient cohort. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>This may well be explained, as outlined above, by a significant proportion of patients receiving suboptimal management with glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>The age of menarche did not differ between mutation groups, suggesting a similar course of pubertal development in females. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Most women with null and A mutations in our study had never tried to have children, which is a similar finding to reports from Sweden (25). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the Swedish study, we observed 1 patient with null mutations, who had 1 child. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>An increasing number of children were born in patients with less severe genotypes and females with milder genotypes had tried for fertility more commonly (Supplemental Table 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Using our data set, we are able to report only on fertility, but importantly, some recent studies established almost normal fecundity in women with CAH who wish to have children (25, 26). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>We did not assess whether ovulation frequency differed between patients with different genotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>However, factors other than hormonal control may well play an important role in decreased fertility in women with CAH (27). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, we did not explore sexual orientation or behavior in our patients, which would have provided insights into the effect of the underlying genotype on potential differences in cerebral masculinization caused by androgen effects on the female brain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Others have described higher rates of homosexual and bisexual orientation in women with CAH with increasing frequency in those with severe underlying genotypes (21). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Patients from all mutation groups showed impaired subjective heath status compared with normal controls for most items. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>However, outcome between patients from different mutation groups did not differ, and subjective health status was similarly impaired when comparing men and women and patients younger and older than 30 years of age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Comparing the different disease severities suggests that impaired subjective health status is caused by exogenous factors such as treatment or noncompliance rather than by predetermined genetic factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Chronic conditions are generally associated with several difficulties potentially affecting QOL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Impaired subjective health status has been described in our UK CaHASE cohort (10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>This impairment was similar to if not greater than previously observed in patients with adrenal insufficiency on current standard replacement therapy (28). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>The situation in CAH appears to be more complex because CAH features not only adrenal insufficiency but also the additional problem of androgen excess. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>It is, however, unclear why different studies on subjective health status in CAH have led to variable results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, most studies applying the SF-36 showed an impaired subjective health status (10, 29, 30). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>However, adults with CAH in the multicenter study from the United Kingdom had a worse subjective health status than controls and patients with adrenal insufficiency (10), whereas a study including 2 specialized centers from Germany showed only mild impairment compared with control and better QOL than patients with adrenal insufficiency (30). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Other studies including adult CAH patients did find normal QOL (21, 31) or even better QOL in CAH patients compared with normal controls (32). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Differences in health care provision may account for such differences, but clear evidence for such assumptions is lacking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>In a recent paper on an American cohort of CAH patients, similar findings to ours were described, with most patients showing suboptimal biochemical control of CAH (33). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, most current health problems in adult CAH patients with 21OHD under medical follow-up do not correlate with the severity of the underlying genetic CYP21A2 genotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>This was observed at an equal level in both sexes and all mutation severity groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>The only exemption is men with nonclassic CAH, who were underrepresented in the current study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>The most likely common nongenetic influences on health in different patients are the prescribed steroid hormone replacement regimen and general health care provision. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Thus, the future improvement of care provision requires improved individualized treatment strategies tailored to the needs of individual patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>It is possible that differences between different CYP21A2 mutation groups will be unmasked consequent to future improvements of health care provision for adult patients with CAH. </plain></SENT>
