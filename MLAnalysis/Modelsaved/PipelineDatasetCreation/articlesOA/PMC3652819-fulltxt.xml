The <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibition of prolyl endopeptidase (PEP) was used as screening method to select the suitable fraction for peptide identification. Functional analysis of 13L peptide was achieved using the transgenic <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> strain CL4176 expressing the human A&#946;<sub>1&#8211;42</sub> peptide as a pre-clinical <italic>in vivo</italic> model for Alzheimer's disease. Among the peptides isolated, peptide 13L (1 &#181;g/mL) showed the highest antioxidant activity (<italic>P</italic>&#8804;0.001) in the wild-type strain (N2). Furthermore, 13L produced a significant delay in body paralysis in strain CL4176, especially in the 24&#8211;47 h period after A&#946;<sub>1&#8211;42</sub> peptide induction (<italic>P</italic>&#8804;0.0001). This observation is in accordance with the reduction of A&#946; deposits in CL4176 by western blot.

It originated in the rain forests of the Americas and was introduced to Europe in the 16<sup>th</sup> century. Historically, cocoa beans have had many uses ranging from medication to currency <xref rid="pone.0063283-Dillinger1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>; however, the concept that cocoa or chocolate has health benefits was not accepted throughout much of Europe until the 20<sup>th</sup> century <xref rid="pone.0063283-Steinberg1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. To date, numerous studies have shown that cocoa and cocoa-based products contain many different substances with beneficial effects on human health <xref rid="pone.0063283-Galleano1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063283-Rusconi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Cocoa polyphenols (mainly catechin, epicatechin and procyanidins) are the major antioxidant source in the cocoa bean as they are present in high concentrations. Cocoa flavonoids are known to display antioxidant effects through the scavenging of reactive oxygen species, Fe2+ and Cu+ chelating, inhibition of key enzymes, and promoting antioxidant defenses <xref rid="pone.0063283-Katz1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Furthermore, there is strong evidence that consumption of polyphenol-rich cocoa products contributes to the prevention of cardiovascular diseases <xref rid="pone.0063283-Galleano1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, also showing anti-tumoral properties <xref rid="pone.0063283-Preza1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and the ability to prevent diabetes development <xref rid="pone.0063283-Katz1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Recently, the literature <xref rid="pone.0063283-Nehlig1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> has described that compounds present in cocoa powder and chocolate exert several beneficial effects on the brain, improving cognition in animals and humans. Hence, the health-promoting properties of cocoa powder have mainly been attributed to their polyphenolic compounds. However, during bean processing to produce cocoa powder, polyphenol concentration can be affected by processes like fermentation or roasting. Therefore, identification of other natural sources with antioxidative properties other than polyphenols could be an interesting aim of nutrition research.</p><p>Dietary proteins are one of the most promising bioactive compounds. Various studies have reported on the antioxidant properties of hydrolysates or bioactive peptides from plant or animal sources (for a review see <xref rid="pone.0063283-Sarmadi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>). These include peptides from fish processing products <xref rid="pone.0063283-Klompong1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, which have been found to retard lipid peroxidation; and proteins from milk casein, bovine serum albumine, ovalbumine, soybean, oilseed proteins, wheat gliadin and maize zein, which exert antioxidative activities against the peroxidation of lipids and fatty acids <xref rid="pone.0063283-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>The protein content of cocoa seed is 10&#8211;15% of the dry weight, with an amino acid profile rich in lysine, arginine, serine, proline, alanine, leucine, valine, phenylalanine, and methionine <xref rid="pone.0063283-Summa1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However, there is not much information concerning the potential beneficial properties of cocoa peptides <xref rid="pone.0063283-Preza1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and hence to study their impact on the prevention or treatment of age-related diseases is of great interest.</p><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized pathologically by senile plaques, where the major constituent is the amyloid beta peptide (A&#946;), a 39&#8211;43 amino acid peptide derived from proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) <xref rid="pone.0063283-Selkoe1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of senile dementia, whose etiology is still under discussion. Recent studies have suggested a prion-like mechanism of disease transmission through propagation of protein misfolding in animal brains <xref rid="pone.0063283-Morales1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>; however, the mechanism responsible for the initiation of A&#946; accumulation is controversial. In spite of this, there is wide acceptance of the &#8220;amyloid cascade hypothesis&#8221; <xref rid="pone.0063283-Hardy1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, which states that A&#946; accumulation triggers downstream neurotoxic events, leading to neuronal dysfunction and death. The strongest evidence supporting this hypothesis is based on the identification of mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene or two presenilin genes (PS1 and PS2) in familial cases of AD, which result in increased A&#946; production <xref rid="pone.0063283-Sherrington1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Evidence for involvement of free radicals in AD include the presence of elevated levels of protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation products and oxidative damage to mitochondria due to the ability of A&#946; peptide to act as a pro-oxidant. This knowledge indicates that the oxidation process clearly unleashes Alzheimer's disease <xref rid="pone.0063283-Verri1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>In this context, many different <italic>in vivo</italic> models have been used to study the mechanism of A&#946; toxicity and determine effective therapeutic strategies. More recently, different transgenic strains of the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> have been used as model for neurodegenerative diseases, including AD <xref rid="pone.0063283-Luo1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063283-Ewald1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063283-Calahorro1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063283-Teschendorf1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.

Interestingly, protein hydrolysis of &#8220;Barquillo&#8221; enhanced the antioxidative effect and protective activity against A&#946; toxicity in the nematode.

These results support the important role of other compounds (other than polyphenols) in the antioxidant activity of cocoa and chocolate <xref rid="pone.0063283-Katz1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Therefore, a purification process was performed in order to isolate and identify these bioactive peptides. Fractionation of hydrolyzed &#8220;Barquillo&#8221; resulted in three RPC fractions with antioxidant properties and the ability to delay paralysis in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> AD model. All the identified peptides in these fractions belonged to the 21 kDa seed protein from <italic>Theobroma cacao</italic> and, surprisingly, many of them were located in a region encoding trypsin inhibitor activity.

Pyruvate metabolism was the most significant up-regulated metabolic pathway in peptide 13L-fed nematodes. This pathway is considered the output of glycolysis and the metabolic intersection of different pathways (such as propanoate metabolism, butanoate metabolism, leucine and lysine biosynthesis and citrate cycle). In this metabolic pathway, pyruvate is decarboxylated by pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) to produce acetyl-coA, which is the key substance for ATP synthesis (through citrate cycle) and synthesis of acetylcholine. Furthermore, previous reports have shown that PDH inactivation results in acetylcholine reduction in cholinergic neurons, and therefore, neuronal death as a consequence of energy production failure <xref rid="pone.0063283-Imahori1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Also, PDH reduction is related with glycolysis reduction and mitochondrial dysfunction, which are described to be present in AD <xref rid="pone.0063283-Bubber1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063283-Reddy1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063283-Phelps1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063283-Chou1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. The microarray results indicated an up-regulation of pyruvate metabolism (and other related-pathways such as propanoate and butanoate metabolism), which could lead to an increase in acetyl-CoA production. This finding suggests that up-regulation of pyruvate metabolism as the central pathway could also up-regulate related metabolic pathways, leading to increased carbohydrate metabolism, including glucose. Furthermore, we determined citrate-cycle up-regulation after nematodes ingested 13L peptide. In the human brain, reduced activity of some tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) enzymes has been described in AD patients <xref rid="pone.0063283-Bubber1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Taking into account that the major portion of glucose flux takes place through the TCA cycle <xref rid="pone.0063283-Phelps1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, our results would indicate that 13L peptide could enhance the glucose metabolism to ensure ATP demands for neuronal cells.</p><p>Worm culture supplementation with 13L peptide also up-regulated tryptophan metabolism in the nematodes. Tryptophan is an essential amino acid for humans with two metabolic pathways: the methoxyindole pathway, which leads to formation of serotonin (5-HT) and melatonin, and the kynurenine pathway, which is involved in the cleavage of the indol ring of tryptophan to produce kynurenine <xref rid="pone.0063283-Oxenkrug1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, synthesized serotonin from tryptophan has important functions in both the nervous system and other tissues, and is also involved in behaviors such as egg laying, pharyngeal pumping, male mating, and experience-dependent regulation of locomotion <xref rid="pone.0063283-Hare1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. From microarray data, we found that several genes within the tryptophan metabolism pathway were up-regulated (with positive fold change). This was the case of the tyrosine decarboxylase (<italic>tdc-1</italic>), which is required for octopamine synthesis from tyramine, a putative neurotransmitter necessary to coordinate locomotion in <italic>C. elegans</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0063283-Alkema1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. In addition, the L-amino acid/L-histidine decarboxylase (C05D2.3) was positively regulated within the tryptophan metabolic pathway, probably leading to serotonin synthesis. Finally, other hypothetical proteins showed positive regulation within this pathway, and were enzymes involved in the synthesis of acetyl-coA, substrate of glycolysis (2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (T22B11.5); acetyl-coA acetyltransferase (T02G5.4); hydroxyacyl-coA dehydrogenase, (T08B2.7). These proteins are also involved in the regulation of adiposity in <italic>C. elegans</italic>

Genetic studies have previously indicated that protein homeostasis is a major factor affecting longevity <xref rid="pone.0063283-Alavez1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. The interruption of this homeostasis can result in protein misfolding and in the accumulation of insoluble protein fibrils and aggregates, such as amyloids. Thus, the search for compounds or molecules that maintain protein homeostasis could have a beneficial effect against ageing and age-related diseases. Our results clearly indicate the effect of 13L peptide on proteosomal functions; therefore, it could be contributing to protein homeostasis in the nematode. In addition, some studies have provided evidence that proteosome could contribute directly to AD by modulating presenilins and, therefore, maturation of &#946;-amyloid precursor <xref rid="pone.0063283-Checler1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Other authors have demonstrated the proteosome regulatory function of AIP-1 and its effect on A&#946;-accumulation and A&#946;-paralysis reduction <xref rid="pone.0063283-Hassan1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. We found various genes within the up-regulated proteosome pathway encoding proteasome regulatory particles after 13L peptide ingestion. One group comprised <italic>RPN</italic> genes, which encode a non-ATPase subunit of the 26S proteasome 19S regulatory particles (RP) base subcomplex and are involved in unfolding and recognition of protein substrates and/or recycling ubiquitin moieties during protein degradation. The other regulatory genes were <italic>RPT</italic> genes, which are believed to be involved in unfolding protein substrates and translocating them into the core proteolytic particle (CP) of the proteasome. Therefore, this could indicate that 13L peptide-fed nematodes have a cellular response to regulate proteosomal functions, enhancing protein degradation and protein turnover.</p><p>In summary, a new bioactive peptide (13L) with antioxidant activity and beneficial properties against AD has been described in this study. This peptide was obtained from a cocoa by-product, but has also been identified in different commercial chocolate samples (data not shown). Our results suggest a mechanism based on the activity of 13L peptide at different levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063283-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Firstly, the ability of 13L peptide to inhibit PEP activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, which is described as a putative &#947;-secretase <xref rid="pone.0063283-Barelli1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> and which has a <italic>C. elegans</italic> homolog <xref rid="pone.0063283-Hornsten1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>; secondly, the <italic>in vivo</italic> effect of 13L peptide on A&#946;-aggregation inhibition and thirdly, A&#946;-toxicity reduction through antioxidant activity and modulation of synaptic and proteosomal functions.</p><fig id="pone-0063283-g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0063283.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Proposed model for 13L peptide mechanism.</title><p>Our working hypothesis is that 13L peptide could act through repression of the main events present in AD: oxidative stress, neuronal dysfunction and inflammation. Our study shows that 13L peptide mechanisms reducing A&#946; toxicity are a combined effect of PEP inhibition activity, antioxidant properties and ability to inhibit A&#946;-aggregation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0063283.g006"/></fig><p>Therefore, this study provides evidence for the potential therapeutic use of 13L peptide in the prevention of aging-related diseases. Further studies with murine models and human trials will be essential in order to validate the effectiveness of this peptide.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0063283.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Effect of 13L peptide on A&#946; accumulation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> CL4176.
