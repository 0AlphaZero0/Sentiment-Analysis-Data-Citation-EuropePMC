</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Cocoa is the unprocessed bean from the plant Theobroma cacao. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>It originated in the rain forests of the Americas and was introduced to Europe in the 16th century. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Historically, cocoa beans have had many uses ranging from medication to currency [1]; however, the concept that cocoa or chocolate has health benefits was not accepted throughout much of Europe until the 20th century [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>To date, numerous studies have shown that cocoa and cocoa-based products contain many different substances with beneficial effects on human health [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Cocoa polyphenols (mainly catechin, epicatechin and procyanidins) are the major antioxidant source in the cocoa bean as they are present in high concentrations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Cocoa flavonoids are known to display antioxidant effects through the scavenging of reactive oxygen species, Fe2+ and Cu+ chelating, inhibition of key enzymes, and promoting antioxidant defenses [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there is strong evidence that consumption of polyphenol-rich cocoa products contributes to the prevention of cardiovascular diseases [3], also showing anti-tumoral properties [6] and the ability to prevent diabetes development [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Recently, the literature [7] has described that compounds present in cocoa powder and chocolate exert several beneficial effects on the brain, improving cognition in animals and humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Hence, the health-promoting properties of cocoa powder have mainly been attributed to their polyphenolic compounds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>However, during bean processing to produce cocoa powder, polyphenol concentration can be affected by processes like fermentation or roasting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Therefore, identification of other natural sources with antioxidative properties other than polyphenols could be an interesting aim of nutrition research. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Dietary proteins are one of the most promising bioactive compounds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Various studies have reported on the antioxidant properties of hydrolysates or bioactive peptides from plant or animal sources (for a review see [8]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>These include peptides from fish processing products [9], which have been found to retard lipid peroxidation; and proteins from milk casein, bovine serum albumine, ovalbumine, soybean, oilseed proteins, wheat gliadin and maize zein, which exert antioxidative activities against the peroxidation of lipids and fatty acids [10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The protein content of cocoa seed is 10–15% of the dry weight, with an amino acid profile rich in lysine, arginine, serine, proline, alanine, leucine, valine, phenylalanine, and methionine [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>However, there is not much information concerning the potential beneficial properties of cocoa peptides [6] and hence to study their impact on the prevention or treatment of age-related diseases is of great interest. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized pathologically by senile plaques, where the major constituent is the amyloid beta peptide (Aβ), a 39–43 amino acid peptide derived from proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of senile dementia, whose etiology is still under discussion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have suggested a prion-like mechanism of disease transmission through propagation of protein misfolding in animal brains [13]; however, the mechanism responsible for the initiation of Aβ accumulation is controversial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>In spite of this, there is wide acceptance of the “amyloid cascade hypothesis” [14], which states that Aβ accumulation triggers downstream neurotoxic events, leading to neuronal dysfunction and death. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The strongest evidence supporting this hypothesis is based on the identification of mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene or two presenilin genes (PS1 and PS2) in familial cases of AD, which result in increased Aβ production [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Evidence for involvement of free radicals in AD include the presence of elevated levels of protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation products and oxidative damage to mitochondria due to the ability of Aβ peptide to act as a pro-oxidant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>This knowledge indicates that the oxidation process clearly unleashes Alzheimer's disease [16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>In this context, many different in vivo models have been used to study the mechanism of Aβ toxicity and determine effective therapeutic strategies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>More recently, different transgenic strains of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have been used as model for neurodegenerative diseases, including AD [17], [18], [19], [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The worm was genetically engineered to carry the human gene for Aβ42 [21], [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>The resulting transgenic strain CL4176 develops a concomitant progressive paralysis phenotype, being a well-suited model for correlating Aβ expression and toxicity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>In the present study, a high protein cocoa by-product, namely “Barquillo”, obtained from the cocoa butter extraction process, was used to purify bioactive peptides with antioxidant activity and functional properties against β-amyloid peptide toxicity related to AD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>The aforementioned bioactive peptides were evaluated using in vitro assays (inhibition of prolyl endopeptidase enzyme) and in vivo experiments with the model organism C. elegans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>As a result of these assays, a promising 13-amino acid peptide was isolated, which was then used in a transcriptomic analysis in the nematode to determine the pathways it affected. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>This pathway is considered the output of glycolysis and the metabolic intersection of different pathways (such as propanoate metabolism, butanoate metabolism, leucine and lysine biosynthesis and citrate cycle). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>In this metabolic pathway, pyruvate is decarboxylated by pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) to produce acetyl-coA, which is the key substance for ATP synthesis (through citrate cycle) and synthesis of acetylcholine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, previous reports have shown that PDH inactivation results in acetylcholine reduction in cholinergic neurons, and therefore, neuronal death as a consequence of energy production failure [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Also, PDH reduction is related with glycolysis reduction and mitochondrial dysfunction, which are described to be present in AD [39], [40], [41], [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>The microarray results indicated an up-regulation of pyruvate metabolism (and other related-pathways such as propanoate and butanoate metabolism), which could lead to an increase in acetyl-CoA production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that up-regulation of pyruvate metabolism as the central pathway could also up-regulate related metabolic pathways, leading to increased carbohydrate metabolism, including glucose. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we determined citrate-cycle up-regulation after nematodes ingested 13L peptide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>In the human brain, reduced activity of some tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) enzymes has been described in AD patients [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Taking into account that the major portion of glucose flux takes place through the TCA cycle [41], our results would indicate that 13L peptide could enhance the glucose metabolism to ensure ATP demands for neuronal cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Worm culture supplementation with 13L peptide also up-regulated tryptophan metabolism in the nematodes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>Tryptophan is an essential amino acid for humans with two metabolic pathways: the methoxyindole pathway, which leads to formation of serotonin (5-HT) and melatonin, and the kynurenine pathway, which is involved in the cleavage of the indol ring of tryptophan to produce kynurenine [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>In C. elegans, synthesized serotonin from tryptophan has important functions in both the nervous system and other tissues, and is also involved in behaviors such as egg laying, pharyngeal pumping, male mating, and experience-dependent regulation of locomotion [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>From microarray data, we found that several genes within the tryptophan metabolism pathway were up-regulated (with positive fold change). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>This was the case of the tyrosine decarboxylase (tdc-1), which is required for octopamine synthesis from tyramine, a putative neurotransmitter necessary to coordinate locomotion in C. elegans [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>In addition, the L-amino acid/L-histidine decarboxylase (C05D2.3) was positively regulated within the tryptophan metabolic pathway, probably leading to serotonin synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Finally, other hypothetical proteins showed positive regulation within this pathway, and were enzymes involved in the synthesis of acetyl-coA, substrate of glycolysis (2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (T22B11.5); acetyl-coA acetyltransferase (T02G5.4); hydroxyacyl-coA dehydrogenase, (T08B2.7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>These proteins are also involved in the regulation of adiposity in C. elegans [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the tryptophan metabolism pathway was confirmed to be a molecular target of 13L peptide by means of experiments with the C. elegans mutant strain for the tryptophan hydroxylase TPH-1, which is essential for serotonin biosynthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Animals bearing a TPH-1 deletion mutation do not synthesize serotonin and tph-1 mutants display abnormalities in behavior and metabolism, such as large amounts of stored fat [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Our study showed that 13L peptide produced significant body fat reduction in the wild-type strain of C. elegans (N2) (Figure 5A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>However, this phenotype was not observed in the tph-1 mutant strain (Figure 5B), suggesting that tryptophan metabolism is a mechanism of 13L peptide function. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Proteasome is a large protein complex whose function is to degrade ubiquitinated proteins by an ATP-dependent mechanism [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Genetic studies have previously indicated that protein homeostasis is a major factor affecting longevity [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>The interruption of this homeostasis can result in protein misfolding and in the accumulation of insoluble protein fibrils and aggregates, such as amyloids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>Thus, the search for compounds or molecules that maintain protein homeostasis could have a beneficial effect against ageing and age-related diseases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Our results clearly indicate the effect of 13L peptide on proteosomal functions; therefore, it could be contributing to protein homeostasis in the nematode. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>In addition, some studies have provided evidence that proteosome could contribute directly to AD by modulating presenilins and, therefore, maturation of β-amyloid precursor [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>Other authors have demonstrated the proteosome regulatory function of AIP-1 and its effect on Aβ-accumulation and Aβ-paralysis reduction [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>We found various genes within the up-regulated proteosome pathway encoding proteasome regulatory particles after 13L peptide ingestion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>One group comprised RPN genes, which encode a non-ATPase subunit of the 26S proteasome 19S regulatory particles (RP) base subcomplex and are involved in unfolding and recognition of protein substrates and/or recycling ubiquitin moieties during protein degradation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>The other regulatory genes were RPT genes, which are believed to be involved in unfolding protein substrates and translocating them into the core proteolytic particle (CP) of the proteasome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this could indicate that 13L peptide-fed nematodes have a cellular response to regulate proteosomal functions, enhancing protein degradation and protein turnover. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>In summary, a new bioactive peptide (13L) with antioxidant activity and beneficial properties against AD has been described in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>This peptide was obtained from a cocoa by-product, but has also been identified in different commercial chocolate samples (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest a mechanism based on the activity of 13L peptide at different levels (Figure 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>Firstly, the ability of 13L peptide to inhibit PEP activity in vitro, which is described as a putative γ-secretase [52] and which has a C. elegans homolog [53]; secondly, the in vivo effect of 13L peptide on Aβ-aggregation inhibition and thirdly, Aβ-toxicity reduction through antioxidant activity and modulation of synaptic and proteosomal functions. </plain></SENT>
