<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Here, we have combined protein modeling with evolutionary analysis in order to study the evolution and structure of chemosensory proteins (CSPs) within arthropods and, more specifically, in ants by using the data available from sequenced genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ants and other social insects are especially interesting model systems for the study of chemosensation, as they communicate in a highly complex social context and much of their communication relies on chemicals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our ant protein models show how this complexity has shaped CSP evolution; the proteins are highly modifiable by their size, surface charge and binding pocket. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, we divide ant CSPs into three groups: typical insect CSPs, an ancient 5-helical CSP and hymenopteran CSPs with a small binding pocket, and suggest that these groups likely serve different functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The hymenopteran CSPs have duplicated repeatedly in individual ant lineages. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our phylogenetic analysis shows that within the Arthropoda the only highly conserved gene is the ancient 5-helical CSP, which is likely involved in an essential ubiquitous function rather than chemosensation. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Chemical communication is crucial for insects, as their perception of the world is dominated by odors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Most of their behavior from courtship and mating to locating resources such as food and a suitable habitat are dependent on chemical senses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Insect chemosensory systems have been studied using several approaches, and information on specific genes, neurological processes and biochemical properties of the chemosensory systems is constantly growing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>From an evolutionary point of view, chemosensory systems are interesting because of their potential role in adaptation and speciation [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of insect chemosensation also has practical importance through potential applications for pest control. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The reception of chemical messages in insects starts when specific carrier proteins, such as the odorant binding proteins (OBP) or chemosensory proteins (CSP), bind and solubilize odorants and pheromones and transport them through the aqueous hemolymph [2],[3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The chemical messages carried by the OBPs and CSPs are decoded when odorant receptors (OR), or in some cases gustatory receptors (GR), selectively bind the chemicals [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>All chemosensory genes (OBP, CSP, OR and GR) can form large gene families, each containing from a few to several hundreds of genes, depending on species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Chemosensory gene families have been intensively studied in the context of gene family dynamics and they usually show birth-and-death evolution with purifying selection being the main force [5], [6], [7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Here, we concentrate on CSPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>CSPs are small globular proteins with a hydrophobic binding pocket and usually containing six Î±-helices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The CSP gene family varies in size across arthropods; the tick Ixodes scapularis has one CSP gene, Drosophila melanogaster has four, and the largest known repertoires are found in the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (19 genes), the silkworm Bombyx mori (22 genes) and the fire ant Solenopsis invicta (21 genes) [8], [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Even though the number of CSP genes can be similar in two species, few of them form orthologous pairs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Instead, a large proportion of these genes are specific to certain taxonomic lineages, having duplicated independently in each lineage and evolved functions specific to that lineage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>While several studies have investigated the evolutionary forces driving the evolution of these chemosensory gene families, relatively little is known about the precise function of specific genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Most functional information comes from expression studies and some structural studies characterizing the binding properties of CSPs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>While some CSPs bind and transmit chemical messages, others are involved in processes such as development [10] and possibly immune responses [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Generally, insect CSPs are highly expressed in the sensillar lymph and, in vitro, capable of binding different components of pheromonal blends [12], but not all CSPs are restricted to chemosensory organs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The honey bee, Apis mellifera, the closest studied relative of ants, expresses its CSPs in diverse tissues throughout development [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Four of the A. mellifera CSPs have been studied in detail, and shown to exhibit different binding spectra. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>AmelCSP3 possibly binds the brood pheromone, which stimulates the workers to take care of the larvae [14], whereas AmelCSP5 has been shown to play a role in development having a maternal-zygotic expression pattern and being involved in integument formation [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Several species among Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera have CSPs with antenna-rich expression suggesting chemosensory function [e.g. [15], [16], [17],[18]] and in ants one CSP plays a role in nestmate recognition [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Chemosensory functions have also been implicated in Locusta migratoria, where several CSPs show antenna-rich expression and some are involved in the behavioral shift from gregarization to solitarization [19], and in tsetse fly Glossina morsitans morsitans, where the expression of CSPs suggests their role in host searching behavior [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Summarizing, the CSP proteins perform tasks ranging from ontogeny to colony level regulation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Ants are a model system to study chemical communication as their communication takes place in a highly complex social context, in which chemicals are used for example to maintain colony cohesion and direct altruistic behavior towards nestmates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The currently available ant genomes (seven species from four ant subfamilies) share seven CSP genes descended from an ancestral genome, forming seven orthologous groups of genes (CSP1-7; [8]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Purifying selection has dominated the evolution of these shared genes, and genes orthologous to some of these seven groups can be found in the honey bee [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Of the seven shared ant orthologs, the CSP7 protein is involved in binding nestmate recognition cues in Camponotus japonicus [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the CSP gene family has expanded repeatedly in individual ant lineages, and the expanded copies appear to have descended from the CSP7 gene [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>These ant-specific expansions show signs of positive selection, suggesting that they have an adaptive role [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, they have a fast turnover rate with many gene gain and loss events, and their sequence evolution is characterized by a high dN/dS ratio [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The fact that these rapidly evolving ant-specific expansions have originated from the nestmate recognition cue binder CSP7 suggests that the expansions in ants may also have roles related to chemical communication. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Structural biology offers powerful tools for interpreting the evolution and diversity of gene families [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>These tools can help to understand, among others, the sites of conservation and functional variation in the protein sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>For example, histones have N- and C-terminal sequence variation that is translated into tail domains of varying size and charge [22], harboring important regulatory modifications [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Another well-studied example is the nuclear receptor protein family, which binds small hydrophobic ligands similar to those of CSPs, inside a bundle of Î±-helices [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Changes in this binding pocket are critical to the evolution of nuclear receptors; some of them bind a wide range of ligands, while others are more selective depending on their pocket size and shape [24], [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>In the case of insect CSPs, structural data is available e.g. for two different CSPs of the moth Mamestra brassicae [26], [27] and one desert locust CSP [28], but no comparative structural studies exist. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we use comparative protein modeling to characterize the diversity of ant CSPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>We identify variation and conservation in CSP size, charge and structural changes in the binding pocket, as these characteristics can provide the keys to understand the functional diversity of CSPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>CSPs interact both with their ligands and ORs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>As the protein surface is the area that first interacts with ligands and receptors, changes in the size and the surface charge could mediate interactions between the CSP and its ligand or OR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Changes in the binding pocket could reflect the ligands the CSPs can accommodate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>We also assess whether structural information supports the hypothesis that the expansion of the CSP gene family in ants has led to specialization in tasks related to chemical communication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>In that case, the proteins coded by the expanded portion of the CSP family should be more similar to CSPs known to function in chemosensation than to those that function in other tasks, such as development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Previously, we identified sites under positive selection in ant CSPs [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Here we map these sites to the protein to infer which parts and properties of the protein have been under positive selection during the expansion of the CSP genes within ants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>This will help to relate positive selection to the structural and functional features of the proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Finally, we use a large-scale phylogeny combined with the modeled protein structures to infer how structurally different CSPs are distributed within the arthropods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>This wider phylogenetic context allowed us to explore how the CSP gene family has evolved within a time frame of 700 My. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>CSP5 is the least similar (19% identity) of the orthologs, thus, an alternative sequence-based method was used to test the reliability of the model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>The sequence-based secondary structure prediction also indicated CSP5 to be a 5-helical protein and located the helices and connective loops almost identically with the model (Dataset S1), supporting the general protein architecture of CSP5 in our model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>The quality of the modeled protein structures was further investigated with Ramachandran assessment [30], which was excellent (&gt;95% of residues in favored region and &lt;1% in the outlier region) for CSP1-2, CSP4 and CSP5-6, good for CSP3 (91.5% and 4.7%, respectively) and lower for CSP7 (89.7% of the residues in the favored region and 5.2% outliers). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Ant CSP6, CSP7 and the ant-specific CSP expansion have generally larger ligand-binding residues than ant CSP1-5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Many of these amino acid residues become completely buried in the binding pocket with no surface access upon ligand binding based on MbraCSPA6 structure [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>The large binding-residues could result in these CSPs binding smaller and/or less branched ligands or smaller amounts of ligand than CSP1-5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, these CSPs (except CSP6) have a C-terminal truncation, which might provide better access for some ligands to the inner cavity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>CSPs similar to ant CSP7 seem to be Hymenoptera specific on the basis of our CSP phylogeny (Figure 4.). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>In Camponotus japonicus, CSP7 binds the cuticular hydrocarbons used in nestmate recognition and is the major protein expressed in the antennae [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Proteins orthologous or similar to the C. japonicus protein are also expressed in the antennae in L. humile (LhumCSP7) [17], A. mellifera (AmelCSP1) [13] and P. dominulus (PdomCSP1) [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the A. mellifera CSP1 and the P. dominulus CSP1 have similar binding preferences [14], [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>AmelCSP1 binding preference for straight chain primary alcohols and esters clearly decreases when the compound size exceeds 14 carbon atoms [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Also, PdomCSP1 seems to prefer alcohols and amides with carbon chain length 14â16 [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Because of similar expression and structural conservation of these proteins, we suggest that CSP7 binds similar substances, including cuticular hydrocarbons, in Hymenoptera. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>The ant-specific CSP expansion has been derived from CSP7 type of ancestor and may share these functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>This is supported by the fact that all the modeled proteins within the ant-specific expansion have partially retained the surface charge and the binding pocket size changing mutations of the ant CSP7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the ant-specific duplicates appear to keep one location of charge; this is the so called crown, which is also found in CSP7. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Summarizing, ant CSP6-7 and CSPs within the ant-specific expansion clearly differ from other modeled ant CSPs and their structural conservation suggests they could bind similar ligands, including cuticular hydrocarbons among others. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>In addition to their role in nestmate recognition, ants use cuticular hydrocarbons as an information source to distinguish workers that perform different tasks [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, they are used to indicate fertility and dominance status [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Thus the expansion and diversification of ant CSPs could reflect the variety of information content in cuticular hydrocarbons and their importance in ant chemical communication. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>We inspected more closely one branch of ant-specific duplicates, the largest S. invicta specific expansion (Figure 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>This expansion was shown to evolve fast and putatively under positive selection (dN/dSâ=â1.2 as estimated in [8]) and to contain a possible nestmate cue binder of S. invicta [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>These S. invicta CSPs share similarities with CSP6, CSP7 and duplicates in other ant species in that they all have mostly large binding-residues of varying charge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>The S. invicta CSPs also appear to have clear signatures of their own; these proteins have fully lost the last helix and have increased surface hydrophobicity and in this respect resemble the conserved CSP5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>The charge of S. invicta CSPs is highly variable and does not obey the charged crown pattern of other CSPs in the ant-specific expansion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>Presumably, these S. invicta CSP duplicates have adapted for individual ligand and/or receptor-binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>This is supported by the work of GonzÃ¡lez et al. [16], who show that one of these proteins, the putative nestmate cue binder, does not bind cuticular hydrocarbons, but instead binds polar cuticular lipids such as fatty acids and esters. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>The earlier analyses indicated that CSPs within the ant-specific expansion have evolved under positive selection [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>Two of the positively selected sites are among the binding-residues, but all the remaining positively selected sites are surface residues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that natural selection has favored the diversification of the surface residues rather than changes in the binding pocket. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>This is in contrast to proteins that function in similar tasks as CSPs, namely the OBPs, where positive selection was suggested to predominantly act on binding residues [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>The surface sites in CSPs have extensive variation in charge, which is significantly higher than the overall charge variation of the surface, further suggesting positive selection is driving surface charge changes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>The extensive variation in surface charge in the ant CSP family seems therefore to be an adaptation associated with the function of CSPs in a similar way as suggested, for example, in the case of Pgi duplication in teleost fishes [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>In that case, different Pgi copies are expressed tissue specifically, and have evolved differing surface charges through weak positive selection on several amino acid sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Similar findings have also been made in other duplicated genes [38]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>Another chemosensory gene family, the OR family, has expanded to include hundreds of copies in ants [39], [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>Generally, it has been thought that different ORs bind different odors and this is the first discriminatory step in olfaction [4], while CSPs and OBPs act as general carriers with wide binding spectra. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>Now, growing evidence shows that some CSPs and OBPs can bind selectively [14], [41], with drastic conformational changes taking place upon ligand binding [26], [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>Campancci et al. [26] hypothesized that conformational changes in CSPs, depending on which ligand has been bound, could direct the CSP to different ORs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>Taking this into account, we suggest that the positively selected sites on the surface and the resulting charge variation of CSPs could either affect the specificity of the CSP to a certain ligand or mediate interaction between the CSP and specific ORs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, surface charge variation might be linked to the cellular environment where the CSP is expressed, as in the case of Pgi in teleost fishes [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>The role of the conserved charged crown suggests it is important for the ant-specific CSPs and could also be important in OR binding or ligand recognition. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>Our ant examples show that CSP proteins have extensive size, charge and binding pocket variation that can presumably be linked to their interaction with ORs or ligands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>The group of CSPs that have expanded in ants are likely involved in chemosensation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, positive selection in these ant-specific duplicates has driven changes in the surface charge of these proteins, further suggesting adaptive significance of surface charge in CSPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>Both modeling and phylogenetics highlighted a group of unique CSPs, whose conserved, ancient 5-helical structure is distinct from other CSPs and likely involved in functions other than chemosensation. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>To study the structural variation in CSPs, we built homology models of several ant CSPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>As modeling is based on an accurate multiple sequence alignment, we built a multi-taxa alignment using MAFFT [43] using the G-INS-i method. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>In addition to template and modeled amino acid sequences we included all the CSPs from the seven ant species (Camponotus floridanus (Cflo), Harpegnathos saltator (Hsal), Solenopsis invicta (Sinv), Linepithema humile (Lhum), Pogonomyrmex barbatus (Pbar), Acromyrmex echinatior (Aech) and Atta cephalotes (Acep)) and several other insect taxa; Apis mellifera, Bombyx mori, Tribolium castaneum, Anopheles gambiae, Drosophila melanogaster, Acyrthosiphon pisum, Pediculus humanus, Daphnia pulex and Ixodes scapularis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>In addition to these we used hymenopteran sequences from [33], [44] and Lepidopteran sequences from [45] as well as CSPs from Plutella xylostella, Amyelois transitella and Megoura viciae (Dataset S2.). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>We used the same alignment to produce a CSP arthropod phylogeny with 1000 bootstrap replicates using maximum likelihood in RAxML [46], [47]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>As a modeling template we used the non-ligand bound structure MbraCSPA6 (PDB-ID:1KX9) from M. brassicae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>With the exception of the last helix, CSPs contain ultraconserved residues evenly spread (approximately every fifth residue apart) in the sequence, for example, (PbarCSP1 numbering) Y25, D30, I37, R42, Y47, D53, D60, K65, A71, Q83, I90, L94, W102 and Y109 (see Dataset S2 for sequence alignment). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>Notably, all CSPs have four cysteine residues spread out in the sequence that build two cysteine bridges. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>These cysteine bridges, the evenly spread conserved residues, the lack of long insertions or deletions and the sequence based secondary structure predictions (see Dataset S1) suggest that the tertiary structure is likely highly similar in most CSPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>Thus, CSPs make reliable modeling targets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>We chose representative sequences for modeling in the seven ant species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>The sequences for modeling were chosen based on a minimal number of insertions or deletions compared to the template sequence and minimal sequence variation within the group of CSPs to be modeled. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>The modeled proteins of the conserved orthologous ant CSP genes were: CSP1-CSP6 of P. barbatus and CSP7 of A. echinatior. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>The identity scores between the modeled CSPs and the template were calculated in ClustalW [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>Additional amino acid sequence-based secondary structure prediction was performed in the case of the two CSPs that had sequence identity below 20% (PbarCSP5 and SinvCSP15) using the software PSIPRED [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>This approach does not rely on any existing structure, but is based on sequences that are associated with secondary structures (helices, Î²-sheets and coils). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>Thus, the prediction offers a way to estimate the reliability of a model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>We compared the protein models of orthologous ant CSPs to infer structural differences and similarities between them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>We also studied the extent of variation of each CSP between ant species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>In order to compare the orthologous ant CSPs to the CSPs in the ant-specific expansion, we modeled a subset of proteins from the ant-specific expansion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>One protein from each ant species was chosen from different parts of the gene phylogeny in order to cover variation within the ant-specific expansion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>The modeled proteins were HsalCSP8, AcepCSP8, CfloCSP11, LhumCSP10, PbarCSP10 and AechCSP14 and seven proteins in a S. invicta specific expansion (SinvCSP13, Sinv15-17, Sinv19-21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>Modeling was done with homology modeling software Bodil [49] that enables rapid model construction based on a homologous template structure when the number of insertions and deletions is low (as in the case of CSPs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>This program uses the peptide backbone of the template structure to create a model, adjusts the backbone torsion angles, and adds the amino acid side chains based on torsion angles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>An alignment of the template structure and all the modeled ant CSPs (total 20) is in Dataset S3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>Program RAMPAGE [30] was used to validate the peptide backbone chemistry, i.e., for Ramachandran assessment, which indicates the percentage of the model amino acids having chemically favored dihedral angle values. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>Generally, &gt;90% of the amino acid residues should be at the favored region in the Ramachandran assessment for a reliable model [50]. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>To compare the binding pockets, we defined the amino acid residues that are likely to interact with the ligands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>We defined as ligand-binding residues those 34 residues that were at atomic interaction distance (5 Ã) from the three bromo-dodecanol molecules in the ligand-bound M. brassicae CSPA6 structure (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
