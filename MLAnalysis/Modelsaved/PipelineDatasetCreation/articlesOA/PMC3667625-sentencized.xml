</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In metazoa, diverse stress signals converge at a single phosphorylation event at serine 51 of a common effector, the translation initiation factor eIF2Î±. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>This step is carried out by four eIF2Î± kinases in mammalian cells: PERK, which responds to an accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), GCN2 to amino acid starvation and UV light, PKR to viral infection, and HRI to heme deficiency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>This collection of signaling pathways has been termed the âintegrated stress responseâ (ISR), as they converge on the same molecular event. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>eIF2Î± phosphorylation results in an attenuation of translation with consequences that allow cells to cope with the varied stresses (Wek et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>eIF2 (which is comprised of three subunits, Î±, Î² and Î³) binds GTP and the initiator Met-tRNA to form the ternary complex (eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAi), which, in turn, associates with the 40S ribosomal subunit forming the 43S pre-initiation complex (PIC) that scans the 5â²UTR of mRNAs to select the initiating AUG codon. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Upon phosphorylation of its Î±-subunit, eIF2 becomes a competitive inhibitor of its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), eIF2B (Hinnebusch and Lorsch, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The tight and non-productive binding of phosphorylated eIF2 to eIF2B prevents loading of the eIF2 complex with GTP thus blocking ternary complex formation and reducing translation initiation (Krishnamoorthy et al., 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Because eIF2B is less abundant than eIF2, phosphorylation of only a small fraction of the total eIF2 has a dramatic impact on eIF2B activity in cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Paradoxically, under conditions of reduced protein synthesis, a small group of mRNAs that contain upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in their 5â²UTR are translationally up-regulated (Hinnebusch, 2005; Jackson et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>These include mammalian ATF4 (a cAMP element binding [CREB] transcription factor) and CHOP (a pro-apoptotic transcription factor) (Harding et al., 2000; Vattem and Wek, 2004; Palam et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>ATF4 regulates the expression of many genes involved in metabolism and nutrient uptake and additional transcription factors, such as CHOP, which is under both translational and transcriptional control (Ma et al., 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of eIF2Î± thus leads to preferential translation of key regulatory molecules and directs diverse changes in the transcriptome of cells upon cellular stress. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>One of the eIF2Î± kinases, PERK, lies at the intersection of the ISR and the unfolded protein response (UPR) that maintains homeostasis of protein folding in the ER (Pavitt and Ron, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The UPR is activated by unfolded or misfolded proteins that accumulate in the ER lumen because of an imbalance between protein folding load and protein folding capacity, a condition known as âER stressâ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In mammals, the UPR is comprised of three signaling branches mediated by ER-localized transmembrane sensors, PERK, IRE1, and ATF6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>These sensor proteins detect the accumulation of unfolded protein in the ER and transmit the information across the ER membrane, initiating unique signaling pathways that converge in the activation of an extensive transcriptional response, which ultimately results in ER expansion (Ron and Walter, 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The lumenal stress-sensing domains of PERK and IRE1 are homologous and likely activated in analogous ways by direct binding to unfolded peptides (Gardner and Walter, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>This binding event leads to oligomerization and trans-autophosphorylation of their cytosolic kinase domains, and, for PERK, phosphorylation of its only known substrate, eIF2Î±. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>In this way, PERK activation results in a quick reduction in the load of newly synthesized proteins that are translocated into the ER-lumen (Harding et al., 2000). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Upon ER stress, both the transcription factor XBP1s, produced as the consequence of a non-conventional mRNA splicing reaction initiated by IRE1, and the transcription factor ATF6, produced by proteolysis and release from the ER membrane, collaborate with ATF4 to induce the vast UPR transcriptional response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Transcriptional targets of the UPR include the ER protein folding machinery, the ER-associated degradation machinery, and many other components functioning in the secretory pathway (Walter and Ron, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Although the UPR initially mitigates ER stress and as such confers cytoprotection, persistent and severe ER stress leads to activation of apoptosis that eliminates damaged cells (Shore et al., 2011; Tabas and Ron, 2011). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>By interrogating a large chemical library for small molecules that block PERK signaling, we identified ISRIB as a potent ISR inhibitor, functioning downstream of all eIF2Î± kinases. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>To identify inhibitors of PERK signaling, we engineered a reporter that allows monitoring of PERK activation in living cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>To this end, we constructed a retroviral vector containing the open-reading frame of firefly luciferase fused to the 5â²UTR of ATF4 mRNA (Figure 1A), which contains two short open-reading frames (uORFs) that control ATF4 translation in a stress-dependent manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>After infection, we established a HEK293T cell line harboring the stably integrated reporter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>We used thapsigargin, a potent ER stressor that inhibits the ER calcium pump, to activate PERK and induce eIF2Î± phosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Thapsigargin treatment resulted in a 4.9-fold induction in luciferase activity in a 384 well format with a Z factor of 0.5 (Figure 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>This format was used to screen 106,281 compounds covering a wide chemical space. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>We identified 460 hits (0.43%) (Figure 1C), which were further validated in an 8-point dose-response assay using the same reporter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>We further triaged the compounds by discarding inhibitors that also affected the IRE1 branch of the UPR using a luciferase-based XBP1 splicing reporter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Less than half (187 hits) of our initial hits proved unique to the PERK branch. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>We next used an orthogonal secondary screen that employed a different reporter (bi-cistronic ATF4-dGFP-IRES-mCherry) stably integrated into a different cell line (U2OS cells). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>The read-out of this latter screen was microscopy-based, which allowed us to simultaneously assess acute toxicity by cell counting, further reducing the number of viable hits to 77 (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>As a tertiary screen, we tested compounds for their ability to inhibit ER stress-elicited induction of endogenous ATF4 by Western blot analysis. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Based on previous insights on how cells can become resistant to eIF2Î± phosphorylation, we consider two likely scenarios by which ISRIB could act:First, ISRIB could weaken the effects of the non-productive interaction of phospho-eIF2Î± with eIF2B, thereby increasing the available eIF2Î±-GEF activity in the cell, restoring the concentration of ternary complex that can engage in translation initiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>Precedence for this possibility derives from genetic studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where the molecular mechanism of regulation by eIF2Î± phosphorylation was first discovered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>As in mammalian cells, amino acid starvation in yeast leads to GCN2 activation and eIF2Î± phosphorylation, resulting in overall translational down-regulation and translational induction of a transcriptional activator, GCN4, mediated by uORFs in the 5â²UTR of its mRNA (Hinnebusch, 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>eIF2B is a conserved protein complex comprised of five different subunits, two of which form the catalytic core, and the remaining three have regulatory roles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Mutations in different eIF2B subunits can elicit a phospho-eIF2Î± resistant phenotype (Vazquez de Aldana and Hinnebusch, 1994; Pavitt et al., 1997, 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>These mutations have been proposed to act either by weakening the interaction of phospho-eIF2Î± with eIF2B, reducing its ability to outcompete non-phosphorylated eIF2 for binding, or by allowing binding of phospho-eIF2Î± to the mutant eIF2B in a manner that is conducive to nucleotide exchange. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>ISRIB could be altering the affinity of phospho-eIF2Î± for eIF2B or overcoming the nonproductive interaction that blocks GTP loading, mimicking the effect of these mutations.Second, ISRIB could increase the activity of eIF2B, so that the residual amount not engaged with phospho-eIF2Î± is sufficient to sustain normal levels of ternary complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Precedence for this possibility derives from studies in macrophages, where engagement of toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 results in activation of the catalytic activity of eIF2B (Woo et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>This activation results from engagement of the TLR-signaling pathway that induces a phosphatase removing a constitutively present inhibitory phosphate from the eIF2B Îµ-subunit (S539). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>When faced with ER stress, PERK-mediated translational attenuation contributes to adaptation by reducing the load of newly synthesized proteins that are translocated into the ER (Harding et al., 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>In addition, induction of the transcription regulator ATF4 upregulates many genes that increase the protein folding capacity in the ER. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Both of these activities serve to reestablish homeostasis, balancing the protein folding load and protein folding capacity in the ER lumen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>This reasoning is supported by the increased sensitivity to ER stress exhibited by MEFs that lack PERK or ATF4, as well as MEFs that carry a non-phosphorylatable knock-in allele of eIF2Î±(S51A) (Harding et al., 2000; Harding et al., 2003; Lu et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>One example is Childhood Ataxia with CNS Hypomyelination (CACH), also known as Vanishing White Matter disease (VWM), which has been mapped to mutations in different subunits of eIF2B (Li and Wang, 2004). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Several lines of genetic evidence in mice suggest that phosphorylation-dependent regulation of eIF2Î± phosphorylation is a critical hub for the control of synaptic plasticity (as assessed by late long-term potentiation [L-LTP] in brain slices) and memory consolidation (as assessed in behavioral tasks in animals). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>In particular, the threshold for induction of L-LTP is reduced and memory consolidation is enhanced in mice lacking GCN2 or PKR and in mice heterozygous for non-phosphorylatable eIF2Î±(S51A), which have reduced levels of eIF2Î± phosphorylation (Costa-Mattioli et al., 2005; Costa-Mattioli et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>As we show here, ISRIB pharmacologically phenocopies these genetic manipulations in behavioral tasks by rendering cells insensitive to eIF2Î± phosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>In agreement, treatment of mice with a PKR inhibitor was reported to enhance memory consolidation, and, conversely, treatment with salubrinal, an inhibitor that prolongs eIF2Î± phosphorylation, to block L-LTP and memory consolidation (Costa-Mattioli et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>eIF2Î± phosphorylation results in a dual effect on gene expression: a global translational diminution and translational upregulation of select mRNA, including ATF4 mRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>Both may be important to explain the observed effects on L-LTP and memory. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>It has long been appreciated that new protein synthesis is required for memory consolidation and that ATF4 represses CREB-mediated transcription of âmemory genesâ (Klann and Dever, 2004; Sutton and Schuman, 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Indeed, this latter function of ATF4 in memory consolidation is evolutionarily conserved from Aplysia to rodents (Yin et al., 1994; Bartsch et al., 1995; Chen et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>Because a small physiological increase in the level of eIF2Î± phosphorylation that does not significantly alter overall translation is sufficient to induce ATF4, production of this transcription factor can be finely tuned in neuronal cells by perhaps selective activation of different eIF2Î± kinases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>The observed effects of ISRIB may therefore result from overcoming effects caused by a relatively small level of regulatory phosphorylation that is distinct from the high level resulting from ER stress-inducing agents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>In light of this reasoning, a therapeutic window may exist in which ISRIBâs effects as memory enhancer can be exploited without encountering long-term toxic consequences. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>ISRIB increases memory consolidation, allowing pharmacological enhancement of the brainâs ability to learn. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>Evolution therefore did not arrive at a maximally optimized process, imposing a brake (via eIF2Î± phosphorylation) on memory consolidation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>This mechanism may underscore the importance of filtering memories before committing them to long-term storage. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the author response typically shows only responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></boxed-text><p><text><SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled âPharmacological brake-release of mRNA translation enhances cognitive memoryâfor consideration at eLife. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Your article has been evaluated by a Senior editor and 4 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our consensus is that the discovery of a small molecule that interposes itself (functionally) between the phosphorylated alpha subunit of translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2Î±) and the target of this phosphorylation event, the translational machinery, thereby inhibiting an ancient signaling pathway known as the integrated stress response, is an important discovery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No one has previously reported a functionally similar inhibitorâin fact, until this report, it was unsuspected that this node in the ISR was even susceptible to inhibition. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The compound is remarkably potent, hitting its unknown target(s) when applied to cells at a submicromolar concentration. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The functional characterization of the compound is rather thorough and thus its utility as a tool compound is well documentedâthis is important, as many other âfirstsâ of this type report on theoretical tool compounds, but fall short of demonstrating in vivo utility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, there is reason to hope that ISRIB will be applied to much further research and that this paper will serve as a foundation for such studies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Lastly, the reviewers were impressed by effects on memory formation, which is enhanced by application of the compound. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Whereas the functional characterisation of ISRIB is very thorough, it is not matched by a similar level of molecular detail. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We do not know if ISRIB directly modulates the interaction of eIF2Î± with eIF2B or the competing interactions with eIF5 or some aspect of eIF2B activityâpossibilities noted by the authors in their Discussion. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The four reviewers were initially divided on the impact of this deficiency on the suitability of the paper for publication in eLife. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The conclusion of our deliberations is that some simple measuresâthat will provide further clues to the site of the compound's actionâneed to be taken before the paper will be acceptable for publication in eLife. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>1) The effect of ISRIB application on the recovery of a complex between eIF2 and eIF2B could be measured directly in lysates of unstressed and stressed cells by co-immunoprecipitation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Chris Proudâs lab has expressed tagged versions of eIF2B subunits that associate with endogenous eIF2 in transfected HEK293 cells (they co-precipitate eIF2Î± and eIF2Î±-P by pulling-down the tagged eIF2B subunit (see Figure 2 in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21560189">PMID: 21560189</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>If a coherent effect is observed (say less eIF2Î±-P associating with tagged eIF2Be in ISRIB-treated stressed cells) the discussion, focusing on that aspect, would be justified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>However, if no effect is observed, the alternative discussion (focusing on a possible enhancement of eIF2Bâs enzymatic activity) would be justified. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>2) Similarly, the impact of ISRIB application on those aspects of the phosphorylation status of eIF2B that can be queried by commercially available phospho-specific antibodies should be measured. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>3) In relation to the compoundâs effects on memory, it was deemed important to assess the likelihood that ISRIB affects memory formation by acting on brain cells, as opposed to eliciting these effects by peripheral action. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Therefore it would seem important to determine if the compound gets into the CNS, when applied at doses that affect memory. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Perhaps it is possible to analyze levels in the CSF of injected animals or address this matter functionally by measuring ISR activity in the CNS of injected animals in a suitable experimental design. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>4) Finally ISRIB treatment was post-training for water maze and cued fear conditioning (in order to focus on effects of ISRIB on memory consolidation), but ISRIB treatment was chronic prior to training for contextual fear conditioning. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have performed the experiment suggested (Chris Proud kindly provided the plasmids encoding the myc-tagged subunits of eIF2B) and we are able to co- immunoprecipitate eIF2Î± after a Ni-NTA pull-down. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, no differences are observed in the amount associated of either the phospho- or total eIF2Î± in the presence or absence of ISRIB. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have not pursued this effort further because we are overexpressing the GEF significantly, and we believe that the absence of effect of ISRIB on the interaction between eIF2B and eIF2 may not necessarily reflect what happens under physiological expression levels. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, we have performed sucrose gradients to reveal changes in the interaction of eIF2 and eIF2B following the endogenous complexes (HEK293T cells) with antibodies against eIF2Î± and eIF2BÎµ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We do not observe significant changes in complex formation (eIF2B-eIF2) upon ER-stress and thus we are not able to test the effect of ISRIB on this interaction. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We are currently developing potent ISRIB analogs that will allow us to cross-link ISRIB to its target. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our strategy is to develop appropriate biochemical assays to unravel the molecular mechanism after identification of its target. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although increasing eIF2B activity or decreasing the interaction of phospho- eIF2Î± with eIF2B are possible modes in which ISRIB could generate a resistant phenotype, there are many other ways in which this molecule could act. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For example ISRIB could modulate the interaction between eIF2 and eIF5, which acts as a GAP and GDI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We believe that the unbiased search for ISRIBâs target will be a more linear path to unravel its mechanism of action than ruling in or out individual possibilities. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>2) Similarly, the impact of ISRIB application on those aspects of the phosphorylation status of eIF2B that can be queried by commercially available phospho-specific antibodies should be measured. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We queried the phosphorylation status of Serine 539 of the eIF2BÎµ subunit and found no differences in the presence or absence of ISRIB. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This site is constitutively phosphorylated by GSK and negative regulates eIF2B activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In macrophages, dephosphorylation of S539 is induced upon pathogen invasion and TLR engagement, leading to increased eIF2B GEF activity inducing a phospho-eIF2Î± resistant phenotype (Woo et al, Nat. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Cell Biol, January 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>ISRIB does not elicit this phenotype by modulating this phosphorylation site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>We added the data to Figure 3âfigure supplement 1 and mentioned this result in the Discussion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge no other phospho-specific antibodies are commercially available for eIF2B putative regulatory phosphorylation sites. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>3) In relation to the compoundâs effects on memory, it was deemed important to assess the likelihood that ISRIB affects memory formation by acting on brain cells, as opposed to eliciting these effects by peripheral action. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>We have confirmed the presence of ISRIB in the brain by mass spectrometry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>We performed a single intraperitonneal injection at 2.5 mg/kg (the dose used in the context-cued fear conditioning experiment) and detect the appearance of ISRIB in the brain with the same dynamics of accumulation that we observed in plasma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>After 24 hr, the time-point at which long-term memory is measured, the concentration of ISRIB in the brain is 30 ng/g of tissue or approximately 60 nM (12-fold higher than its IC50). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>We have included the pharmacokinetic data in Figure 6B. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>We have not been able to look at ISR activity in the brain in the experimental setup that replicates the behavioral tests. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In this scenario, there is no significant result that increases eIF2Î± phosphorylation or ATF4 production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>We postulate that memory depends on transient and local changes in eIF2Î± phosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Looking at the modulation of eIF2Î± phosphorylation in the brain and the effect of ISRIB will have to await the development of more sensitive in vivo tools that report on this molecular event, such as an ATF4-luciferase reporter mouse. </plain></SENT>
