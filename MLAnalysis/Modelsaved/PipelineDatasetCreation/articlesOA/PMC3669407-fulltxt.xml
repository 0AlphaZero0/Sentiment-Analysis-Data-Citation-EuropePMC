Anthrax vaccine is highly effective, but vaccine-induced IgG antibody responses vary widely following required doses of vaccinations. Such variation can be related to genetic factors, especially genomic copy number variants (CNVs) that are known to be enriched among genes with immunologic function. We have tested this hypothesis in two study populations from a clinical trial of anthrax vaccination.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We performed CNV-based genome-wide association analyses separately on 794 European Americans and 200 African-Americans. Antibodies to protective antigen were measured at week 8 (early response) and week 30 (peak response) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We used DNA microarray data (Affymetrix 6.0) and two CNV detection algorithms, hidden markov model (PennCNV) and circular binary segmentation (GeneSpring) to determine CNVs in all individuals. Multivariable regression analyses were used to identify CNV-specific associations after adjusting for relevant non-genetic covariates.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Within the 22 autosomal chromosomes, 2,943 non-overlapping CNV regions were detected by both algorithms. Genomic insertions containing <italic>HLA-DRB5, DRB1</italic> and <italic>DQA1/DRA</italic> genes in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region (chromosome 6p21.3) were moderately associated with elevated early antibody response (&#946;&#8202;=&#8202;0.14, p&#8202;=&#8202;1.78&#215;10<sup>&#8722;3</sup>) among European Americans, and the strongest association was observed between peak antibody response and a segmental insertion on chromosome 1, containing <italic>NBPF4, NBPF5, STXMP3, CLCC1</italic>, and <italic>GPSM2</italic> genes (&#946;&#8202;=&#8202;1.66, p&#8202;=&#8202;6.06&#215;10<sup>&#8722;5</sup>). For African-Americans, segmental deletions spanning <italic>PRR20, PCDH17</italic> and <italic>PCH68</italic> genes on chromosome 13 were associated with elevated early antibody production (&#946;&#8202;=&#8202;0.18, p&#8202;=&#8202;4.47&#215;10<sup>&#8722;5</sup>). Population-specific findings aside, one genomic insertion on chromosome 17 (containing <italic>NSF, ARL17</italic> and <italic>LRRC37A</italic> genes) was associated with elevated peak antibody response in both populations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Multiple CNV regions, including the one consisting of MHC genes that is consistent with earlier research, can be important to humoral immune responses to anthrax vaccine adsorbed.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases through contracts N01-AI40068 and 272201000023C-0-0-1.

Anthrax can be and has been used in biological warfare and bioterrorism. Throughout history, anthrax infections have killed hundreds of thousands of animals and people. The development of an animal vaccine in 1881 substantially reduced the threat of anthrax to livestock and humans <xref rid="pone.0064813-Cherkasskiy1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, anthrax still has a fatality rate of 80% or higher <xref rid="pone.0064813-Meselson1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and the long-lived, soil-borne anthrax bacterial spore remains a public health concern with intermittent outbreaks in livestock and humans. European investigators recently confirmed 14 deaths among 119 suspected anthrax cases <xref rid="pone.0064813-National1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In the United States in 2001, 22 cases of anthrax were linked to anthrax contaminated envelopes mailed to persons working in the news media and government <xref rid="pone.0064813-Jernigan1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.

Prevention of the disease depends upon the efficacy of the licensed anthrax vaccine adsorbed (AVA-Biothrax&#8482;, Bioport Corporation, Lansing MI) <xref rid="pone.0064813-1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. AVA-Biothrax&#8482; is a cell-free filtrate prepared from an avirulent strain of <italic>B. anthracis,</italic> the product contains protective antigen as its major component. It was licensed for use in 1970 after a single trial demonstrated a vaccine efficacy of 93% <xref rid="pone.0064813-Brachman1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Like others, anthrax vaccine confers immunity by simulating a natural infection, but responses to this and other vaccines vary in human populations.</p><p>Genetic differences in vaccine response have been explained by the polymorphic nature of gene families involved in various pathways, specifically immune response. Genetic variations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertion/deletion, gene duplication and copy number variants (CNVs) are common in the human genome. Many polymorphic genetic variations have been implicated as independent cofactors in infection and immunity <xref rid="pone.0064813-Ovsyannikova1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064813-Ovsyannikova2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064813-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.

Briefly, of the 1,563 participants, 1,303 were randomly assigned to seven arms: group 1 received the licensed regimen (8 doses, subcutaneously (SQ)), while group 2 also received 8 doses but with intramuscular (IM) administration. Groups 3 through 5 received between 4 and 7 IM doses, and groups 6a (SQ) and 6b (IM) received saline placebo. Of the 1,303 participants, 1,078 eligible individuals were genotyped using the Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0.

Generally, 0 represents deletion in both chromosomes; 1, deletion in one chromosome; 3, insertion in one chromosome; and 4, two or more insertions. GeneSpring provides a continuous value that does not always clearly discriminate between single and double deletions or insertions. In order to assess concordance between the two algorithms, we classified the calls from both algorithms as either deletion, insertion, or normal without accounting for single or double insertion/deletion.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>CNV and CNV Region</title><p>We determined CNV regions (CNVRs) using the method suggested in PLINK <xref rid="pone.0064813-Purcell1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>: we defined CNV predictor variables at individual genomic positions when an individual had a CNV that spanned the given position. The genomic positions used were the transition points, that is, all starting and ending positions of the called CNV for any individual in the sample. We only considered CNVs with at least two consecutive CNV probes spanning at least 10 bp showing consistent deletion or duplication. We further limited the analysis to transition points that were spanned by CNVs called in at least 10 individuals.

Values below detection threshold were treated as missing and excluded from the analysis. We regressed outcomes on the transition point of each confirmed CNV in our analyses. The CNV data or each transition point defined above were represented in the linear regression as either: a) any deletion versus all others (D2-); or b) any insertion versus all others (I2+). All analyses in each CNV transition point were performed separately among European American and African American populations. Adjustment for age, sex, route of administration (SQ vs. 3-IM vs. 4-IM), and the first three principal component values, from the combined population, were applied in all models <xref rid="pone.0064813-Pajewski2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. For significantly associated CNV transition points, all genes were identified within the respective CNVR. As described above, administrations were performed by either 3 or 4 doses of anthrax vaccine by IM or SQ; thus we also performed separate analysis for each vaccine delivery group and performed a meta-analysis among European Americans and African Americans separately, using the DerSimonian and Laird&#8217;s linear random-effects model with the &#8220;rma&#8221; function in R package &#8220;metaphor&#8221; <xref rid="pone.0064813-DerSimonian1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064813-Viechtbauer1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.

Using genome-wide association testing, we focused on CNV, an important but not yet commonly evaluated source of genetic variation, for its association with AbPA response to AVA-Biothrax&#8482; in European American and African Americans. The strongest associations were found in regions containing <italic>NBPF4, NBPF5, STXBP3, CLCC1, GPSM2</italic> on chromosome 1 (adjusted analysis p&#8202;=&#8202;6.06&#215;10<sup>&#8722;5</sup>, meta-analysis p&#8202;=&#8202;5.28&#215;10<sup>&#8722;5</sup>) in European Americans, and in regions containing <italic>PRR20, PCDH17, PCH68</italic> (adjusted analysis p&#8202;=&#8202;4.47&#215;10<sup>&#8722;5</sup>, meta-analysis p&#8202;=&#8202;8.57&#215;10<sup>&#8722;4</sup>) in African-Americans.

However, to date there are no reports of involvement of any of these genes in immunity or vaccine response.</p><p>We also observed associations with other CNVRs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0064813-t001">table 1</xref>); but none of the genes within those CNVRs have a known role in basic immunology or vaccine response mechanisms. <italic>STXBP3</italic> and <italic>CLCC1</italic> genes on chromosome 1 have been linked to insulin dependent diabetes mellitus <xref rid="pone.0064813-Irvin1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. <italic>STXBP3</italic>, syntaxin binding protein, is associated with glucose metabolism in adipocytes and contributes to fusion of intracellular GLUT4-containing vesicles with the cell surface in adipocytes <xref rid="pone.0064813-Irvin1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. <italic>CLCC1</italic>, chloride channel CLIC-like 1, produces protein located in the membranes of intracellular compartments of endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus <xref rid="pone.0064813-Nagasawa1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. <italic>GPSM2</italic>, G-protein-signaling modulator 2, belongs to a family of genes that modulate G proteins activation and is associated with cell division and cancer <xref rid="pone.0064813-Blumer1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. <italic>NBPF4</italic> and <italic>NBPF5</italic> are neuroblastoma breakpoint family genes that have not been associated with any disease.</p><p>Each CNV calling algorithm and analytical approach has its own limitations and strengths. In our study, Penn-CNV identified 5,812 different CNVRs, with an average of 70 CNVs in each individual; whereas GeneSpring identified 7,271 different CNVRs, with an average of 168 in each individual. Using only the CNVs with concordant calls from two different methods will miss potential CNVs from the filtering due to inherent difficulties in defining CNVs. For example, the HMM algorithm has difficulty with heterogenous CNV regions. However, the requirement for concordance provides higher confidence in the fidelity of the CNV calls. CNVs consistently called from two or more different calling algorithms are more reliable than those CNVs called from a single algorithm <xref rid="pone.0064813-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Even with our more stringent definition, the number of CNV calls per person seems to be higher in our study than other studies, very likely because we have considered CNVs as small as 10 bp (but occurring in at least 10 individuals), rather than the conventional size of 10 kb that is often used. However, that difference is not a major concern for our analysis because most of the significant associations were observed with large CNVs.</p><p>Of note, in this study we examined the association of the CNVs in both early and peak vaccine response. The biological mechanisms of early and peak response may well be different, and our studies suggest that CNVs associated with differential levels of antibody were different at the two phases. Our study involved two ethnic populations nested within a multi-center vaccine trial. While this cohort is the largest for an anthrax vaccine genetic study, our analysis in African Americans remains underpowered. Nevertheless, one region of the genome seems to have a constant effect in both European American and African American populations. With our conservative approach to CNV calls, we only examined 2,943 CNVs in total; thus, our associations seem to meet the stringent correction criteria for multiple tests. As with most vaccine genetic studies, another limitation of the present study is lack of a readily available replication cohort. Although the results from this study are preliminary, they show the potential for identification of gene copy number that could play a role in vaccine response. Weaponized anthrax spores remain a lethal bioterrorism threat to military personnel and civilian populations; continued research is therefore needed to understand whether and how genetic profiles can predict vaccine response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0064813.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
