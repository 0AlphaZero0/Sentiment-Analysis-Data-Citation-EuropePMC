</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Anthrax, caused by Bacillus anthracis, is one of the most likely biological threat candidates as infection can involve the skin, gastrointestinal tract, or lungs [1], [2], [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Anthrax can be and has been used in biological warfare and bioterrorism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Throughout history, anthrax infections have killed hundreds of thousands of animals and people. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The development of an animal vaccine in 1881 substantially reduced the threat of anthrax to livestock and humans [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>However, anthrax still has a fatality rate of 80% or higher [5] and the long-lived, soil-borne anthrax bacterial spore remains a public health concern with intermittent outbreaks in livestock and humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>European investigators recently confirmed 14 deaths among 119 suspected anthrax cases [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In the United States in 2001, 22 cases of anthrax were linked to anthrax contaminated envelopes mailed to persons working in the news media and government [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>As recently as August 2012, the Colorado Department of Agriculture investigators confirmed anthrax in one deceased cow and suspected exposure to anthrax in about 50 other dead cattle [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Prevention of the disease depends upon the efficacy of the licensed anthrax vaccine adsorbed (AVA-Biothrax™, Bioport Corporation, Lansing MI) [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>AVA-Biothrax™ is a cell-free filtrate prepared from an avirulent strain of B. anthracis, the product contains protective antigen as its major component. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>It was licensed for use in 1970 after a single trial demonstrated a vaccine efficacy of 93% [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Like others, anthrax vaccine confers immunity by simulating a natural infection, but responses to this and other vaccines vary in human populations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Genetic differences in vaccine response have been explained by the polymorphic nature of gene families involved in various pathways, specifically immune response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Genetic variations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertion/deletion, gene duplication and copy number variants (CNVs) are common in the human genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Many polymorphic genetic variations have been implicated as independent cofactors in infection and immunity [10], [11], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Studies among monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs (for hepatitis B, oral polio, tetanus, Haemophilus influenzae type b and diphtheria vaccine response) have suggested significant heritability (44–77%) with both HLA and non-HLA genes [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that several genes, including those in the major histocompatibility (MHC) region are associated with longitudinal variation of antibody response [18], [19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Most genetic epidemiological studies, including our own previous work on vaccine response [18], [19], have focused on SNPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>This concentration has overshadowed the importance of structural variants, especially CNVs [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>CNVs are the result of duplications, deletions, insertions and other complex rearrangements of DNA segments often defined to be larger than 10 kb. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>These structural genetic variations have been shown to be involved in pathogenesis and treatment of immune related diseases [21], [22], [23], [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>CNVs are frequently enriched in genes associated with immunity, inflammation, and host defense; they are likely under positive selection for their contribution to the enhanced ability of humans to adapt to their environment [25], [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that common CNVs play a role in differential antibody response to the AVA-Biothrax™ vaccine. </plain></SENT>

STXBP3 and CLCC1 genes on chromosome 1 have been linked to insulin dependent diabetes mellitus [44]. STXBP3, syntaxin binding protein, is associated with glucose metabolism in adipocytes and contributes to fusion of intracellular GLUT4-containing vesicles with the cell surface in adipocytes [44]. CLCC1, chloride channel CLIC-like 1, produces protein located in the membranes of intracellular compartments of endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus [45]. GPSM2, G-protein-signaling modulator 2, belongs to a family of genes that modulate G proteins activation and is associated with cell division and cancer [46].

<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>In our study, Penn-CNV identified 5,812 different CNVRs, with an average of 70 CNVs in each individual; whereas GeneSpring identified 7,271 different CNVRs, with an average of 168 in each individual. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Using only the CNVs with concordant calls from two different methods will miss potential CNVs from the filtering due to inherent difficulties in defining CNVs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>For example, the HMM algorithm has difficulty with heterogenous CNV regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>However, the requirement for concordance provides higher confidence in the fidelity of the CNV calls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>CNVs consistently called from two or more different calling algorithms are more reliable than those CNVs called from a single algorithm [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Even with our more stringent definition, the number of CNV calls per person seems to be higher in our study than other studies, very likely because we have considered CNVs as small as 10 bp (but occurring in at least 10 individuals), rather than the conventional size of 10 kb that is often used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>However, that difference is not a major concern for our analysis because most of the significant associations were observed with large CNVs. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>The biological mechanisms of early and peak response may well be different, and our studies suggest that CNVs associated with differential levels of antibody were different at the two phases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Our study involved two ethnic populations nested within a multi-center vaccine trial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>While this cohort is the largest for an anthrax vaccine genetic study, our analysis in African Americans remains underpowered. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>With our conservative approach to CNV calls, we only examined 2,943 CNVs in total; thus, our associations seem to meet the stringent correction criteria for multiple tests. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>As with most vaccine genetic studies, another limitation of the present study is lack of a readily available replication cohort. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Although the results from this study are preliminary, they show the potential for identification of gene copy number that could play a role in vaccine response. </plain></SENT>
