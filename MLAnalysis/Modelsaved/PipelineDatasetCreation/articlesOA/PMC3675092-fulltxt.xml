The interaction between T cell receptor (TCR), peptide, and MHC (TCRpMHC) is one of the most important processes in adaptive immunology. However, the detailed structural mechanism of T cell activation (TCA) is still unknown <xref rid="pone.0064464-Rudolph1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Several models for the mechanisms involved in TCR triggering have been proposed <xref rid="pone.0064464-Choudhuri1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>: roughly they can be grouped in aggregation models, models based on conformational changes, and segregation models. It is known that T cells can recognize seemingly dissimilar epitopes <xref rid="pone.0064464-Wucherpfennig1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> where sequence similarity alone is not sufficient to explain immunogenicity <xref rid="pone.0064464-Hemmer1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> suggesting that structural rearrangements <xref rid="pone.0064464-Guy1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, changes in heat capacity (which can be an indicator of conformational change or flexibility <xref rid="pone.0064464-Krogsgaard1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>), biochemical similarities <xref rid="pone.0064464-Frankild1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, hydrophobicity, molecular weight and structural preferences <xref rid="pone.0064464-Tung1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> may play an additional important role in determining immunogenicity. Hence it is difficult to develop predictive methods for peptide immunogenicity and only few methods have been published. For example, POPI <xref rid="pone.0064464-Tung2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and its extension POPISK <xref rid="pone.0064464-Tung1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> are based on physicochemical properties. Also the general alignment methods ALIGN <xref rid="pone.0064464-Myers1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and PSI-BLAST <xref rid="pone.0064464-Altschul1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> were used to align new peptides with known immunogenic ones <xref rid="pone.0064464-Tung2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In contrast, the binding affinity between peptide and MHC can be predicted with rather high accuracy <xref rid="pone.0064464-Tong1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and therefore many predictive studies use the peptide binding affinity to MHC as an approximation for immunogenicity <xref rid="pone.0064464-Mishra1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. However, this does not provide the full picture: while binding affinity (usually &lt;500 nM <xref rid="pone.0064464-Yewdell1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>) is a prerequisite for immunogenicity, the magnitude of the pMHC affinity does not correlate well with the magnitude of immunogenicity (<xref rid="pone.0064464-Tung1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and therein references). The explanation for immunogenicity is rather to be found in a synergistic combination of TCRpMHC affinity, mean interaction time, and relative abundance of both complexes. However, to incorporate all these factors in a (structural) predictive model currently does not seem feasible.</p><p>Molecular dynamics (MD) <xref rid="pone.0064464-Hansson1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> is a computational method to solve Newton&#8217;s equations of motion for a given system of atoms. Various MD studies have been performed in relation to TCRpMHC interaction: Cuendet et al. investigated the dissociation of the TCR from the pMHC via a steered MD simulation and gave insight into the dissociation mechanism of two complexes, which differed by only a single amino acid mutation <xref rid="pone.0064464-Cuendet1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Yaneva et al. performed MD simulation studies of HLA-DR3 with and without invariant chain-associated peptide (CLIP) and found that larger conformational changes of alpha-helices flanking the MHC binding groove occur without CLIP <xref rid="pone.0064464-Yaneva1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Wan et al. performed free energy calculations between pMHC and TCR <xref rid="pone.0064464-Wan1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Painter et al. <xref rid="pone.0064464-Painter1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> as well as Zacharias et al. <xref rid="pone.0064464-Zacharias1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> compared the peptide-bound and non-bound state of the MHC molecule via MD studies. Wan et al. published a large scale MD simulation of the whole TCRpMHC complex and CD4 complex including the surrounding membranes <xref rid="pone.0064464-Wan2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Rognan et al. studied and predicted the interaction between pMHC and the T cell receptor via molecular dynamics simulation <xref rid="pone.0064464-Rognan1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Haidar et al. performed several in silico point mutations in TCRs to increase the binding affinity to pMHC <xref rid="pone.0064464-Haidar1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Camacho et al. performed a structural and thermodynamic approach to modeling peptide immunogenicity for protein antibodies <xref rid="pone.0064464-Camacho1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. De Rosa et al. described a protocol to model the structure of a TCR based on its sequence on a pMHC complex. Subsequently they verified their results via MD simulations <xref rid="pone.0064464-DeRosa1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Stavrakoudis perfomed a single MD simulation of the LC13 TCR in complex with HLA-B*08&#8758;01 <xref rid="pone.0064464-Stavrakoudis1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Cuendet et al. performed a steered MD study of 3 TCRpMHC complexes <xref rid="pone.0064464-Cuendet2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In this study they investigated the dissociation of the TCR on the basis of the reduction of hydrogen bonds, an increase of water in the interface and energetic changes. Narzi et al. used MD simulations to investigate the disease associated MHC alleles HLA-B*27&#8758;09 and HLA-B*27&#8758;05 with different viral and self-peptides <xref rid="pone.0064464-Narzi1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In a previous study our group showed, via a combination of MD simulation, pMHC binding assays, and in vitro T cell activation assays, that an N-terminal peptide flanking region (PFR) of MHC class II can significantly influence the immunogenicity compared to the same peptide without the PFR <xref rid="pone.0064464-Knapp1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Recently we could also show the molecular background of mug pollen Art v 1<sub>25&#8211;36</sub> bound to HLA-DR1 and HLA-DR4 <xref rid="pone.0064464-Knapp2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In another study we compared data of 3 altered peptides ligands (APLs) related to experimental allergic encephalomyelitis <xref rid="pone.0064464-Knapp3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Since it is known that altered peptide ligands often induce alterations in the TCRpMHC interface <xref rid="pone.0064464-Armstrong1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> we extended our approach of investigating APLs via MD to a more systematic screening of 172 well described and strongly related TCRpMHC systems. For this purpose we performed a total of 192 MD simulations with a total length of 2 720 ns and found indications that more and less immunogenic complexes might have slightly different initial relaxation dynamics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Experimental Data</title><p>We selected the protein data bank <xref rid="pone.0064464-Bergman1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> identification (PDB-id) 1mi5 as a structural basis for our study. It contains the crystal structure of LC13 TCR in combination with HLA-B*08&#8758;01 and the Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) peptide with the amino acid sequence FLRGRAYGL. We chose this system for two reasons. Firstly, the TCRpMHC structure has been determined and described as a whole (PDB-id 1mi5; <xref rid="pone.0064464-KjerNielsen1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>) as well as in its unliganded parts: TCR (PDB-id 1KGC; <xref rid="pone.0064464-KjerNielsen2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>) and pMHC (PDB-id 1M05; <xref rid="pone.0064464-KjerNielsen3" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>). Secondly, Kjer-Nielsen et al. depict a systematic substitution study of all 9 amino acid positions in the peptide with the remaining 19 standard amino acids. For each of these mutations they provide the results <xref rid="pone.0064464-KjerNielsen1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> of a cytotoxicity assay <xref rid="pone.0064464-Burrows1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> over a range of peptide concentrations. This yields 172 (20+8&#215;19) experimental immunogenicity values for APLs of the same TCR/MHC complex. This data set allows for a systematic and explorative comparison between effects induced by more and less immunogenic peptides.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Simplifications in the TCRpMHC Structure Avoided</title><p>Since the TCRpMHC is a large complex, many authors have only simulated the variable regions of the TCR, the epitope and the &#945;1 and &#945;2 domain for MHC class I, or the &#945;1 and &#946;1 domain for MHC class II. There is evidence that this reduction may be legitimate <xref rid="pone.0064464-Rognan2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0064464-Omasits1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. However, this view is not shared by everyone, see, for instance, <xref rid="pone.0064464-Wan3" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. In our study the aim is to track subtle changes in shape and dynamics. Hence we simulated the full TCRpMHC without any simplifications in the available TCRpMHC x-ray structure. This includes the constant regions of the TCR as well as the &#945;3 region and &#946;2 microglobulin of the MHC.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Construction of the Simulated Complexes</title><p>We modeled all 172 TCRpMHC complexes on the basis of PDB accession code 1mi5.

We performed these amino acid side chain substitutions with SCWRL <xref rid="pone.0064464-Canutescu1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> and visually confirmed them with the substitution method of SPDBV <xref rid="pone.0064464-Guex1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, as this combination turned out to be the most appropriate way <xref rid="pone.0064464-Knapp4" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064464-Knapp5" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Molecular Dynamics Workflow</title><p>We performed MD simulations using Gromacs 4 <xref rid="pone.0064464-Hess1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> according to the following workflow. We immersed each modeled TCRpMHC structure into a three-dimensional explicit water cube with side length of 119 &#197;, allowing for a minimum distance of 20 &#197; between protein and box-boundary. Additionally, we applied periodic boundary conditions. Subsequently, we used a steepest descent method to minimize the energy of the system. In the next step we warmed the system up to 310 K. Finally, MD simulations were carried out for a simulation time of 10 ns for each complex (in total yielding a simulation time of 1720 ns) using bond constraints that allowed for an integration step of 3 fs <xref rid="pone.0064464-Mazur1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064464-Feenstra1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Further simulation parameters were set to values derived in one of our previous studies <xref rid="pone.0064464-Omasits1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.</p><p>To further investigate the behaviour of the simulations over a longer time period, we additionally performed 50 ns simulations of 20 TCRpMHC complexes. For this purpose we choose the complexes with mutations in position 7 of the peptide. This position is considered as pivotal for the recognition process by the TCR since the tyrosine present in the x-ray structure protrudes deep within a pocket created by CDR1alpha, CDR3alpha, and CDR3beta of the TCR <xref rid="pone.0064464-KjerNielsen1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.

Thereby we used two different fitting strategies for the simulation trajectories. Since we are interested in the deformations of the TCR we firstly fitted the model to pMHC to obtain insight into the overall movements of the TCR and, secondly, we fitted it to the TCR itself to investigate the relative deformations within the TCR.

In other words: t-test{[(all &#8220;groupM&#8221; RMSD values), (all &#8220;groupL&#8221; RMSD values)] | time, region, &#945;}. This leads to a number of 314900 (3350&#215;94) unpaired t-tests. These are illustrated as a 1-bit image of significances (see result section). We conducted this procedure for the 4 thresholds determined above, both fitting strategies (see previous section) and p-value thresholds at &#945;&#8202;=&#8202;0.05, 0.01, and 0.001, respectively, leading to a total number of 7557600 unpaired t-tests.</p><p>It is obvious that p-values of this procedure cannot directly confirm statistical significance on the differences between the two classes due to the large number of tests. Therefore, we merely compute labels indicating whether p&lt;&#945; only, as an intermediate measure for differences. Statistical testing is relegated to one step further. Our new null hypothesis is that there are no consistent differences between groups and thus labels indicating p&lt;&#945; should occur only sporadically and about equally distributed over time and space. The alternative hypothesis is that differences show a systematic structure with a large number of adjacent labels, both in time and space.</p><p>We define three measures, applied to the entire map (image), expressing the extent to which the maps show such a systematic structure.</p><p>The first such systematicity measure is a reduction of &#8220;salt and pepper noise&#8221; while the edges of the image are preserved. For this purpose we used a 2-dimensional median filter employing a 3&#215;3 window. This systematicity measure is defined as<disp-formula id="pone.0064464.e002"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0064464.e002.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>where <bold>I</bold> is the <italic>nR x nT</italic> image matrix of &#8220;pixels&#8221; (<italic>nR&#8202;=&#8202;</italic>number of regions, <italic>nT&#8202;=&#8202;</italic>number of time points), with each &#8220;pixel&#8221; being 1 if p&lt;&#945; in the t-test, 0 otherwise.

These regions cannot be expected to correlate with their non-adjacent neighbours in the region list of <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0064464-t001">Table 1</xref>. Thus, we computed <italic>s<sub>1</sub></italic> for 7 distinct sub-images of the 94&#215;3350 image and summed up the results. By this way only regions that show consistent adjacent differences in both space and time yield large values of <italic>s<sub>1</sub></italic>. We also considered the aspect that the application to 7 sub-images may penalize boundary regions of the sub-images too strongly. Hence, we also implemented this method for the image as a whole. However, the results were almost identical (data not shown).

The first major difference occurs between the 2 fitting strategies. It turns out that the fitting of the simulation trajectory to the TCR leads to a much sharper discrimination between the groups (data not shown) and therefore only this version is discussed in detail. In the TCR fitting version several regions are systematically highlighted as different between the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064464-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In particular, in several regions continuous &#8220;lines&#8221; of differences over a longer time period can be observed. This effect of fitting suggests that the spatial rearrangements during the very early relaxation process in reaction to different peptide immunogenicity classes consist of local phenomena within the TCR rather than of global rearrangements of the TCR. This is in agreement with the literature which proposes small shifts instead of major structural changes <xref rid="pone.0064464-Armstrong1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.

This approach gave indications that the very early relaxation dynamics differ between groups of TCRpMHC complexes with different levels of peptide immunogenicity. On this basis we conclude that there is a correlation between peptide immunogenicity and the way TCRpMHC complexes start their relaxation process from the initial (perturbed) x-ray structure within the first 10 ns of simulation. It was already shown that different physicochemical properties are related to peptide immunogenicity <xref rid="pone.0064464-Tung2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and that structural rearrangement during TCR binding contributes to T cell activation <xref rid="pone.0064464-Krogsgaard1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. On this basis it is consequential that different physicochemical properties cause different structural dynamics and could be another level of T cell regulation. However, we also want to point out that the shortness of the simulations could have introduced a systematic bias, and large conformational changes taking place may not have been sampled by these simulations. Additionally an evaluation of a subset of 20 simulations with a length of 50 ns did show differences between the groups, however, they were not statistically significant, which might be caused by the too small sample size. Hence, further studies with several hundred of complexes with several hundred of nanoseconds each will be necessary to finally prove or disprove differences between more and less immunogenic TCRpMHC complexes.</p><p>It is known that the variable loops of the TCR undergo significant changes upon pMHC engagement leading to a loss of flexibility in the loops <xref rid="pone.0064464-Schamel1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>.
