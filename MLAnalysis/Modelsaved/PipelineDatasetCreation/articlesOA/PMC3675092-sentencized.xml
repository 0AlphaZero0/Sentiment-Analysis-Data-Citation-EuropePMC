</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>T cells (TC) do not recognize natural antigens but short peptides (called T cell epitopes) which are presented in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the surface of specialized antigen presenting cells (APCs) after uptake and processing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The interaction between T cell receptor (TCR), peptide, and MHC (TCRpMHC) is one of the most important processes in adaptive immunology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, the detailed structural mechanism of T cell activation (TCA) is still unknown [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Several models for the mechanisms involved in TCR triggering have been proposed [2]: roughly they can be grouped in aggregation models, models based on conformational changes, and segregation models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It is known that T cells can recognize seemingly dissimilar epitopes [3] where sequence similarity alone is not sufficient to explain immunogenicity [4] suggesting that structural rearrangements [5], changes in heat capacity (which can be an indicator of conformational change or flexibility [6]), biochemical similarities [7], hydrophobicity, molecular weight and structural preferences [8] may play an additional important role in determining immunogenicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Hence it is difficult to develop predictive methods for peptide immunogenicity and only few methods have been published. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>For example, POPI [9] and its extension POPISK [8] are based on physicochemical properties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Also the general alignment methods ALIGN [10] and PSI-BLAST [11] were used to align new peptides with known immunogenic ones [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the binding affinity between peptide and MHC can be predicted with rather high accuracy [12] and therefore many predictive studies use the peptide binding affinity to MHC as an approximation for immunogenicity [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>However, this does not provide the full picture: while binding affinity (usually &lt;500 nM [14]) is a prerequisite for immunogenicity, the magnitude of the pMHC affinity does not correlate well with the magnitude of immunogenicity ([8] and therein references). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The explanation for immunogenicity is rather to be found in a synergistic combination of TCRpMHC affinity, mean interaction time, and relative abundance of both complexes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>However, to incorporate all these factors in a (structural) predictive model currently does not seem feasible. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Molecular dynamics (MD) [15] is a computational method to solve Newtonâs equations of motion for a given system of atoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Various MD studies have been performed in relation to TCRpMHC interaction: Cuendet et al. investigated the dissociation of the TCR from the pMHC via a steered MD simulation and gave insight into the dissociation mechanism of two complexes, which differed by only a single amino acid mutation [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Yaneva et al. performed MD simulation studies of HLA-DR3 with and without invariant chain-associated peptide (CLIP) and found that larger conformational changes of alpha-helices flanking the MHC binding groove occur without CLIP [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Wan et al. performed free energy calculations between pMHC and TCR [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Painter et al. [19] as well as Zacharias et al. [20] compared the peptide-bound and non-bound state of the MHC molecule via MD studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Wan et al. published a large scale MD simulation of the whole TCRpMHC complex and CD4 complex including the surrounding membranes [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Rognan et al. studied and predicted the interaction between pMHC and the T cell receptor via molecular dynamics simulation [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Haidar et al. performed several in silico point mutations in TCRs to increase the binding affinity to pMHC [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Camacho et al. performed a structural and thermodynamic approach to modeling peptide immunogenicity for protein antibodies [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>De Rosa et al. described a protocol to model the structure of a TCR based on its sequence on a pMHC complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Subsequently they verified their results via MD simulations [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Stavrakoudis perfomed a single MD simulation of the LC13 TCR in complex with HLA-B*08â¶01 [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Cuendet et al. performed a steered MD study of 3 TCRpMHC complexes [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In this study they investigated the dissociation of the TCR on the basis of the reduction of hydrogen bonds, an increase of water in the interface and energetic changes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Narzi et al. used MD simulations to investigate the disease associated MHC alleles HLA-B*27â¶09 and HLA-B*27â¶05 with different viral and self-peptides [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In a previous study our group showed, via a combination of MD simulation, pMHC binding assays, and in vitro T cell activation assays, that an N-terminal peptide flanking region (PFR) of MHC class II can significantly influence the immunogenicity compared to the same peptide without the PFR [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Recently we could also show the molecular background of mug pollen Art v 125â36 bound to HLA-DR1 and HLA-DR4 [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In another study we compared data of 3 altered peptides ligands (APLs) related to experimental allergic encephalomyelitis [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Since it is known that altered peptide ligands often induce alterations in the TCRpMHC interface [32] we extended our approach of investigating APLs via MD to a more systematic screening of 172 well described and strongly related TCRpMHC systems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>For this purpose we performed a total of 192 MD simulations with a total length of 2 720 ns and found indications that more and less immunogenic complexes might have slightly different initial relaxation dynamics. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>It contains the crystal structure of LC13 TCR in combination with HLA-B*08â¶01 and the Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) peptide with the amino acid sequence FLRGRAYGL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>We chose this system for two reasons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Firstly, the TCRpMHC structure has been determined and described as a whole (PDB-id 1mi5; [34]) as well as in its unliganded parts: TCR (PDB-id 1KGC; [35]) and pMHC (PDB-id 1M05; [36]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Secondly, Kjer-Nielsen et al. depict a systematic substitution study of all 9 amino acid positions in the peptide with the remaining 19 standard amino acids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>For each of these mutations they provide the results [34] of a cytotoxicity assay [37] over a range of peptide concentrations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>This yields 172 (20+8Ã19) experimental immunogenicity values for APLs of the same TCR/MHC complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>This data set allows for a systematic and explorative comparison between effects induced by more and less immunogenic peptides. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Since the TCRpMHC is a large complex, many authors have only simulated the variable regions of the TCR, the epitope and the Î±1 and Î±2 domain for MHC class I, or the Î±1 and Î²1 domain for MHC class II. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that this reduction may be legitimate [38]â[42]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Hence we simulated the full TCRpMHC without any simplifications in the available TCRpMHC x-ray structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>This includes the constant regions of the TCR as well as the Î±3 region and Î²2 microglobulin of the MHC. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>We performed MD simulations using Gromacs 4 [48] according to the following workflow. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>We immersed each modeled TCRpMHC structure into a three-dimensional explicit water cube with side length of 119 Ã, allowing for a minimum distance of 20 Ã between protein and box-boundary. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we applied periodic boundary conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, we used a steepest descent method to minimize the energy of the system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>In the next step we warmed the system up to 310 K. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Finally, MD simulations were carried out for a simulation time of 10 ns for each complex (in total yielding a simulation time of 1720 ns) using bond constraints that allowed for an integration step of 3 fs [49], [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Further simulation parameters were set to values derived in one of our previous studies [42]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>To further investigate the behaviour of the simulations over a longer time period, we additionally performed 50 ns simulations of 20 TCRpMHC complexes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>For this purpose we choose the complexes with mutations in position 7 of the peptide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>This position is considered as pivotal for the recognition process by the TCR since the tyrosine present in the x-ray structure protrudes deep within a pocket created by CDR1alpha, CDR3alpha, and CDR3beta of the TCR [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Together with the 10 ns simulations this yields a total simulation time of 2 720 ns (10Ã172+20Ã50). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>They range from the role of solvent in protein dynamics [59] via the description of the structural pathway between the open and closed conformation of GroEL [60], the flexibility of a short peptide linker governing the activation of tyrosine kinases [61], to opening and closing of the long channel in acetylcholinesterase [62], to protein folding [63]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>In this study we applied MD to 172 closely related APLs of a well described TCRpMHC system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>This approach gave indications that the very early relaxation dynamics differ between groups of TCRpMHC complexes with different levels of peptide immunogenicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>On this basis we conclude that there is a correlation between peptide immunogenicity and the way TCRpMHC complexes start their relaxation process from the initial (perturbed) x-ray structure within the first 10 ns of simulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>It was already shown that different physicochemical properties are related to peptide immunogenicity [9] and that structural rearrangement during TCR binding contributes to T cell activation [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>On this basis it is consequential that different physicochemical properties cause different structural dynamics and could be another level of T cell regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>However, we also want to point out that the shortness of the simulations could have introduced a systematic bias, and large conformational changes taking place may not have been sampled by these simulations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Additionally an evaluation of a subset of 20 simulations with a length of 50 ns did show differences between the groups, however, they were not statistically significant, which might be caused by the too small sample size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Hence, further studies with several hundred of complexes with several hundred of nanoseconds each will be necessary to finally prove or disprove differences between more and less immunogenic TCRpMHC complexes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>It is known that the variable loops of the TCR undergo significant changes upon pMHC engagement leading to a loss of flexibility in the loops [64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>On this basis our study gives indications that these changes might differ on the basis of different peptide immunogenicity levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Thereby our findings agree well with the proposed idea that the TCR functions as a mechanosensor [57] and the beta-chain may play an important role in ligand recognition [32]. </plain></SENT>
