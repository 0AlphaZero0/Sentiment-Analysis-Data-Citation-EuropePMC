However, the biological functions of CLEC4F have not been elucidated. To address this question, we examined the expression and distribution of murine CLEC4F, determined its binding specificity by glycan array, and investigated its function using CLEC4F knockout (<italic>Clec4f&#8722;/&#8722;</italic>) mice. We found that CLEC4F is a heavily glycosylated membrane protein co-expressed with F4/80 on Kupffer cells. In contrast to F4/80, CLEC4F is detectable in fetal livers at embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) but not in yolk sac, suggesting the expression of CLEC4F is induced as cells migrate from yolk cells to the liver. Even though CLEC4F is not detectable in tissues outside liver, both residential Kupffer cells and infiltrating mononuclear cells surrounding liver abscesses are CLEC4F-positive upon <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (<italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>) infection. While CLEC4F has strong binding to Gal and GalNAc, terminal fucosylation inhibits CLEC4F recognition to several glycans such as Fucosyl GM1, Globo H, Bb3&#8764;4 and other fucosyl-glycans. Moreover, CLEC4F interacts with alpha-galactosylceramide (&#945;-GalCer) in a calcium-dependent manner and participates in the presentation of &#945;-GalCer to natural killer T (NKT) cells. This suggests that CLEC4F is a C-type lectin with diverse binding specificity expressed on residential Kupffer cells and infiltrating monocytes in the liver, and may play an important role to modulate glycolipids presentation on Kupffer cells.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Science Council (NSC 101-2325-B-010-006 and NSC 101-2321-B-010-003), Academia Sinica, Thematic Research Project (AS-101-TP-B06-2) and in part by the Infection and Immunity Center, National Yang-Ming University, Taiwan (a grant from Ministry of Education, Aim for the Top University Plan), Taipei Veterans General Hospital (V102E4-003), Taichung Veterans General Hospital (TCVGH-YM1010202).

The extracellular domain of rCLEC4F exists as a trimer stabilized by the neck region <xref rid="pone.0065070-Fadden1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The expression of rCLEC4F was shown to be exclusively present on resident liver macrophages <xref rid="pone.0065070-Haltiwanger1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, thus rCLEC4F is also named as Kupffer cell receptor/KCR.

In general, murine Kupffer cells were identified by F4/80<sup>+</sup> cells in the liver. However, there is no suitable marker to distinguish Kupffer cells from other tissue macrophages and the mononuclear phagocyte system. Hence, studies on the ontogeny of Kupffer cells are still controversial <xref rid="pone.0065070-Klein1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065070-Naito1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.

Nevertheless, the expression of CLEC4F in the mononuclear phagocyte system and tissues are not confirmed yet. Therefore, we would like to examine both the mRNA and protein level of CLEC4F to clarify the distribution and specificity of CLEC4F.</p><p>CLEC4F belongs to the C-type lectin family, but its biological functions are not well elucidated yet. It has been shown that members of the C-type lectin family are involved in the delivery of lipid antigens to antigen presenting cells. The lipoarabinomannan has been shown to be internalized and delivered to late endosomal and lysosomal compartments by the CLEC13D/CD206/macrophage mannose receptor <xref rid="pone.0065070-Prigozy1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, while the presentation of CD1a-dependent lipid antigens is blocked by antibodies to CLEC4K/CD207/langerin <xref rid="pone.0065070-Hunger1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. NKT cells are a unique lineage of T cells that express NK lineage receptors and semi-invariant CD1d-restriced &#945;&#946; TCRs <xref rid="pone.0065070-Bendelac1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065070-Ohteki1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and can be activated by glycolipid &#945;-GalCer <xref rid="pone.0065070-Kawano1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Upon stimulation, NKT cells produce large amounts of IL-4, IFN-&#947; and other cytokines, potentially enabling them to act as powerful regulators of the immune system <xref rid="pone.0065070-Hammond1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Mouse NKT cells represent about 0.5% of the T cell population in blood, peripheral lymph node, and spleen. Almost 30% of the T cells in the liver have the NKT cell phenotype <xref rid="pone.0065070-Eberl1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. It has been shown that Kupffer cells are the key antigen presentation cells for hepatic NKT cells <xref rid="pone.0065070-Schmieg1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. However, the role of Kupffer cells in glycolipid presentation and NKT activation is still controversial. During <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> infection, Kupffer cells form stable contacts with NKT cells via CD1d, which lead NKT cells activation <xref rid="pone.0065070-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In contrast, other studies have shown Kupffer cells were not required in the development of &#945;-GalCer-induced liver injury <xref rid="pone.0065070-Biburger1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> or &#945;-GalCer-induced NKT cell hyporesponsiveness <xref rid="pone.0065070-Biburger2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Therefore, we are interested in understanding whether CLEC4F is involved in presentation of &#945;-GalCer.</p><p>In order to investigate these issues, anti-CLEC4F monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and <italic>Clec4f&#8722;/&#8722;</italic> mice were generated to determine the expression and distribution of CLEC4F-positive (CLEC4F<sup>+</sup>) cells, and to understand the ontogeny of Kupffer cells. Moreover, mice were challenged with <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> to examine the distribution of CLEC4F<sup>+</sup> cells and investigate its function in host defense. Here we reported that CLEC4F is expressed on residential Kupffer cells and F4/80-positive cells infiltrating into liver. Furthermore, CLEC4F is involved in the presentation of &#945;-GalCer to NKT cells, suggesting CLEC4F is not only a tissue macrophage-specific marker, but may also play a role in glycolipid presentation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Animals</title><p>C57BL/6 mice were obtained from the National Laboratory Animal Center, Taiwan. <italic>Clec4f&#8722;/&#8722;</italic> mice were generated by homologous recombination in ES cells (AB2.2, 129/SvEv strain) (Figure S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0065070.s001">File S1</xref>) and backcrossed onto C57BL/6 background for more than eight generations.

The translation of the ORF predicts a polypeptide of 548 amino acids with a molecular weight of 61 kDa, which shows 80% identity to rCLEC4F. The sequence annotation of KUCR_MOUSE (P70194) revealed that the murine CLEC4F is a type-II transmembrane protein with a short amino-terminal domain (amino acid residues 1&#8211;42) in the N-terminus, followed by a hydrophobic region (amino acid residues 43&#8211;69) as transmembrane region; the third domain (amino acid residues 70&#8211;437) contains six potential N-glycosylation sites at positions 86, 92, 115, 132, 209 and 255 residues, and the fourth domain is located in the carboxyl terminus (amino acid residues 438&#8211;538) and contains a typical C-type lectin domain, also known as CRD. The CRD domain of CLEC4F displays the highest homology with hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGP-Rs) (46.2% identity), followed by macrophage Gal/GalNAc specific lectins (MGLs) (45.7% identity), langerin (43.8% identity) and DC-SIGN (42.5% identity).</p><p>In contrast to F4/80, quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that CLEC4F mRNA is only expressed in liver and freshly isolated Kupffer cells, but not in all other tissues.

The binding affinity of Fc.CLEC4F with &#945;-GalCer was determined to be 100 nM (dissociation constant), indicating a multivalent interaction of Fc.CLEC4F with &#945;-GalCer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065070-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). In a competitive binding experiment, &#945;-GalCer and three truncated derivatives (phytosphingosine, Gal, and ceramide) in solution competed with immobilized &#945;-GalCer for the binding sites on the CLEC4F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065070-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). The binding strength was in an order of &#945;-GalCer&gt;ceramide &#8776; Gal &gt;phytoshpingosine. This observation indicates that both Gal and ceramide were involved in Fc.CLEC4F and &#945;-GalCer interactions. We further asked whether CLEC4F is involved in &#945;-GalCer presentation to hepatic NKT cells. To address this question, Kupffer cells isolated from <italic>Clec4f&#8722;/&#8722;</italic> or wild-type littermates were incubated with &#945;-GalCer, followed by incubation with hepatic lymphocytes (including hepatic NKT cells). We were surprised to find that the secretion of IFN-&#947; is downregulated in hepatic lymphocytes stimulated with &#945;-GalCer-loaded <italic>Clec4f&#8722;/&#8722;</italic> Kupffer cells, while the production of IL-4 is similar under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065070-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Interestingly, blocking antibody against CD1d further suppressed the secretion of IFN-&#947; in a dose-dependent manner, and there is no difference for IFN-&#947; and IL-4 secretion between <italic>Clec4f&#8722;/&#8722;</italic> and wild-type Kupffer cells in the presence of high dose (15 &#181;g/ml) anti-CD1d mAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065070-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). However, serum levels of ALT, IFN-&#947; and IL-4 are similar between <italic>Clec4f&#8722;/&#8722;</italic> and wild-type littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065070-g007">Figure 7</xref>), suggesting dendritic cells and other antigen presenting cells in liver can also present &#945;-GalCer efficiently to NKT cells even in the presence of CLEC4F.</p><fig id="pone-0065070-g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0065070.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>CLEC4F is involved in the presentation of &#945;-GalCer to NKT cells.</title><p>(A) The schematic structure of &#945;-GalCer.

The biological function of Kupffer cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of host defense, bilirubin metabolism, ischemia-reperfusion injury, viral hepatitis, steatohepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, intrahepatic cholestasis, activation or rejection of the liver during liver transplantation, and liver fibrosis, as well as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease <xref rid="pone.0065070-Baffy1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. In this study, we demonstrated clearly that the expression of CLECF4F is restricted on Kupffer cells, and facilitates &#945;-GalCer presentation to NKT cells. In addition, CLEC4F displays diverse binding specificity to glycans. Thus, CLEC4F is not only a Kupffer cell-specific marker, but may also contribute to the presentation of other glycans and glycolipids to activate NKT cells.</p><p>In contrast to F4/80, which is a constitutively expressed surface marker for both peripheral and resident macrophages <xref rid="pone.0065070-Hume1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065070-Naito1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065070-Matthews1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, CLEC4F is inducible in the liver microenvironment. The first evidence comes from the observation that CLEC4F is detectable in fetal liver from E11.5, but not in yolk sac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065070-g003">Figure 3</xref>) during embryogenesis. Yolk sac is the first organ where the macrophages develop. It has been demonstrated that macrophages occur in the yolk sac of animal and human embryos. The F4/80<sup>+</sup> primitive macrophages appear in murine yolk sac at E9, and then differentiate into fetal macrophages <xref rid="pone.0065070-Naito2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065070-Takahashi1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065070-Matthews1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065070-Tiedemann1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065070-Weinberg1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Fetal liver begins to form its fundamental structure at E10, and primitive macrophages are detected in the hepatic sinusoid <xref rid="pone.0065070-Naito2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Our findings suggest that the expression of CLEC4F appeared when primitive macrophages migrated into fetal liver. The second evidence comes from the observation that both the number of F4/80<sup>+</sup> and CLEC4F<sup>+</sup> cells in the liver were increased and similar during <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065070-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). This suggests the infiltrating F4/80<sup>+</sup> cells become CLEC4F<sup>+</sup> upon entry to the liver. Finally, we found the expression of CLEC4F is lost when Kupffer cells were cultured <italic>in vitro</italic> for 7 days (Figure S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0065070.s001">File S1</xref>). In addition, CLEC4F is not expressed on the murine Kupffer cell line, KC13-2 <xref rid="pone.0065070-Dory1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> (Figure S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0065070.s001">File S1</xref>), suggesting Kupffer cells may fail to maintain CLEC4F expression under culture condition. It would be interesting to understand what kinds of signals or molecules are necessary to regulate CLEC4F expression in the liver microenvironment in the future.</p><p>Several C-type lectin receptors, including Dectin-1, Dectin-2, DC-SIGN, and Mincle have been shown to recognize cell wall components of <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (<italic>C. albicans</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0065070-Osorio1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065070-Hardison1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065070-Filler1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>.
