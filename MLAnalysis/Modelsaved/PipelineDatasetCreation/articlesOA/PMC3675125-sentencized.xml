<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To address this question, we examined the expression and distribution of murine CLEC4F, determined its binding specificity by glycan array, and investigated its function using CLEC4F knockout (Clec4f−/−) mice. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CLEC4F (also known as Kupffer cell receptor, KCR) was first purified from rat liver extract by affinity chromatography on L-fucosyl-bovine serum albumin (BSA)-Sepharose column and was reported as a hepatic fucose-binding lectin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This suggested that rat CLEC4F (rCLEC4F) serves as fucose receptor [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Further studies showed that rCLEC4F has high binding affinity for Gal and GalNAc [1], [3], desialylated, complex N-link glycan [4] and glycolipids, such as Gb4Cer (GalNAcβ1-3Galα1-4Galβ1-4GlcβlCer), Gb5Cer (GalNAcα1-3GalNAcβ1-3Galα1-4Galβ1-4GlcβlCer) and LacCer (Galβ1-4GlcβlCer) but not ganglinoside [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Based on the recognition patterns, rCLEC4F may have functions paralleling to mammalian CLEC4H/asialoglycoprotein receptor [4] and may also participate in the clearance of circulating Gal- and fucose-terminated glycoproteins from blood [4], [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The rCLEC4F is a 550 amino acid type II transmembrane C-type lectin [7] and the C-terminal domain of rCLEC4F is homologous to the carbohydrates recognition domain (CRD) of other mammalian C-type lectins, such as langerin, asialoglycoprotein receptor and collectin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The extracellular domain of rCLEC4F exists as a trimer stabilized by the neck region [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The expression of rCLEC4F was shown to be exclusively present on resident liver macrophages [2], thus rCLEC4F is also named as Kupffer cell receptor/KCR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Kupffer cells are heterogeneous and are the largest population of tissue macrophages located in the liver within the lumen of hepatic sinusoids [8], [9], [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>F4/80 is the pan marker for murine tissue macrophages [11], [12], [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In general, murine Kupffer cells were identified by F4/80+ cells in the liver. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>However, there is no suitable marker to distinguish Kupffer cells from other tissue macrophages and the mononuclear phagocyte system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Hence, studies on the ontogeny of Kupffer cells are still controversial [9], [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Recent studies show that the mRNA expression level of CLEC4F was enriched in carbon-labeled Kupffer cells [14] and hepatic inflammation [15], but was decreased or lost in Kupffer cells-depleted livers [16], [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the expression of CLEC4F in the mononuclear phagocyte system and tissues are not confirmed yet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we would like to examine both the mRNA and protein level of CLEC4F to clarify the distribution and specificity of CLEC4F. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>CLEC4F belongs to the C-type lectin family, but its biological functions are not well elucidated yet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that members of the C-type lectin family are involved in the delivery of lipid antigens to antigen presenting cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The lipoarabinomannan has been shown to be internalized and delivered to late endosomal and lysosomal compartments by the CLEC13D/CD206/macrophage mannose receptor [18], while the presentation of CD1a-dependent lipid antigens is blocked by antibodies to CLEC4K/CD207/langerin [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>NKT cells are a unique lineage of T cells that express NK lineage receptors and semi-invariant CD1d-restriced αβ TCRs [20], [21] and can be activated by glycolipid α-GalCer [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Upon stimulation, NKT cells produce large amounts of IL-4, IFN-γ and other cytokines, potentially enabling them to act as powerful regulators of the immune system [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Mouse NKT cells represent about 0.5% of the T cell population in blood, peripheral lymph node, and spleen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Almost 30% of the T cells in the liver have the NKT cell phenotype [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that Kupffer cells are the key antigen presentation cells for hepatic NKT cells [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>However, the role of Kupffer cells in glycolipid presentation and NKT activation is still controversial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>During Borrelia burgdorferi infection, Kupffer cells form stable contacts with NKT cells via CD1d, which lead NKT cells activation [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In contrast, other studies have shown Kupffer cells were not required in the development of α-GalCer-induced liver injury [27] or α-GalCer-induced NKT cell hyporesponsiveness [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we are interested in understanding whether CLEC4F is involved in presentation of α-GalCer. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate these issues, anti-CLEC4F monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and Clec4f−/− mice were generated to determine the expression and distribution of CLEC4F-positive (CLEC4F+) cells, and to understand the ontogeny of Kupffer cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Moreover, mice were challenged with L. monocytogenes to examine the distribution of CLEC4F+ cells and investigate its function in host defense. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Here we reported that CLEC4F is expressed on residential Kupffer cells and F4/80-positive cells infiltrating into liver. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, CLEC4F is involved in the presentation of α-GalCer to NKT cells, suggesting CLEC4F is not only a tissue macrophage-specific marker, but may also play a role in glycolipid presentation. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Kupffer cells are the largest and heterogeneous population of resident macrophages in the liver [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>The biological function of Kupffer cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of host defense, bilirubin metabolism, ischemia-reperfusion injury, viral hepatitis, steatohepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, intrahepatic cholestasis, activation or rejection of the liver during liver transplantation, and liver fibrosis, as well as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrated clearly that the expression of CLECF4F is restricted on Kupffer cells, and facilitates α-GalCer presentation to NKT cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>In addition, CLEC4F displays diverse binding specificity to glycans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>Thus, CLEC4F is not only a Kupffer cell-specific marker, but may also contribute to the presentation of other glycans and glycolipids to activate NKT cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>In contrast to F4/80, which is a constitutively expressed surface marker for both peripheral and resident macrophages [12], [13], [42], CLEC4F is inducible in the liver microenvironment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>The first evidence comes from the observation that CLEC4F is detectable in fetal liver from E11.5, but not in yolk sac (Figure 3) during embryogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>Yolk sac is the first organ where the macrophages develop. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>It has been demonstrated that macrophages occur in the yolk sac of animal and human embryos. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>The F4/80+ primitive macrophages appear in murine yolk sac at E9, and then differentiate into fetal macrophages [36], [37], [42], [43], [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>Fetal liver begins to form its fundamental structure at E10, and primitive macrophages are detected in the hepatic sinusoid [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the expression of CLEC4F appeared when primitive macrophages migrated into fetal liver. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>The second evidence comes from the observation that both the number of F4/80+ and CLEC4F+ cells in the liver were increased and similar during L. monocytogenes infection. </plain></SENT>
