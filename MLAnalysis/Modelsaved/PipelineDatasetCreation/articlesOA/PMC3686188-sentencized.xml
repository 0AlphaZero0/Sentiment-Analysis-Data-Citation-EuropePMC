</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Allopatric speciation appears to be the dominant geographic mode of speciation in birds (Mayr 1942; Cracraft 1982; Chesser and Zink 1994; Friesen and Anderson 1997; Barraclough and Vogler 2000; Coyne and Price 2000; Drovetski 2003; Phillimore et al. 2008; Price 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Sympatric speciation is infrequent and generally associated with unusual reproductive circumstances. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>For example, African indigobirds (Vidua spp.) that parasitize nests of estrildid finches (Estrildidae) could have diverged sympatrically through host specialization (Sorenson et al. 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>But overall, nest parasitism is uncommon across avian lineages, with host-specificity in parasitism and, therefore, the possibility for sympatric speciation being even less common. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In the band-rumped storm-petrel (Oceanodroma castro), populations on several Atlantic archipelagos diverge due to breeding allochrony with birds breeding in different seasons in the same archipelago being evolutionary sister-units (Friesen et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>However, allochrony is not common in birds, even among other storm-petrels. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="?"><plain>The intriguing question then is what conditions (if any) can facilitate sympatric speciation in birds? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Adaptive radiation appears to be a likely scenario for sympatric speciation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>However, studies of avian adaptive radiations on oceanic islands provide virtually no support for sympatric speciation (Coyne and Price 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In the Hawaiian honeycreepers (Drepanidinae), only 2 of 7 sister pairs occur on the same island – the Nihoa (Telespiza ultima) and Laysan (T. cantans) finches on Laysan, and the apapane (Himatione sanguinea) and akohekohe (Palmeria dolei) on Maui (Lerner et al. 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In both pairs, one species has a much wider distribution in the archipelago than the other, so the potential for allopatric speciation cannot be excluded. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In the Galapagos Islands, all mockingbird lineages are allopatric (Arbogast et al. 2006) and for Darwin's finches, allopatry is proposed as the initial stage of speciation (Petren et al. 2005). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In adaptive radiations on continental landmasses, there is also little support for sympatric speciation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In grouse (Tetraoninae), a recently evolved Holarctic subfamily with many widely distributed, sympatric species and numerous adaptive physiological and morphological characters (Johnsgard 1983; Drovetski et al. 2006), peripatric speciation (divergence of a small peripheral population) appears to be the predominant mode of speciation (Drovetski 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In songbirds, molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that co-distributed species within Palearctic regions are the result of multiple colonizations of those regions or post vicariant (allopatric) range expansion, rather than the result of in situ (sympatric) speciation (Voelker 1999, 2002; Johannson et al. 2007; Voelker 2010). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The diversity of habitats along environmental gradients is thought to provide an opportunity for sympatric speciation to occur. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Mountain areas are good examples of sharp elevational habitat gradients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, mountain areas are known hot spots of avian diversity and endemism (Myers et al. 2000; Orme et al. 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>However, the potential link between speciation across sharp elevational gradients and high avian endemism and diversity is not well supported. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Studies in the mountains of South and Central America, hosting the richest avian diversity in the world, show that closely related lineages (e.g., sister taxa) are not found in different habitats along elevational gradients as would be expected under a sympatric speciation model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Instead, they are found in similar environments on different parts of single mountain ranges or on different ranges (Chaves and Smith 2011; Barrera-Guzmán et al. 2012; Gutiérrez-Pinto et al. 2012); these patterns suggest allopatric divergence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>A similar pattern occurs in Africa, where studies of a variety of lineages (avian and non-avian) indicate that sister taxa are not co-distributed on single mountains (Voelker et al. 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>While support for sympatric speciation in birds remains elusive, studies of montane-distributed groups which occupy different habitats may still provide the best opportunity to identify cases of ecological divergence supportive of sympatric speciation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The Palearctic passerine family, Prunellidae (accentors; Fig. 1), provides such an opportunity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>This family consists of a single genus (Prunella) comprising 13 species (Dickinson 2003), all of which are associated with mountains and none are long-distance migrants (Hatchwell 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Most accentors occur in the Himalayan region, broadly defined to include the Himalayas, Tibet, and mountains of south-central China east of Tibet, or in the central Palearctic (Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Three species (rubiculoides, immaculata, and strophiata) are endemic to the Himalayan region, two (atrogularis and koslowi) are endemic to central Palearctic mountains, and two (fulvescens and himalayana) are distributed across these two regions (Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Three species (fagani, modularis, and ocularis) are restricted to the western Palearctic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>One (rubida) is endemic to Japan and Kuril islands, montanella is distributed across central and eastern Palearctic, and collaris is distributed across all regions (Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Four of the thirteen species (montanella, koslowi, rubida, and modularis) can also be found in lowlands. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>This variation in habitat associations has been used taxonomically, with some authors subdividing Prunella into two subgenera or genera: Laiscopus and Prunella (Stepanyan 2003; Hatchwell 2005). Laiscopus includes two larger species (collaris and himalayana), which breed in alpine habitats, while Prunella includes the remaining 11 species, all of which are smaller than Laiscopus and associated with shrub habitats inside forest or adjacent habitats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The Himalayas and south-central Siberian regions are each inhabited by both of the Laiscopus species and by four Prunella, suggesting the possibility that speciation in these regions resulted from ecological divergence (sympatric speciation) rather than geographic isolation (allopatric speciation). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in this study we focused on the evolutionary relationships, biogeographic history, and geographic mode of speciation in Prunellidae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>We used sequences of the mitochondrial ND2 gene and intron 9 of the Z chromosome specific Aconitase 1 gene (ACO1I9) to reconstruct a phylogeny of all currently recognized species in the family. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>For all individuals we sequenced the complete mtDNA ND2 gene (1041 bp GenBank accession numbers KC759264 - KC759315, we also used two additional accessions AF407039 and HM538386) and intron 9 of the Z chromosome specific Aconitase 1 gene (ACO1I9, 1094 bp; GenBank accession numbers KC759183 - KC759263). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>We used previously published polymerase chain reaction (PCR) profiles and primers for both ND2 and ACO1I9 (Drovetski et al. 2004a, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>We could not amplify both loci in their entire length for fagani (n = 2) and atrogularis from the Urals (P. a. atrogularis; n = 2) due to the poor quality of DNA extracted from toe pads of museum specimens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>For these species we used five primer pairs for each locus (Appendix S2), but we were still unable to sequence ACO1I9 for the two atrogularis from the Urals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>We also failed to amplify the 3' half of ACO1I9 for both collaris from Sikhote-Alin' mountains (P. c. erythropygia), so we used only 544 bp for these samples which we amplified with primers ACO1I-9F and ACO1-I9Rint (Kimball et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>The sequences were aligned automatically in Sequencher 5.0.1 (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI) and verified manually to ensure consistent alignment of indels in the ACO1I9 sequences. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Females are hemigametic in their Z-specific (sex-linked) loci and thus have only one allele. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>In heterogametic males whose ACO1I9 alleles differed in length, the alleles were identified by subtracting the complimentary sequence of the allele without the indel from the double peaks in their chromatogram. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Although tedious, this procedure allowed us to identify indels and to resolve nucleotide polymorphisms without ambiguity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>ACO1I9 alleles of heterogametic males that had the same length but contained multiple nucleotide differences were resolved using PHASE 2.1.1 (Stephens et al. 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>We conducted two independent PHASE runs. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Known haplotypes from females, homozygous males, and males with a single polymorphic site or indel were set as known alleles. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>We used *BEAST v1.7.4 (Drummond et al. 2012) to reconstruct phylogenetic trees for each locus and to reconstruct a species tree for Prunellidae using both loci. *BEAST was also used to estimate divergence times across lineages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>We used the mean rate of sequence evolution and associated 95% confidence interval (CI) reported by (Lerner et al. 2011) for ND2 (2.9 × 10−2 [2.4–3.3 × 10−2]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>This rate is derived from the sequence of lineage splits in Hawaiian Honeycreepers (Drepanidinae) and is calibrated using the well-established dates of sequential uplift of the Hawaiian Archipelago. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>For ACO1I9 we allowed the rate to be estimated relative to that of ND2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>This estimate was 3.2 × 10−3 (95% CI: 2.4–4.0 × 10−3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>This rate was slightly higher than the evolutionary rates reported for 13 autosomal loci 3.5 × 10−4–1.9 × 10−3 (Lerner et al. 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>The higher evolutionary rates for Z-specific as compared to autosomal loci are expected due to the former having ¾ of the population size of the latter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Gene regions were unlinked and allowed to estimate clock parameters independently. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>We used the Akaike information criterion (AIC; Akaike 1974) implemented in jModelTest (Posada 2008) to select substitution models for the BEAST analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>For all loci jModelTest selected slightly simplified submodels of the generalized time reversible (GTR) model (Tavaré 1986) with discrete-gamma (G) model of substitution rates across sites (Yang 1994) and the proportion of invariable sites (I) included. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we selected GTR + G + I model for BEAST analyses of both loci. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>We incorporated a Yule process speciation prior for both loci. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>To select the appropriate molecular clock prior we conducted two independent runs for each locus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>In one run we used a strict clock prior and in the other relaxed lognormal prior. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>We then conducted the maximum likelihood ratio test (MLRT; Huelsenbeck and Crandall 1997) to determine whether the strict clock tree likelihood was significantly worse than the relaxed clock tree likelihood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>Because MLRT was not significant for either of our two loci, we used strict molecular clock model in our BEAST analyses. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Such a range provides no information about the relationship between the sympatry and age because its sympatry value (0) is determined by a historic accident – the probability of colonizing a small, remote habitat island rather than by interactions with other species. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>This is because changes in taxonomic treatment (e.g., recognizing divergent collaris races as species) will result in changes in the sizes of species ranges and thus the degree of their overlap with other species, as well as in the number of comparison pairs. </plain></SENT>
