patients are at risk for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), no case of cutaneous SCC
derived from RDEB with humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) has been reported. We
present the first case report of a male patient with HHM with leukocytosis caused by
cutaneous SCC resulting from RDEB. A 20-yr-old Japanese male patient with RDEB; the
diagnosis was confirmed by electron microscopic examination, suffered an intractable skin
ulcer and hypercalcemia and leukocytosis. PTH-rP, SCC antigen and Granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) levels were elevated. The histological diagnosis of the
skin lesion was made well-differentiated SCC. Immunohistochemical staining showed the
expression of PTH-rP in atypical tumor cells. For the control of hypercalcemia before an
amputation, we used zoledronate safely and could control the serum Ca concentration in the
normal range. After the amputation of his right leg including SCC, leukocytosis improved
immediately and PTH-rP in blood decreased to the normal range. One month after the
amputation, local recurrence of cutaneous SCC and multiple lung metastases were observed.
PTH-rP increased gradually associated with hypercalcemia. Although the patient reached an
unfortunate turning point about 4 mo after the amputation, we propose that zoledronate is
an effective and safe treatment for HHM with cardiorenal complications.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>quamous cell carcinoma</kwd><kwd>hypercalcemia</kwd><kwd>PTH-rP</kwd><kwd>G-CSF</kwd><kwd>recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa</kwd><kwd>zoledronate</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a family of genetic blistering skin diseases with dysfunction
of cell adhesion molecules in the cutaneous basement membrane zone. Among these, recessive
dystrophic EB (RDEB, Hallopeau-Siemens type; OMIM#226600) is caused by genetic mutation of
type VII collagen securing the basement membrane to the underlying dermis. RDEB is
characterized by trauma-induced blistering beneath the basement membrane, intractable skin
ulcers, scarring, milia, and nail dystrophy. Patients with RDEB are at high risk of
developing cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). In RDEB, the cumulative risk is 76.5% by
the age of 60 yr compared with a life-time risk of cutaneous SCC in the general non-EB
United States population of 9&#8211;14% among men and 4&#8211;9% in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>). Unlike sporadic SCC in the general population, RDEB-associated
cutaneous SCC readily metastasizes and has emerged as a prevalent life-threatening
complication in these patients.</p><p>Hypercalcemia has been reported secondary to various cancers. Parathyroid hormone-related
protein (PTH-rP), which has significant homology with human parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the
N-terminal region, interacts with a common PTH/PTH-rP receptor in bone and kidney, and
causes humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM). Although lung SCC is sometimes associated
with HHM, a little cases of cutaneous SCC have been reported, and no case of cutaneous SCC
derived from RDEB with complicating HHM. We present here the first case report of a
20-yr-old Japanese man with both HHM and leukocytosis assumed to be due to the production of
G-CSF caused by cutaneous SCC resulting from RDEB.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Case report</title><p>A 17-yr-old Japanese man was referred to the pediatric unit of our hospital for chronic
cardiorenal failure due to prolonged malnutrition and body fluid loss from skin lesion. His
height and weight were 130.0 cm (&#8211;7.2 SD) and 25.3 kg (&#8211;3.9 SD), respectively. He had a
history of generalized trauma-induced blisters and erosions from birth. There was no family
history of any similar skin conditions. Electron microscopy of his skin biopsy specimens
confirmed the diagnosis of RDEB [Data have not obtained]. At the age of 20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p> Clinical course. The time course of Ca, P, PTH, and PTH-rP concentration are shown.
The 0 mo is the referral point. The time course of the anti-hypercalcemic therapies

ointments, which persisted for about 5 mo and eventually rose up like an exudative tumoral
mass. As the ulcer expanded, serum calcium increased gradually and reached 14.6 mg/dl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref>; 3.5 mo). Dermatologic examination revealed
widespread blisters, erosions, and scarring all over the extremities and trunk. There was
extensive dystrophic scarring leading to flexion contractures, complete digital fusion and
nail loss of the hands and feet and, on the right foot, an exudative verrucous tumor with an
irregular margin was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2A, B</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p> Photographs of skin lesions. a: Widespread blisters, erosions, and scarring on the
hip. b: Exudative verrucous tumor with an irregular margin on the right foot.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cpe-20-065-g002"/></fig>). Laboratory examinations showed a white cell count of 39,440 /mm<sup>3</sup>
(neutrophils: 92.0%, Ca: 14.6 mg/dl (corrected by serum albumin concentration; Ca
measurement+(4-albumin)), iP: 2.6 mg/dl, ALP: 863 U/l (normal value, 134&#8211;359), intact PTH:
19.0 pg/ml (10&#8211;60), PTH-rP: 3.4 pmol/l (&lt;1.1), SCC antigen: 63 ng/ml (&lt;2.0) and G-CSF:
402 pg/ml (&lt;18.1). Twenty-four hours creatinine clearance was 14.8 ml/min, showing severe
renal dysfunction, with preservation of urine volume (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). A skin biopsy taken from the ulcerative tumoral mass showed the
proliferation of atypical squamous cells with hyperkeratosis, cancer pearls and dyskeratotic
cells, resulting in the histological diagnosis of well-differentiated SCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3A, B</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p> Light microscopy of the tumor revealed proliferative lobules of atypical epithelium

positive reaction for atypical tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig.
3C</xref>). His leg X-rays revealed thin cortical bones, probably due to malnutrition or
immobilization. Computed tomography (CT) scanning of his leg showed tumor mass invasion from
his right internal malleolus up to near the knee joint with irregular margins. No evidence
of metastasis was detected by whole-body CT, positron emission tomography and bone
scintigram. Because diuretics therapy had already been started for chronic heart failure and
rehydration was difficult because of cardiorenal complications, he was treated firstly with
calcitonin (Elcitonin<sup>R</sup>, Asahi KASEI, Japan) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref>). Serum calcium decreased temporarily, but increased again, reaching 17.2
mg/dl in a month. Although he did not present with obvious clinical symptoms for
hypercalcemia, intravenous bisphosphonate was administered for two days. We selected
zoledronate (Zometa<sup>&#174;</sup>; Novartis, Japan) (0.5 mg per day &#215; 2 d) because it did not
need high-volume administration, in consideration of the cardiorenal complications. The dose
of zoledronate was determined according to his body weight and renal function. Although
urine volume decreased slightly and serum creatinine increased slightly (max. 0.9 mg/dl), no
other zoledronate complication was observed. Serum calcium decreased immediately and
normalized 8 d after zoledronate administration, and his right leg was amputated below the
knee out. The surgical margins were free of tumor macroscopically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig. 4A</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_004" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p> Photographs of skin lesions at the amputation site. a: Surgical margins were free
from tumor macroscopically. b: One month after amputation, an ulcer around the
operation scar spread and grew like a tumor mass.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cpe-20-065-g004"/></fig>). After the operation, leukocytosis and G-CSF improved to the normal range
immediately. Serum calcium remained within the normal range and intact PTH increased;
consequently 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D increased and PTH-rP decreased to the normal range.
Postoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy were not performed because of his poor
general condition. One month after the amputation, an ulcer around the operation scar spread
and grew like a tumor mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig. 4B</xref>). When local
recurrence of cutaneous SCC was observed, multiple lung metastases were detected by CT.
PTH-rP increased gradually, worsening hypercalcemia to 17.8 mg/dl. Lung metastasis
complicated his dyspnea gradually and he died about 4 mo after the amputation. No attempts
were made to resuscitate or to perform extraordinary therapeutic measures. An autopsy was
refused by his family. <table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title> Laboratory Data (at 3.5 mo in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref>)</title></caption></table-wrap>
</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>A wide range of cancers produces PTH-rP and causes paraneoplasmic syndrome called HHM.
PTH-rP has high affinity for PTH/PTH-rP receptors similar to PTH and increases serum calcium
when its blood level is raised. Although more than half of HHM is caused by SCC among the
many kinds of cancer cells including lung and oral cavity; for no clear reason, there are
not many cases derived from cutaneous SCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). The present
patient showed severe hypercalcemia and leukocytosis as well as elevated serum PTH-rP and
G-CSF levels. Furthermore, a positive cytoplasmic reaction to antibodies against PTH-rP was
shown in cutaneous SCC at biopsy, followed by normalization of hypercalcemia, leukocytosis,
PTH-rP and G-CSF after surgical excision of the tumor. And reflecting a hungry bone
syndrome, PTH and I,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D were increased. Kato <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>) reported a patient with cutaneous SCC accompanied with
marked hypercalcemia and leukocytosis; however, our literature search revealed no case
reports of cutaneous SCC resulting from RDEB, producing both PTH-rP and G-CSF.</p><p>Management of HHM is aimed at the control of serum calcium, preferably by removal of the
tumor, but alternatively by pharmacological means, including forced diuresis and agents such
as bisphosphonates, glucocorticoids, mithramycin, calcitonin, and gallium nitrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>). Calcitonin shows rapid reduction of serum calcium
levels (maximal response to rapid reduction of serum Ca levels occurs within 12&#8211;24 h) and
has fewer side effects than other agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>). This was
administered first in our patient, but the reduction was small and transient, so its value
was questionable. On the other hand, bisphosphonates are effective for hypercalcemia, and
approximately 60&#8211;90% of patients have normal serum calcium levels within 4&#8211;7 d, and the
responses last for 1&#8211;3 wk. Thus, bisphosphonate therapy should be considered as the
first-line treatment for hypercalcemia. Among many bisphosphonate agents, such as
pamidronate and alendronate, are used in pediatric patients. Since these bisphosphonates
need a high volume of infusion for administration, more attention is required for patients
with cardiorenal complications. As our patient showed relatively severe renal dysfunction,
we decided to use zoledronate, which does not require high-volume administration. Although
the urine volume decreased slightly and serum creatinine increased slightly, no other
complications were observed.</p><p>Although the patient reached an unfortunate turning point, we propose that zoledronate is
an effective and safe treatment for HHM with cardiorenal complications.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Mallipeddi</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group>
