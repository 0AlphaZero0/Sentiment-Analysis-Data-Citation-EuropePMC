</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a family of genetic blistering skin diseases with dysfunction of cell adhesion molecules in the cutaneous basement membrane zone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Among these, recessive dystrophic EB (RDEB, Hallopeau-Siemens type; OMIM#226600) is caused by genetic mutation of type VII collagen securing the basement membrane to the underlying dermis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>RDEB is characterized by trauma-induced blistering beneath the basement membrane, intractable skin ulcers, scarring, milia, and nail dystrophy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Patients with RDEB are at high risk of developing cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In RDEB, the cumulative risk is 76.5% by the age of 60 yr compared with a life-time risk of cutaneous SCC in the general non-EB United States population of 9–14% among men and 4–9% in women (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Unlike sporadic SCC in the general population, RDEB-associated cutaneous SCC readily metastasizes and has emerged as a prevalent life-threatening complication in these patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Hypercalcemia has been reported secondary to various cancers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTH-rP), which has significant homology with human parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the N-terminal region, interacts with a common PTH/PTH-rP receptor in bone and kidney, and causes humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Although lung SCC is sometimes associated with HHM, a little cases of cutaneous SCC have been reported, and no case of cutaneous SCC derived from RDEB with complicating HHM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>We present here the first case report of a 20-yr-old Japanese man with both HHM and leukocytosis assumed to be due to the production of G-CSF caused by cutaneous SCC resulting from RDEB. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>His height and weight were 130.0 cm (–7.2 SD) and 25.3 kg (–3.9 SD), respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>He had a history of generalized trauma-induced blisters and erosions from birth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>There was no family history of any similar skin conditions. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>As the ulcer expanded, serum calcium increased gradually and reached 14.6 mg/dl (Fig. 1; 3.5 mo). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Dermatologic examination revealed widespread blisters, erosions, and scarring all over the extremities and trunk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>There was extensive dystrophic scarring leading to flexion contractures, complete digital fusion and nail loss of the hands and feet and, on the right foot, an exudative verrucous tumor with an irregular margin was observed (Fig. 2A, BFig. 2 Photographs of skin lesions. a: Widespread blisters, erosions, and scarring on the hip. b: Exudative verrucous tumor with an irregular margin on the right foot.). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Laboratory examinations showed a white cell count of 39,440 /mm3 (neutrophils: 92.0%, Ca: 14.6 mg/dl (corrected by serum albumin concentration; Ca measurement+(4-albumin)), iP: 2.6 mg/dl, ALP: 863 U/l (normal value, 134–359), intact PTH: 19.0 pg/ml (10–60), PTH-rP: 3.4 pmol/l (&lt;1.1), SCC antigen: 63 ng/ml (&lt;2.0) and G-CSF: 402 pg/ml (&lt;18.1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours creatinine clearance was 14.8 ml/min, showing severe renal dysfunction, with preservation of urine volume (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>A skin biopsy taken from the ulcerative tumoral mass showed the proliferation of atypical squamous cells with hyperkeratosis, cancer pearls and dyskeratotic cells, resulting in the histological diagnosis of well-differentiated SCC (Fig. 3A, BFig. 3 Light microscopy of the tumor revealed proliferative lobules of atypical epithelium with squamous pearl, invading the subcutaneous fat. a: low power, b: high power (hematoxylin and eosin staining), c: Immunohistochemical staining with anti-PTH-rP polyclonal antibodies showed the positive reaction of atypical tumor cells.). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining with anti-PTH-rP polyclonal antibodies showed a positive reaction for atypical tumor cells (Fig. 3C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>His leg X-rays revealed thin cortical bones, probably due to malnutrition or immobilization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography (CT) scanning of his leg showed tumor mass invasion from his right internal malleolus up to near the knee joint with irregular margins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>No evidence of metastasis was detected by whole-body CT, positron emission tomography and bone scintigram. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Because diuretics therapy had already been started for chronic heart failure and rehydration was difficult because of cardiorenal complications, he was treated firstly with calcitonin (ElcitoninR, Asahi KASEI, Japan) (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Serum calcium decreased temporarily, but increased again, reaching 17.2 mg/dl in a month. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Although he did not present with obvious clinical symptoms for hypercalcemia, intravenous bisphosphonate was administered for two days. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>We selected zoledronate (Zometa®; Novartis, Japan) (0.5 mg per day × 2 d) because it did not need high-volume administration, in consideration of the cardiorenal complications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The dose of zoledronate was determined according to his body weight and renal function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Although urine volume decreased slightly and serum creatinine increased slightly (max. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>0.9 mg/dl), no other zoledronate complication was observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Serum calcium decreased immediately and normalized 8 d after zoledronate administration, and his right leg was amputated below the knee out. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>The surgical margins were free of tumor macroscopically (Fig. 4AFig. 4 Photographs of skin lesions at the amputation site. a: Surgical margins were free from tumor macroscopically. b: One month after amputation, an ulcer around the operation scar spread and grew like a tumor mass.). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>After the operation, leukocytosis and G-CSF improved to the normal range immediately. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Serum calcium remained within the normal range and intact PTH increased; consequently 1,25(OH)2D increased and PTH-rP decreased to the normal range. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Postoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy were not performed because of his poor general condition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>One month after the amputation, an ulcer around the operation scar spread and grew like a tumor mass (Fig. 4B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>When local recurrence of cutaneous SCC was observed, multiple lung metastases were detected by CT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>PTH-rP increased gradually, worsening hypercalcemia to 17.8 mg/dl. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Lung metastasis complicated his dyspnea gradually and he died about 4 mo after the amputation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>No attempts were made to resuscitate or to perform extraordinary therapeutic measures. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>A wide range of cancers produces PTH-rP and causes paraneoplasmic syndrome called HHM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>PTH-rP has high affinity for PTH/PTH-rP receptors similar to PTH and increases serum calcium when its blood level is raised. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Although more than half of HHM is caused by SCC among the many kinds of cancer cells including lung and oral cavity; for no clear reason, there are not many cases derived from cutaneous SCC (2,3,4,5,6,7,8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The present patient showed severe hypercalcemia and leukocytosis as well as elevated serum PTH-rP and G-CSF levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a positive cytoplasmic reaction to antibodies against PTH-rP was shown in cutaneous SCC at biopsy, followed by normalization of hypercalcemia, leukocytosis, PTH-rP and G-CSF after surgical excision of the tumor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>And reflecting a hungry bone syndrome, PTH and I,25(OH)2D were increased. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Kato et al. (3) reported a patient with cutaneous SCC accompanied with marked hypercalcemia and leukocytosis; however, our literature search revealed no case reports of cutaneous SCC resulting from RDEB, producing both PTH-rP and G-CSF. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Management of HHM is aimed at the control of serum calcium, preferably by removal of the tumor, but alternatively by pharmacological means, including forced diuresis and agents such as bisphosphonates, glucocorticoids, mithramycin, calcitonin, and gallium nitrate (9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Calcitonin shows rapid reduction of serum calcium levels (maximal response to rapid reduction of serum Ca levels occurs within 12–24 h) and has fewer side effects than other agents (9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>This was administered first in our patient, but the reduction was small and transient, so its value was questionable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, bisphosphonates are effective for hypercalcemia, and approximately 60–90% of patients have normal serum calcium levels within 4–7 d, and the responses last for 1–3 wk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Thus, bisphosphonate therapy should be considered as the first-line treatment for hypercalcemia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Among many bisphosphonate agents, such as pamidronate and alendronate, are used in pediatric patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Since these bisphosphonates need a high volume of infusion for administration, more attention is required for patients with cardiorenal complications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>As our patient showed relatively severe renal dysfunction, we decided to use zoledronate, which does not require high-volume administration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Although the urine volume decreased slightly and serum creatinine increased slightly, no other complications were observed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Although the patient reached an unfortunate turning point, we propose that zoledronate is an effective and safe treatment for HHM with cardiorenal complications. </plain></SENT>
