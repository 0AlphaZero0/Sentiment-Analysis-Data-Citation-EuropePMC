<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>As one of the most important sources of atmospheric oxygen and crucial carbon fixers, they have been intensively studied by experimental and evolutionary science [3], [4], [5]. Gloeobacter violaceus Rippka et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>1974, the most primitive among living cyanobacteria, has been subjected to both of these approaches. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In its original description [6], the authors studied a single cyanobacterial strain (PCC 7421) isolated from the surface of a limestone rock in Kernwald (Switzerland). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>A peculiar simple cell organization with complete absence of thylakoids and an unusual structure of the photosynthetic apparatus supported the description of a new, separate monotypic genus Gloeobacter [6], [7], [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Following studies of the phylogenetic comparison of SSU rRNA gene and other loci [9], [10], [11] demonstrated that G. violaceus diverged very early during the cyanobacterial radiation, in an ancient lineage preceding the cyanobacterial chloroplast ancestors [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>These findings were in accordance with its primitive morphology and cell ultrastructure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Since then, G. violaceus PCC 7421 has become one of the key species in evolutionary studies of (cyano)bacteria [13], [14], [15] and plant life in general [16], [17], [18]. Gloeobacter was also among the first cyanobacterial strains having its complete genome sequenced [19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Besides its significance in evolutionary research, G. violaceus PCC 7421 has been frequently used as a model organism for experimental studies of oxygenic photosynthesis [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>A unique molecular structure of photosystems I and II [21], [22], [23] and an unusual morphology of its phycobilisomes (PBS) [24] enable Gloeobacter to harvest light and transfer energy in a manner, which is different from other photosynthetic organisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Unlike in other cyanobacteria, its PBSs are composed of six peripheral phycocyanin/phycoerythrin rods bound as a bundle to five horizontal rods of an allophycocyanin core, allowing atypical energy transfer pathways [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Apart from the field of photosynthesis research, a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC) was cloned from G. violaceus and has become an important molecular model of membrane receptors in general biological and clinical studies [26], [27], [28]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In contrast to detailed knowledge of cell structure, physiology and genetics of the experimental model strain PCC 7421, data on the ecology, distribution, life strategy and overall variability in the genus Gloeobacter have, until now, remained extremely limited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Apart from PCC 7421, a few more populations were collected and isolated from nearby localities (PCC 9601, PCC 8105). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The only cyanobacterium morphologically and phylogenetically corresponding to G. violaceus found, aside from the original locality, was reported to be from a surface of a fountain in Florence, Italy [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The unexplained biological identity of Gloeobacter and its relationship to other cyanobacteria has been under discussion ever since the establishment of the genus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Already in its original description, Rippka et al. [6] suggested a close relationship to a little known botanical species Gloeothece coerulea Geitler 1927. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>This latter cyanobacterium has a similar, simple cell morphology and life cycle, and contains polar granules clearly resembling those of G. violaceus [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>On the basis of this assumption and the observation of fossil cyanobacterial remnants, Golubic &amp; Campbell [31] hypothesized that the Gloeobacter/Gloeothece coerulea-like morphotype has colonized epilithic habitats since the Precambrian. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Another rock-inhabiting species, Aphanothece caldariorum Richter 1880, was studied in detail by Hansgirg [32] and it has quite often been found in samples of (sub-)aerophytic microalgal biofilms since then. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>As noted by Komárek &amp; Anagnostidis [33], this cyanobacterium is almost identical to G. coerulea in both morphology and life strategy and thus potentially related to G. violaceus. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Under the current cyanobacterial taxonomy [33], the genus Gloeobacter can be relatively easily distinguished from the morphologically similar genera Aphanothece, Anathece, Cyanobium and Gloeothece by its phylogenetic position and by the absence of thylakoids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>However, until now, Gloeobacter was studied exclusively by observing its cultures, while similar morphospecies from other genera (e.g., Gloeothece coerulea, Aphanothece caldariorum) have never been isolated into cultures, making it impossible to study them using electron microscopy and molecular analysis to provide the necessary evidence concerning their phylogeny and cell ultrastructure. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In this study, we provide extensive evidence for three original isolates of Gloeobacter violaceus, a botanical type specimen of A. caldariorum, and two reference strains G. violaceus PCC 7421 and PCC 9601 to uncover their taxonomic identity, phylogeny, and biology in natural populations. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>In their report, Courdeau et al. [61] described a phylogenetic cluster with moderate branch support, consisting of Synechococcus-like morphotypes related to Gloeobacter, which they called 'Gloeobacterales'. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>It also included the peculiar candidatus Gloeomargarita lithophora that forms intracellular calcite precipitates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>In a manner similar to Gloeobacter, members of this group diverged earlier in evolution than the chloroplast ancestors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>In our evolutionary trees, this cluster, represented by the Synechococcus strains isolated from the Yellowstone National Park hot springs (C9, Ja-3-3Ab and Ja-2-3B′a), branched separately (Figure 5B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Considering the major differences in cell ultrastructure and photosynthetic apparatus, we propose that the order Gloeobacterales should be reserved for the genus Gloeobacter, which is primarily defined by the absence of thylakoids [62]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>This is further supported by a considerable SSU rRNA gene sequence distance; for comparison, there is approximately 88% similarity between G. violaceus PCC 7421 and Synechococcus sp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Ja-3-3Ab while the similarity between PCC 7421 and a heterocytous cyanobacterium, Nostoc sp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>PCC 7120, is 87%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in all known cyanobacteria from these ancient lineages, there is a clear common tendency to colonize wet or submerged, mostly calcite rocks [61]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>This evidence reflects a possible first appearance of cyanobacteria in rock-associated, calcifying biofilm habitats, such as stromatolites or travertine spring mats. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Our results brought new clues to solving a 40 years old puzzle about the true biological identity of Gloeobacter violaceus, an important model organism with a great value in several biological disciplines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>In the first place, we showed that the genus Gloeobacter is a commonly occurring terrestrial cyanobacterium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>On the basis of detailed morphological, ultrastructural, biochemical, and phylogenetic comparisons of two available Gloeobacter strains, three new independent isolates, and a botanical type specimen, we generated complementary evidence of the identity of Gloeobacter with a long known rock-dwelling cyanobacterial morphospecies Aphanothece caldariorum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>The life strategy of Gloeobacter/A. caldariorum is congruent with that of other primitive coccoid cyanobacteria, suggesting a possible origin of their cyanobacterial ancestors in alkaline rock-associated biofilms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>In this paper we provided observations of previously unknown genetic variability and phenotypic plasticity, which we expect to be utilized by experimental and evolutionary researchers worldwide. </plain></SENT>
