<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Most of these infections have a viral etiology principally rotaviruses that alone account for approximately 527,000 (475000–580000) deaths per annum among children less than 5 years of age [2], [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Globally, more than 2 million children are hospitalized every year for rotavirus infection and 90% of rotavirus associated mortalities occur in Africa and Asia [4], [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Rotaviruses have been classified into seven heterogenic groups (A to G) based on their genetic and antigenic properties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Group A rotaviruses are the most important and frequently detected viruses among the three groups A, B and C that infect humans [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The virus belongs to the family reoviridae with triple-coated icosahedral virion particle, enclosed within is the 11 segmented double stranded RNA genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The triple layered capsid consists of 2 proteins in the outer shell (VP7 and VP4), the intermediate layer constitutes VP6 while VP2 forms the inner layer enclosing two proteins VP1 and VP3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Based on VP6 capsid gene, the virus has been classified into seven major genogroups while VP7 and VP4 are the basis of a binary-system for further classifying the genogroup A viruses into 27 G- and 35 P- genotypes respectively [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Globally, the most important types causing majority of infections are G1P [8], G2P [4], G3P [8], G4P [8] and G9P [8] [8], [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>However, significant diversity of rotavirus genotypes have emerged with several novel combinations due to accumulation of point mutations, genome re-assortments or zoonotic transmission of animal strains resulting in the introduction of new antigenic variants [10], [11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Rotavirus strain identification is considered as the key component of epidemiological surveys, disease distribution, genotype prevalence studies, vaccine administration and efficacy monitoring programs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Many past studies have highlighted the significance of continued monitoring of circulating rotavirus strains in order to maintain sufficient population immunity [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In Pakistan, there is no well-developed surveillance system for rotavirus strain identification although country’s Ministry of Health has initiated a hospital based surveillance network to serologically test the stool samples from children presented with gastroenteritis at central district hospitals in 3 major cities; Karachi (Sindh province), Lahore and Rawalpindi (Punjab province). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>These sentinel sites perform ELISA for the diagnosis of rotavirus infection without any further analysis for viral genotype identification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>This study is in continuation to our previous work where we identified an emerging rotavirus genotype G12 in two children admitted to a hospital in Rawalpindi [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>To further explore the epidemiology and genotypic diversity of rotavirus in Pakistan, here we report the findings of rotavirus subtypes detected in children hospitalized, due to severe dehydrating diarrhea, at Children’s Hospital Lahore. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>During the last 15 years, very few reports about circulating genotypes of rotavirus are available from Pakistan [36]–[38] in which circulation of G1, G2, G4 and G9 in combination with P [4], P [6], P [8], P [11] have been described. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>The continued surveillance programs and characterization of rotavirus strains during the post-vaccination era is needed to monitor the emergence of ‘escape’ strains due to long-term pressure exerted by homotypic immunity [44]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Complete genome sequencing will therefore be required to generate more comprehensive information on molecular epidemiology and evolutionary dynamics of rotaviruses on account of its segmented genome and the possible role of internal genes in immunity [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Although the aminoacid residues within the VP7 protein of G1 strains showed higher similarities with the Rotarix™ strains, significant differences were found amongst all four epitopes of VP4 proteins. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>The Rotarix™ vaccine efficacy against G2 strains is somewhat lower as compared to other genotypes while data pertaining to G12 strains is not available as yet [47]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Similarly, for G1 genotypes, the substitutions at positions 94, 97, 147 and 291 of VP7 protein are found to play a significant role in antigenic recognition [54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>In respect to G2 rotavirus genotypes, the substitution D96N within the antigenic region A was found responsible for failure of G2- specific monoclonal antibodies to react [55], but none of these mutations were found in Pakistani strains, except for G2 strains where D96N; Aspartic acid to Asparagine, substitution was found amongst all viruses from Pakistan (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Jin et al reported that most of the currently circulating G1 strains and the Rotarix™ vaccine RRV-S1 strain differ in their antigenic properties and mutations in these antigenic sites may ultimately cause vaccine failure [56]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Despite these variable epidemiological reports, it has been now established that rotavirus vaccines are equally effective against vast diversity of rotavirus genotypes by generating heterotypic immune response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>In the recent vaccine trails, both Rotarix™ and RotaTeq™ have been proven as equally effective in regions with high child and adult mortality [57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Multiple reviews from high and middle income countries have reported a substantial reduction in disease burden within a few years of vaccine implementation through decreased magnitude of rotavirus associated diarrhea and deaths [58], [59]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>For instance, studies in Mexico and Brazil reported a reduction in diarrhea related deaths in infants and young children after the introduction of rotavirus vaccine [60], [61]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>As a final point, in April 2009, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on immunization recommended the inclusion of rotavirus vaccination of infants into all national immunization programs, with a stronger recommendation for countries where “diarrheal deaths account for ≥10% of mortality among children aged &lt;5 years” [67]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Our present findings conclude that the rotavirus genotypes circulating in different geographical areas of Pakistan are quite variable and large scale studies must be conducted to calculate the burden of disease as well as the epidemiological understanding of contributing viral genotypes. </plain></SENT>
