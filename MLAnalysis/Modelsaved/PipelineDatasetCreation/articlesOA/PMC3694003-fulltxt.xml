Kalata B1, a representative member of this family of mini-proteins, has been found to inhibit the proliferation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Analysis of T-cell proliferation upon treatment with chemically synthesized kalata B1 mutants revealed a region comprising inter-cysteine loops 1 and 2 of the cyclotide framework to be important for biological activity. Cytokine signaling analysis using an &#8216;active&#8217; kalata B1 mutant [T20K], and the reference drug cyclosporin A (CsA) demonstrated that treatment of activated T-lymphocytes with these compounds decreased the expression of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) surface receptor as well as IL-2 cytokine secretion and <italic>IL-2</italic> gene expression, whereas the &#8216;inactive&#8217; kalata B1 mutant [V10K] did not cause any effects. The anti-proliferative activity of [T20K] kalata B1 was antagonized by addition of exogenous IL-2. Furthermore, treatment with [T20K] kalata B1 led to an initial reduction of the effector function, as indicated by the reduced IFN-&#947; and TNF-&#945; production, but the levels of both cytokines stabilized over time and returned to their normal levels. On the other hand, the degranulation activity remained reduced. This indicated that cyclotides interfere with T-cell polyfunctionality and arrest the proliferation of immune-competent cells through inhibiting IL-2 biology at more than one site. The results open new avenues to utilize native and synthetically-optimized cyclotides for applications in immune-related disorders and as immunosuppressant peptides.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cyclotide</kwd><kwd>lymphocytes</kwd><kwd>proliferation</kwd><kwd>immunosuppression</kwd><kwd>plant</kwd><kwd>peptide</kwd><kwd>cytokine</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was financially supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF): P24743-B21 and P22889-B11 and the Software AG foundation/DAMUS-Donata (DO-P 9383).

Immune dysfunction can cause an over-reactivity of this defense machinery and in some instances lead to organ rejection and autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis. Immunosuppression, i.e., the targeted reduction of the activation or efficacy of the immune system, is an option for the treatment of such conditions. Since most immune disorders are characterized by an increased proliferation of T-lymphocytes, most immunosuppressive drugs aim at blocking this step in the cell cycle [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Naturally occurring peptides, such as cyclosporin A (CsA), a cyclic non-ribosomal depsipeptide of fungal origin, have long been known as effective immunosuppressant drugs to treat increased T-cell proliferation, e.g., severe cases of rheumatoid arthritis [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Although still widely used in the clinic today, CsA has many and sometimes strong side effects [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Other peptides with potential activity in suppressing immune cell proliferation have been isolated from various organisms, including fungi (e.g., colutellin A [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]), plants (e.g., orbitides [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]) and animals (e.g., the scorpion venom peptides margatoxin [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and Vm24 [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]). Another large and diverse group of naturally occurring peptides that have attracted much attention in pharmaceutical drug design applications due to their unique three-dimensional topology, are plant cyclotides [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Recently, their anti-proliferative effects on activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were reported [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Cyclotides are head-to-tail cyclized peptides in which the circular backbone chain comprises ~30 amino acids, including six conserved cysteines that form three disulfide bonds arranged in a cyclic cystine-knot motif [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Their remarkable structure make cyclotides extremely resistant to enzymatic, chemical or thermal degradation [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In contrast to non-ribosomally synthesized secondary plant metabolites, cyclotides are true gene products and their biosynthesis involves ribosomal precursor synthesis, enzymatic processing [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and protein folding events [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Cyclotides were originally discovered in coffee-family (<italic><named-content content-type="family">Rubiaceae</named-content></italic>) plants [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], but have since been found in violets (<italic><named-content content-type="family">Violaceae</named-content></italic>) [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], cucurbits (<italic><named-content content-type="family">Cucurbitaceae</named-content></italic>) [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], legumes (<italic><named-content content-type="family">Fabaceae</named-content></italic>) [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and potato-family (<italic><named-content content-type="family">Solanaceae</named-content></italic>) plants [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Additionally, acyclic cyclotide homologs have been reported in grasses (<italic><named-content content-type="family">Poaceae</named-content></italic>) [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Interestingly, one plant can produce dozens of different cyclotides [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and approximately 300 cyclotides have been sequenced so far (www.cybase.org.au). The intra-cysteine sequences found in naturally occurring cyclotides display a wide range of residue variations and hence the cyclotide scaffold serves as a natural combinatorial peptide template [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Based on their phylogenetic distribution in the plant kingdom, it has been estimated that there are at least 50,000 novel cyclotides to be discovered [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and we are only beginning to understand their enormous variety in plants [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Their immunosuppressant activity, natural sequence variability, and their biological and chemical stability as well as reported oral activity [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] make cyclotides ideal candidates for drug design applications [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Here, structure-activity relationships for several amino acid mutants of the cyclotide kalata B1 have been determined using T-cell proliferation assays. After defining the &#8216;active&#8217; and &#8216;inactive&#8217; immunosuppressive motifs of the cyclotide framework, we further explored their mechanism-of-action on immunological signaling pathways that are relevant to the regulation of T-cell proliferation <italic>in vivo</italic>. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed report on the modulation and mechanism of cyclotides on signaling pathways in immune cells.

Several linear precursors of single point-mutated lysine or alanine analogues of kalata B1 were assembled using solid-phase peptide synthesis. After cleavage from the resin and purification with reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), the mutant peptides were cyclized and oxidized. The yields of the kalata B1 mutants [T8K], [V10K], [V10A], [G18K], [T20K] and [N29K] after oxidative folding were calculated to 15%, 16%, 21%, 22%, 40% and 29%, respectively, which are of similar magnitude to synthetic cyclotide yields described previously [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The yield of cyclization was calculated by comparing the peak area of the correctly folded peptide to the total peak area of the analytical RP-HPLC chromatogram.

NMR &#945;-H chemical shifts of all mutants were determined using two-dimensional NMR spectra and showed no significant differences from kalata B1, indicating that the mutant cyclotides had similar three-dimensional folds to wild-type kalata B1.

Furthermore, space-filling structural models of the [V10K] and [T20K] mutants and kalata B1 indicated that the replaced residues are located on opposite sides of the peptide surface and that the valine to lysine or threonine to lysine mutation, respectively, slightly affected the area and hydrophobic properties of the surface of the cyclotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068016-g001">Figure 1C)</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0068016-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0068016.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Structure of kalata B1 and cyclotide mutants.</title><p>The structure of kalata B1 is shown in cartoon form (<bold>A</bold>).

The data indicated that the kalata B1 mutants [G18K], [N29K] and [T20K] exhibited a dose-dependent anti-proliferative function on lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068016-g002">Figure 2)</xref>, as well as on purified T-cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0068016.s002">Figure S2</xref>) with corresponding IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 1.9 to 4.4 &#181;M (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1)</xref>; no signs of cytotoxicity were observed in the analyzed concentration range up to 14 &#181;M, which is in agreement with a previous study [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Recent studies identified distinct sub-regions of the kalata B1 molecule that are associated with its mode-of-action, namely (i) a hydrophilic face centered around the residue Glu-7 and adjacent residues, (ii) a surface-exposed hydrophobic patch formed by residues Leu-2, Pro-3, Val-4, Val-10, Trp-23, Pro-24 and Val-25 and (iii) an amendable face formed by residues Gly-1, Gly-18, Thr-20, Ser-22, Thr-27 and Asn-29 [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Our results support this clustering phenomenon and suggest that it may be a general mechanism for other biological activities of cyclotides. The hydrophilic face has been described previously as the &#8216;bioactive face&#8217;, since disruption of its physico-chemical properties by mutation of amino acids to alanine or lysine leads to a loss-of-function [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Accordingly, the kalata B1 mutants [G8K], [V10K] and [V10A] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068016-g001">Figure 1)</xref> lost their immunosuppressive activity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068016-g002">Figure 2)</xref>. On the other hand, mutations of residues Gly-18, Thr-20 and Asn-29 to lysine, which are located on the amendable face of the molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068016-g001">Figure 1)</xref>, did not negatively affect anti-proliferative capacity on lymphocytes and isolated T-cells, relative to native kalata B1. This observation is in agreement with previous studies on the anthelmintic activity of cyclotides [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>It is evident that single amino acid replacements within the &#8216;active&#8217; cyclotide face and in particular of residues Gly-8 and Val-10 have detrimental effects on immunosuppressant activity, suggesting compound specificity. Additionally, analysis of a cyclotide all-D-enantiomer in comparison with the native L-form suggests a direct stereospecific target interaction. Specifically, all-D-kalata B2 had a significantly reduced anti-proliferative effect on PBMCs and purified T-cells at concentrations of 1.8 and 3.5 &#181;M, respectively, in comparison to native kalata B2 [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0068016.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Moreover, proliferation analysis of activated lymphocytes <italic>versus</italic> purified T-cells suggested that the cyclotide-mediated immunosuppression was of direct origin, and no anti-proliferative activity changes were observed between bulk lymphocytes and purified T-cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1)</xref>. Knowing that the immunosuppressive activity of cyclotides was compound-specific, stereospecific and directly related to T-cell biology, the kalata B1 mutants [T20K] (&#8216;active&#8217;) and [V10K] (&#8216;inactive&#8217;) were further analyzed regarding signaling pathways of T-cell proliferation in comparison to the well-characterized immunosuppressant drug CsA.</p></sec><sec id="s2.3"><title>Influence of cyclotides on interleukin 2-receptor expression</title><p>Amongst other pathways, T-cell proliferation is initiated by ligation of the T-cell receptor to antigens that trigger a complex T-cell receptor signaling pathway. During this process, T-cells express the autocrine growth factor interleukin 2 (IL-2), which promotes interaction with its surface receptor that is up-regulated in activated T-cells [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Therefore the influence of cyclotides on the expression of the IL-2 receptor was analyzed using [T20K] kalata B1 and [V10K] kalata B1. Treatment of lymphocytes with CsA or [T20K] kalata B1 led to a reduction of the IL-2 surface receptor CD25 expression (76% &#177; 11 or 79% &#177; 10, respectively) after 24 h as compared to untreated cells, i.e., stimulated lymphocytes (ctrl, 100%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068016-g003">Figure 3A)</xref>. This observation is even more significant for 36 h of treatment, i.e., the CD25 expression was further reduced to 62% &#177; 7.3(CsA) and 46% &#177; 18 ([T20K] kalata B1), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068016-g003">Figure 3B)</xref>. Thus, the IL-2 receptor expression analysis of activated T-cells demonstrated a reduction of the cell surface expression of the receptor in the presence of the immunosuppressive cyclotide [T20K] kalata B1. The inhibition over time was comparable to that of CsA and these results confirm the potential of CsA to influence the early activation state of lymphocytes, due to partial suppression of the IL-2 receptor [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].

The notion that cyclotide-induced immunosuppression is mediated by an IL-2-dependent inhibition of proliferation is further supported by the observation of the reduced transcriptional IL-2 level. To determine the validity of the significant IL-2 reduction after cyclotide treatment, the influence of exogenous addition of IL-2 post treatment was analyzed. If inhibition of IL-2 production is the exclusive mode-of-action of CsA and cyclotides, one would expect that this effect is reversible by exogenous addition of IL-2 to the cell culture medium. For this purpose, the cells were preincubated with cyclotides or CsA before activation. After the activation period, the cells were washed to remove any excess of cyclotides or CsA, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068016-g004">Figure 4A and B)</xref>. In parallel, the cells were treated and cultured simultaneously with the addition of exogenous IL-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068016-g004">Figure 4C and D)</xref>.

Consequently it was of interest to determine whether cyclotides solely inhibit proliferation or affect the effector function of T-lymphocytes, which would directly relate to changes in interferon-gamma (IFN-&#947;) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;) levels. Therefore, the production of both mediators was analyzed following treatment of activated T-lymphocytes with cyclotides or CsA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068016-g005">Figure 5)</xref>. The IFN-&#947; concentration of the CsA and [T20K]-treated cells at an early time point (i.e., 24 h post stimulation) was significantly reduced to 14% &#177; 3.4 and 21% &#177; 13, respectively, as compared to the control. The production of IFN-&#947; was not affected by [V10K] kalata B1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068016-g005">Figure 5A)</xref>. Accordingly, treatment with CsA (23% &#177; 1.8) or [T20K] kalata B1 (23% &#177; 11) resulted in a significantly reduced TNF-&#945; expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068016-g005">Figure 5C)</xref>. To determine whether the effector function of T-lymphocytes remained compromised, IFN-&#947; and TNF-&#945; release was measured at a later time-point, i.e., 36 h post stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068016-g005">Figure 5B and D)</xref>. These experiments indicated that treatment with CsA resulted in a prolonged reduction of IFN-&#947; (23% &#177; 1.9), whereas the cyclotide [T20K]-treated cells had the ability to recover over time, i.e., the cyclotide treatment had no effect on the IFN-&#947; level after 36 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068016-g005">Figure 5B)</xref>. Similarly, TNF-&#945; production was reduced after treatment with CsA (20% &#177; 14) whereas the cyclotide-treated cells ([T20K] kalata B1 and [V10K] kalata B1) did not affect the TNF-&#945; level at the late time point after activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068016-g005">Figure 5D)</xref>. The capacity to diminish the release of these mediators from activated cells by [T20K] kalata B1 is comparable to that of CsA. Treatment with [T20K] kalata B1 led to an initial reduction of the effector function, as indicated by the reduced IFN-&#947; and TNF-&#945; production, but the levels of both cytokines stabilized over time and returned to their normal levels.

Activation of T-lymphocytes leads to a release of cytolytic granules that contain lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (CD107; LAMP-1). During degranulation, the granule vesicle membranes fuse with the membranes of activated T-lymphocytes and therefore LAMP-1 can be used as a marker protein for the cytotoxic activity of these cells. After 36 h, 42% &#177; 21 of the CsA and 49% &#177; 17 of the [T20K] kalata B1-treated cells contained the degranulation marker LAMP-1 as compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068016-g005">Figure 5E)</xref>, which demonstrated that either treatment reduced degranulation capacity, whereby the cyclotide [V10K] kalata B1 had no influence on this functional activity of stimulated T-lymphocytes. This indicated that cyclotide-treated cells restored their polyfunctionality in contrast to CsA-treated controls. The TNF-&#945; gene is one of the earliest to be transcribed in lymphocytes after activation, followed by the production of both IL-2 and IFN-&#947;. Such process defines a significant part of the functional activity of a T-cell and the ability to produce multiple cytokines has been associated with beneficial immune responses [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].
