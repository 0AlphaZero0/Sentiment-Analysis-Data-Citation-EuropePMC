</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Adjuvant chemotherapy is indicated in the clinical management of most premenopausal women and postmenopausal women with ER- tumors, improving disease-free and overall survival [1–5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Studies have also shown that the risk of asynchronous contralateral breast cancer (CBC) is lower among individuals who receive chemotherapy for treatment of their first primary breast cancer [6, 7], with overall CBC risk reductions of 30–80 % reported in observational studies of women treated for breast cancer [7–12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Germline genetic variation in drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters is thought to contribute to the observed inter-individual variation in treatment efficacy [13, 14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The extent to which variation in these genes modifies the association between chemotherapy and risk of CBC is not known. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Candidate genes can be classified into three main categories: phase I enzymes [e.g., cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes], phase II conjugation enzymes [e.g., glutathione S-transferases (GSTs)], and drug transporters (e.g., ABCB1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Together, these proteins influence the bio-activation, inactivation, and detoxification of a wide range of therapeutics [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The impact of variation in these genes on the association between chemotherapy and risk of CBC is not known. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the impact of common single nucleotide variation in genes coding for drug metabolizing enzymes (CYP1A1, CYP1B1, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, GSTM1, GSTM2, GSTP1), targets (DHFR, MTHFR), and transporters (ABCB1), known to be involved in the metabolism and action of drugs commonly used in polychemotherapy regimens for breast cancer (e.g., cyclophosphamide, anthracyclines, and antimetabolites) [14, 15], on risk of CBC in the Women’s Environment Cancer and Radiation Epidemiology (WECARE) Study, a population-based case–control study of women with CBC (cases) and unilateral breast cancer (UBC) (controls). </plain></SENT>
