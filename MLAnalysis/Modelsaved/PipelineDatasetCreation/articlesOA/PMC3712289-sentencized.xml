<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Substrates selected for degradation are covalently marked with chains of the small protein ubiquitin, which targets them to the 26S proteasome for subsequent proteolysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While recent studies have illuminated the overall architecture of this ATP-dependent protease, the structural and molecular mechanisms of substrate engagement and translocation remain poorly understood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Indeed, little is known about the detailed mechanisms of AAA+ (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) protein unfoldases in general, despite the broad importance of ATP-dependent protein unfolding, remodeling, and degradation in the cell 2. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P3"><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 26S proteasome is a massive molecular machine with at least 34 different subunits, forming a barrel-shaped 20S peptidase capped on one or both ends by a 19S regulatory particle 3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The proteolytic active sites of the peptidase are sequestered in an internal chamber, which protein substrates can access only after unfolding, deubiquitination, and translocation by the regulatory particle 4–6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This regulatory particle consists of 20 subunits and can be divided into two stably associated subcomplexes, the lid and the base 7. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P4"><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The base subcomplex contains the proteasomal molecular motor, a heterohexameric ring of six distinct AAA+ ATPase subunits in the order Rpt1–Rpt2–Rpt6–Rpt3–Rpt4–Rpt5 8,9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In addition, it includes two large scaffolding proteins (Rpn1 and Rpn2), the ubiquitin receptor Rpn13 10, and the non-essential deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) Ubp6 11. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The AAA+ domains of the ATPase subunits are predicted to contact the substrate via conserved loops in the central pore and use the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to undergo conformational changes and exert a mechanical pulling force, that unfold and translocate the substrate into the peptidase 12–16. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Each ATPase subunit also contains an N-terminal domain, which is composed of an OB-fold (oligomer binding fold) and an N-terminal helix 17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Together, the six OB-folds of the ATPase hexamer form a separate ring (the N-ring) above the AAA+ domains, while the N-terminal helices pair into three coiled coils that protrude from this N-ring. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Distinct tails at the C-termini of the ATPase subunits mediate attachment of the base to the 20S peptidase through interactions with dedicated pockets on the peptidase surface 18,19. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Previous structural studies have shown that these two subcomplexes bind in an asymmetric fashion, with the AAA+- and N-ring pores surprisingly offset from a coaxial alignment with the peptidase 20–22. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P5"><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The lid subcomplex is laterally bound to the holoenzyme, partially surrounding the base and also contacting the 20S peptidase 20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Six of the lid subunits (Rpn3, Rpn5, Rpn6, Rpn7, Rpn9, Rpn12) interact through C-terminal PCI (proteasome-CSN-eIF3) domains in a horseshoe-shaped arrangement, with their N-terminal domains extending radially outward 20,23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The intrinsic ubiquitin receptor Rpn10 binds to the periphery of the proteasome at the far end of Rpn9’s N-terminal domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Rpn8 and the essential DUB Rpn11 24 form a dimer that projects toward the center of the regulatory particle 25, positioning Rpn11 near the N-ring. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>This DUB has been shown to remove entire ubiquitin chains from the substrate by cleaving the isopeptide bond of the proximal ubiquitin moiety 26. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, Rpn11’s deubiquitination activity was found to depend on ATP hydrolysis by the proteasome, suggesting a potential coupling with substrate translocation 24. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism for this coupling remains unknown. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P6"><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Previous crystallographic studies of several related RecA-type and AAA+ helicases revealed that their AAA+ domains and pore loops deviate from a planar organization and exhibit staircase arrangements around the hexameric ring 27–29. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Based on current mechanistic models for these motors, individual AAA+ domains are predicted to continually progress through the distinct conformational registers of the staircase as they hydrolyze ATP 27. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, within an ensemble of hydrolyzing proteasome particles, the heterohexameric ATPase ring would be expected to display a variety of distinct conformational states. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>However, previous EM reconstructions of the proteasome in the presence of saturating ATP show that the ATPase domains adopt a fixed spiral staircase arrangement, with Rpt3 in the highest and Rpt2 in the lowest position for every complex 20,25. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The fixed organization of the proteasomal ATPases thus contradicts the currently predicted mechanisms for AAA+ unfoldases, suggesting that either the observed staircase reflects a translocation-incompetent state or substrate translocation functions by an alternative mechanism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Distinguishing between these scenarios has thus far been impossible due to the lack of structural information on the proteasome or any other protein unfoldase during substrate degradation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P7"><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>To gain structural insights into the mechanisms of substrate processing by the 26S proteasome, we solved the cryo-EM structure of the holoenzyme during the degradation of an ubiquitin-tagged substrate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>We identified an alternative, translocation-competent conformation of the regulatory particle, characterized by a repositioned Rpn11 and a rearranged ATPase ring that together enable efficient substrate degradation. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P8"><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>We first solved the cryo-EM structure of wild-type holoenzyme during degradation of a ubiquitinated substrate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Occupancy was maximized by incubating the proteasome with an excess of a previously characterized model substrate 20, consisting of GFP fused to a destabilized titin I27 domain and an unstructured 111 amino acid segment for engagement 30,31. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>2D analysis revealed that the regulatory particles of these actively degrading proteasomes were much more variable than those of previously observed ATP-bound, substrate-free (apo) proteasomes (Supplementary Figure 1a-c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional analyses showed that a large fraction of the regulatory particles had undergone a dramatic rearrangement, which included a blockage of the N-ring pore by Rpn11 as well as the formation of contacts between Rpn10 and the Rpt4–Rpt5 coiled coil (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 1d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Notably, the regulatory particles in this altered conformation displayed an additional low-resolution electron density near the N-ring and Rpn11, consistent with a flexibly attached globular structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>GFP exhibits a high thermodynamic stability and fast refolding kinetics 32, and may have numerous ubiquitin chains attached to its many surface-exposed lysine residues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Due to these obstacles, GFP processing may represent the rate-limiting step in the degradation of this substrate, causing an accumulation of proteasome particles that have translocated the fusion construct up to the GFP moiety. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>This would suggest that the observed additional density arises from folded GFP at the entrance to the N-ring (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 1e). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P9"><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Within the ensemble of doubly-capped proteasomes, we observed three different populations of holoenzyme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>25% showed both regulatory particles in the substrate-engaged conformation, 35% had both regulatory particles in the apo conformation with no indication of additional density, and 40% were asymmetric with one apo and one substrate-engaged regulatory particle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The fact that we observe this distribution of asymmetric as well as dually-translocating proteasomes indicates that there is neither positive nor negative cooperativity between the two regulatory particles of the holoenzyme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Substrate degradation can thus also occur simultaneously from both ends, which had been unexpected based on previous studies of other AAA+ proteases 33. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P10"><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>In order to achieve a higher resolution structure of the regulatory particle in the translocating conformation, it was necessary to trap a uniform ensemble of substrate-engaged proteasome particles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>We therefore purified yeast 26S holoenzymes containing an Rpn11 active site mutation (AXA 24,34, Supplementary Figure 2a) that abolishes de-ubiquitination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>This mutation prevents further substrate processing when the uncleaved ubiquitin chain arrives at the entrance to the unfoldase pore 24,26. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>To additionally increase sample homogeneity, we deleted Rpn13, making Rpn10 the sole intrinsic ubiquitin receptor for substrate recruitment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Importantly, this mutant enzyme exhibits wild-type levels of basal ATP hydrolysis, which is stimulated by the presence of an ubiquitinated substrate (Supplementary Figure 2b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>By solving a high-resolution cryo-EM structure, we confirmed that the structural organization of this mutant enzyme in the absence of substrate was indistinguishable from the wild-type holoenzyme, except for the lack of Rpn13 (Supplementary Figure 3a). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P11"><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>For the substrate-bound structure of the mutant proteasome, we reduced the background around imaged particles by using a simplified substrate (Supplementary Figure 3c), containing a 52 aminoacid flexible tail at the C-terminus, a small globular domain (N1 domain of the gene-3-protein, G3P), and a single lysine at the N-terminus that allowed for homogeneous ubiquitination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Wild-type proteasome efficiently degrades this substrate in C- to N-terminal direction at a rate of ~1 min−1 enzyme−1 (Supplementary Figure 4a), whereas the Rpn11AXA Rpn13Δ mutant proceeds through the globular domain and stalls when the N-terminally attached ubiquitin chain reaches the entrance to the pore. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>We therefore do not expect to observe electron density for the globular domain of the substrate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>However, the presence of stalled substrate on the mutant proteasome was confirmed by pull-down experiments (Supplementary Figure 4b). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P12"><text><SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Our subnanometer-resolution cryo-EM reconstruction reveals that substrate induces broad changes in the structure of the regulatory particle (Figure 2a, Supplementary Figure 3b, 5a–c), leading to a coaxial alignment of the DUB Rpn11, the N-ring, the AAA+ ring, and the entrance to the peptidase (Supplementary Movie 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>The N-ring is shifted and tilted by 16 Å and 13 degrees, respectively, and this movement is further propagated to the upper part of the regulatory particle through the N-terminal coiled coil of Rpt3 and Rpt6 (Figure 2b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>This coiled coil suspends Rpn2 above the unfoldase 20, and the change in position of the N-ring causes it to twist and hence Rpn2 to rotate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Since Rpn2 forms static interactions with the lid subunits Rpn3, Rpn11, Rpn12, as well as the bundle of lid-subunit C-termini 25, the movement of Rpn2 translates into a 25 degree rotation of the lid around the Rpt3–Rpt6 coiled coil anchor point (Figure 2c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Excluded from this rotation are the N-terminal domains of Rpn5 and Rpn6, which contact the AAA+ ring and the core peptidase and therefore perform distinct motions to accommodate the reorganization of subcomplexes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>While we examined the 20S peptidase in detail, we did not observe any interpretable changes in the density of this subcomplex (Supplementary Figure 3b). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P13"><text><SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>To eliminate the possibility that this new conformation is an alternative apo state, we searched the data sets of substrate-free proteasome particles for this conformer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>In fact, we did observe particles in this new conformation, but there is a strict correlation with the presence of additional density at the entrance of the pore, in a location similar to the previously observed density for the GFP model substrate (Supplementary Figure 5d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>It is therefore likely that this additional density results from endogenous substrates that co-purify with proteasomes from yeast, and we were able to confirm the presence of these ubiquitinated proteins in our proteasome preparations by anti-ubiquitin western blotting (Supplementary Figure 5e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Together, these findings indicate that the new conformation is not simply an alternative apo state, but a previously undescribed degradation mode that is induced by substrate. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P14"><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>We do not observe density for the unstructured polypeptide in the central pore, which is not surprising given the probable heterogeneity in its orientation in the pore and the limited resolution of the EM reconstruction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>However, we used crosslinking and partial-degradation experiments to confirm that the substrate polypeptide is indeed translocated through the central pore (Supplementary Figure 6a,b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>We therefore propose that the observed conformational switch originates from interactions between substrate and the AAA+ domains of Rpt1–6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Unfoldases of the AAA+ family are known to respond to substrate engagement with an increase in ATPase activity 35–37, potentially due to better subunit coordination in an altered ring conformation (see section on base reorganization below). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>ATP hydrolysis could thus be used to drive the conformational switch of the regulatory particle into a degradation-competent state after substrate contacts ATPase subunits in the central pore. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Ubiquitin binding to the only receptor on our mutant proteasome, Rpn10, is unlikely to induce the conformational switch, because its ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM) is flexibly attached and, in contrast to its globular domain, unresolved even in the substrate-bound state. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>If ubiquitin binding triggered the switch to the observed conformation, it would in fact hinder substrate engagement, because access to the N-ring pore becomes considerably restricted by Rpn11 (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there are several examples for efficient ubiquitin-independent protein degradation by the proteasome 38–41. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Thus, for the ubiquitin-dependent majority of proteasome substrates, ubiquitin binding seems to be required for efficient engagement primarily because it increases the local substrate concentration at the proteasome surface and maximizes the probability that a flexible segment enters the processing pore. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P15"><text><SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>In the substrate-free conformation of the regulatory particle, Rpn11 is located to the side of the N-ring pore. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Docking the crystal structure of a related DUB, AMSH-LP 42, into this structure revealed that the Rpn11 catalytic groove is positioned directly above the bottom portion of the N-terminal coiled coil of Rpt4 and Rpt5 20 (Figure 3a), which may prevent a substrate-bound ubiquitin from reaching the DUB active site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Importantly, however, in this pre-engaged state the N-ring pore is accessible to the flexible tail of an incoming substrate that is tethered to an ubiquitin receptor. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P16"><text><SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Upon substrate engagement by the AAA+ ring, Rpn11 shifts by 18 Å towards the center of the regulatory particle, placing it directly above the N-ring pore and liberating its active site for ubiquitin cleavage (Figure 3a, Supplementary Movie 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>This dramatic movement of Rpn11 may explain the previously described translocation dependence of deubiquitination 24 and offers a mechanism to prevent the premature removal of ubiquitin from a substrate that is not yet engaged. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P17"><text><SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>In the substrate-engaged conformation, the catalytic groove of Rpn11 is aligned with the axis of the unfoldase pore, and an ubiquitin moiety bound with its C-terminal tail in this groove would be positioned alongside Rpn11, where it would have no steric clashes or interactions with other subunits of the regulatory particle (Figure 3b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>This lack of interactions may explain the absence of observable electron density for the Rpn11-bound ubiquitin moiety, as its globular domain can adopt a wide range of orientations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>However, we do observe a continuum of EM density across the catalytic groove (Figure 3c, Supplementary Figure 7a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Based on the crystal structure of ubiquitin-bound AMSH-LP 42, and given the fact that the tertiary organization of Rpn11 does not change upon substrate engagement (Supplementary Figure 7b,c), the additional bridging density may correspond to a short three-stranded beta sheet formed between Rpn11 and the C-terminal tail of ubiquitin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Besides this defined interaction with Rpn11, the ubiquitin chain appears to make no additional rigid contacts with other proteasome subunits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Even the receptor UIM of Rpn10 is unresolved in EM reconstructions due to its flexible attachment, which explains the lack density for an ubiquitin chain bound to it. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P18"><text><SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>The placement of Rpn11 above the N-ring positions its active site only ~10 Å from the pore entrance, such that the isopeptide branch point of a substrate-attached ubiquitin must pass by the catalytic groove en-route to the central pore. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Rpn11 may thus act as a gatekeeper, scanning the substrate polypeptide to ensure that all ubiquitins are removed before reaching and obstructing the entrance to the pore. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>In addition, the location of the Rpn11 active site likely determines its specificity for cleaving the proximal ubiquitin 26, since endo-isopeptidase activity would require the positioning of a second ubiquitin below Rpn11, in a region that is sterically occluded by the N-ring (Figure 3b). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P19"><text><SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Our EM structure reveals that substrate engagement in the central pore triggers major changes in the conformation of the AAA+ ring, primarily by inducing the subunits to shift and rotate away from the lid (Supplementary Movie 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>This movement of subunits leads to a global shift of the AAA+ ring relative to the peptidase, from a 10-Å offset to a nearly perfect coaxial alignment (Figure 4a,b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Despite this transition, the C-terminal tails of Rpt2, Rpt3, and Rpt5, which contain the conserved HbYX (hydrophobic-tyrosine-unspecified residue) motif for peptidase interaction, remain docked in their respective binding pockets (Supplementary Figure 8a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the Rpt motions result in a ~ 4-fold widening of the central pore, from an almost closed to an open state that can readily accommodate a translocating polypeptide (Figure 4b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Notably, the pore diameter in both the pre-engaged and substrate-bound conformation is actually smaller than it appears in our structures, since heterogeneity in the position of pore loops causes some lack of density in the central channel. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>In addition to the motions of the AAA+-domain hexamer, the rigid N-ring also shifts to become aligned with the peptidase, creating a continuous channel through the entire complex (Figure 4a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Together, this coaxial alignment and the expansion of the central pore most likely facilitate efficient substrate translocation (Supplementary Figure 8b). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P20"><text><SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>The lid subcomplex appears to play an important role in stabilizing the reorganized architecture of the base. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>We observe three major interactions between the lid and the base in both the substrate-free and substrate-bound reconstructions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>The small AAA+ subdomain of Rpt3 contacts the lid subunits Rpn5 and Rpn6, while the Rpt3–Rpt6 AAA+ interface interacts with Rpn7 (Figure 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>During the substrate-induced conformational transition, Rpn7 remains in contact with the Rpt3–Rpt6 interface and thus may function as a joint to accommodate the differential movements of the lid and base subcomplexes. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>These uniform interfaces are reminiscent of the “rigid bodies” that are formed in the homohexameric unfoldase ClpX between each large AAA+ subdomain and the small subdomain of the neighboring subunit 43. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Based on rigidifying intersubunit crosslinking of the ClpX hexamer, it has been proposed that ATP hydrolysis changes the relative orientation of the large and small AAA+ subdomains within a given subunit and thus drives movements of the “rigid body” formed with the subdomain of the neighbor to propel a substrate polypeptide through the central pore 43,44. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>The apparent formation of uniform intersubunit contacts in the proteasomal Rpt ring upon substrate engagement therefore strongly suggests the transition from a pre-engaged to a more symmetrical, translocation-competent state that allows optimal coordination between ATPase subunits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, one of the interfaces, between the small AAA+ subdomain of Rpt3 and the large AAA+ subdomain of Rpt4 (Figure 6b), already exhibits this “rigid body” orientation in the substrate-free state of the AAA+ ring. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Rpt3 and Rpt4 are located at the top of the spiral staircase adopted by the Rpts prior to substrate engagement and would therefore be the first subunits to interact with an incoming substrate 20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Substrate-induced movement of their stably associated large and small AAA+ subdomain may propagate the formation of uniform interfaces to the remainder of the Rpts and thus induce the transition to a translocation-competent ring conformation that is then maintained until the substrate has been completely translocated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P22"><text><SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>Importantly, as the Rpt-ring conformation changes in response to substrate engagement, each AAA+ subunit rotates to a variable degree. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>This results in a switch from the pronounced spiral staircase of subunits in the substrate-free state to a nearly planar ring when substrate is engaged (Figure 7, Supplementary Movie 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>The strong pitch of the spiral in the absence of substrate originates from the large AAA+ subdomains of Rpt1–Rpt6 being arranged at different heights along the central pore axis, with Rpt3 at the top and Rpt2 at the bottom position 20,25. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the large AAA+ subdomains in the substrate-engaged conformation are at one level, but each tilted to different degrees about an axis lying in the plane of the ring (Figure 7). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the ATPase ring of the 26S proteasome in the substrate-engaged state displays a fixed spiral orientation with highly ordered densities (Figure 7b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>This is especially interesting given that substrate stimulates the ATPase rate (Supplementary Figure 2b), and the enzyme was hydrolyzing at this stimulated rate when the sample was frozen for EM analysis. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>While it is possible that substrate translocation is driven by only local motions of the pore-loops in an otherwise fixed AAA+ spiral, it is more likely that the spiral is dynamic and the specific orientation we observe in our structure represents a “dwell” state, adopted before or after coordinated ATP hydrolysis events that rapidly progress around the ring. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>The uniform subunit interfaces formed between neighboring Rpts upon substrate engagement are consistent with this model, as they would facilitate such coordinated firing of subunits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>A rapid progression of ATP-hydrolysis-driven conformational changes around the ring has been proposed for the AAA+ DNA packaging motor of the bacteriophage ϕ29 45,46. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>During translocation of a DNA substrate, this packaging motor spends 90% of its time in a stationary or “dwell” phase, during which ADP is released and subunits are loaded with ATP, and only 10% of its time in a “burst” phase, during which substrate is translocated by coordinated conformational changes of subunits around the ring. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>A similar temporal distribution for the substrate-engaged proteasome, with 90% of particles in the dwell phase at any given time, would result in an EM reconstruction with an apparently fixed AAA+-ring spiral, as we observe. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>However, particles that are in the burst phase at the time of sample freezing may cause the lower local resolution we observe for the AAA+ ring in the substrate-bound compared to the pre-engaged structure (Supplementary Figure 5a,b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>The pre-engaged state may not exhibit a coordinated burst phase or undergo the same conformational changes associated with a rapid, progressive hydrolysis around the ring, because its individual subunits are not coupled by the uniform interfaces that are present in the substrate-engaged state. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P24"><text><SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>The specific orientation of the translocation-competent spiral, with Rpt1 adopting the top position in all dwell-phase particles, likely originates from conformational constraints imposed by the heterohexameric architecture of the ATPase ring as well as its asymmetric surroundings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>We propose that the Rpt ring adopts this spiral as soon as a substrate polypeptide is engaged in the central pore. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Coordinated ATP hydrolysis then drives the tilting of individual AAA+ domains through the different subunit registers of the translocation-competent spiral, generating a power stroke that propels a certain length of polypeptide through the pore. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>The three models used for this refinement included a C2-symmetric proteasome containing two apo-state regulatory particles (EMDB-1992), a C2-symmetric proteasome containing two substrate-engaged regulatory particles (the substrate-engaged Rpn11AXA Rpn13Δ reconstruction), and an asymmetric proteasome containing one apo-state and one substrate-engaged regulatory particle. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>It is not possible that this density is a product of model bias, as the substrate-engaged mutant density used to generate the initial models did not contain this globular density due to the design of the substrate. </plain></SENT>
