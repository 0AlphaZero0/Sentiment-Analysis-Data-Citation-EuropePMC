In a combined analysis, the summary per-allele odds ratio (OR) for BC of 2q35-rs13387042 polymorphism was 1.13 (95% CI: 1.11&#8211;1.16; P&lt;10<sup>&#8722;5</sup>). Significant associations were also detected under co-dominant, dominant and recessive genetic models. In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significantly increased risks were found in Asians, Caucasians and Hispanic whites for the polymorphism in all comparisons; whereas no significant associations were found among Africans. In addition, we find 2q35-rs13387042 polymorphism conferred significantly risks for both ER-positive and ER-negative tumors.

The risk is even greater for women with multiple cases in family members. BC may be attributable to mutations in high-penetrance genes such as BRCA1, BRCA2, p53 and PTEN, as well as moderate or low penetrance genes (e.g., CHEK2, ATM, HRAS1, BRIP1, and PALB2), but these mutations account for a relatively small proportion of the heritable risk in these BC families <xref rid="pone.0066979-Walsh1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066979-Walsh2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.

Recently, a genome-wide association (GWA) study conducted in European ancestry population by Stacey et al. identified a new genetic susceptibility locus, rs13387042, at chromosome 2q35 was associated with BC risk <xref rid="pone.0066979-Stacey2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. After that, a number of studies have investigated the association between 2q35 rs13387042 polymorphism and BC risk. However, these studies have yielded conflicting or inconclusive result. These disparate findings may be due partly to insufficient power, phenotypic heterogeneity, population stratification, small effect of the polymorphism on BC risk, and even publication biases. Therefore, we carried out a comprehensive meta-analysis on all eligible studies to estimate the overall BC risk of 2q35-rs13387042 polymorphism as well as to quantify the between-study heterogeneity and potential bias.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We performed this analysis in accordance with the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement <xref rid="pone.0066979-Moher1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> (Checklist S1).</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Literature search strategy and inclusion criteria</title><p>Epidemiological genetic association studies published before the end of December 2012 on breast cancer and polymorphism in the chromosome 2q35 were sought by computer-based searches from databases including MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, ISI web of science and CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) without language restriction. Search term combinations were keywords relating to the chromosome 2q35 (e.g., &#8220;2q35&#8221;, &#8220;rs13387042&#8221;) in combination with words related to breast cancer (e.g., breast cancer' or &#8216;malignant breast neoplasm&#8217;).

Relevant clinical characteristics included estrogen receptor (ER) status, progesterone receptor (PR) status, ERBB2 status, and tumor grade.

The procedure scores each paper categorizing it as having &#8216;high&#8217;, &#8216;median&#8217; or &#8216;poor&#8217; quality.

The meta-analysis examined the association between the polymorphism and the risk of BC for the: (1) allele contrast, (2) heterozygous, (3) homozygote, (5) dominant, and (6) recessive model. Heterogeneity across individual studies was calculated using the Cochran's Q-statistic test followed by subsidiary analysis or by random-effects regression models with restricted maximum likelihood estimation <xref rid="pone.0066979-Cochran1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0066979-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The Q test was also performed to detect heterogeneity between subgroups. Random-effects and fixed-effect summary measures were calculated as inverse-variance&#8211;weighted average of the log odds ratio. The results of random-effects summary were reported in the text because it takes into account the variation between studies. Sources of heterogeneity were investigated by stratified meta-analyses based on ethnicity, sample size (No. cases &#8805;1000 or, &lt;1000), ER and PR status. In addition, ethnicity, sample size, genotyping method and quality score were analyzed as covariates in meta-regression. The significance of the overall OR was determined by the Z-test.

Sensitivity analysis was performed by removing each individual study in turn from the total and re-analyzing the remainder. This procedure was used to ensure that no individual study was entirely responsible for the combined results. Statistical power (nominal &#945;&#8202;=&#8202;0.05) of this meta-analysis based on overall sample size was calculated with the pooled OR estimate from different ethnicity and minor allele frequency in controls <xref rid="pone.0066979-Cai1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

Accumulated evidence suggests that it is a complex polygenic disorder for which genetic factors play an important role in disease etiology <xref rid="pone.0066979-Lichtenstein1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Common variation rs13387042 at 2q35 was originally identified in large GWA study in European population <xref rid="pone.0066979-Stacey2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Since then, extensive case-control studies in different populations reported that the rs13387042 polymorphism in 2q35 has been implicated in BC risk. However, results of genetic association studies were confusing because of the difficulty in replicating significant associations. Different characteristics among studies such as ethnicities, BC subtype, definition of case and control, introduced heterogeneity and made the results of association studies hard to be interpreted. A meta-analysis aiming at finding out the origin of heterogeneity and assessing overall effects of these variants on BC was performed. This is the first comprehensive meta-analysis that examined the rs13387042 polymorphisms in 2q35 and the relationship with susceptibility for BC. Its strength was based on the accumulation of published data giving greater information to detect significant differences. In total, the meta-analysis involved 24 studies for BC that provided 99,772 cases and 164,985 controls. Overall, a significant association existed between the 2q35 rs13387042 variant and BC risk.</p><p>In the subgroup analysis, study conducted in Caucasian populations was responsible for heterogeneity, and the ORs between different genetic models and sample size were consistent. The rs13387042 showed positive association with BC in Asian, Caucasian and Hispanic white populations. However, no associations were found in African descent population. In fact, the distribution of the less common G allele varies extensively between different races, with a prevalence of &#8764;88% among Asians, &#8764;49% among Caucasians and &#8764;28% among African population <xref rid="pone.0066979-Hutter1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0066979-Campa1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Thus, failing to identify any significant association in Caucasians and other populations could be due to substantially lower statistical power caused by the relatively lower prevalence of G allele of rs13387042. Such result could also be due to the limited number of studies among African populations, which had insufficient statistical power to detect a slight effect or different linkage disequilibrium (LD) pattern of the polymorphism among African populations. Therefore, additional studies are warranted to further validate ethnic difference in the effect of this polymorphism on BC risk. It is possible that variation at this locus has modest effects on BC, but environmental factors may predominate in the progress of BC, and mask the effects of this variation. Specific life style environmental factors, such as estrogen exposure status and smoking habit have been already well studied in recent decades <xref rid="pone.0066979-Lichtenstein1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The unconsidered factors mixed together may cover the role of 2q35-rs13387042 polymorphism.</p><p>Findings from previous studies suggested that several SNPs are predominantly associated with ER+ breast cancer: TNRC9-rs3803662 <xref rid="pone.0066979-Stacey2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066979-Reeves1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066979-Milne1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, 5p12-rs4415084 <xref rid="pone.0066979-Stacey1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, 5p12-rs10941679 <xref rid="pone.0066979-Stacey1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, FGFR2-rs2981582 <xref rid="pone.0066979-Stacey1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066979-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> 8q24-rs13281615 <xref rid="pone.0066979-GarciaClosas1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. In our results, 2q35-rs13387042 was associated with both ER+ and ER&#8722; BC. Similar risks were also observed when stratified by PR status. SNP 2q35-rs13387042 showed a strongly statistically significant association with risk in ER+ and PR+ cases compared to ER&#8722; and PR&#8722; cases. Because ER and PR status are the major markers of BC subtypes, these observations suggest that inherited risk variants of these subtypes may vary. The magnitude of the observed differences is small, and by themselves these findings are unlikely to have any immediate clinical implications. However, the observed differences provide clues to the biologic mechanisms that underpin tumor heterogeneity, which may ultimately lead to improved treatment and prevention. Since rs13387042 is located in a 90-kb region of high LD without any known genes or human RNAs, indicating that further study of the biological function of this SNP is necessary.</p><p>The strengths of this study include the very large sample size, no deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and the high quality of the qualified studies. However, our current study should be interpreted with several technical limitations in mind. Firstly, the vast majority of white subjects in the study are of European descent, and statistical power for analyses in other ethnicities is limited. Because the sample size was considerably smaller for African studies, the main conclusions from this manuscript are based on analyses among white European and Asian women. Future studies including larger numbers of Africans are necessary to clarify the consistency of findings across ethnic groups. Secondly, our results were based on unadjusted estimates, while a more precise analysis should be conducted if individual data were available, which would allow for the adjustment by other covariates including age, menopausal status, family history, environmental factors and lifestyle <xref rid="pone.0066979-Lichtenstein1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Third, only published studies were included in this meta-analysis. Therefore, publication bias may have occurred, even though the use of a statistical test did not show it. Recently, two meta-analyses found that SLC4A7 and XRCC1 were associated with increased BC susceptibility <xref rid="pone.0066979-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066979-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. BC is an extremely complex disease and the same polymorphism may have different roles in different ethnicity. Using meta-analysis to combine all available evidence may help to identify new loci for BC susceptibility and thus provide insight into the in vivo relationship between candidate genes and BC. An improved understanding of the pathogenesis of BC will be beneficial in the diagnosis of prodromal symptoms and in establishing appropriate therapeutic intervention to prevent the onset and the progression of BC.</p><p>In summary, findings from this meta-analysis indicate that 2q35 rs13387042 polymorphism is significantly associated with an increased risk of BC. Further studies should investigate the markers on and adjacent to 2q35 to clarify whether the present association is causal or due to linkage disequilibrium.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0066979.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
