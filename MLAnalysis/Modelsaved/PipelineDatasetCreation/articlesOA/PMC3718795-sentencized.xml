</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Breast cancer (BC), as a substantial global public health concern, is one of the most common cancers diagnosed in women and is the primary cause of death among women in both the developing and developed world [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>It is estimated that over one million women are diagnosed with BC every year, and more than 410,000 will die from the disease [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>During the past two decades, there are well-documented reductions in mortality from BC in many counties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, incidence rates continue to increase and do so more rapidly in countries that historically had low rates [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The etiology of BC is extremely complex and, while not yet elucidated, appears to involve numerous genetic, endocrine, and external environmental factors [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Family history is an important risk factor for BC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The risk of developing BC for a woman with a first-degree affected relative is increased 2-fold [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The risk is even greater for women with multiple cases in family members. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>BC may be attributable to mutations in high-penetrance genes such as BRCA1, BRCA2, p53 and PTEN, as well as moderate or low penetrance genes (e.g., CHEK2, ATM, HRAS1, BRIP1, and PALB2), but these mutations account for a relatively small proportion of the heritable risk in these BC families [6], [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Since 2007, several genome-wide association studies of BC [5], [8]–[10], have identified a number of genetic susceptibility loci that are associated with the risk of BC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Recently, a genome-wide association (GWA) study conducted in European ancestry population by Stacey et al. identified a new genetic susceptibility locus, rs13387042, at chromosome 2q35 was associated with BC risk [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>After that, a number of studies have investigated the association between 2q35 rs13387042 polymorphism and BC risk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>However, these studies have yielded conflicting or inconclusive result. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>These disparate findings may be due partly to insufficient power, phenotypic heterogeneity, population stratification, small effect of the polymorphism on BC risk, and even publication biases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we carried out a comprehensive meta-analysis on all eligible studies to estimate the overall BC risk of 2q35-rs13387042 polymorphism as well as to quantify the between-study heterogeneity and potential bias. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of the development and progression of BC is far from being clear at present. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Accumulated evidence suggests that it is a complex polygenic disorder for which genetic factors play an important role in disease etiology [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Common variation rs13387042 at 2q35 was originally identified in large GWA study in European population [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Since then, extensive case-control studies in different populations reported that the rs13387042 polymorphism in 2q35 has been implicated in BC risk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>However, results of genetic association studies were confusing because of the difficulty in replicating significant associations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Different characteristics among studies such as ethnicities, BC subtype, definition of case and control, introduced heterogeneity and made the results of association studies hard to be interpreted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis aiming at finding out the origin of heterogeneity and assessing overall effects of these variants on BC was performed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>This is the first comprehensive meta-analysis that examined the rs13387042 polymorphisms in 2q35 and the relationship with susceptibility for BC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>Its strength was based on the accumulation of published data giving greater information to detect significant differences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>In total, the meta-analysis involved 24 studies for BC that provided 99,772 cases and 164,985 controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Overall, a significant association existed between the 2q35 rs13387042 variant and BC risk. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup analysis, study conducted in Caucasian populations was responsible for heterogeneity, and the ORs between different genetic models and sample size were consistent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>The rs13387042 showed positive association with BC in Asian, Caucasian and Hispanic white populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>However, no associations were found in African descent population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>In fact, the distribution of the less common G allele varies extensively between different races, with a prevalence of ∼88% among Asians, ∼49% among Caucasians and ∼28% among African population [34]–[36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Thus, failing to identify any significant association in Caucasians and other populations could be due to substantially lower statistical power caused by the relatively lower prevalence of G allele of rs13387042. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Such result could also be due to the limited number of studies among African populations, which had insufficient statistical power to detect a slight effect or different linkage disequilibrium (LD) pattern of the polymorphism among African populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Therefore, additional studies are warranted to further validate ethnic difference in the effect of this polymorphism on BC risk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>It is possible that variation at this locus has modest effects on BC, but environmental factors may predominate in the progress of BC, and mask the effects of this variation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Specific life style environmental factors, such as estrogen exposure status and smoking habit have been already well studied in recent decades [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>The unconsidered factors mixed together may cover the role of 2q35-rs13387042 polymorphism. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Findings from previous studies suggested that several SNPs are predominantly associated with ER+ breast cancer: TNRC9-rs3803662 [11], [37], [41], 5p12-rs4415084 [9], 5p12-rs10941679 [9], FGFR2-rs2981582 [9], [43] 8q24-rs13281615 [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>In our results, 2q35-rs13387042 was associated with both ER+ and ER− BC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Similar risks were also observed when stratified by PR status. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>SNP 2q35-rs13387042 showed a strongly statistically significant association with risk in ER+ and PR+ cases compared to ER− and PR− cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Because ER and PR status are the major markers of BC subtypes, these observations suggest that inherited risk variants of these subtypes may vary. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of the observed differences is small, and by themselves these findings are unlikely to have any immediate clinical implications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>However, the observed differences provide clues to the biologic mechanisms that underpin tumor heterogeneity, which may ultimately lead to improved treatment and prevention. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Since rs13387042 is located in a 90-kb region of high LD without any known genes or human RNAs, indicating that further study of the biological function of this SNP is necessary. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>The strengths of this study include the very large sample size, no deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and the high quality of the qualified studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>However, our current study should be interpreted with several technical limitations in mind. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Firstly, the vast majority of white subjects in the study are of European descent, and statistical power for analyses in other ethnicities is limited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Because the sample size was considerably smaller for African studies, the main conclusions from this manuscript are based on analyses among white European and Asian women. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Future studies including larger numbers of Africans are necessary to clarify the consistency of findings across ethnic groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Secondly, our results were based on unadjusted estimates, while a more precise analysis should be conducted if individual data were available, which would allow for the adjustment by other covariates including age, menopausal status, family history, environmental factors and lifestyle [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Third, only published studies were included in this meta-analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Therefore, publication bias may have occurred, even though the use of a statistical test did not show it. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Recently, two meta-analyses found that SLC4A7 and XRCC1 were associated with increased BC susceptibility [45], [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>BC is an extremely complex disease and the same polymorphism may have different roles in different ethnicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Using meta-analysis to combine all available evidence may help to identify new loci for BC susceptibility and thus provide insight into the in vivo relationship between candidate genes and BC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>An improved understanding of the pathogenesis of BC will be beneficial in the diagnosis of prodromal symptoms and in establishing appropriate therapeutic intervention to prevent the onset and the progression of BC. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>In summary, findings from this meta-analysis indicate that 2q35 rs13387042 polymorphism is significantly associated with an increased risk of BC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Further studies should investigate the markers on and adjacent to 2q35 to clarify whether the present association is causal or due to linkage disequilibrium. </plain></SENT>
