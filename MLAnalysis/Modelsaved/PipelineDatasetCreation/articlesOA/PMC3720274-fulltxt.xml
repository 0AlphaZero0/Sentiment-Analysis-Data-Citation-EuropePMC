<italic>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A. actinomycetemcomitans</italic>) is a Gram-negative coccobacillus that causes localized aggressive periodontitis (LAP) <xref rid="pone.0069382-Zambon1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Localized aggressive periodontitis (LAP) causes rapid loss of ligamentous tissue and alveolar bone surrounding first molars and central incisors, resulting in eventual tooth loss. In the general adolescent population in the U.S., LAP has a prevalence of approximately 0.5%; it is 15 times more prevalent among African-American adolescents, compared to the general population <xref rid="pone.0069382-Zambon1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. <italic>A. actinomycetemcomitans</italic> (<italic>Aa</italic>) is also associated with infections of the heart <xref rid="pone.0069382-Yaun1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0069382-Anolik1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, urinary tract <xref rid="pone.0069382-Townsend1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, and brain <xref rid="pone.0069382-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>The two most studied toxins of <italic>Aa</italic> are Cytolethal Distending Toxin (Cdt) and Leukotoxin (LtxA) <xref rid="pone.0069382-Fine1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0069382-FivesTaylor1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Cdt targets a multitude of cells and has been shown to damage gingival tissue in rat and human gingival tissue explants <xref rid="pone.0069382-DamekPoprawa1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. On a functional level Cdt causes cell cycle arrest in rat gingiva when it is applied <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0069382-Ohara1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and induces apoptosis in non-proliferating macrophages <xref rid="pone.0069382-Rabin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. With respect to periodontal disease, Cdt has been linked to induction of RANKL expression in human gingival fibroblasts and periodontal ligament cells <xref rid="pone.0069382-Belibasakis1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and T cells <xref rid="pone.0069382-Belibasakis2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. RANKL interacts with RANK on the surface of osteoclast progenitor cells. This interaction results in the activation of osteoclast progenitor cells to become osteoclasts which resorb bone <xref rid="pone.0069382-Hsu1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>Leukotoxin (LtxA), a member of the RTX toxin family <xref rid="pone.0069382-Lally1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0069382-Welch1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0069382-Welch2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, is related to the <italic>E. coli</italic> hemolysin alpha <xref rid="pone.0069382-Felmlee1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0069382-Kraig1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. LxtA is expressed as an operon of four genes, <italic>ltxA</italic>, <italic>ltxB, ltxC,</italic> and <italic>ltxD</italic>. The structural gene responsible for cell lysis is <italic>ltxA </italic>

</xref>. The cell receptor for LtxA is human lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA-1) <xref rid="pone.0069382-Dileepan1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Leukotoxin disrupts the membranes of target cells. It is thought to be active against polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes in humans and Old World monkeys exclusively <xref rid="pone.0069382-Taichman1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0069382-Taichman2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Different <italic>Aa</italic> strains produce different amounts of leukotoxin, although a correlation between levels of leukotoxin and disease has not been reported. Overall, leukotoxin is thought to be the major virulence factor of <italic>Aa</italic>-induced aggressive periodontitis as defined by bone loss.</p><p>We recently investigated the effect of <italic>Aa</italic> on the rat acquired immune response <xref rid="pone.0069382-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Since Cdt is known to affect lymphocytes, and has been shown to affect rat tissue, we also wanted test the effect of cytolethal distending toxin on rat CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells <italic>in vitro</italic> prior to our testing of a <italic>cdtB</italic> deletion in our rat model of periodontal bone loss. We used LtxA as a control in these lymphocyte <italic>in vitro</italic> studies since previous reports showed that LtxA only affected the lymphocytes of humans and Old World monkeys <xref rid="pone.0069382-Taichman2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Our results showed that leukotoxin and cytolethal distending toxin can affect rat lymphocytes <italic>in vitro.</italic> As a result of these findings we revised our goal to now include <italic>in vivo</italic> studies of the effects of both Cdt and LtxA in a rat model of periodontal disease. In these studies, we are the first to demonstrate that leukotoxin is effective in a rat model of periodontitis and that leukotoxin shows a greater effect on alveolar bone loss when compared to Cdt. Our studies suggest that <italic>Aa-</italic>induced periodontal disease in a rat model can be used to study the interaction of key <italic>Aa</italic> virulence factors and immune regulation on a cellular level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The animal protocol described in this study was approved by the UMDNJ-Newark Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol number 03024.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>

The <italic>cdtB</italic> gene was amplified by PCR using the following primers:</p><p>CdtBF 5&#8242; <named-content content-type="gene">CACCATGCAATGGGTAAAGCAATT</named-content> (1351&#8211;1370 of the Sugai sequence AB011405.1 (Genbank Accession # AB01140405) and CdtBR2 5&#8242;TTAGCGATCATGAACAAAACTAAC (2202&#8211;2178 of the Sugai sequence <xref rid="pone.0069382-Sugai1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>). The cloned <italic>cdtB</italic> gene was verified by sequence analysis using the cloning primers on the plasmid construct. Plasmid DNA of the correct plasmid construct was transformed into the E coli expression strain BL21 (Invitrogen). Induction of <italic>cdtB</italic> expression was performed by incubation with 0.1 mM IPTG after 4 hours of growth. Cells were pelleted and the pellet lysate was run on a (4&#8211;20%) pre-cast polyacryamide gel (Bio-Rad), which showed an induced band at approximately around 30 kDa. The gel was blotted and hybridized with anti-poly-His antibody linked to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma), which demonstrated that the cloned band and the induced band were the same. The strain was grown and the cell pellet was lysed under denaturing conditions and the CdtB polyhistidine fused protein was isolated using a Nickel column (Qiagen). The protein isolated was then dialyzed under stepwise dilutions, decreasing the urea concentration to zero, and increasing the pH to pH7.0 to allow the protein to refold. The final buffer condition was 100 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.0. The recombinant protein was tested against the rat lymphocytes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>
<italic>In vitro</italic> Tests: LtxA Protein Source</title><p>The leukotoxin protein was provided by Dr. Scott Kachlany (Department of Oral Biology, New Jersey Dental School). The LtxA was isolated as previously described <xref rid="pone.0069382-Kachlany1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Briefly, Leukotoxin was isolated from the supernatant of 12 hour cultures of an Aa smooth strain JP2 grown at pH 6.5&#8211;7.0. The cultures were centrifuged to remove cells from the supernatant and put through a.22 micron pore size filter to remove any remaining cells. The filtered supernatant was then put through a standard protein concentrator to further purify and concentrate the protein for use in testing against rat lymphocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>

The purified responder CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were labeled with 1 &#181;M CFSE (carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester) and cultured in RPMI1640 medium, containing 5% FBS, for 2&#8211;5 days at 37&#176;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. Responder CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells were incubated with graded doses of CdtB or LtxA (5 to 50 ng/ml). Control medium in which CdtB and LtxA were diluted were used, respectively, for the control cells. At the end of the culture periods, flow cytometry was conducted. To reduce non-specific staining in the FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorter) analyses, a lymphocyte gate on viable cells was imposed, followed by a gate on CFSE<sup>+</sup> cells, prior to analyses. The extent of CFSE dilution (indicative of proliferation) was determined by computing the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the analyzed cells. FlowJo software (Tree Star) was used to analyze the FACS data.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Tests of <italic>cdtB</italic> and <italic>ltxA</italic> Mutants in a Rat Model of Periodontal Disease</title><sec id="s2e1"><title>Protocol of our rat model of periodontal disease</title><p>In general we followed the rat model protocol we ran in previous studies <xref rid="pone.0069382-Fine2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0069382-Schreiner1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. We conducted one study using the cdtB mutant strain and a second study using the ltxA mutant strain. Eighteen specific-pathogen-free male Sprague Dawley rats (5&#8211;10 week of age) were housed in separate cages and fed powdered food (Laboratory Rodent Meal Diet 5001, Purina Mills Feeds) to promote plaque development. The rats were given 20 mg/ml kanamycin and 20 mg/ml ampicillin in their drinking water for four days to depress the resident flora. During the final two days of antibiotic treatment, the rats&#8217; mouths were also swabbed with chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12% rinse. Following a rinse-out period of three days the rats were divided into three groups of six rats per group for each study. In the first set of experiments, Group 1 was the control and received no bacteria. Group 2 received the cdtB mutant HS1031Rif. Group 3 received wild type Aa strain IDH781NRif. The bacteria inoculation was given three hours after fasting. The inoculum given to Group 2 or Group 3 consisted of 108 bacterial cells in 3% sucrose PBS mixed with a small amount of powdered food, put in special feeder trays, which fit over the bedding in the cage. The Aa strains were grown and inocula were prepared as previously described <xref rid="pone.0069382-Schreiner1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. After an hour the inoculated food was removed and replaced with regular powdered food. This inoculation-feeding regimen was repeated for eight days. The rats were then fed powdered food for a month. The rats were then switched to pellet food to prevent overgrowth of the incisor teeth. In the second study, Group 1 was the control, Group 2 was fed the ltxA mutant strain Aa1700Rif and Group 3 received the wild type strain DF2200Rif.</p><p>Two weeks after bacterial inoculation, the rats&#8217; oral flora was sampled with a cotton tip swab for soft tissue and a Stimudent (Johnson &amp; Johnson) for hard tissue.

We knocked-out the <italic>Aa cdtB</italic> gene to assess its effect on bone loss, assuming that the <italic>cdtB</italic> mutant strain would show reduced bone loss as compared to the parent (control) <italic>Aa</italic> strain that expressed Cdt. Our initial thought was that an <italic>Aa ltxA</italic> knockout would serve as a second control since Cdt was still expressed and bone loss would be unaffected. This design was based on the fact that LtxA, was previously thought to be active only in humans and Old world monkeys <xref rid="pone.0069382-Taichman1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0069382-Taichman2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. However in our <italic>in</italic>
<italic>vitro</italic> study LtxA showed significant activity with rat lymphocytes. Moreover, in a recent study, LtxA has been shown to affect viability of rat lymphocytes <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0069382-DiFranco1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In line with the studies referenced above, results from the current study showed that LtxA was effective in rats <italic>in vivo</italic> and suggest that both virulence factors (Cdt and LtxA) can be studied in a time dependent manner using this rat model of periodontitis. With that as a foundation, this model should be able to contribute to our understanding of <italic>Aa</italic>-induced human periodontal pathogenesis.</p><p>It is clear that all animal models have some limitations; however, when well designed they provide information that extends far beyond what can be learned from <italic>in</italic>
<italic>vitro</italic> studies, which are typically limited to specific cellular response to one cell type <xref rid="pone.0069382-Graves1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In contrast, an animal model can uncover complex cellular interactions <xref rid="pone.0069382-Graves1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In the experiments we report herein we used our <italic>in vitro</italic> system to guide the animal experiments. Our initial expectation was that leukotoxin would be ineffective in our rat model; however our results <italic>in vitro</italic> proved contrary to that assumption. As a result we decided to test leukotoxin in our animal model of <italic>Aa</italic>-induced bone loss. Our methods of assessing bone loss using this model appears to be very sensitive since the model was able to differentiate between LtxA and Cdt induced disease.</p><p>The <italic>in vitro</italic> studies showed that depending on the dose and duration of the toxin under culture conditions, CdtB and LtxA could either inhibit or induce proliferation of rat CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. The basis of this dichotomy in the response of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to CdtB is not entirely clear at present. However, the early inhibition of proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that we have observed, is likely a manifestation of cell cycle arrest in either the G<sub>1</sub>/S or G<sub>2</sub>/M transition phases, and or apoptosis induction, as observed for Cdt toxins <xref rid="pone.0069382-Jinadasa1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Indeed, CdtB was detectable in nuclei of CHO-K1 cells by 4.5 h post intoxication; and, clear evidence of cell membrane damage was seen as early as 18 h post intoxication of human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells; and cell cycle arrest, in response to CdtB, is both dose and time dependent <xref rid="pone.0069382-Shenker2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. However, it is entirely possible that the dichotomous effects of the toxins relate to phases of the adaptive immune response to the toxins. We had previously shown that intact <italic>Aa</italic> induces a significant effect on the adaptive immune response that affects both B and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref rid="pone.0069382-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. It is also reasonable to speculate that exposure of lymphocytes to LtxA could induce a range of biological signaling cascades that could initially either directly or indirectly (via soluble factors), and thus inhibit lymphocyte proliferation. Similarly, at later time points, soluble factors produced could induce proliferation in lymphocytes. Depending on the factor(s) produced, the effect at later time points could be varied. Irrespective of the effects observed in our studies, it is certain that LtxA exhibits effects on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. It has been shown using the adoptive transfer of Aa antigen specific T lymphocytes that T cell specific bone loss can be induced via osteoclastic activation <xref rid="pone.0069382-Yoshie1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Further, T-cell-derived RANKL expression can be blocked with kaliotoxin which also inhibited antigen stimulated Th1 cell proliferation and T cell RANKL expression <xref rid="pone.0069382-Taubman1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Indeed in our previous study <xref rid="pone.0069382-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> we observed upregulation of RANKL in lymphocytes in our rat feeding model where we observed bone loss in disease induced by a wild type <italic>Aa</italic> strain. In that study upregulation of a series of bone morphogenic proteins such as BMPs 2, 3, 10, and 11 were observed suggesting <italic>Aa-</italic>induced regulation of bone loss in our rat model. Overall, those studies suggest that <italic>Aa</italic> affects T cells, which affect bone loss through RANKL expression. Now that we are aware of the activity of leukotoxin in our rat model we plan to examine this relationship in a systematic fashion to determine the effect of leukotoxin on periodontal pathogenesis.</p><p>In future studies, we will investigate the expression of cytokines from T cells in a time dependent manner, comparing the effects of a <italic>cdtB</italic> mutant versus a <italic>ltxA</italic> mutant. We would expect to collect rat lymphocytes at various time points during the infection <xref rid="pone.0069382-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, and then assess the presence and amounts of various cytokines derived from these <italic>Aa</italic> exposed lymphocytes.</p><p>With respect to <italic>Aa</italic> colonization, 19 of the 24 rats inoculated with <italic>Aa</italic> showed detectable <italic>Aa</italic> by culture and 15 of 24 rats showed detectable <italic>Aa</italic> 12 weeks after infection. In most cases 12 week samples had reduced percent of <italic>Aa</italic> relative to the total flora. None of the 12 uninoculated control rats showed any cultivable <italic>Aa.</italic> It is possible that <italic>Aa</italic> would have been detected in all rats had we used PCR, which we have seen in previous studies <xref rid="pone.0069382-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. However, because our goal was to study the effects of LtxA and Cdt we thought it best to assess viable <italic>Aa</italic> as opposed to DNA. <italic>Aa</italic> was presented as a fraction of the total flora which varied from 0.36&#177;0.69&#215;10<sup>&#8722;4</sup> to 7.16&#177;9.6&#215;10<sup>&#8722;4</sup> at 12 weeks in mutant strains. The amounts of Aa as a percentage of total flora when collecting subgingival flora from diseased sites in human cases of LAP also vary widely. In this study plaque samples were collected from a full arch while disease occurred in one or two teeth. Since most of the teeth sampled did not have disease, it is possible that the low percentage of <italic>Aa</italic> is due to its dilution by commensal members of the flora. One survey in humans showed the variation of <italic>Aa</italic> was 0.2%&#8211;5.0% of total flora; while a second survey showed variation from 0.1% to 114% <xref rid="pone.0069382-Moore1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Variation could be due to sampling and recovery but in general these numbers should be considered as estimates.</p><p>One weakness in this study was the fact that no significant differences in the relative antibody response to <italic>Aa</italic> in both rat experiments were seen at 12 weeks post inoculation. A possible explanation for this finding could be the fact that active disease occurred at an earlier stage and that at 12 weeks disease was in remission. In a recent study <xref rid="pone.0069382-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> we found that the antibody level peaked 2&#8211;4 weeks after inoculation. Therefore, had we taken the samples earlier we might have shown significant differences in the various rat groups. In addition, differences may have been seen if we increased the numbers of animals in the treatment groups. This same explanation could be given for the effect of Cdt on bone loss. Our statistical analysis suggests that increasing the numbers of infected rats to 12 could achieve significance with respect to Cdt.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that LtxA (and to some extent Cdt) are involved with bone loss and disease in our rat model of periodontal disease. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies demonstrate that, as observed for intact <italic>Aa</italic>, toxins elaborated by <italic>Aa</italic> (including LtxA and Cdt) exhibit immune-modulating effects on rat CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Previous studies have shown that infection of rats with wild type <italic>Aa in</italic>
<italic>vivo</italic> resulted in induction in of an array of cytokines and bone morphogenic family of proteins in lymphocytes, which may play a role in bone resorption <xref rid="pone.0069382-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The extent to which LtxA and Cdt induce immunoregulatory effects that culminate in bone resorption, remain to be explored in future <italic>Aa</italic>-infected rat experiments.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Thanks to Dr. Barbara Greenberg and Shuying Jiang of the NJ Dental School Office of Research for help with the statistical analysis of the bone loss data.
