</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A. actinomycetemcomitans) is a Gram-negative coccobacillus that causes localized aggressive periodontitis (LAP) [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Localized aggressive periodontitis (LAP) causes rapid loss of ligamentous tissue and alveolar bone surrounding first molars and central incisors, resulting in eventual tooth loss. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In the general adolescent population in the U.S., LAP has a prevalence of approximately 0.5%; it is 15 times more prevalent among African-American adolescents, compared to the general population [1]. A. actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) is also associated with infections of the heart [2], [3], urinary tract [4], and brain [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The two most studied toxins of Aa are Cytolethal Distending Toxin (Cdt) and Leukotoxin (LtxA) [6], [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Cdt targets a multitude of cells and has been shown to damage gingival tissue in rat and human gingival tissue explants [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>On a functional level Cdt causes cell cycle arrest in rat gingiva when it is applied in vivo [9] and induces apoptosis in non-proliferating macrophages [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>With respect to periodontal disease, Cdt has been linked to induction of RANKL expression in human gingival fibroblasts and periodontal ligament cells [11] and T cells [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>RANKL interacts with RANK on the surface of osteoclast progenitor cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>This interaction results in the activation of osteoclast progenitor cells to become osteoclasts which resorb bone [13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Leukotoxin (LtxA), a member of the RTX toxin family [14], [15], [16], is related to the E. coli hemolysin alpha [17], [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>LxtA is expressed as an operon of four genes, ltxA, ltxB, ltxC, and ltxD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The structural gene responsible for cell lysis is ltxA   [14] ,  [18] . </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The cell receptor for LtxA is human lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA-1) [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Leukotoxin disrupts the membranes of target cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>It is thought to be active against polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes in humans and Old World monkeys exclusively [20], [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Different Aa strains produce different amounts of leukotoxin, although a correlation between levels of leukotoxin and disease has not been reported. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Overall, leukotoxin is thought to be the major virulence factor of Aa-induced aggressive periodontitis as defined by bone loss. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>We recently investigated the effect of Aa on the rat acquired immune response [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Since Cdt is known to affect lymphocytes, and has been shown to affect rat tissue, we also wanted test the effect of cytolethal distending toxin on rat CD4+ T cells in vitro prior to our testing of a cdtB deletion in our rat model of periodontal bone loss. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>We used LtxA as a control in these lymphocyte in vitro studies since previous reports showed that LtxA only affected the lymphocytes of humans and Old World monkeys [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that leukotoxin and cytolethal distending toxin can affect rat lymphocytes in vitro. As a result of these findings we revised our goal to now include in vivo studies of the effects of both Cdt and LtxA in a rat model of periodontal disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In these studies, we are the first to demonstrate that leukotoxin is effective in a rat model of periodontitis and that leukotoxin shows a greater effect on alveolar bone loss when compared to Cdt. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Our studies suggest that Aa-induced periodontal disease in a rat model can be used to study the interaction of key Aa virulence factors and immune regulation on a cellular level. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>This study was designed initially to examine Cdt, a key Aa virulence factor, using a rat model of Aa-induced periodontal disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>We knocked-out the Aa cdtB gene to assess its effect on bone loss, assuming that the cdtB mutant strain would show reduced bone loss as compared to the parent (control) Aa strain that expressed Cdt. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Our initial thought was that an Aa ltxA knockout would serve as a second control since Cdt was still expressed and bone loss would be unaffected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>This design was based on the fact that LtxA, was previously thought to be active only in humans and Old world monkeys [20], [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>However in our in vitro study LtxA showed significant activity with rat lymphocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in a recent study, LtxA has been shown to affect viability of rat lymphocytes in vivo [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>In line with the studies referenced above, results from the current study showed that LtxA was effective in rats in vivo and suggest that both virulence factors (Cdt and LtxA) can be studied in a time dependent manner using this rat model of periodontitis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>With that as a foundation, this model should be able to contribute to our understanding of Aa-induced human periodontal pathogenesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>It is clear that all animal models have some limitations; however, when well designed they provide information that extends far beyond what can be learned from in vitro studies, which are typically limited to specific cellular response to one cell type [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>In contrast, an animal model can uncover complex cellular interactions [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>In the experiments we report herein we used our in vitro system to guide the animal experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Our initial expectation was that leukotoxin would be ineffective in our rat model; however our results in vitro proved contrary to that assumption. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>As a result we decided to test leukotoxin in our animal model of Aa-induced bone loss. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Our methods of assessing bone loss using this model appears to be very sensitive since the model was able to differentiate between LtxA and Cdt induced disease. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>The in vitro studies showed that depending on the dose and duration of the toxin under culture conditions, CdtB and LtxA could either inhibit or induce proliferation of rat CD4+ T cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>The basis of this dichotomy in the response of CD4+ T cells to CdtB is not entirely clear at present. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>However, the early inhibition of proliferation of CD4+ T cells that we have observed, is likely a manifestation of cell cycle arrest in either the G1/S or G2/M transition phases, and or apoptosis induction, as observed for Cdt toxins [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Indeed, CdtB was detectable in nuclei of CHO-K1 cells by 4.5 h post intoxication; and, clear evidence of cell membrane damage was seen as early as 18 h post intoxication of human CD4+ T cells; and cell cycle arrest, in response to CdtB, is both dose and time dependent [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>However, it is entirely possible that the dichotomous effects of the toxins relate to phases of the adaptive immune response to the toxins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>We had previously shown that intact Aa induces a significant effect on the adaptive immune response that affects both B and CD4+ T cells [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>It is also reasonable to speculate that exposure of lymphocytes to LtxA could induce a range of biological signaling cascades that could initially either directly or indirectly (via soluble factors), and thus inhibit lymphocyte proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Similarly, at later time points, soluble factors produced could induce proliferation in lymphocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Depending on the factor(s) produced, the effect at later time points could be varied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Irrespective of the effects observed in our studies, it is certain that LtxA exhibits effects on CD4+ T cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>It has been shown using the adoptive transfer of Aa antigen specific T lymphocytes that T cell specific bone loss can be induced via osteoclastic activation [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Further, T-cell-derived RANKL expression can be blocked with kaliotoxin which also inhibited antigen stimulated Th1 cell proliferation and T cell RANKL expression [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Indeed in our previous study [22] we observed upregulation of RANKL in lymphocytes in our rat feeding model where we observed bone loss in disease induced by a wild type Aa strain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>In that study upregulation of a series of bone morphogenic proteins such as BMPs 2, 3, 10, and 11 were observed suggesting Aa-induced regulation of bone loss in our rat model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Overall, those studies suggest that Aa affects T cells, which affect bone loss through RANKL expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Now that we are aware of the activity of leukotoxin in our rat model we plan to examine this relationship in a systematic fashion to determine the effect of leukotoxin on periodontal pathogenesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>In future studies, we will investigate the expression of cytokines from T cells in a time dependent manner, comparing the effects of a cdtB mutant versus a ltxA mutant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>We would expect to collect rat lymphocytes at various time points during the infection [22], and then assess the presence and amounts of various cytokines derived from these Aa exposed lymphocytes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>With respect to Aa colonization, 19 of the 24 rats inoculated with Aa showed detectable Aa by culture and 15 of 24 rats showed detectable Aa 12 weeks after infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>In most cases 12 week samples had reduced percent of Aa relative to the total flora. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>None of the 12 uninoculated control rats showed any cultivable Aa. It is possible that Aa would have been detected in all rats had we used PCR, which we have seen in previous studies [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>However, because our goal was to study the effects of LtxA and Cdt we thought it best to assess viable Aa as opposed to DNA. Aa was presented as a fraction of the total flora which varied from 0.36±0.69×10−4 to 7.16±9.6×10−4 at 12 weeks in mutant strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>The amounts of Aa as a percentage of total flora when collecting subgingival flora from diseased sites in human cases of LAP also vary widely. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>In this study plaque samples were collected from a full arch while disease occurred in one or two teeth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Since most of the teeth sampled did not have disease, it is possible that the low percentage of Aa is due to its dilution by commensal members of the flora. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>One survey in humans showed the variation of Aa was 0.2%–5.0% of total flora; while a second survey showed variation from 0.1% to 114% [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Variation could be due to sampling and recovery but in general these numbers should be considered as estimates. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>One weakness in this study was the fact that no significant differences in the relative antibody response to Aa in both rat experiments were seen at 12 weeks post inoculation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>A possible explanation for this finding could be the fact that active disease occurred at an earlier stage and that at 12 weeks disease was in remission. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>In a recent study [22] we found that the antibody level peaked 2–4 weeks after inoculation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Therefore, had we taken the samples earlier we might have shown significant differences in the various rat groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>In addition, differences may have been seen if we increased the numbers of animals in the treatment groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>This same explanation could be given for the effect of Cdt on bone loss. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>Our statistical analysis suggests that increasing the numbers of infected rats to 12 could achieve significance with respect to Cdt. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we have shown that LtxA (and to some extent Cdt) are involved with bone loss and disease in our rat model of periodontal disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Our in vitro studies demonstrate that, as observed for intact Aa, toxins elaborated by Aa (including LtxA and Cdt) exhibit immune-modulating effects on rat CD4+ T cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that infection of rats with wild type Aa in vivo resulted in induction in of an array of cytokines and bone morphogenic family of proteins in lymphocytes, which may play a role in bone resorption [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>The extent to which LtxA and Cdt induce immunoregulatory effects that culminate in bone resorption, remain to be explored in future Aa-infected rat experiments. </plain></SENT>
