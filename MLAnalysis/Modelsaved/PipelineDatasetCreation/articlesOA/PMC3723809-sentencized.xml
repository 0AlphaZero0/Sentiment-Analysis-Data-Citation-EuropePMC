</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>C. trachomatis, a gram-negative bacterium, is estimated to infect 90 million people worldwide each year [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In some individuals these infections cause long-term consequences including pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, sterility or blindness [2]–[5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Although Chlamydia can be treated with anti-bacterials, many infections are asymptomatic and therefore go untreated [3], [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A prophylactic vaccine has long been sought against C. trachomatis but has yet to be obtained [7]–[9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The Chlamydia major outer membrane protein, MOMP, is a primary target of vaccine development because it is highly antigenic and comprises ∼60% of the outer membrane protein mass [8], [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>MOMP, coded by the ompA gene, is considered a member of the general porin class of proteins (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop">http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop</ext-link>) [11], a group important for the passive transport of ions, sugars and nucleotides across the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria [12]–[14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Porins have a structural topology comprised of antiparallel β-strands spanning the outer membrane, a water-filled inner channel, tight β-turns extending into the periplasmic region and flexible loops reaching beyond the extracellular surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Several studies have confirmed that the C. trachomatis MOMP shares the characteristics of other gram-negative bacterial porins; it has a monomeric molecular weight of 39.5 kDa, a hydrophobic residue content of ∼40%, and migration patterns on SDS-page gels consistent with trimeric oligomerization [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Native MOMP also transports sugars at rates similar to Pseudomonas aeruginosa OprF [15]–[17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Structural characterization of MOMP remains elusive for a number of reasons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Attempts to generate crystals for X-ray crystallographic studies with native MOMP proteins have been unsuccessful. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Recombinant Chlamydia MOMP protein has been expressed in other systems but has been intractable due to inclusion body formation and very low refolding yields, most likely due to its highly hydrophobic nature and presence of a high number of cysteine residues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Notably, Chlamydia does not have an available genetic system like other bacteria, such as E. coli, and only recently a transformation system limited to the plasmid was described [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Yet, there is an urgent need to elucidate MOMP structural details and understand the conformation of its protective epitopes in order to formulate a vaccine. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Computational homology modeling is a useful alternative method for generating protein structural models in the absence of experimental structural data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>However, direct homology modeling methods cannot be performed for the MOMP because it has little detectable sequence identity to β-barrels with solved structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In general, protein structure is much more conserved than sequence as species diverge, often to the point where no detectable sequence similarity exists between pairs of sequences sharing the same structural fold. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The β-barrel porins are an excellent example of this phenomenon with many sequence pairs sharing very low sequence identity (sometimes only ∼11%) based on structural alignment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>These diverged sequences all share strongly conserved structural features that can be used to inform computational models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>These features include: (1) even number of anti-parallel trans-membrane strands; (2) a relatively high abundance of small hydrophobic residues at the center of the trans-membrane strands facing the membrane; and (3) girdles of aromatic residues at the membrane interfaces [12], [19], [20]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Algorithms have been developed over the past decade to predict β-barrel secondary structure features using “rules” based on these conserved features with a varying degree of detail [21]–[24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Some algorithms predict whether the query sequence more likely belongs to a membrane β-barrel versus a globular protein [25]–[27], while others predict the number (i.e. 8, 10 12, 16, 22-stranded) and position of membrane spanning β-strands [20], [28], [29]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>To date, several groups have assigned secondary structure topology for MOMP of Chlamydia muridarum (previously called Chlamydia trachomatis mouse pneumonitis, MoPn) and C. trachomatis serovars D and F based on these algorithms, biochemical and immunological data [30]–[32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>These studies provide fairly similar assignments of the transmembrane strands; all suggest an overall 16-stranded topology, the models vary primarily in the length and placement of periplasmic turns and external loops with a few variations in positions of β-strands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>However, these topologies cannot be directly translated into a 3D molecular model based on published 16-stranded trimeric β-barrels coordinates because the topology maps do not incorporate one or more of the structural elements of these 3D coordinates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>For example, all known 16-stranded β-barrel porin crystal structures have an eyelet loop that folds into the pore center and is formed by the third loop [33]; the number of residues demarked as loop 3 in two of the three published topology maps are too short to form this conserved structural feature. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In this work, a recently developed suite of β-barrel topology prediction algorithms, TMBpro [29], combined with comparative homology building methods, and model refinement were used to develop a three-dimensional 16-stranded β-barrel homo-trimer model for the C. trachomatis MOMP protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>These methods and the resulting structures illustrate regions where the MOMP protein sequence is consistent with structural and functional features of 16-stranded templates, as well as regions that are structurally inconsistent with known templates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>This enigma motivates further experimental structural studies of this important vaccine target. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The results assign fairly equal probability to the MOMP monomer subunit being comprised of 10-, 12-, 14-, 16- or 18- β–strands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the TMBpro server predicts the probabilities of individual residues in transmembrane β-strands (SI Table 1). Figure 2 compares the predicted β-strand limits to those predicted using Pred-TMBB [22] and TMBeta-NET [26], [34] webservers and the previously published 2D topology maps for the MOMP porin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Several trends can be observed from this comparison: (1) the variable domain regions are predicted to be outside the trans-membrane β-strands; (2) all the algorithms predict similar residues to be in the first 2 and final β-strands; and (3) there is not a consensus for the limits of the remaining β-strands or, in some regions, whether a β-strand is present or not. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Specifically, it is clear that all the algorithms suggest the presence of a long cysteine-containing loop spanning residues G20 to D34, but the Y89 to T100, F113– F139, V203 - I217, A280 – P288, and I341 – V355 sequences have little prediction consensus. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>The most convincing experimental evidence is the detection of oligomeric structures for MOMP [15], which would exclude all currently solved 14-stranded barrels as templates and be more consistent with a 16- or 18-stranded barrel. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>This unique nature of MOMP is not likely to be merely a shortcoming of trying to model a twilight zone protein, but rather reflects constraints that cannot be resolved based on the necessity for VD4 to be external to the pore and the unlikelihood that a sequence of charged residues K334 – S339 form a trans-membrane strand. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Baehr et al. [65] proposed that the TTLNPTIAGK region in VD4, that is conserved among all the human C. trachomatis serovars, might be folded to form a practically inaccessible loop that can served as a site for attachment to the eukaryotic cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>This constraint may explain some of the difficulties we have encountered modeling this region of the protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>The possibility that MOMP exists in multiple conformations, similar to the major porin OprF of P. aeruginosa, cannot be ruled out [56]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Unlike P. aeruginosa, Chlamydia do not have a peptidoglycan layer, although other proteins (in particular the cysteine-rich proteins 15 and 60-kDa) may play a compensatory biological role and MOMP may interact with them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>It seems likely that MOMP adopts multiple conformations during the developmental cycle of Chlamydia and, in addition, that MOMP cysteine residues interact with other periplasmic proteins (again the 15 and 60 kDa cysteine-rich proteins) as indicated by Sugawara et al [56]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the inability of current algorithms to assign significant probabilities to the C-terminus strand assignments for MOMP (Figures 1 and 2) could arise from the multiple conformations, on which the prediction algorithms have not been trained. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>While methods other than template based homology modeling exist for developing structural models, namely ab initio folding through constrained simulated annealing [66], perhaps including constraints based on residue covariance across orthologs [67], [68], MOMP is at the upper limit of protein sequence length tried with covariance methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the number of MOMP orthologs sequenced is comparatively low for developing these constraints and recent attempts for covariance constraints on β-barrel proteins have given results with mixed success [68]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Overall, this 3D MOMP model represents the best case for incorporation of current experimentally derived knowledge for MOMP and structural knowledge for bacterial β-barrels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Although the model is speculative in relation to a comparative model built with higher sequence identity to 16-stranded β-barrels, it does illustrate intriguing unique features that motivate further structural and functional investigations for this important vaccine target. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Default settings, including automated disulfide bond detection were set to give 25 “medium” refined structures per alignment and scored based on contact energy, packing score and MOE's GB/VI energy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Manually derived sequence alignments were maintained between each template and MOMP sequence during model building by constraining the putative β-strand regions (17–20 constraints per run). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>This limited number of constraints allows some modifications in β-strand alignment thus different model outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>The models were analyzed for relative energies and protein geometry to minimize the number of outlier residues for Ramachandran values, bond lengths, angles, and rotameric states. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>The TMBpro server output includes per residue predictions for the query sequence into three bins; membrane-facing, channel-facing or non-transmembrane. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Adjustment to the automated TMBpro β-strand to template alignments were made after considering the following criteria: (i) consensus of β-strand residues by various algorithms, Figure 2, (ii) comparison with β-strand positions in published 2D topology maps, Figure 2, (iii) the probabilities for channel facing (C) and membrane-facing (M) (SI Table 1), and (iv) aromatic residue positions consistent with the putative membrane interface. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>The probabilities for channel facing vs. membrane-facing residues provided a crucial criterion for assessing specific residue alignments to the templates, especially where residues would not be considered entirely hydrophobic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>For example, lysine or arginine residues are generally considered unfavorable as membrane-facing residues due to their charged functional groups, yet there is precedence for these residues to “snorkel” [20] at β-strand termini. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Snorkeling involves the positioning of long hydrophobic side chains inside the membrane and charged groups at the polar membrane interface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>Additionally, although threonine residues are not hydrophobic, they are found to be membrane facing more often than expected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Deviations from the concept of merely alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic residue patterns in trans-membrane β-strands has been noted by Wimley, et al. [19], who found that analyzing abundance patterns for residues enriched at β-strand centers or membrane limits may provide a more reliable prediction scheme for residue orientation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>The higher resolution OmpF coordinates have fewer contact errors at the trimer interface and hence propagates fewer errors to the MOMP model. </plain></SENT>
