<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One approach to this question has been to examine the genetic basis of convergent traits, which likely evolved repeatedly under a shared selective pressure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We investigated the convergent phenotype of blue iris pigmentation, which has arisen independently in four primate lineages: humans, blue-eyed black lemurs, Japanese macaques, and spider monkeys. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Characterizing the phenotype across these species, we found that the variation within the blue-eyed subsets of each species occupies strongly overlapping regions of CIE L*a*b* color space. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Yet whereas Japanese macaques and humans display continuous variation, the phenotypes of blue-eyed black lemurs and their sister species (whose irises are brown) occupy more clustered subspaces. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Variation in an enhancer of OCA2 is primarily responsible for the phenotypic difference between humans with blue and brown irises. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the orthologous region, we found no variant that distinguishes the two lemur species or associates with quantitative phenotypic variation in Japanese macaques. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Given the high similarity between the blue iris phenotypes in these species and that in humans, this finding implies that evolution has used different molecular paths to reach the same end. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Examples of convergent evolution, the independent acquisition of the same trait in different populations or species, may be highly informative with regard to questions of evolutionary predictability and constraint because these likely represent multiple solutions to similar selective pressures (see, e.g., Conway Morris, 2003; Christin et al., 2010; Losos, 2011). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>To date, cases of convergence have been found to occur through independent coding changes in the same gene (e.g., Mundy, 2005; Christin et al., 2008; Gross et al., 2009; Kingsley et al., 2009); through changes in distinct non-coding elements regulating the same gene (e.g., Miller et al., 2007); through distinct changes in the same regulatory element (e.g., Tishkoff et al., 2007); or even through changes in the same protein domains (e.g., Aminetzach et al., 2009; Feldman et al., 2012) or at the same amino acids (e.g., Li et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2010b; Shen et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In other cases, changes in distinct loci result in the evolution of the same trait (e.g., Chen et al., 1997; Hoekstra et al., 2006; Borowsky, 2008; Steiner et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Most studies have found that convergent phenotypes tend to evolve through changes within the same gene (Conte et al., 2012; Martin and Orgogozo, in press) or within a particular pathway (e.g., Chan et al., 2012; Tenaillon et al., 2012); in the absence of a reporting bias, these findings indicate that the number of permissible paths to a trait is often limited. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Many of these reported cases of phenotypic convergence involve pigmentation (see Hubbard et al., 2010), notably in the color of skin (Miller et al., 2007; Gross et al., 2009), fur (Hoekstra et al., 2006; Kingsley et al., 2009; Steiner et al., 2009), or plumage (Mundy, 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In primates, blue iris pigmentation has been documented in four different lineages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In humans (Homo sapiens), the prevalence of the trait increases with latitude from 24 to 55% in European populations (Zanetti et al., 1996; Laeng et al., 2007); it has also been observed in populations with European admixture (Frudakis et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata), which are endemic to the broad-leaved deciduous and evergreen forests of Japan (Oi, 2002; Abe et al., 2005), blue or intermediate iris color has been observed at frequencies of 12 to 19% in colonies on Shodoshima and Kyushu islands (Yamagiwa, 1979; Zhang and Watanabe, 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Blue irises have also been reported in the brown spider monkey (Ateles hybridus, formerly Ateles belzebuth hybridus; Hernandez-Camacho and Cooper, 1976; Konstant et al., 1985) and closely related Colombian black spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi or fusciceps, subspecies rufiventris; Hernandez-Camacho and Cooper, 1976; Defler et al., 2004), which inhabit evergreen, semi-deciduous, and montane seasonal forests in Colombia, Panama, and Venezuela (Mondolfi and Eisenberg, 1979; Defler et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Although the prevalence of this trait in these species has not been extensively documented, approximately 13% of a population of brown spider monkeys in north central Colombia has blue irises (R. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Rimbach and A. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Link, personal communication). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In contrast to these other species, all blue-eyed black lemurs (Eulemur flavifrons, formerly Eulemur macaco flavifrons) have blue irises, whereas in the most closely related species, the black lemur (Eulemur macaco, formerly Eulemur macaco macaco), all individuals have brown irises (Mittermeier et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>These sister species inhabit primary and secondary tropical sub-humid forests in a narrow range in northwestern Madagascar (Rabarivola et al., 1991; Andrianjakarivelo, 2004; Randriatahina and Rabarivola, 2004) and hybridize across part of this range (Rabarivola et al., 1991). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Given that almost all other primates have brown or yellow irises (Kobayashi and Kohshima, 2001), blue iris pigmentation can be inferred to be a derived trait that has arisen independently on these lineages. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Beyond these broad strokes, the extent of iris pigmentation variation within and between species has not been characterized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In particular, it is not yet clear whether the reported blue irises represent the same phenotype in all species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Demonstrating such similarity is important, as if the derived phenotypes were different, we would anticipate the involvement of distinct genetic loci. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Thus, mapping the traits would not provide additional information with regard to evolutionary constraint. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Quantitative measures of iris pigmentation variation, recently demonstrated to be associated with genetic variation in humans (Liu et al., 2010a; Edwards et al., 2012), provide a way of evaluating phenotypic similarity across species. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In humans, the phenotype of blue iris pigmentation has well understood molecular and genetic underpinnings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Observable human “eye color” depends upon the amount and type of melanin within the outermost layers of the iris (Prota et al., 1998; Wielgus and Sarna, 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Whether human irises are blue or brown can be predicted with &gt;80% accuracy by the genotype at a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs12913832, in a regulatory element influencing the expression of OCA2 (Eiberg et al., 2008; Sturm et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2009; Visser et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The OCA2 gene itself encodes a transport protein expressed in the iris that influences the development of melanocytes (Rinchik et al., 1993; Brilliant, 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>In addition to the main effect SNP, variants within OCA2 and at least 12 other genes have been more weakly associated with human iris color variation; these likely act as modifiers of iris color with smaller effect size (Kanetsky et al., 2002; Frudakis et al., 2003; Graf et al., 2005; Duffy et al., 2007; Kayser et al., 2008; Sturm et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Age strongly influences human iris color variation, and sex has a significant but weak effect (Liu et al., 2010a). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Our understanding of the genetic basis of blue iris pigmentation in humans can inform hypotheses regarding the genetic basis in other primates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In humans, several coding sequence mutations and deletions of coding regions in OCA2 cause oculocutaneous albinism, or severely reduced pigmentation of the hair, skin, and irises (Manga and Orlow, 1999; Oetting and King, 1999), whereas regulatory SNP rs12913832 has a more moderate influence on hair and skin phenotypes (Sulem et al., 2007; Branicki et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>If dramatic pigmentation reduction in skin or fur were deleterious in other primates, we may expect blue irises to evolve via regulatory mutations in these species as well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Notably, SNP rs12913832 lies within a stretch of 410 bp demonstrating strong conservation among mammals; thus, this region is a strong candidate for variants with the capacity to influence OCA2 expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Bradley et al. (2009) sequenced 166 bp of the orthologous region and found no fixed differences between the two lemur species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>They identified one variant that was polymorphic within the blue-eyed black lemurs but not the black lemurs sequenced, a pattern that could be suggestive of this variant or a linked site contributing to pigmentation differences. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Several lines of evidence support the idea that blue irises have fitness effects in humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The rarity of observation of the phenotype in nature, in combination with observed deleterious pleiotropic consequences in humans (Eagle Jr, 1994; Imesch et al., 1997; Metallinos et al., 1998; Santschi et al., 1998; Yang et al., 1998; Smith et al., 2000; Pingault et al., 2010) and domesticated animals (Juraschko et al., 2003; Geigy et al., 2007; Hauswirth et al., 2012), suggests that some benefit would be required to overcome purifying selection against these pleiotropic effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Population genetic evidence also supports recent positive selection at the locus responsible for the majority of the phenotypic variation in humans (Voight et al., 2006; Donnelly et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanism driving this population genetic signature is unclear, direct selection for blue irises to improve short wavelength perception (Bornstein, 1973; Laeng et al., 2007), selection for light skin pigmentation to increase vitamin D absorption (see, e.g., Jablonski and Chaplin, 2000; Parra, 2007), and sexual selection (Darwin, 1871; Diamond, 1992; Aoki, 2002; Frost, 2006; Laeng et al., 2007) may have played a part. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Evidence for an adaptive value of blue irises in non-human primates is more limited; however, pleiotropy and sexual selection may also have played a role in these species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>In Japanese macaques, the presence of blue irises is moderately correlated with reduced pigment in fur (Yamagiwa, 1979), so selection on lighter fur could also have increased the frequency of blue irises. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Of note, Japanese macaques have the northern-most range of any non-human primate (30°21' to 41°08'; Oi, 2002), so selection either for increased absorption of UVB or for short wavelength perception could have occurred in this species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>In contrast, neither blue-eyed black lemurs (which are more lightly pigmented than black lemurs among females; Mittermeier et al., 2008) nor either species of spider monkey with blue irises live at extreme latitudes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Several adaptive hypotheses involving blue irises, including sexual selection and species recognition, have been proposed for the blue-eyed black lemur (Bradley et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, blue irises may have risen to high frequency by chance (i.e., via genetic drift) in the non-human primate species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Identifying the loci that underlie blue iris pigmentation in these species would help in evaluating hypotheses about the selective pressures shaping the evolution of this phenotype. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Although some subset of all four species appears to have blue irises, it is unclear whether this “blue” trait is the same in all lineages, and hence whether we expect the degree of similarity in its genetic basis to be informative with regard to evolutionary constraint. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Thus, we first assessed the similarity in the derived trait among species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Given the success of quantitative methods in describing heritable human iris color variation and in detecting genetic associations (Liu et al., 2010a; Edwards et al., 2012), we assessed quantitative variation across species using the CIE L*a*b* color system. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>In this color space, individuals with blue irises occupy a highly similar region in all species (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>When considering both blue and non-blue irises, however, each species has a slightly different overall phenotypic distribution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>Along the magenta-green (CIE a*) axis, lemurs occupy the most restricted region; given that our sample size is limited, a* variation may be greater in natural populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Despite this limitation, variation on the yellow-blue (CIE b*) axis appears to be greater in lemurs than in any of the other species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Some wild macaques have lower (i.e., more green) CIE a* values than any members of the other species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Considering the relatively complete representation of iris color variation in humans and Japanese macaques in our sample, this may indicate that some macaques have more green irises than humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Both macaques and humans have continuous variation between blue and brown (Fig. 2A,D), but the relative positions of irises characterized as brown and intermediate differ slightly between species (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Brown spider monkeys occupy the smallest range of any species, which could be due to their limited sample size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Additionally, this species was the least consistently categorized (Figs. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>In Japanese macaques, the mixture normal model did not fit significantly better than the simple normal model for CIE a* or b* (P = 0.21 and P = 0.31, respectively), suggesting that intermediate phenotypes represent a larger proportion of these samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>This may be due to non-random sampling of Japanese macaques with a preference for lighter iris color. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>When including only eight individuals, as in the lemurs, none of the 1,000 random samples of Japanese macaques and only 3 (JPEG) or 12 (RAW) of the random samples of humans had likelihood ratio test statistics more extreme than the lemurs for CIE b* (Supporting Information Table S4), suggesting that the extreme clustering in lemurs along this axis would not be observed even in a small sample of the other two species. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Our quantitative analysis of iris color variation in the four primate species known to have blue irises revealed the blue iris phenotype to be highly similar across species (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Yet our sequencing results indicated that no variant within the region homologous to the causal regulatory region in humans is solely responsible for blue iris pigmentation in either blue-eyed black lemurs or Japanese macaques. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Regardless of the genetic architecture underlying the phenotypic variation in these other organisms, the genotype-phenotype map clearly differs from that in humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Given that the derived phenotype displays marked similarity among species, this implies some level of flexibility in the evolution of this trait. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Our comparison of the phenotypic variation across species suggests hypotheses about the genetic basis of blue irises in Japanese macaques and blue-eyed black lemurs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>In humans, iris color varies continuously (e.g., Frudakis et al., 2007; Edwards et al., 2012); however, our perception of this spectrum of variation has led us to categorize iris color into discrete classes: e.g., blue, green, and brown (Kayser et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2010a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>The genetic basis of iris color variation in humans reflects both these perceived discrete categories (&gt;80% of the variation in blue vs. brown can be explained by a single mutation) and the underlying continuous nature of the phenotype (several additional loci with more modest effects have been identified; see, e.g., Sulem et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2010a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>In Japanese macaques, as in humans, iris color variation is continuous in CIE L*a*b* space (Fig. 2A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>This may suggest that one or a few loci have strong effect, producing the perceived blue/brown distinction, with additional genetic or environmental modifiers generating a continuous spectrum between these extremes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>In contrast, phenotypic variation is discontinuous between the photographed blue-eyed black lemurs and black lemurs; one or more fixed genetic differences contributing to iris color differences between species could explain this discontinuity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, the derived trait may result from a combination of changes in several genes, thus allowing specific variants to segregate within blue-eyed black lemurs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Additional phenotypic data from brown spider monkey populations might enable predictions about the genetic architecture of iris color variation in this species as well. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>The observation of a variant just upstream of the human causal variant in the sample of blue-eyed black lemurs, but not the sample of black lemurs, raises the possibility that this variant or one linked to it influences iris pigmentation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Although this variant cannot produce blue irises on its own, it could do so in combination with variation at other loci. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Such a complex genetic basis for iris pigmentation could explain the intermediate phenotype observed in hybrids between blue-eyed black lemurs and black lemurs (Meyers et al., 1989; Rabarivola et al., 1991). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>The similarity in derived phenotype among humans, Japanese macaques, blue-eyed black lemurs, and brown spider monkeys makes it more likely that causal sites in the non-human primates lie within regions containing variation influencing OCA2 and other known pigmentation genes in humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Moreover, given the deleterious effects of many coding mutations in OCA2 in humans (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://albinismdb.med.umn.edu">http://albinismdb.med.umn.edu</ext-link>) and, more generally, the ability of regulatory variants to produce subtle and tissue-specific changes in phenotype (Stern, 2000; Carroll et al., 2001; Carroll, 2005), regulatory regions may be a priori more likely to contain the causal site or sites than coding regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>These considerations suggest that studies investigating genomic regions involved in human pigmentation in the three non-human primates will enhance our knowledge of the level of similarity in the genetic basis of iris pigmentation across species and inform our understanding of the evolutionary constraint on this convergent phenotype. </plain></SENT>
