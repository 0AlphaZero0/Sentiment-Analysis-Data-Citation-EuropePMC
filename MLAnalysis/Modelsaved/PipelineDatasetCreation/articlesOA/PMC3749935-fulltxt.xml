<article-title>Fifty Years On: GWAS Confirms the Role of a Rare Variant in Lung Disease</article-title>
</related-article><abstract><p>Several infrequent genetic polymorphisms in the <italic>SERPINA1</italic> gene are known to substantially reduce concentration of alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) in the blood. Since low AAT serum levels fail to protect pulmonary tissue from enzymatic degradation, these polymorphisms also increase the risk for early onset chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The role of more common <italic>SERPINA1</italic> single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in respiratory health remains poorly understood.</p><p>We present here an agnostic investigation of genetic determinants of circulating AAT levels in a general population sample by performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 1392 individuals of the SAPALDIA cohort.</p><p>Five common SNPs, defined by showing minor allele frequencies (MAFs) &gt;5%, reached genome-wide significance, all located in the <italic>SERPINA</italic> gene cluster at 14q32.13. The top-ranking genotyped SNP rs4905179 was associated with an estimated effect of &#946;&#8202;=&#8202;&#8722;0.068 g/L per minor allele (P&#8202;=&#8202;1.20*10<sup>&#8722;12</sup>). But denser <italic>SERPINA1</italic> locus genotyping in 5569 participants with subsequent stepwise conditional analysis, as well as exon-sequencing in a subsample (N&#8202;=&#8202;410), suggested that AAT serum level is causally determined at this locus by rare (MAF&lt;1%) and low-frequent (MAF 1&#8211;5%) variants only, in particular by the well-documented protein inhibitor S and Z (PI S, PI Z) variants. Replication of the association of rs4905179 with AAT serum levels in the Copenhagen City Heart Study (N&#8202;=&#8202;8273) was successful (P&lt;0.0001), as was the replication of its synthetic nature (the effect disappeared after adjusting for PI S and Z, P&#8202;=&#8202;0.57). Extending the analysis to lung function revealed a more complex situation. Only in individuals with severely compromised pulmonary health (N&#8202;=&#8202;397), associations of common SNPs at this locus with lung function were driven by rarer PI S or Z variants. Overall, our meta-analysis of lung function in ever-smokers does not support a functional role of common SNPs in the <italic>SERPINA</italic> gene cluster in the general population.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Low levels of alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) in the blood are a well-established risk factor for accelerated loss in lung function and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. While a few infrequent genetic polymorphisms are known to influence the serum levels of this enzyme, the role of common genetic variants has not been examined so far. The present genome-wide scan for associated variants in approximately 1400 Swiss inhabitants revealed a chromosomal locus containing the functionally established variants of AAT deficiency and variants previously associated with lung function and emphysema. We used dense genotyping of this genetic region in more than 5500 individuals and subsequent conditional analyses to unravel which of these associated variants contribute independently to the phenotype's variability. All associations of common variants could be attributed to the rarer functionally established variants, a result which was then replicated in an independent population-based Danish cohort. Hence, this locus represents a textbook example of how a large part of a trait's heritability can be hidden in infrequent genetic polymorphisms. The attempt to transfer these results to lung function furthermore suggests that effects of common variants in this genetic region in ever-smokers may also be explained by rarer variants, but only in individuals with hampered pulmonary health.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This SAPALDIA project was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grants: 33CS30_134276/1, 33CSCO-108796, 3247BO-104283, 3247BO-104288, 3247BO-104284, 3247-065896, 3100-059302, 3200-052720, 3200-042532, 4026-028099, 3233-054996, PDFMP3-123171); the Federal Office for Forest, Environment and Landscape; the Federal Office of Public Health; the Federal Office of Roads and Transport; the canton's government of Aargau, Basel-Stadt, Basel-Land, Geneva, Luzern, Ticino, Valais and Zurich; the Swiss Lung League; the canton's Lung League of Basel Stadt, Basel Landschaft, Geneva, Ticino, Valais and Zurich; Schweizerische Unfallversicherungsanstalt (SUVA); Freiwillige Akademische Gesellschaft; UBS Wealth Foundation; Talecris Biotherapeutics GmbH; Grifols; Abbott Diagnostics; Kedrion S.p.A.; IRCCS (Istituto di ricovero e cura a carattere scientifico) Foundation San Matteo Hospital; and Cariplo Foundation 2006 projects.

Its main function is to inhibit neutrophil elastase and consequently protect pulmonary tissue. The <italic>SERPINA1</italic> gene encoding the AAT protein is known to be polymorphic in the general population. The best studied single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) causing a reduction in AAT serum levels are the protease inhibitor S (PI S, rs17580) and the protease inhibitor Z (PI Z, rs28929474) variants <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Brantly1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The loss of function mechanism is especially well investigated for the PI Z variant. The resulting amino acid change in AAT leads to the protein's intracellular polymerization in hepatocytes and therefore to a reduced level of secreted serum AAT <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Lomas1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Homozygosity for PI Z (PI ZZ genotype) with a frequency of about 0.01% in Caucasian populations <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Luisetti1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> causes blood AAT levels below 30% of normal. This genotype is clearly associated with elevated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) risk accounting for 1&#8211;2% of all cases <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Lieberman1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003585-1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. There is also strong evidence that accelerated lung function decline and increased obstructive disease risk can be caused by compound heterozygosity of PI Z and PI S (PI SZ genotype). The case is less clear for PI MZ, PI MS or PI SS genotypes (PI M standing for the normal allele), which cause a less pronounced reduction in AAT concentration, as previous studies produced inconsistent evidence <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Hersh1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgen.1003585-Thun1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Further of note, large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on COPD or on cross-sectional or longitudinal lung function have not identified the <italic>SERPINA1</italic> gene to be a major genetic determinant <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Wilk1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgen.1003585-Imboden1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.

Towards that aim, but also to detect further chromosomal loci of potential relevance to circulating levels of AAT, we first performed a GWAS on AAT serum level using a subset of the population-based Swiss Cohort Study of Air Pollution and Lung Disease in Adults (SAPALDIA) as discovery sample, and a second subset of SAPALDIA as well as an independent cohort, the Copenhagen City Heart Study (henceforth referred to as Copenhagen), as replication sample. We also conducted fine mapping analyses of the <italic>SERPINA1</italic> gene in the SAPALDIA cohort.

The subjects with rare variants had a lower adjusted mean AAT level (0.904 g/L, 95% CI 0.884 to 0.924 g/L) compared to those without rare variants (0.992 g/L, 95% CI 0.984 to 1.000 g/L, P&lt;0.001). Although this difference is small, the range covers the recently proposed upper limit of intermediate AAT deficiency (0.92 g/L), a value with some clinical relevance <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Ferrarotti1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. AAT levels of carriers of synonymous mutations or non-synonymous mutations without predicted damaging consequences to protein structure (N&#8202;=&#8202;20) were not different from those carrying no rare variants (0.985 vs. 0.990 g/L, P&#8202;=&#8202;0.77). Assuming that unsequenced samples were negative for mutations with predicted deleterious functional effects, the total variance of explained AAT further increased from 32.8% to 35.4% (based on a statistical model adding all rare mutations with predicted damaging consequences to the protein structure).</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Common and Low-Frequent <italic>SERPINA1</italic> SNPs Previously Associated with Lung Function</title><p>

The SNPs rs4905179 (associated with emphysema in smokers <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Kong1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>) and rs3748312 (associated with cross-sectional lung function among ever smokers <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Obeidat1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>) were strongly associated with AAT in our study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003585-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003585-t004">4</xref>), but both signals disappeared upon adjustment for the low-frequent variants PI S and Z. In order to clarify whether the association of the two common SNPs with pulmonary health could also be explained by effects of the rarer SNPs, we conducted a meta-analysis for cross-sectional lung function in ever-smokers across 17 studies with a total sample size of N&#8202;=&#8202;24,446 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003585.s006">Table S2</xref>). We included nine studies which had contributed to the original finding on lung function <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Obeidat1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and had available genotypes or 1000G imputed genotype data on PI S and Z. The meta-analysis in cohorts of general population study design showed that rs4905179 was not associated with lung function in ever-smokers (P&#8202;=&#8202;0.90 in the fixed-effect meta-analysis, N&#8202;=&#8202;20,153, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003585-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Yet smaller studies recruited within population isolates showed a trend for the rare allele to be associated with low lung function (random-effect P&#8202;=&#8202;0.02, N&#8202;=&#8202;1623, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003585-g005">Figure 5</xref>), and in contrast to the association with AAT serum levels, adjusting for PI S and Z alleles did not modify the association of rs4905179 with lung function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003585-g006">Figure 6</xref>). For the second common SNP, rs3748312, we could nominally replicate the statistically significant allele effect on FEV1 in the general population of ever-smokers (P&#8202;=&#8202;0.02, N&#8202;=&#8202;15,450), and the stronger effect that was published <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Obeidat1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> seems to be driven by population isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003585-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Again, as for rs4905179, the associations were not dependent on S and Z alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003585-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Meta-analyses of the associations of PI S and Z alleles with lung function revealed no consistent associations between these functional AAT level determining variants and reduced FEV1 (Figures S3 and S4). Remarkably, the significant associations of rs4905179 and rs3748312 with lung function assessed in two additional studies with patients featuring compromised pulmonary health and undergoing lung resection, showed evidence for synthetic associations of the common SNPs with lung function that are consistent with our results for circulating AAT (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003585-t005">Table 5</xref>). The minor alleles were associated with lower lung function and the association completely disappeared when conditioned on the presence of PI S and Z alleles.</p><fig id="pgen-1003585-g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1003585.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Forest plot of meta-analyzed results for the effect per minor allele of rs4905179 on FEV1 in ever-smokers, adjusted for sex, age, height and population stratification factors.</title><p>Studies based on population isolates with a high degree of cryptic relatedness are presented separately.

We show here an example in which the polymorphisms PI S and PI Z seem to account for basically all observable effects of common variants in the <italic>SERPINA</italic> gene cluster on AAT serum level. The top-ranking genotyped SNP in our GWAS, rs4905179, was in low r<sup>2</sup>-based LD with PI S (r<sup>2</sup>&#8202;=&#8202;0.18) and PI Z (r<sup>2</sup>&#8202;=&#8202;0.06), reflecting in part the unequal allele frequencies of these SNPs. However, PI S and PI Z showed very high LD in terms of D&#8242; with the GWAS top signals (e.g. D&#8242;&#8202;=&#8202;0.95 and 0.96, respectively, with rs4905179) and generally with many common variants in this locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003585-g004">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting little genetic recombination. This proof-of-principle approach, revealing that signals of common variants in fact merely reflect rarer variants, has recently also been shown for some of the loci regulating low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Sanna1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Oosterveer1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Yet for other loci linked to LDL cholesterol, as well as for loci influencing other traits, both common and low-frequent variants contributed independently of the original GWAS signal to the phenotypic trait <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Sanna1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Galarneau1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Rivas1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>Using regional 1000G imputation within the top-ranking loci can allow the identification of additional association signals of stronger size to support the initial GWAS top result, as observed here for the <italic>SERPINA</italic> cluster, but not for the locus near <italic>MFSD1</italic>, an association which was not confirmed in the SAPALDIA replication arm. The resequencing strategy of the GWAS-identified locus in a sample with low AAT concentrations yielded in the identification of rare variants being strongly associated with reduced AAT blood levels. Such an accumulation of rare variants in the extreme range of the respective phenotype has also been reported by others <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Johansen1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Coassin1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. As for the relative contribution of genetic variants on the phenotype, we confirmed that effect sizes of PI S and Z on AAT serum levels were comparably strong, explaining alone a high proportion of the total variability (24.2%). We estimated that rare variants explained at least another 2% in our population-based sample, but since we did not sequence the entire SAPALDIA sample for rare variants, we cannot reliably quantify this contribution. In terms of blood markers, similar examples exist in which one genetic variant could explain well above 5% of the phenotype's variability (e.g. lipoprotein(a) <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Kronenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, bilirubin <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> or adiponectin <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Heid1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>), but for many other markers like serum lipid levels, only variants with small effects have been detected so far <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Aulchenko1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p><p>Association patterns between <italic>SERPINA1</italic> variants and circulating AAT did not translate to according associations with lung function level in a straightforward manner. Lung function is a complex phenotype associated with numerous genetic variants <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Artigas1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Imboden1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Studies on the associations of <italic>SERPINA1</italic> polymorphisms with lung function and COPD have produced mixed results. It is well accepted that severe AAT deficiency caused by PI null mutations or by the presence of two PI Z alleles puts a subgroup of carriers at higher risk of emphysema and COPD, especially when smoking <xref rid="pgen.1003585-1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Studies on COPD found suggestive evidence for an association with heterozygous status for the PI Z allele <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Hersh1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Sorheim1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, but we observed no associations in our meta-analysis between PI Z and lung function level in ever-smokers. In the SAPALDIA general population sample, we had previously reported that an effect of the PI Z allele on lung function decline is restricted to persistent smokers and primarily observed for forced expiratory flow 25&#8211;75% <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Thun1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Other variation in or close to the <italic>SERPINA1</italic> gene has been proposed to play a role for pulmonary health. First, a haplotype pattern of five common SNPs was reported to be more frequent in COPD cases than in controls in a study with limited statistical power <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Chappell1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The only SNP which was also separately associated with COPD in that analysis was not associated with reduced serum levels in our study (rs8004738, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003585-t004">Table 4</xref>). Second, the minor allele of rs4905179, which was the top signal in the current AAT GWAS, was positively associated with emphysema assessed by chest tomography in three independent cohorts consisting of smoking COPD patients without severe AAT deficiency (PI ZZ) <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Kong1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Finally, the minor allele of the intronic SNP rs3748312 was positively associated with lung function in ever-smokers from different population-based studies of the SpiroMeta Consortium <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Obeidat1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The association of these two SNPs with lung function in ever-smokers was heterogeneous across studies in our meta-analysis. Dependency on PI S and Z was limited to studies in patients with lung resection (Groningen, UBC), consistent with the notion that <italic>SERPINA1</italic> may only confer risk in selected population subgroups.</p><p>There are several possible explanations for the poor translation of genetic association patterns with serum AAT to lung function and for the heterogeneity of associations between <italic>SERPINA1</italic> variants and lung function. First, lung function is influenced by mechanisms in addition to protease-antiprotease disequilibrium. Second, the contribution of the <italic>SERPINA1</italic> gene variants as a determinant of lung function likely depends on both the evolutionary pressure in isolated populations and the prevalence of effect modifiers in the respective study populations. These include smoking and smoking intensity, and likely other markers of inflammation. AAT itself plays a dual role in its relationship with lung function. While chronic AAT deficiency is etiologically associated with adverse pulmonary health, individuals with lung function impairment in fact exhibit higher AAT levels for a given genetic background due to AAT's role as an acute-phase inflammation marker <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Silverman1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Senn1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Third, tissue-specific regulation of the <italic>SERPINA1</italic> locus may play an important role. Serum AAT levels are driven by <italic>SERPINA1</italic> expression, protein formation and secretion in hepatocytes, so that regulatory SNPs associated with serum AAT likely reflect processes in the liver. One way to infer causality of potentially regulatory SNPs is by testing if they are simultaneously associated with health outcome and gene expression in the relevant tissue <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Emilsson1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. We therefore conducted a look-up in an expression quantitative loci (eQTL) database of lung tissue <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Hao1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, but could not find any common variant which was significantly associated in <italic>cis</italic> with the transcripts deriving from the <italic>SERPINA1</italic> locus. In a recent study on networks of blood metabolites, the SNPs rs11628917 and rs1884549 were the most strongly associated blood and liver eQTLs with respect to <italic>SERPINA1</italic> expression <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Inouye1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. They both lie in the 3&#8242; untranslated region of <italic>SERPINA1</italic>, but were not associated with blood AAT in our GWAS (P&#8202;=&#8202;0.80 and P&#8202;=&#8202;0.21, respectively). Moreover, we could not detect epistasis between those variants and the deleterious coding variants PI S and Z in terms of AAT serum levels. The absence of such an interaction does not point to regulatory function of the common SNPs <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Lappalainen1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> and argues in favor of tissue-specific heterogeneity. Forth, the role of <italic>SERPINA1</italic> in selected subgroups of persons exhibiting accelerated lung function decline or COPD needs to be considered from a perspective beyond genetic variation, as a recent study investigating epigenetic mechanisms of disease revealed methylation status of the <italic>SERPINA1</italic> gene to be most strongly associated with cross-sectional lung function and COPD <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Qiu1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>.</p><p>The strength of this study is that it combines the report of a GWAS on AAT serum levels with meta-analyses of the associations of some of the GWAS top variants with lung function. The effects of the underlying functional variants are thoroughly investigated resulting in the hitherto largest meta-analysis of PI S and Z on FEV1 in ever-smokers. Ascertainment and study design of the many participating studies were sufficiently diverse to informatively address heterogeneity in association of common and rarer variants in the <italic>SERPINA</italic> gene cluster with lung function. The strength of the discovery sample is the population-based study design and the detailed characterization of the participants. Sex, age and smoking are important modifiers of AAT blood levels in the general population <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Senn1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> and were included in all regression models. More refined smoking variables covering smoking intensity were not included as this information is less complete than smoking status in SAPALDIA and would lower the sample size. By excluding samples with elevated hs-CRP values we avoided the masking of AAT deficiencies due to a chronic or acute inflammation. On the methodological side, conditional analysis is a well-established tool for identifying independent signals within a certain locus <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003585-LangoAllen1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Trynka1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Furthermore, 1000G imputation was able to point to the causal variant demonstrating its reliability to correctly assign alleles close to the 1% MAF threshold.</p><p>The limitations of this investigation include firstly the small sample size of the GWAS discovery arm, resulting in a high susceptibility to false negative findings. We calculated 63% power to detect SNPs with an allele effect of 0.1 g/L AAT serum level (&#8202;=&#8202;2.4% of the phenotypic variance) to a genome-wide significance level of 5*10<sup>&#8722;8</sup>. However, if we define the clinically important threshold of AAT as the upper limit of intermediate AAT deficiency, which has been recently suggested as 0.92 g/L <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Ferrarotti1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, we have more than 99.9% power to detect such a large-impact variant. Nevertheless, genes that contribute to AAT serum levels with smaller effects than <italic>SERPINA1</italic> were likely to be missed. This could be a reason why neither SNPs in interleukin 6 (IL-6) nor in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1&#945; (HNF-1&#945;)/HNF-4, both important regulators of AAT expression <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Rollini1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, were associated with circulating AAT concentrations. Furthermore, by sequencing only the coding region of <italic>SERPINA1</italic>, rare variants in introns and outside the gene could not be determined. Another potential limitation of our GWAS on AAT serum level is the overrepresentation of asthmatics in the discovery sample. Asthma patients usually show higher levels of inflammatory markers in their lungs. However, we did not find heterogeneity in the effects of the most strongly associated SNPs when comparing asthmatics with non-asthmatics. Moreover, AAT mean values between the discovery and the replication arm were not significantly different, as participants with elevated hs-CRP had been excluded.</p><p>In conclusion, our study confirms the <italic>SERPINA1</italic> locus as the major genetic determinant of AAT blood levels. Methodologically, it represents a powerful example how low-frequent variants, separated by several kilobases from the top-ranking GWAS signals, can create purely synthetic associations which do not add to the variance of the respective outcome. In terms of lung function, our data do not support a functional role of any common SNP in the <italic>SERPINA</italic> cluster in the general population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>SAPALDIA was approved by the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences, the national ethics committee for clinical research (UREK, Project Approval Number 123/00) and the Cantonal Ethics Committees for each of the eight examination areas (Ethics commissions of the cantons Aargau, Basel, Geneva, Grisons, Ticino, Valais, Vaud and Zurich).

<italic>SERPINA1</italic> SNP Selection for Fine Mapping in SAPALDIA</title><p>In an attempt to find AAT modifying <italic>SERPINA1</italic> gene variants acting independently of each other, a multiple strategy to optimally cover the gene was applied. Sequencing of the whole <italic>SERPINA1</italic> gene in 25 unrelated samples from the Italian registry of AAT deficiency which demonstrated extreme phenotypes was used to identify common SNPs not present in HapMap. Extreme phenotypes consisted of 11 samples with AAT&gt;1.60 g/L and hs-CRP &lt;8 mg/L, 3 samples with PI ZZ or PI SZ genotype and AAT&lt;0.20 g/L, 2 samples with PI MZ genotype and AAT&lt;0.60 g/L, as well as 9 non-carriers of PI S or PI Z alleles with blood levels &gt;0.65 and &lt;1.10 g/L. In these 25 samples, a total of 129 mutations were identified in the <italic>SERPINA1</italic> gene. After removing SNPs which were monomorphic in our data, SNPs deviating from HWE or lying in high LD with an adjacent marker (D&#8242;&gt;0.8 and r<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.4 according to JLIN <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Carter1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>), we finally obtained a list of 22 common SNPs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003585-t004">Table 4</xref>, selection A). In a second strategy, HapMap CEU data was used to select tagging SNPs (Haploview 3.32) <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Barrett1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, resulting in 8 polymorphisms (selection B). Third, TAMAL <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Hemminger1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref> was used to identify promising SNPs in the region of the <italic>SERPINA1</italic> gene (selection C). Pairwise LD and the feasibility of designing a corresponding TaqMan assay reduced the number of SNPs to 13. Two established (PI S and Z) and one suggestive (rs8004738 <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Chappell2" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>) functional SNPs were added (selection D), resulting in 16 SNPs used in the conditional analysis. Three of them were already part of the SNP array genotyped for the GWAS.

Student's t-test was used to compare adjusted mean AAT levels between different subgroups of the sequenced samples. The genome-wide association of 2.17 million quality-controlled SNPs with serum AAT levels was assessed using fixed effects linear regression with ProbABEL <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Aulchenko2" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. An additive genetic model was applied and the association was adjusted for sex, age, study center, dichotomous current smoking status, as well as population stratification factors. To account for population stratification, we relied on previously inferred ancestry-informative principal components using EIGENSTRAT 2.0 software <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Price1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref> and HapMap data, as well as additional reference European samples <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Heath1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. Cryptic relatedness was detected based on identity-by-state (IBS) analysis. Influence of additional suggestive determinants of AAT, such as hs-CRP, BMI, alcohol intake and passive smoking was assessed in a sensitivity analysis. We also performed genome-wide analysis conditioned on the functionally established PI S and PI Z variants. Bonferroni correction for multiple testing was applied, resulting in P&lt;5*10<sup>&#8722;8</sup> to designate genome-wide significance, taking account of one million independent tests for common variants across the genome. For the SNPs imputed by using 1000G reference samples, we considered a three times lower p-value as adequate as roughly three times more SNPs on chromosome 14 passed an imputation-r<sup>2</sup> threshold of 0.5 (219,471 1000G-derived variants vs. 82,296 HapMap2-derived variants). Applying this to a 2 Mb chromosomal stretch (with approximately 600 HapMap2-derived SNPs) resulted in a significance threshold of roughly 3*10<sup>&#8722;5</sup>.</p><p>For the replicated SNP in the SAPALDIA replication arm, as well as for the lung function analysis, a two-sided p-value of 0.05 was considered significant.

Stepwise conditional analyses were conducted by testing each SNP for AAT association after including at each step the most significantly associated SNP in the model. As some of these SNPs turned out to be in unexpectedly high LD, we applied a threshold level for statistical significance of P&#8202;=&#8202;0.005, accounting for approximately ten independent tests <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>.</p><p>To be as close as possible to the calculations carried out in the original publication <xref rid="pgen.1003585-Obeidat1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, multivariate linear regression models for lung function analyses were used adjusted for sex, age, height and population stratification factors (if available).</p><p>All the SAPALDIA regression analyses were performed with STATA 12.1 IC.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Further Software</title><p>Manhattan, Q-Q and forest plots were created with the help of R 2.15.1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org">www.r-project.org</ext-link>).
