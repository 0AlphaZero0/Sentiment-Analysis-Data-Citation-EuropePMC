</related-article><abstract><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several infrequent genetic polymorphisms in the SERPINA1 gene are known to substantially reduce concentration of alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) in the blood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since low AAT serum levels fail to protect pulmonary tissue from enzymatic degradation, these polymorphisms also increase the risk for early onset chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The role of more common SERPINA1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in respiratory health remains poorly understood. </plain></SENT>
</text></SecTag></p><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We present here an agnostic investigation of genetic determinants of circulating AAT levels in a general population sample by performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 1392 individuals of the SAPALDIA cohort. </plain></SENT>
</text></SecTag></p><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five common SNPs, defined by showing minor allele frequencies (MAFs) &gt;5%, reached genome-wide significance, all located in the SERPINA gene cluster at 14q32.13. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The top-ranking genotyped SNP rs4905179 was associated with an estimated effect of β = −0.068 g/L per minor allele (P = 1.20*10−12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>But denser SERPINA1 locus genotyping in 5569 participants with subsequent stepwise conditional analysis, as well as exon-sequencing in a subsample (N = 410), suggested that AAT serum level is causally determined at this locus by rare (MAF&lt;1%) and low-frequent (MAF 1–5%) variants only, in particular by the well-documented protein inhibitor S and Z (PI S, PI Z) variants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Replication of the association of rs4905179 with AAT serum levels in the Copenhagen City Heart Study (N = 8273) was successful (P&lt;0.0001), as was the replication of its synthetic nature (the effect disappeared after adjusting for PI S and Z, P = 0.57). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Extending the analysis to lung function revealed a more complex situation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only in individuals with severely compromised pulmonary health (N = 397), associations of common SNPs at this locus with lung function were driven by rarer PI S or Z variants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, our meta-analysis of lung function in ever-smokers does not support a functional role of common SNPs in the SERPINA gene cluster in the general population. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Low levels of alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) in the blood are a well-established risk factor for accelerated loss in lung function and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>While a few infrequent genetic polymorphisms are known to influence the serum levels of this enzyme, the role of common genetic variants has not been examined so far. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The present genome-wide scan for associated variants in approximately 1400 Swiss inhabitants revealed a chromosomal locus containing the functionally established variants of AAT deficiency and variants previously associated with lung function and emphysema. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We used dense genotyping of this genetic region in more than 5500 individuals and subsequent conditional analyses to unravel which of these associated variants contribute independently to the phenotype's variability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>All associations of common variants could be attributed to the rarer functionally established variants, a result which was then replicated in an independent population-based Danish cohort. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Hence, this locus represents a textbook example of how a large part of a trait's heritability can be hidden in infrequent genetic polymorphisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The attempt to transfer these results to lung function furthermore suggests that effects of common variants in this genetic region in ever-smokers may also be explained by rarer variants, but only in individuals with hampered pulmonary health. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) is a serum marker for inflammation produced in the liver. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Its main function is to inhibit neutrophil elastase and consequently protect pulmonary tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The SERPINA1 gene encoding the AAT protein is known to be polymorphic in the general population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The best studied single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) causing a reduction in AAT serum levels are the protease inhibitor S (PI S, rs17580) and the protease inhibitor Z (PI Z, rs28929474) variants [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The loss of function mechanism is especially well investigated for the PI Z variant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The resulting amino acid change in AAT leads to the protein's intracellular polymerization in hepatocytes and therefore to a reduced level of secreted serum AAT [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Homozygosity for PI Z (PI ZZ genotype) with a frequency of about 0.01% in Caucasian populations [3] causes blood AAT levels below 30% of normal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>This genotype is clearly associated with elevated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) risk accounting for 1–2% of all cases [4], [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>There is also strong evidence that accelerated lung function decline and increased obstructive disease risk can be caused by compound heterozygosity of PI Z and PI S (PI SZ genotype). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The case is less clear for PI MZ, PI MS or PI SS genotypes (PI M standing for the normal allele), which cause a less pronounced reduction in AAT concentration, as previous studies produced inconsistent evidence [6]–[9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Further of note, large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on COPD or on cross-sectional or longitudinal lung function have not identified the SERPINA1 gene to be a major genetic determinant [10]–[12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>But a recent GWAS on emphysema [13] and a comprehensive evaluation of candidate regions for lung function [14] reported rs4905179 and rs3748312, two common SNPs (minor allele frequencies (MAFs) &gt;5%) located in the SERPINA gene cluster on 14q32.13, among their most strongly associated results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>This locus encompasses SERPINA1 and ten other genes (SERPINA2 to SERPINA6 and SERPINA9 to SERPINA13) encoding extracellular ‘clade A’ serpins with very heterogeneous functions [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>It is currently not known whether such association signals observed for this locus reflect a causal role of common variants or whether they are merely synthetic, reflecting effects of rarer causal variants [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Towards that aim, but also to detect further chromosomal loci of potential relevance to circulating levels of AAT, we first performed a GWAS on AAT serum level using a subset of the population-based Swiss Cohort Study of Air Pollution and Lung Disease in Adults (SAPALDIA) as discovery sample, and a second subset of SAPALDIA as well as an independent cohort, the Copenhagen City Heart Study (henceforth referred to as Copenhagen), as replication sample. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>We also conducted fine mapping analyses of the SERPINA1 gene in the SAPALDIA cohort. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Finally, we meta-analyzed the lung function effect of common and low-frequent SERPINA1 SNPs previously observed to be associated with pulmonary health in ever-smokers, based on data provided by several population- and patient-based studies. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>A comparison between the characteristics of the genome-wide analyzed sample (SAPALDIA discovery arm, N = 1392) and the remainder of the SAPALDIA cohort (SAPALDIA replication arm, N = 4245) did not reveal substantial differences in AAT serum levels or covariate distribution (Table S1), although asthmatics were overrepresented (39.4%) in the SAPALDIA discovery arm and absent in the replication arm, which is due to previous study design [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The participants of the independent replication cohort Copenhagen (N = 8273) were on average five years older and had twice as many current smokers (Table S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>This was in line with substantially lower lung function levels (more than 800 mL lower forced expiratory volume in 1 second, FEV1, compared to both SAPALDIA subsets) and slightly elevated AAT blood levels (1.339 g/L vs. 1.257 and 1.255 g/L, respectively). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Both the top-ranking imputed SNP, rs2736887, and the top-ranking genotyped SNP, rs4905179, were located in close proximity to the SERPINA6 gene and approximately 33 kb and 50 kb downstream of SERPINA1 (effect estimates β = −0.071 and −0.068 g/L per minor allele; P = 2.48*10−13 and 1.20*10−12, respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Linkage disequilibrium (LD) between these two variants based on HapMap2 CEU (Utah residents with Northern and Western European ancestry) derived haplotype data [18] was strong (r2 = 0.88, D′ = 1), but Figure 2 suggests that the LD, expressed in r2 values, between the top-ranking SNP and the other SNPs in the region is generally modest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The genomic inflation factor lambda was low (λ = 1.02), suggesting minimal population stratification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>The quantile-quantile plot (Q-Q plot) showed good adherence to null expectation and substantial positive deviation between observed and expected p-values for the top-ranking SNPs (Figure S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>In a sensitivity analysis adjusting for additional covariates, including high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), body mass index (BMI), passive smoking and alcohol intake, the genome-wide association results did not show an increase in the strength of the top-ranking loci, nor did they point to additional loci (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Even though this GWAS was enriched with asthma patients, GWAS stratification according to asthma status did not show heterogeneity for the top-ranking signals between participants with and without asthma (data not shown). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>In a second fine mapping step, exon sequencing was performed in 410 subjects with low AAT levels that were independent of the presence of PI S or PI Z alleles [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>16 additional SERPINA1 variants (two deletions and 14 SNPs) were detected, of which all but one had already been described [21]–[29] (Table S7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Three of the SNPs were synonymous, and five had no accession numbers in public databases (as of April 1st, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>Most of the non-synonymous SNPs have already been described as potentially lowering AAT serum level, and computational tools only classified one of them as no damaging to the protein's tertiary structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>In order to estimate the phenotypic influence of these rare variants, we compared mean AAT blood levels, adjusted for sex, age, study center, current smoking, as well as for the presence of PI S and Z alleles, between samples without rare variants (N = 346) and those with a single rare variant (N = 63) or more than one (N = 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>The subjects with rare variants had a lower adjusted mean AAT level (0.904 g/L, 95% CI 0.884 to 0.924 g/L) compared to those without rare variants (0.992 g/L, 95% CI 0.984 to 1.000 g/L, P&lt;0.001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Although this difference is small, the range covers the recently proposed upper limit of intermediate AAT deficiency (0.92 g/L), a value with some clinical relevance [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>AAT levels of carriers of synonymous mutations or non-synonymous mutations without predicted damaging consequences to protein structure (N = 20) were not different from those carrying no rare variants (0.985 vs. 0.990 g/L, P = 0.77). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Assuming that unsequenced samples were negative for mutations with predicted deleterious functional effects, the total variance of explained AAT further increased from 32.8% to 35.4% (based on a statistical model adding all rare mutations with predicted damaging consequences to the protein structure). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Results from a previous GWAS on emphysema [13] and a large-scale evaluation of candidate loci on lung function [14] pointed to a role of common variants in the SERPINA gene cluster. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>The SNPs rs4905179 (associated with emphysema in smokers [13]) and rs3748312 (associated with cross-sectional lung function among ever smokers [14]) were strongly associated with AAT in our study (Tables 1 and 4), but both signals disappeared upon adjustment for the low-frequent variants PI S and Z. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>In order to clarify whether the association of the two common SNPs with pulmonary health could also be explained by effects of the rarer SNPs, we conducted a meta-analysis for cross-sectional lung function in ever-smokers across 17 studies with a total sample size of N = 24,446 (Table S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>We included nine studies which had contributed to the original finding on lung function [14] and had available genotypes or 1000G imputed genotype data on PI S and Z. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>The meta-analysis in cohorts of general population study design showed that rs4905179 was not associated with lung function in ever-smokers (P = 0.90 in the fixed-effect meta-analysis, N = 20,153, Figure 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Yet smaller studies recruited within population isolates showed a trend for the rare allele to be associated with low lung function (random-effect P = 0.02, N = 1623, Figure 5), and in contrast to the association with AAT serum levels, adjusting for PI S and Z alleles did not modify the association of rs4905179 with lung function (Figure 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>For the second common SNP, rs3748312, we could nominally replicate the statistically significant allele effect on FEV1 in the general population of ever-smokers (P = 0.02, N = 15,450), and the stronger effect that was published [14] seems to be driven by population isolates (Figure 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Again, as for rs4905179, the associations were not dependent on S and Z alleles (Figure 8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Meta-analyses of the associations of PI S and Z alleles with lung function revealed no consistent associations between these functional AAT level determining variants and reduced FEV1 (Figures S3 and S4). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>The minor alleles were associated with lower lung function and the association completely disappeared when conditioned on the presence of PI S and Z alleles. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>We present here the first GWAS on circulating AAT blood levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Our results confirm that genetic variation in the SERPINA1 gene is a strong determinant of serum AAT levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Fine mapping of SERPINA1 and subsequent stepwise regression analyses further revealed that the associations with common variants in the SERPINA locus could be attributed to rarer variants previously identified to be causally linked with AAT deficiency. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>There is an ongoing debate about whether rare variants are responsible for the missing heritability observed in GWAS on many complex outcomes [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>We show here an example in which the polymorphisms PI S and PI Z seem to account for basically all observable effects of common variants in the SERPINA gene cluster on AAT serum level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>The top-ranking genotyped SNP in our GWAS, rs4905179, was in low r2-based LD with PI S (r2 = 0.18) and PI Z (r2 = 0.06), reflecting in part the unequal allele frequencies of these SNPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>However, PI S and PI Z showed very high LD in terms of D′ with the GWAS top signals (e.g. D′ = 0.95 and 0.96, respectively, with rs4905179) and generally with many common variants in this locus (Figure 4), suggesting little genetic recombination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>This proof-of-principle approach, revealing that signals of common variants in fact merely reflect rarer variants, has recently also been shown for some of the loci regulating low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol [31], [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Yet for other loci linked to LDL cholesterol, as well as for loci influencing other traits, both common and low-frequent variants contributed independently of the original GWAS signal to the phenotypic trait [31], [33], [34]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Using regional 1000G imputation within the top-ranking loci can allow the identification of additional association signals of stronger size to support the initial GWAS top result, as observed here for the SERPINA cluster, but not for the locus near MFSD1, an association which was not confirmed in the SAPALDIA replication arm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>The resequencing strategy of the GWAS-identified locus in a sample with low AAT concentrations yielded in the identification of rare variants being strongly associated with reduced AAT blood levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Such an accumulation of rare variants in the extreme range of the respective phenotype has also been reported by others [35], [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>As for the relative contribution of genetic variants on the phenotype, we confirmed that effect sizes of PI S and Z on AAT serum levels were comparably strong, explaining alone a high proportion of the total variability (24.2%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>We estimated that rare variants explained at least another 2% in our population-based sample, but since we did not sequence the entire SAPALDIA sample for rare variants, we cannot reliably quantify this contribution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>In terms of blood markers, similar examples exist in which one genetic variant could explain well above 5% of the phenotype's variability (e.g. lipoprotein(a) [37], bilirubin [38] or adiponectin [39]), but for many other markers like serum lipid levels, only variants with small effects have been detected so far [40]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Association patterns between SERPINA1 variants and circulating AAT did not translate to according associations with lung function level in a straightforward manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Lung function is a complex phenotype associated with numerous genetic variants [11], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Studies on the associations of SERPINA1 polymorphisms with lung function and COPD have produced mixed results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>It is well accepted that severe AAT deficiency caused by PI null mutations or by the presence of two PI Z alleles puts a subgroup of carriers at higher risk of emphysema and COPD, especially when smoking [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Studies on COPD found suggestive evidence for an association with heterozygous status for the PI Z allele [6], [8], but we observed no associations in our meta-analysis between PI Z and lung function level in ever-smokers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>In the SAPALDIA general population sample, we had previously reported that an effect of the PI Z allele on lung function decline is restricted to persistent smokers and primarily observed for forced expiratory flow 25–75% [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Other variation in or close to the SERPINA1 gene has been proposed to play a role for pulmonary health. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>First, a haplotype pattern of five common SNPs was reported to be more frequent in COPD cases than in controls in a study with limited statistical power [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>The only SNP which was also separately associated with COPD in that analysis was not associated with reduced serum levels in our study (rs8004738, Table 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Second, the minor allele of rs4905179, which was the top signal in the current AAT GWAS, was positively associated with emphysema assessed by chest tomography in three independent cohorts consisting of smoking COPD patients without severe AAT deficiency (PI ZZ) [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Finally, the minor allele of the intronic SNP rs3748312 was positively associated with lung function in ever-smokers from different population-based studies of the SpiroMeta Consortium [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>The association of these two SNPs with lung function in ever-smokers was heterogeneous across studies in our meta-analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Dependency on PI S and Z was limited to studies in patients with lung resection (Groningen, UBC), consistent with the notion that SERPINA1 may only confer risk in selected population subgroups. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>There are several possible explanations for the poor translation of genetic association patterns with serum AAT to lung function and for the heterogeneity of associations between SERPINA1 variants and lung function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>First, lung function is influenced by mechanisms in addition to protease-antiprotease disequilibrium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Second, the contribution of the SERPINA1 gene variants as a determinant of lung function likely depends on both the evolutionary pressure in isolated populations and the prevalence of effect modifiers in the respective study populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>These include smoking and smoking intensity, and likely other markers of inflammation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>AAT itself plays a dual role in its relationship with lung function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>While chronic AAT deficiency is etiologically associated with adverse pulmonary health, individuals with lung function impairment in fact exhibit higher AAT levels for a given genetic background due to AAT's role as an acute-phase inflammation marker [42], [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Third, tissue-specific regulation of the SERPINA1 locus may play an important role. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Serum AAT levels are driven by SERPINA1 expression, protein formation and secretion in hepatocytes, so that regulatory SNPs associated with serum AAT likely reflect processes in the liver. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>One way to infer causality of potentially regulatory SNPs is by testing if they are simultaneously associated with health outcome and gene expression in the relevant tissue [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>We therefore conducted a look-up in an expression quantitative loci (eQTL) database of lung tissue [45], but could not find any common variant which was significantly associated in cis with the transcripts deriving from the SERPINA1 locus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>In a recent study on networks of blood metabolites, the SNPs rs11628917 and rs1884549 were the most strongly associated blood and liver eQTLs with respect to SERPINA1 expression [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>They both lie in the 3′ untranslated region of SERPINA1, but were not associated with blood AAT in our GWAS (P = 0.80 and P = 0.21, respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we could not detect epistasis between those variants and the deleterious coding variants PI S and Z in terms of AAT serum levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>The absence of such an interaction does not point to regulatory function of the common SNPs [47] and argues in favor of tissue-specific heterogeneity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Forth, the role of SERPINA1 in selected subgroups of persons exhibiting accelerated lung function decline or COPD needs to be considered from a perspective beyond genetic variation, as a recent study investigating epigenetic mechanisms of disease revealed methylation status of the SERPINA1 gene to be most strongly associated with cross-sectional lung function and COPD [48]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>The strength of this study is that it combines the report of a GWAS on AAT serum levels with meta-analyses of the associations of some of the GWAS top variants with lung function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>The effects of the underlying functional variants are thoroughly investigated resulting in the hitherto largest meta-analysis of PI S and Z on FEV1 in ever-smokers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Ascertainment and study design of the many participating studies were sufficiently diverse to informatively address heterogeneity in association of common and rarer variants in the SERPINA gene cluster with lung function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>The strength of the discovery sample is the population-based study design and the detailed characterization of the participants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Sex, age and smoking are important modifiers of AAT blood levels in the general population [43] and were included in all regression models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>More refined smoking variables covering smoking intensity were not included as this information is less complete than smoking status in SAPALDIA and would lower the sample size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>By excluding samples with elevated hs-CRP values we avoided the masking of AAT deficiencies due to a chronic or acute inflammation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>On the methodological side, conditional analysis is a well-established tool for identifying independent signals within a certain locus [38], [49], [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 1000G imputation was able to point to the causal variant demonstrating its reliability to correctly assign alleles close to the 1% MAF threshold. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>The limitations of this investigation include firstly the small sample size of the GWAS discovery arm, resulting in a high susceptibility to false negative findings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>We calculated 63% power to detect SNPs with an allele effect of 0.1 g/L AAT serum level ( = 2.4% of the phenotypic variance) to a genome-wide significance level of 5*10−8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>However, if we define the clinically important threshold of AAT as the upper limit of intermediate AAT deficiency, which has been recently suggested as 0.92 g/L [20], we have more than 99.9% power to detect such a large-impact variant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, genes that contribute to AAT serum levels with smaller effects than SERPINA1 were likely to be missed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>This could be a reason why neither SNPs in interleukin 6 (IL-6) nor in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF-1α)/HNF-4, both important regulators of AAT expression [51], were associated with circulating AAT concentrations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, by sequencing only the coding region of SERPINA1, rare variants in introns and outside the gene could not be determined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Another potential limitation of our GWAS on AAT serum level is the overrepresentation of asthmatics in the discovery sample. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Asthma patients usually show higher levels of inflammatory markers in their lungs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>However, we did not find heterogeneity in the effects of the most strongly associated SNPs when comparing asthmatics with non-asthmatics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Moreover, AAT mean values between the discovery and the replication arm were not significantly different, as participants with elevated hs-CRP had been excluded. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our study confirms the SERPINA1 locus as the major genetic determinant of AAT blood levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Methodologically, it represents a powerful example how low-frequent variants, separated by several kilobases from the top-ranking GWAS signals, can create purely synthetic associations which do not add to the variance of the respective outcome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>In terms of lung function, our data do not support a functional role of any common SNP in the SERPINA cluster in the general population. </plain></SENT>
