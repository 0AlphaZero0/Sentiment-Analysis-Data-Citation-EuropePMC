<italic>Lrig2</italic>-deficient mice were generated by the ablation of <italic>Lrig2</italic> exon 12 (<italic>Lrig2E12</italic>). The <italic>Lrig2E12-/</italic>- mice showed a transiently reduced growth rate and an increased spontaneous mortality rate; 20-25% of these mice died before 130 days of age, with the majority of the deaths occurring before 50 days. <italic>Ntv-a</italic> transgenic mice with different <italic>Lrig2</italic> genotypes were transduced by intracranial injection with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B-encoding replication-competent avian retrovirus (RCAS)-producing DF-1 cells.

Although many oligodendroglial tumors respond favorably to therapy, most patients are not cured by current treatment modalities. The most common cytogenetic chromosomal alteration in oligodendroglial tumors is a combined loss of chromosomes 1p and 19q, which is associated with improved survival and response to treatment [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and the PDGF receptors, PDGFR&#945; and PDGFR&#946;, are overexpressed in the majority of oligodendrogliomas [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A functional role for dysregulated PDGFR signaling in oligodendroglial tumors is further supported by animal models in which PDGF autocrine stimulation contributes to gliomagenesis, including oligodendroglioma genesis [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains (LRIG) proteins are a family of integral membrane proteins [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The mammalian LRIG gene family is composed of three paralogues, <italic>LRIG1</italic>, <italic>LRIG2</italic>, and <italic>LRIG3</italic> [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The best-studied family member, LRIG1, antagonizes growth factor signaling mediated by the ERBB [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], MET [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and RET [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] receptor tyrosine kinases, and is suggested to be a tumor suppressor [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. LRIG1 expression is associated with a favorable prognosis in many cancer types [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. <italic>Lrig1</italic> knockout mice show hyperproliferation of intestinal stem cells [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and spontaneously develop intestinal tumors [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Furthermore, Lrig1 regulates epidermal stem cell quiescence [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and the knockout mice develop psoriatic skin lesions, suggesting that Lrig1 also has an essential role in epidermal homeostasis [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This role is further supported by the redistribution of LRIG proteins observed in human psoriatic skin lesions compared with the normal epidermis [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In the nematode <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content></italic>, the single LRIG paralogue, SMA-10, regulates body size and bone morphogenetic protein signaling [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. LRIG3 appears to have a role in modulating Fgf and Wnt signaling in <named-content content-type="genus-species">

</named-content> [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. <italic>Lrig3</italic>-deficient mice have cranio-facial and inner ear defects, but appear grossly normal in other respects [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Little is known regarding the molecular and developmental functions of mammalian LRIG2. Recently it was found that <italic>LRIG2</italic> mutations are associated with congenital urofacial syndrome [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In addition, LRIG2 expression is an independent prognostic factor associated with poor survival in oligodendroglioma [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The latter suggests that LRIG2 might promote the genesis or growth of oligodendroglial tumors and cervical squamous cell carcinoma, and that LRIG1 and LRIG2 might have different, possibly opposing, functions.</p><p>In this study, we generated <italic>Lrig2</italic>-deficient mice and investigated their survival, health, growth, and susceptibility to PDGFB-induced gliomagenesis. In addition, we studied possible effects of Lrig2 on Pdgfr levels and PDGF-induced intracellular signaling events.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All mice were housed and maintained, and all experiments were performed in accordance with the European Communities Council Directive (86/609/EEC).

Our study revealed a role for <italic>Lrig2</italic> in mouse growth and survival, gliomagenesis, and cell signaling. <italic>Lrig2</italic> was disrupted by ablation of exon 12, which resulted in an altered reading frame, introducing multiple stop codons in the corresponding mRNA. Exon 12 encodes the C-terminal portion of the LRR domain, preceding the immunoglobulin-like, transmembrane, and cytosolic domains. Thus, the <italic>Lrig2E12-/-</italic> mice could not express full-length Lrig2. However, expression of a truncated Lrig2 protein lacking the immunoglobulin-like, transmembrane, and cytosolic domains remained a possibility. Due to a lack of reagents, e.g., suitable antibodies, we were unable to determine whether a truncated Lrig2 protein was expressed in <italic>Lrig2E12-/-</italic> mice. However, we find it unlikely that the phenotype observed was the result of non-physiological functions of a hypothetical and truncated Lrig2 protein. First, the <italic>Lrig2</italic> transcript levels were down-regulated in the <italic>Lrig2E12-/-</italic> mice compared to wild-type mice, making the risk of non-specific and non-physiologic interactions less likely. Second, in a genetic screen in the nematode <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content></italic>, it was found that mutations introducing stop codons after the first Ig domain in the single nematode LRIG gene, <italic>SMA-10</italic>, resulted in similar, or identical, phenotypes as a true null-allele [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Thus, and as the observed phenotype could clearly be attributed to the <italic>Lrig2E12</italic> allele, we propose that <italic>Lrig2</italic> plays important roles in the processes leading to the phenotypes observed. Little is known regarding the regulation of <italic>Lrig</italic> expression, and it is not known whether the Lrig proteins have redundant functions. However, our quantifications of the <italic>Lrig</italic> transcript levels in mice of the different <italic>Lrig2</italic> genotypes indicated that neither <italic>Lrig1</italic> nor <italic>Lrig3</italic> was feedback regulated by <italic>Lrig2</italic>; at least, not in the brain.</p><p>
<italic>Lrig2E12-/-</italic> mice showed increased spontaneous mortality and transiently reduced growth rates. The majority of the deaths occurred during the first week after weaning. By 130 days of age, between 20 and 25% of <italic>Lrig2E12-/-</italic> mice had either died or been euthanized due to the sudden onset of severe, general symptoms of illness. Frequently, these mice were emaciated, but the cause of emaciation or any other illness symptoms could not be determined by routine necropsy. Similarly, no anatomical or histological abnormalities were found in apparently healthy <italic>Lrig2E12-/-</italic> mice. Therefore, the increased spontaneous mortality of <italic>Lrig2E12-/-</italic> mice remains unexplained. Reduced body size is a common and often idiopathic effect of genetic modifications in mice, and there are numerous reports of genetically modified mouse strains with reduced body size [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In our <italic>Lrig2E12-/-</italic> mice, however, the reduction in body weight was only transient. The weight differences between <italic>Lrig2E12+/+</italic> and <italic>Lrig2E12-/-</italic> mice were obvious at 5 days of age, and the differences remained until 12 to 15 weeks of age, after which, the differences disappeared. A similar transient reduction in body size or growth retardation is observed in <italic>Pa2g4</italic> (also called <italic>ErbB3-binding protein 1</italic> or <italic>Ebp1</italic>) knockout mice [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and <italic>Otx1</italic> knockout mice [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The <italic>Otx1</italic> knockout mice also show transient hypogonadism, and their transient growth retardation is thought to be secondary to low levels of pituitary hormones. By 4 months of age, <italic>Otx1</italic> knockout mice display restored growth, gonadal function, and pituitary hormone production. In the case of the <italic>Lrig2E12-/-</italic> mice, we are not yet able to explain the mechanisms underlying the transient weight reduction and subsequent recovery; however, this observation may indicate that Lrig2 exerts temporally restricted effects on growth regulation via specific cell types, which was also suggested for ErbB3-binding protein 1 [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Intriguingly, <italic>Lrig2E12-/-</italic> mice were protected against <italic>PDGFB</italic>-induced glioma. The current investigation was prompted by our previous finding that LRIG2 expression is associated with poor oligodendroglioma patient survival [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In oligodendroglial tumors, dysregulated PDGFR signaling is a common feature. Therefore, we used an animal model of PDGF-induced glioma where PDGFB-encoding RCAS retroviruses are injected intracranially into <italic>Ntv-a</italic> transgenic mice. As previously reported [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], this treatment resulted in brain tumors resembling human oligodendroglioma and glioblastoma. <italic>Lrig2E12+/+</italic> animals developed tumors at a higher frequency and of higher malignancy than <italic>Lrig2E12-/-</italic> mice. This result implies a promoting role of Lrig2 in the genesis and/or progression of oligodendroglioma and in PDGF signaling. A previous report showed that the level of PDGF signaling in the current glioma model determines tumor latency and malignancy [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Therefore, we speculate that Lrig2 might have positively regulated PDGFR signaling in the tumors of wild-type mice. To address whether Lrig2 regulates Pdgfr signaling, we analyzed PDGF-BB induced signaling events in a series of primary MEF cell lines that were established from inbred mice of different <italic>Lrig2</italic> genotypes. We chose to study PDGF signaling in these cells because primary MEFs represent a well-characterized and reproducible experimental system for the study of PDGF signaling. These analyses revealed subtle but significant changes in Pdgfr signaling in the <italic>Lrig2E12-/-</italic> cells. The <italic>Lrig2E12-/-</italic> cells showed a more rapid induction of the immediate-early genes <italic>Fos</italic> and <italic>Egr2</italic> in response to PDGF stimulation than <italic>Lrig2E12+/+</italic> cells. The kinetic difference, although subtle, was reproducible and significant, showing that Lrig2 influenced Pdgfr signaling in these cells. Intriguingly, we were unable to demonstrate any effect of Lrig2 on the Pdgfr protein levels or phosphorylation events of Pdgfr, Akt, or Erk. Similarly, we failed to detect any difference in Pdgfr&#945; or Pdgfr&#946; levels in the tumors of different <italic>Lrig2</italic> genotypes by immunohistochemistry (data not shown). This apparent paradox of an observable effect on immediate-early gene induction but not on Pdgfr, Akt, or Erk phosphorylation levels could be the result of different mechanisms. For example, the regulatory function of Lrig2 could be downstream of the Pdgfrs, Akt, and Erk, or at parallel pathways that were not analyzed in the present study. Another possibility is that Lrig2 regulates the cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation of transcription factors or other regulatory molecules. It is also possible that our assays used to monitor protein phosphorylation levels were not sensitive enough to detect small changes in phosphorylation levels that might have been translated into detectable differences in gene induction. Thus, Lrig2 clearly regulated PDGF-induced immediate-early gene induction; however, the molecular mechanism for this regulation remains to be clarified. Because the gliomas in our animal model were induced by <italic>PDGFB</italic>, we find it likely that the tumor promoting effect of Lrig2 was mediated by regulation of PDGF signaling. However, other tumor-promoting effects of Lrig2 cannot be excluded, at present. Likewise, the current data cannot discriminate between cancer cell autonomous and non-autonomous effects of Lrig2. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the survival benefit of low LRIG2 expression in human oligodendroglioma patients was due to LRIG2 expression in the cancer cells only [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This observation may suggest that the tumor promoting effect of LRIG2 is indeed cancer cell autonomous. In any case, the results herein presented, showing that Lrig2 promoted <italic>PDGFB</italic>-induced glioma in mice, are consistent with the previous finding that LRIG2 expression predicts poor survival in human oligodendroglioma patients [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Taken together, these two observations suggest that LRIG2 is an important regulator of oligodendroglioma initiation or progression.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The phenotype of <italic>Lrig2E12-/-</italic> mice was distinct from that of the previously described <italic>Lrig1</italic>- and <italic>Lrig3</italic>-mutant mice, and included increased spontaneous mortality, transiently reduced growth rate, and protection against <italic>PDGFB</italic>-induced glioma.
