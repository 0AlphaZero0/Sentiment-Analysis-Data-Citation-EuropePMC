<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The Lrig2E12-/- mice showed a transiently reduced growth rate and an increased spontaneous mortality rate; 20-25% of these mice died before 130 days of age, with the majority of the deaths occurring before 50 days. Ntv-a transgenic mice with different Lrig2 genotypes were transduced by intracranial injection with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B-encoding replication-competent avian retrovirus (RCAS)-producing DF-1 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>All injected Lrig2E12+/+ mice developed Lrig2 expressing oligodendroglial brain tumors of lower grade (82%) or glioblastoma-like tumors of higher grade (18%). Lrig2E12-/- mice, in contrast, only developed lower grade tumors (77%) or had no detectable tumors (23%). Lrig2E12-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) showed altered induction-kinetics of immediate-early genes Fos and Egr2 in response to PDGF-BB stimulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, Lrig2E12-/- MEFs showed no changes in Pdgfrα or Pdgfrβ levels or in levels of PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of Pdgfrα, Pdgfrβ, Akt, or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Oligodendroglial tumors, including oligodendroglioma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, oligoastrocytoma, and anaplastic oligosastrocytoma, are diffusively infiltrating primary brain tumors [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Although many oligodendroglial tumors respond favorably to therapy, most patients are not cured by current treatment modalities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The most common cytogenetic chromosomal alteration in oligodendroglial tumors is a combined loss of chromosomes 1p and 19q, which is associated with improved survival and response to treatment [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and the PDGF receptors, PDGFRα and PDGFRβ, are overexpressed in the majority of oligodendrogliomas [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>A functional role for dysregulated PDGFR signaling in oligodendroglial tumors is further supported by animal models in which PDGF autocrine stimulation contributes to gliomagenesis, including oligodendroglioma genesis [4,5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains (LRIG) proteins are a family of integral membrane proteins [6–9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The mammalian LRIG gene family is composed of three paralogues, LRIG1, LRIG2, and LRIG3 [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The best-studied family member, LRIG1, antagonizes growth factor signaling mediated by the ERBB [10,11], MET [12], and RET [13] receptor tyrosine kinases, and is suggested to be a tumor suppressor [7,14,15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>LRIG1 expression is associated with a favorable prognosis in many cancer types [16–20]. Lrig1 knockout mice show hyperproliferation of intestinal stem cells [21,22] and spontaneously develop intestinal tumors [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Lrig1 regulates epidermal stem cell quiescence [23,24], and the knockout mice develop psoriatic skin lesions, suggesting that Lrig1 also has an essential role in epidermal homeostasis [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>This role is further supported by the redistribution of LRIG proteins observed in human psoriatic skin lesions compared with the normal epidermis [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the single LRIG paralogue, SMA-10, regulates body size and bone morphogenetic protein signaling [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>LRIG3 appears to have a role in modulating Fgf and Wnt signaling in  Xenopus  [28]. Lrig3-deficient mice have cranio-facial and inner ear defects, but appear grossly normal in other respects [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Little is known regarding the molecular and developmental functions of mammalian LRIG2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Recently it was found that LRIG2 mutations are associated with congenital urofacial syndrome [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In addition, LRIG2 expression is an independent prognostic factor associated with poor survival in oligodendroglioma [31] and squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The latter suggests that LRIG2 might promote the genesis or growth of oligodendroglial tumors and cervical squamous cell carcinoma, and that LRIG1 and LRIG2 might have different, possibly opposing, functions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In this study, we generated Lrig2-deficient mice and investigated their survival, health, growth, and susceptibility to PDGFB-induced gliomagenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In addition, we studied possible effects of Lrig2 on Pdgfr levels and PDGF-induced intracellular signaling events. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="364" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of an Lrig2-deficient mouse strain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="365" pm="."><plain>Our study revealed a role for Lrig2 in mouse growth and survival, gliomagenesis, and cell signaling. Lrig2 was disrupted by ablation of exon 12, which resulted in an altered reading frame, introducing multiple stop codons in the corresponding mRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="366" pm="."><plain>Exon 12 encodes the C-terminal portion of the LRR domain, preceding the immunoglobulin-like, transmembrane, and cytosolic domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="367" pm="."><plain>Thus, the Lrig2E12-/- mice could not express full-length Lrig2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="368" pm="."><plain>However, expression of a truncated Lrig2 protein lacking the immunoglobulin-like, transmembrane, and cytosolic domains remained a possibility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="369" pm="."><plain>Due to a lack of reagents, e.g., suitable antibodies, we were unable to determine whether a truncated Lrig2 protein was expressed in Lrig2E12-/- mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="370" pm="."><plain>However, we find it unlikely that the phenotype observed was the result of non-physiological functions of a hypothetical and truncated Lrig2 protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="371" pm="."><plain>First, the Lrig2 transcript levels were down-regulated in the Lrig2E12-/- mice compared to wild-type mice, making the risk of non-specific and non-physiologic interactions less likely. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="372" pm="."><plain>Second, in a genetic screen in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, it was found that mutations introducing stop codons after the first Ig domain in the single nematode LRIG gene, SMA-10, resulted in similar, or identical, phenotypes as a true null-allele [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="373" pm="."><plain>Thus, and as the observed phenotype could clearly be attributed to the Lrig2E12 allele, we propose that Lrig2 plays important roles in the processes leading to the phenotypes observed. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="380" pm="."><plain>Similarly, no anatomical or histological abnormalities were found in apparently healthy Lrig2E12-/- mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="381" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the increased spontaneous mortality of Lrig2E12-/- mice remains unexplained. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="382" pm="."><plain>Reduced body size is a common and often idiopathic effect of genetic modifications in mice, and there are numerous reports of genetically modified mouse strains with reduced body size [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="383" pm="."><plain>In our Lrig2E12-/- mice, however, the reduction in body weight was only transient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="384" pm="."><plain>The weight differences between Lrig2E12+/+ and Lrig2E12-/- mice were obvious at 5 days of age, and the differences remained until 12 to 15 weeks of age, after which, the differences disappeared. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="385" pm="."><plain>A similar transient reduction in body size or growth retardation is observed in Pa2g4 (also called ErbB3-binding protein 1 or Ebp1) knockout mice [38] and Otx1 knockout mice [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="386" pm="."><plain>The Otx1 knockout mice also show transient hypogonadism, and their transient growth retardation is thought to be secondary to low levels of pituitary hormones. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="387" pm="."><plain>By 4 months of age, Otx1 knockout mice display restored growth, gonadal function, and pituitary hormone production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="388" pm="."><plain>In the case of the Lrig2E12-/- mice, we are not yet able to explain the mechanisms underlying the transient weight reduction and subsequent recovery; however, this observation may indicate that Lrig2 exerts temporally restricted effects on growth regulation via specific cell types, which was also suggested for ErbB3-binding protein 1 [37]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="389" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, Lrig2E12-/- mice were protected against PDGFB-induced glioma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="390" pm="."><plain>The current investigation was prompted by our previous finding that LRIG2 expression is associated with poor oligodendroglioma patient survival [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="391" pm="."><plain>In oligodendroglial tumors, dysregulated PDGFR signaling is a common feature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="392" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we used an animal model of PDGF-induced glioma where PDGFB-encoding RCAS retroviruses are injected intracranially into Ntv-a transgenic mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="393" pm="."><plain>As previously reported [5], this treatment resulted in brain tumors resembling human oligodendroglioma and glioblastoma. Lrig2E12+/+ animals developed tumors at a higher frequency and of higher malignancy than Lrig2E12-/- mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="394" pm="."><plain>This result implies a promoting role of Lrig2 in the genesis and/or progression of oligodendroglioma and in PDGF signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="395" pm="."><plain>A previous report showed that the level of PDGF signaling in the current glioma model determines tumor latency and malignancy [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="396" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we speculate that Lrig2 might have positively regulated PDGFR signaling in the tumors of wild-type mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="397" pm="."><plain>To address whether Lrig2 regulates Pdgfr signaling, we analyzed PDGF-BB induced signaling events in a series of primary MEF cell lines that were established from inbred mice of different Lrig2 genotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="398" pm="."><plain>We chose to study PDGF signaling in these cells because primary MEFs represent a well-characterized and reproducible experimental system for the study of PDGF signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="399" pm="."><plain>These analyses revealed subtle but significant changes in Pdgfr signaling in the Lrig2E12-/- cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="400" pm="."><plain>The Lrig2E12-/- cells showed a more rapid induction of the immediate-early genes Fos and Egr2 in response to PDGF stimulation than Lrig2E12+/+ cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="401" pm="."><plain>The kinetic difference, although subtle, was reproducible and significant, showing that Lrig2 influenced Pdgfr signaling in these cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="402" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, we were unable to demonstrate any effect of Lrig2 on the Pdgfr protein levels or phosphorylation events of Pdgfr, Akt, or Erk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="403" pm="."><plain>Similarly, we failed to detect any difference in Pdgfrα or Pdgfrβ levels in the tumors of different Lrig2 genotypes by immunohistochemistry (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="404" pm="."><plain>This apparent paradox of an observable effect on immediate-early gene induction but not on Pdgfr, Akt, or Erk phosphorylation levels could be the result of different mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="405" pm="."><plain>For example, the regulatory function of Lrig2 could be downstream of the Pdgfrs, Akt, and Erk, or at parallel pathways that were not analyzed in the present study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="406" pm="."><plain>Another possibility is that Lrig2 regulates the cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation of transcription factors or other regulatory molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="407" pm="."><plain>It is also possible that our assays used to monitor protein phosphorylation levels were not sensitive enough to detect small changes in phosphorylation levels that might have been translated into detectable differences in gene induction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="408" pm="."><plain>Thus, Lrig2 clearly regulated PDGF-induced immediate-early gene induction; however, the molecular mechanism for this regulation remains to be clarified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="409" pm="."><plain>Because the gliomas in our animal model were induced by PDGFB, we find it likely that the tumor promoting effect of Lrig2 was mediated by regulation of PDGF signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="410" pm="."><plain>However, other tumor-promoting effects of Lrig2 cannot be excluded, at present. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="411" pm="."><plain>Likewise, the current data cannot discriminate between cancer cell autonomous and non-autonomous effects of Lrig2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="412" pm="."><plain>In this regard, it is noteworthy that the survival benefit of low LRIG2 expression in human oligodendroglioma patients was due to LRIG2 expression in the cancer cells only [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="413" pm="."><plain>This observation may suggest that the tumor promoting effect of LRIG2 is indeed cancer cell autonomous. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="414" pm="."><plain>In any case, the results herein presented, showing that Lrig2 promoted PDGFB-induced glioma in mice, are consistent with the previous finding that LRIG2 expression predicts poor survival in human oligodendroglioma patients [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="415" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these two observations suggest that LRIG2 is an important regulator of oligodendroglioma initiation or progression. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="417" pm="."><plain>The phenotype of Lrig2E12-/- mice was distinct from that of the previously described Lrig1- and Lrig3-mutant mice, and included increased spontaneous mortality, transiently reduced growth rate, and protection against PDGFB-induced glioma. </plain></SENT>
