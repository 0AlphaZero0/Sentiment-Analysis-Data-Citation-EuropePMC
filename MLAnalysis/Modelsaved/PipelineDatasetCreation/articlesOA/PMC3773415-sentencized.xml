<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Iron deficiency is one of the most common deficiencies in the world and can lead to anemia [1–3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients with reduced absorption of dietary iron (e.g., patients with inflammatory bowel disease, gastrointestinal surgery, or who have had gastric bypass) or patients with increased utilization or loss of iron from the body (e.g., pregnancy/childbirth, heavy uterine bleeding, lactation, hemodialysis, or surgery) are particularly at risk [1, 4–6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>IDA may adversely affect cognitive function, physical activity, immune response, inflammatory conditions, and pregnancy outcomes [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Different kinds of therapies from oral iron to blood transfusion are currently used to treat IDA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The aim of the treatment is to return both hemoglobin and iron stores to normal levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Oral iron therapy is the treatment of choice for the majority of patients with IDA because of its effectiveness, safety, and low cost. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Even though many patients can tolerate oral iron without difficulty, up to 40% may have side effects attributable to oral iron replacement therapy [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The incidence of side effects increase with the dose and adversely affects compliance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Also, oral iron is often not capable of replenishing severe iron deficits [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>As a treatment of last resort, blood transfusions are used, but they may lead to the transmission of known and unknown pathogens, immunological impact, and transfusion reactions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Intravenous (IV) administration of iron is preferred in patients who are unable to absorb sufficient iron from the gastrointestinal tract or those who do not tolerate oral iron, in patients in whom blood transfusions need to be avoided for medical or religious reasons, and in patients with chronic iron loss exceeding the rate of replacement possible with oral treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>First generation intravenous iron formulations, namely, iron dextran (DEX), have been used as an alternative to oral iron in the treatment of IDA of multiple etiologies although it is known to cause severe immunological responses, including fatal anaphylactic reactions [3, 4, 10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Second generation, nondextran IV irons, such as iron sucrose and sodium ferric gluconate, do not contain dextran, or modified dextran, but they have significant dosage and administration rate limitations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>They are characterized by a risk of adverse reactions called labile iron reactions at higher doses which may include hypotension, cramping, diarrhea, or chest pain [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Feraheme (ferumoxytol) is a recently approved IV iron administered as two injections of 510 mg [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Although Feraheme was designed with a modified dextran shell to reduce immunogenic potential, anaphylaxis in individuals with previous hypersensitivity to iron dextran has been reported [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), a novel IV iron, is a stable Type I polynuclear iron (III) hydroxide carbohydrate complex [1] that has been approved in Europe for the treatment of iron deficiency since 2007. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>After IV administration, FCM is mainly found in the reticuloendothelial system of the liver, the spleen, and bone marrow [1, 13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The iron slowly dissociates from the complex and can be efficiently used in the bone marrow for hemoglobin synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>FCM offers significant advantages compared to earlier generation IV iron preparations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Due to its structure, FCM is more stable than sodium ferric gluconate and iron sucrose. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>It is therefore possible to administer much higher single doses over shorter periods of time than sodium ferric gluconate or iron sucrose, resulting in the need for fewer administrations to replete iron stores [1, 4, 5, 13–15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In addition, it is not a dextran or modified dextran so the risk of hypersensitivity reactions is reduced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In multiple studies, FCM has been shown to be an effective option in the treatment of IDA, and it also improves the quality of life of patients [1, 4, 5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to conduct a head-to-head comparison of the safety of an investigational IV iron regimen (FCM) versus IV iron dextran in the treatment of IDA when oral iron was not tolerated or the response was poor. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Patients received up to 750 mg of iron as undiluted FCM (15 mg/kg up to a maximum of 750 mg) at 100 mg per minute via IV push injection weekly until the calculated iron deficit dose had been administered. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Patients who were randomized to DEX received their study drug between Days 0 and 42. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>On Day 0, a test dose of 25 mg of DEX was administered slowly over 5 minutes, and the subject was observed for 15 minutes to 1 hour, and if no reaction occurred, the remainder of the Day 0 dose was given. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The total DEX dose was determined by calculating the total iron requirement and dividing this total amount into one or more single dose(s). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Discussion </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>The primary objective of this trial was to compare the safety of FCM to DEX in patients with IDA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients were females whose principal cause of anemia was heavy uterine bleeding, inflammatory bowel disease, or other gastrointestinal pathologies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>This trial confirmed the safety profile of FCM in comparison to another frequently administered IV iron, iron dextran. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Although the trial had a sample size of only 160 patients, several adverse events related to immune system disorders and skin disorders were observed more frequently in the DEX group than the FCM group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Two subjects in the DEX group reported serious AEs that were considered to be study drug related as opposed to none in the FCM group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Moreover, about twice as many subjects in the DEX group were prematurely discontinued from study drug due to the occurrence of an AE (11 versus 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>The majority of AEs resulting in premature discontinuation from study drug were considered possibly or probably related to study drug. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Many in the DEX group were related to allergy/immune response. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Many studies have shown that FCM has a relatively modest incidence of adverse effects [4, 4, 19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>The most commonly observed AEs were nausea, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and rash [1, 13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Serious AEs observed were considered to be unrelated to the administration of FCM [5, 13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Iron dextran is currently the only IV iron approved in the US for use in ID patients (i.e., other than chronic kidney disease). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>It can lead to potentially dangerous clinical scenarios because of the possibility of inducing a severe immunological response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>The risk of anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions caused by DEX has been reported previously [10, 20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>The iron dextran utilized in this trial was mainly high molecular weight iron dextran (Dexferrum). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>The difference between the high molecular weight and low molecular weight iron dextran formulations is due to the size of the iron cores, not the dextran shell, the suspected component responsible for iron dextran-related anaphylactic reactions [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>The amounts of carbohydrate shell are approximately equal in the two iron dextrans [22, 23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Studies have found that high molecular weight iron dextran compared with low molecular weight iron dextran had higher frequencies of anaphylactic-type reactions [24, 25], while another study found similar or higher frequencies with low molecular weight iron dextran [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>The current study indicates a favorable safety profile for FCM as compared to that of high molecular weight iron dextran due to the small number of subjects that received low molecular weight iron dextran. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Compared to the DEX group, the proportion of patients experiencing a transient decrease in serum phosphate was higher in the FCM group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>The mean value of phosphorus decreased from Day 0 to Day 14 in patients in the FCM group but increased after Day 14 to Day 42. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>The mean value at Day 42 (2.75 mg/dL) is within the normal range for the central laboratory used in this trial (2.2–5.1 mg/dL). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>None of the patients with reduced phosphorus levels were clinically symptomatic or received any medications to treat these changes in phosphorus level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>A transient decrease in serum phosphate has also been reported in other trials of FCM [4, 5, 27, 28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>A possible mechanism is that FCM transiently increases the levels of intact fibroblast growth factor 23, which is a hormone that inhibits renal reabsorption of phosphate [29]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>FCM was equivalently effective as DEX in the treatment of IDA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Both treatments improved hemoglobin by an average of approximately 2.5 g/dL over the study period, returning hemoglobin from starting value of about 9.5 g/dL to about 12 g/dL in around 4 weeks after first dose. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Intravenous administration of FCM with doses of up to 750 mg delivered at a rate of 100 mg per minute also significantly increased ferritin level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>As compared to iron dextran, FCM had a greater effect with respect to the restoration of iron stores (as indicated by an increase in ferritin). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Our results, consistent with the results of previous clinical trials, [1, 3, 4, 13, 30, 31] demonstrate that FCM is safe and well tolerated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>In the current study, consistent with previous trials [4, 5, 13, 15, 30–32], FCM increased hemoglobin levels, replenished iron stores, and had a low incidence of AEs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>In this study there was also a lower rate of allergic reactions in the FCM group with respect to the DEX group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Moreover, large doses of FCM (up to 750 mg) could be administered via rapid IV push injection (at 100 mg per minute) in this trial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Thus, FCM is a safe, effective, and convenient option for the treatment of IDA of any etiology [1, 5, 32]. </plain></SENT>
