<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although previous studies suggested that only VcCheY3 directly switches the flagellar rotation, the involvement of VcCheY4 in chemotaxis could not be ruled out. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of these studies, however, focused on the structure, mechanism of activation or molecular basis of FliM binding of the VcCheYs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>From the crystal structures of Ca2+ and Mg2+ bound VcCheY3 we proposed the presence of a conformational barrier composed of the hydrophobic packing of W61, M88 and V106 and a unique hydrogen bond between T90 and Q97 in VcCheY3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lesser fluorescence quenching and higher Km value of VcCheY3, compared to its mutants VcCheY3-Q97A and VcCheY3-Q97A/E100A supported our proposition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, aforesaid biochemical data, in conjunction with the structure of VcCheY3-Q97A, indicated that the coupling of T90 and Q97 restricts the movement of T90 toward the active site reducing the stabilization of the bound phosphate and effectively promoting autodephosphorylation of VcCheY3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The structure of BeF3 − activated VcCheY3 insisted us to argue that elevated temperature and/or adequacy of phosphate pool might break the barrier of the free-state VcCheY3 and the conformational changes, required for FliM binding, occur upon phosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Structure of VcCheY4 has been solved in the free and sulfated states. VcCheY4sulf, containing a bound sulfate at the active site, appears to be more compact and stable with a longer α4 helix, shorter β4α4 loop and hydrogen bond between T82 and the sulfate compared to VcCheY4free. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>While pull down assay of VcCheYs with VcFliMNM showed that only activated VcCheY3 can interact with VcFliMNM and VcCheY4 cannot, a knowledge based docking explained the molecular mechanism of the interactions between VcCheY3 and VcFliM and identified the limitations of VcCheY4 to interact with VcFliM even in its phosphorylated state. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Vibrio cholerae, the highly motile gram-negative bacterial pathogen that causes cholera, uses chemotaxis and motility to travel to its preferred intestinal niche to colonize [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Extensive studies on chemotaxis of Escherichia coli or Salmonella typhimurium showed that the ligand induced conformational change in methyl accepting chemotaxis protein (MCP) is sensed by the CheA–CheW complex eventually resulting autophosphorylation of the kinase CheA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Autophosphorylated CheA then donates phosphate to the response regulator CheY. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylated CheY interacts with the flagellar motor protein FliM and influence the direction of flagellar rotation from counter clock wise (CCW) to clock wise (CW) [2], [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>CCW rotation results smooth swimming and CW rotation causes the cell to tumble [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Because of the presence of a single polar flagellum, V. cholerae does not tumble as such but reverses direction briefly, allowing the bacterium to randomly reorient itself and swim in a new direction. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The genomes of a large number of bacterial species, including Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Rhodobacter spaeroides, Myxococcus xanthus, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Yersinia pestis, encode for multiple paralogues of the various chemotaxis genes and chemotaxis in these bacteria is more complex [5], [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>A recent genomic and bioinformatic analysis of over 450 bacteria indicates that more than 50% of the chemotaxis gene homologs have more than one copy of chemotaxis genes [5] and these genes are involved not only in flagellum-mediated chemotaxis but also in type-4 pilus-based motility [7], [8], polysaccharide biosynthesis associated with pilus-based gliding motility [9] and flagellar morphogenesis [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In many cases, however, genetic analysis has not been successful in deciphering the function of these chemotaxis gene homologs [5], [11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The genome sequence of V. cholerae has three sets of Che protein and 45 MCP-like proteins [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Each set of che genes forms clusters where che cluster I (located on chromosome I) contains cheY1, cheA1, cheY2, cheR1, cheB1 and the putative gene cheW; cluster II of chromosome I contains cheW1, cheB2, cheA2, cheZ and cheY3, while cluster III of chromosome II contains cheB3, cheD, cheR3, cheW2, cheW3, cheA3 and cheY4. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>So far, the molecular characterization of all four CheYs of V. cholerae (namely, VcCheY1–VcCheY4) is restricted to a few in vivo studies where some of the chemotaxis related genes are found to be involved in the virulence of V. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Cholerae [13]–[15] [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Attempts to identify the V. cholerae cheY responsible for the flagellar motion showed that a deletion of cheY3 impairs chemotaxis [1] while insertional disruption and duplication of the cheY4 gene result in decreased and increased motility respectively [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Swarming assay and assessment of the swimming behaviour indicated that only VcCheY3 directly switches flagellar rotation, although this study could not rule out the involvement of VcCheY4 in the motor action [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Later, Bandyopadhaya and Chaudhuri (2009) showed that inactivation of cheY3 or cheY4 generates a less motile and less adherent mutant [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of VcCheYs indicate that only 17% residues are identical among them which comprise the residues involved in binding of the divalent metal ion and stabilization of the phosphorylated intermediate (Figure 1a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>This implies that the basic machinery for the phosphorylation is intact for all four VcCheYs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Available literature, however, suggest that deletion of the cheY1 and cheY2 genes does not cause any defect in chemotaxis [14] and motility or adherence remains unaffected for the insertional mutants of cheY1 or cheY2 [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>All these observations point to the fact that VcCheY3 and VcCheY4 are the key response regulators to control chemotaxis in V. cholerae. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Also, T87I and T87I/Y106W mutants of EcCheY were found to be phosphorylatable although these mutants were unable to generate clockwise rotation of the flagella [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>In addition, both of these mutants had ∼5-fold lower autodephosphorylation rates and the mutants were completely resistant to CheZ activity, indicating that an isoleucyl side-chain at position 87 renders EcCheY unable to perform its chemotactic functions [20]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>VcCheY3 bears only 37% sequence identity with that of VcCheY4 (Figure 1a) and so far, nothing is known about the structure, mechanism of activation or molecular basis of FliM binding for these two key response regulators, implicated in chemotaxis and virulence of V. cholerae. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Our structural observations identified a unique conformational barrier in VcCheY3 that controls its phosphorylation event. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Implication of this barrier is established by fluorescence spectroscopic study on VcCheY3 and its mutants VcCheY3-Q97A, VcCheY3-Q97A/E100A and VcCheY3-D60A, comparison of their Km values and pull down assay with VcFliMNM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>We have also reported the structures of VcCheY4 in free and sulfate bound states here and comparison of these structures helped us to argue that VcCheY4 has a strong tendency to be phosphorylated and the phosphorylated state would be more stable compared to its free state. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>While our pull down assay showed that only activated VcCheY3 can interact with VcFliMNM and VcCheY4 cannot, structure based docking explained the molecular mechanism of the interactions between VcCheY3 and VcFliM and identified the structural limitations of VcCheY4 to interact with VcFliM even in its phosphorylated state. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Unlike E. coli two-component chemosensory pathway that relies on a single copy of response regulator CheY, V. cholerae possesses four CheY homologues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Occurrence of multiple CheYs is not unusual in bacteria as these are also found in R. sphaeroides and B. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Burgdorferi [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have demonstrated that multiple copies of CheY play specific roles in the chemotactic signal transduction mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>As for example, among the three CheYs of B. burgdorferi only CheY3 directly regulates motor action while the other two cannot bind to the motor and act as signal terminating phosphate sink [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in R. sphaeroides only CheY6 can change the direction of the flagellar motor, although the others bind FliM probably to regulate the level of the phosphodonor [38], [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>An intriguing question, therefore, arises about the role of multiple copies of CheY in V. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Cholerae, especially of VcCheY3 and VcCheY4. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Together, phosphorylation at the active site Asp, hallmark movement of the Thr and the β4α4 loop toward the active site to stabilize the bound phosphate, ‘in’ positioning of the crucial hydrophobic residue of β5 and FliM binding at the α4-β5-α5 face to reverse the flagellar motion constitute the general mode of action of the chemotactic response regulators. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>In EcCheY or StCheY, a preformed pocket was seen to accommodate the ‘in’ position of the crucial β5 residue Y106 upon activation (Figure 2b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>In contrast to that, in VcCheY3, this pocket is preoccupied by the hydrophobic packing of W61, M88 and V106 (Figure 2c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>A unique hydrogen bond between T90 and Q97 additionally restricts the outward movement of W61, which is necessary to make a pocket for the ‘in’ positioning of Y109. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>This hydrogen bond also obstructs the movement of T90 toward the active site essentially hindering the stabilization of the phosphoryl group by T90. VcCheY3 shows minimum quenching in the presence of acP which further support the hindered movement of W61 upon phosphorylation at D60 (Figure 3a). VcCheY3-Q97A and VcCheY3-Q97A/E100A, on the other hand, show considerable quenching in the presence of acP indicating that in the absence of the hydrogen bond between T90 and Q97, W61 can easily be reoriented toward solvent and T90 can move toward the active site to stabilize the phosphoryl group. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Higher Km value of VcCheY3 compared to its mutants VcCheY3-Q97A and VcCheY3-Q97A/E100A further establishes the hindrance caused by the hydrogen bond between T90 and Q97 in stabilizing the acyl phosphate on D60. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>The lower Km values of VcCheY3-Q97A and VcCheY3-Q97A/E100A are due to the loss of the coupling between T90 and Q97 which facilitates the movement of T90 toward the active site and stabilize the acyl phosphate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>A comparison of the Km value of VcCheY3 with the CheYs from Helicobacter pylori or E. coli shows that the Km of VcCheY3 is also higher than that of HpCheY1 (1.07±0.31 mM) and EcCheY (3.2±0.4 mM). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>As mentioned by Lam et al. (2010), Km increases with the increase in the ionic strength of the buffer used in the experiment [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>While 200 mM salt was used in the experiment of EcCheY, only 50 mM salt was used for HpCheY1and VcCheY3 (and its mutants). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>Since our experimental condition is same as that of HpCheY1, we can clearly infer that the Km value of VcCheY3 is about six fold higher than that of HpCheY1. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>As mentioned earlier, a higher Km (Km = Ks. k3/k2) implies a decrease in the binding affinity between CheY and the phosphodonor (larger Ks), a slower rate of phosphorylation of CheY (smaller k2) or a faster rate of autodephosphorylation (larger k3) [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>The high Km value of VcCheY3 implies that either its phosphorylation occurs slowly or it has a higher rate of autodephosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Based on the swarming assay and swimming behaviour Hyakutake et al, (2005) reported that only the VcCheY3 directly switches the flagellar rotation [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Our pull down assay shows that VcCheY3 and its mutants VcCheY3-Q97A and VcCheY3-Q97A/E100A bind VcFliMNM efficiently in the presence of BeF3 − and Mg2+. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Docking results suggest that VcFliMN can fit properly at the α4-β5-α5 face of the activated VcCheY3 with significant number of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions (Figure 6a, 6b; Table 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Moreover, sequence comparison of VcCheY3 with EcCheY or StCheY denotes that the crucial residues implicated in binding the kinase CheA are conserved in VcCheY3 (Figure 1a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>These observations indicate that although VcCheY3 has all the requisites for the phosphorylation, stabilization of the acyl phosphate is hindered due to the obstructed movement of T90 towards the active site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Lesser stabilization of the bound phosphate might be implicated in enhanced autodephosphorylation (larger k3) for VcCheY3, effectively causing lower rate of activation which is reflected in its higher Km value. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>The conformational barrier of VcCheY3, therefore, acts as a molecular switch to control the level of VcCheY3-P. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Elevated temperature and/or adequacy of phosphate pool might break the barrier of the free-state VcCheY3 and flip it to the phosphorylated state for FliM binding. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Two distinct conformations, differing at helix α4 and the crucial β4α4 loop, are observed for VcCheY4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>Among these two structures, VcCheY4sulf possesses a bound sulfate ion near the active site which occupies a position similar to the BeF3 − of StCheY-BeF3 − and VcCheY3-BeF3 − (Figure 5a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>A bound sulfate ion was also observed in HpCheY1 structure (PDB code: 3GWG) where that sulfate ion caused conformational changes similar to the activated structure [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>However, in HpCheY1, along with the conventional conformational changes, an unusual orientation of D53 was observed [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>In VcCheY4sulf, the sulfate ion did not alter the side chain conformation of catalytic D52 but stayed very close (∼2.5 Å) to it (Figure 5a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Since VcCheY4sulf was crystallized at pH 4.0, at this pH D52 might be protonated allowing the sulfate ion to come to its close vicinity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>In VcCheY4sulf, the sulfate ion is properly coordinated with the Ca2+ ion and is stabilized through the interactions with T82 and K104 (Figure 5a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Considering the compactness of the VcCheY4sulf structure having a shorter β4α4 loop with low B-factors, long α4 helix, movement of T82 and β4α4 loop to stabilize the sulfate ion and additional hydrogen bond between T82 and K89, it can be said that VcCheY4 has a strong tendency to be phosphorylated in the presence of a divalent metal ion and the phosphorylated state is more stable compared to its free state. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that the crucial β5 residue W101 of VcCheY4 consistently acquires ‘in’ position, VcCheY4 fails to interact with VcFliMNM (Figure 6a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Through mutagenesis and structure-function studies Matsumura and collaborators showed that substitution of Y106 of EcCheY with tryptophan (Y106W) produces a phosphorylation-dependent, hyperactive mutant that generates mainly clockwise rotational bias upon interacting with FliM [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>In contrast to that, despite the consistent ‘in’ position of W101, VcCheY4 does not interact with VcFliM, as the N terminal part of VcFliM does not fit at the α4-β5-α5 face of VcCheY4 because of their spatial and electrostatic incompatibility (Table 3, Figure 6e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>This apparent contradiction suggest that FliM binding by CheY is not just influenced by the ‘in’ positioning of the β5 hydrophoc residue but the spatial and electrostatic compatibility of the α4-β5-α5 face of CheY with the N-terminal part of FliM plays a vital role in this process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Since, CheZ and FliM share a common face of CheY for binding with similar mode of interactions [41], VcCheY4 is expected not to interact efficiently with CheZ as well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>This observation corroborates with the fact that no cheZ is found in the cluster III where cheY4 is located. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Since VcCheY4 can be phosphorylated but cannot bind FliM and probably not CheZ as well, VcCheY4 might act as phosphate sink or it might induce the expression of some other genes upon phosphorylation which can indirectly modulate flagellar action and/or virulence. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>VcCheY4 was seen to slightly enhance the spreading of an E. coli cheZ mutant in semisolid agar and based on that Hyakutake et al proposed that VcCheY4 can affect chemotaxis by removing a phosphoryl group from VcCheY3 [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Our observations intend us to hypothesise that if a phosphate pull is shared by VcCheY3 and VcCheY4 then VcCheY4 can cause a phosphate depleted situation for VcCheY3, as phosphorylated state of VcCheY4 is more stable compared to its unphosphorylated state, which is other way round for VcCheY3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, in a phosphate depleted situation, additional energy might help phosphorylated VcCheY4 to release the phosphoryl group through conformation dependent autodephosphorylation, as proposed by Pazy et al., 2009 [42] based on their observations of the mutant EcCheY. </plain></SENT>
