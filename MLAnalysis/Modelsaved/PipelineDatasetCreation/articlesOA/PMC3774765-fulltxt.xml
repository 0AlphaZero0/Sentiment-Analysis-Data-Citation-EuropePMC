Importantly, interactions between immune/inflammatory and neuroendocrine systems may underlie programming effects. We examined whether cortisol changes persist to school age, and if common genetic variants in the promoter region of the <italic>NFKBIA</italic> gene involved in regulation of immune and inflammatory responses, modify the association between early experience and later life stress as indexed by hair cortisol levels, which provide an integrated index of endogenous HPA axis activity. Cortisol was assayed in hair samples from 128 children (83 born preterm &#8804;32 weeks gestation and 45 born full-term) without major sensory, motor or cognitive impairments at age 7 years. We found that hair cortisol levels were lower in preterm compared to term-born children. Downregulation of the HPA axis in preterm children without major impairment, seen years after neonatal stress terminated, suggests persistent alteration of stress system programming. Importantly, the etiology was gender-specific such that in preterm boys but not girls, specifically those with the minor allele for <italic>NFKBIA</italic> rs2233409, lower hair cortisol was associated with greater neonatal pain (number of skin-breaking procedures from birth to term), independent of medical confounders. Moreover, the minor allele (CT or TT) of <italic>NFKBIA</italic> rs2233409 was associated with higher secretion of inflammatory cytokines, supporting the hypothesis that neonatal pain-related stress may act as a proinflammatory stimulus that induces long-term immune cell activation. These findings are the first evidence that a long-term association between early pain-related stress and cortisol may be mediated by a genetic variants that regulate the activity of NF-&#954;B, suggesting possible involvement of stress/inflammatory mechanisms in HPA programming in boys born very preterm.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by grants from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) National Institutes of Health/NICHD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nichd.nih.gov">http://www.nichd.nih.gov</ext-link>) R01 HD039783 to REG, and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca">http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca</ext-link>) MOP86489 to REG.

Dysregulation of immune/inflammatory responses may play a central role in mediating early programming effects <xref rid="pone.0073926-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Studies in the field of early programming have focused primarily on heightened stress reactivity later in life, often measured in terms of HPA responses to acute stressors. In contrast little is known about effects of programming on endogenous stress levels long after a period of early stress has terminated.</p><p>Infants born very preterm (&#8804;32 weeks gestation) are exposed to considerable procedural pain-related stress during weeks to months of life-saving procedures during hospitalization in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), that appears to impact the HPA axis long after NICU discharge <xref rid="pone.0073926-Grunau1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073926-Grunau2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Importantly, the neuroendocrine system, the immune system and the central nervous system are linked in a complex regulatory network, with extensive bidirectional communication between and among these systems (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0073926-Padett1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073926-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>). Glucocorticoid hormones can regulate expression of immunologically related genes <xref rid="pone.0073926-Padett1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073926-Miller2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and conversely, dysregulation of immune/inflammatory responses may play a central role in mediating early programming effects of the HPA axis <xref rid="pone.0073926-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The potential role of stress hormones in mediating immune/inflammatory function and in turn, the role of immune function/inflammation in mediating changes in the HPA axis in children born very preterm have not been addressed to our knowledge.</p><p>Cortisol levels are known to be relatively low while preterm infants are in the NICU <xref rid="pone.0073926-Hingre1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0073926-Grunau3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Long after NICU discharge, the trajectory of cortisol activity over time appears to be altered <xref rid="pone.0073926-Grunau1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In a longitudinal cohort, we found that greater cumulative neonatal pain-related stress (higher number of skin-breaking procedures from birth to term adjusted for neonatal medical confounders) was associated with altered baseline cortisol levels at 8 and 18 months corrected age compared to infants born full-term term <xref rid="pone.0073926-Grunau1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073926-Grunau2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Importantly, endogenous cortisol levels play an important role in brain function <xref rid="pone.0073926-Lupien1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0073926-Fietta1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and in physiology and metabolism <xref rid="pone.0073926-Molina1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Thus alterations in HPA activity and responsiveness at school age in children born preterm have important functional implications.</p><p>Stress and adversity in early life can program a phenotype of exaggerated adrenocortical and inflammatory responses to challenge <xref rid="pone.0073926-Miller3" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Environmental stress can enhance or suppress aspects of the immune response by altering activity of the cellular signaling pathways that regulate inflammation, including the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-&#954;B <xref rid="pone.0073926-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Long-term alterations in HPA responsiveness that result from early life stress and adversity may also play a role in modulating immune function. Moreover, early life stress, including pain, shows sex-specific effects in rodents, however the direction varies depending on numerous factors such as age and type of exposure (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0073926-LaPrairie1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>); therefore, we examined gender differences. Several studies have reported associations between maternal depression and altered child basal cortisol levels <xref rid="pone.0073926-Dougherty1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, therefore we examined maternal depression and anxiety as potential social confounders.</p><p>In the present study we first determined whether the increased cortisol levels observed in children at 8 and 18 months persist to school age in children born very preterm. Then to address the etiology of HPA alterations in these children, we examined whether neonatal inflammation may be involved in programming of the HPA axis by early life stress. Specifically, we investigated whether common genetic variants in the promoter region of the <italic>NFKBIA</italic> gene modulate the long-term associations of neonatal procedural pain-related stress with HPA axis programming in children born very preterm. The <italic>NFKBIA</italic> gene encodes I&#954;B&#945;, a critical negative regulator of the transcription factor NF-&#954;B <xref rid="pone.0073926-Hayden1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073926-Lynn1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. NF-&#954;B regulates the expression of the majority of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and leukocyte adhesion molecules, as well as pro-survival and anti-apoptosis genes; moreover, dysregulation of NF-&#954;B is a known consequence of early life stress <xref rid="pone.0073926-Niederberger1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073926-Bonizzi1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Specifically, we assessed functional genetic variants in the promoter of <italic>NFKBIA.</italic> It has been established that individuals carrying the minor allelic variants at rs3138053 and rs2233409 have lower expression of both the <italic>NFKBIA</italic> gene expression and I&#954;B&#945; protein and this decrease in negative regulation is associated with higher Toll-like receptor-mediated inflammatory responses <xref rid="pone.0073926-Ali1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Importantly, in the present study, we used hair cortisol as an integrated measure of chronic stress that provides a well-validated index of endogenous HPA axis activity over time <xref rid="pone.0073926-VanUum1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0073926-Meyer1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> in contrast to salivary or serum cortisol that provides an acute measure at a single point in time, varies with time of day, and reflects the more immediate stress context. Furthermore, in a subset of children born preterm that consented to provide a blood sample at age 7 years, we compared the levels of NF-&#954;B-driven secretion of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor-necrosis-factor alpha (TNF&#945;) between subjects who varied in the promoter regions of the <italic>NFKBIA</italic> gene.</p><p>Cumulative neonatal pain-related stress was operationalized as the sum of all skin-breaking procedures, adjusted for medical confounders. The magnitude of response to a procedure in preterm neonates does not directly reflect the degree of invasiveness. Rather, sensitization to what has occurred in the past hour <xref rid="pone.0073926-Holsti1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, past 24 hours <xref rid="pone.0073926-Grunau4" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, and cumulatively since birth <xref rid="pone.0073926-Grunau5" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, underlies reactivity. Sensitization is mediated at the spinal cord level, and is a phenomenon of the immature central nervous system that is excitable to incoming stimuli, inducing a wind-up phenomenon that affects reactivity to subsequent stimuli <xref rid="pone.0073926-Fitzgerald1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Therefore we use the number of skin-breaking procedures from birth to hospital discharge as an index of &#8220;pain-related stress&#8221; and did not adjust for extent of each procedure.</p><p>Our approach reflected the theoretical framework of long-term effects of major psychological childhood stress proposed by Miller, Chen and Parker <xref rid="pone.0073926-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and aimed to extend their model to long term effects of physical stress in very immature preterm neonates. We hypothesized that at age 7 years: 1) hair cortisol levels will differ in children born very preterm compared to full-term, and differ by gender; 2) among the very preterm children, procedural pain-related stress in the NICU, quantified as number of skin-breaking procedures from birth to term equivalent (adjusted for medical and social confounders), will be associated with altered hair cortisol levels at age 7 years; and 3) genetic variation that impacts the regulation of NF-&#954;B will interact with the degree of pain-related stress in the NICU and be reflected in hair cortisol levels at age 7 years. To our knowledge, this is the first study in very preterm children to address the etiology of HPA activity in relation to a transcription factor critical in stress and immune function, and the first study in this population of a cumulative index of stress long after hospital discharge.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Board of the University of British Columbia and the Research Ethics Board of the Children&#8217;s &amp; Women&#8217;s Health Centre of BC, and conforms to the conventions set out in the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 133 school age children, 91 born preterm (PT) at &#8804;32 wk gestational age (GA) (M&#8202;=&#8202;42, F&#8202;=&#8202;49; mean gestation 29.6 wk; SD&#8202;=&#8202;2.4; mean age at testing 7.7 yrs; SD&#8202;=&#8202;0.3) and 42 full-term (FT) healthy controls (M&#8202;=&#8202;15, F&#8202;=&#8202;27; mean gestation 39.9 wk; SD&#8202;=&#8202;1.0; mean age 7.8 yr; SD&#8202;=&#8202;0.8) were included in the present study as part of a longitudinal study on the long-term effects of pain-related stress in children born very preterm (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0073926-Grunau1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073926-Grunau6" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0073926-t001">Table 1</xref>).

A cluster of hair strands (&#8764;2&#8211;3 mm diameter) were cut at the base of the hair shaft from five small spots. The hair samples were secured on a cardboard card with tape, labeled, and stored in individual sealed plastic bags at room temperature until analysis. The most proximal 2 cm from the scalp of each hair sample was utilized for the assay. The hair sample was weighed, and 10&#8211;15 mg from each sample was placed in scintillation vials. To remove external contaminants, hair samples were washed twice by immersing each sample in 3 mL of isopropanol and incubating it at room temperature in a centrifuge at 100 RPM for 3 minutes. After decanting the isopropanol, samples were allowed to dry for at least 12 hours. After drying, 1 mL of methanol was added to each scintillation vial. Hair was then finely minced with surgical scissors, cleaning the scissors between samples. The vials were sealed with paraffin film and incubated for 16 hours at 50&#176;C in a centrifuge at 100 RPM. Following methanol extraction each cortisol-containing methanol solution was transferred into 5 mL test tubes and evaporated on a test tube hot plate under a steady stream of nitrogen gas.

We found that for both boys and girls, hair cortisol levels as an integrated index of chronic stress, were lower in children born very preterm compared to full-term.

These previous studies demonstrated upregulation of resting cortisol levels at 8 and 18 months corrected age in the the subset of preterm infants born at extremely low gestational age (ELGA, 23&#8211;28 weeks gestation). In the present study, we now found downregulation of hair cortisol overall in children born very preterm (both ELGA, 23&#8211;28 weeks and very low gestational age, VLGA, 28&#8211;32 weeks), in the same cohort at school age, suggesting persistent early programming. Cortisol levels in humans exposed to early adverse conditions can later show upregulation or downregulation depending on multiple factors including time since the stress occurred and the nature of the stress or trauma (<xref rid="pone.0073926-Carpenter1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073926-Miller4" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. In particular, post-traumatic stress disorder is associated with a pattern of higher cortisol closer to the period of substantial stress, then lower cortisol later. Interestingly, <italic>fetal</italic> stress has been associated with low cortisol in adulthood, but only in a subset of individuals born low birthweight and post-mature (i.e. after 40 weeks gestation), whereas other subgroups of low birthweight adults displayed the opposite association between fetal stress and later cortisol concentrations <xref rid="pone.0073926-Kajantie1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Whether among infants born very preterm or growth-restricted at full-term, the lack of prospective longitudinal studies limits understanding of the etiology of early life stress and later variation in direction of cortisol. Our findings suggest such developmental trajectories long-term to be complex and likely gender-specific, requiring a lot of further research to elucidate the factors involved.</p><p>Relationships between dysregulation in cortisol levels and clinical manifestations are complex. A recent review of research on hair cortisol described contradictory findings on the direction of cumulative cortisol in relation to depression <xref rid="pone.0073926-Sharpley1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.

Importantly, consistent with our hair cortisol findings in the present study, we found that the extent of pain-related stress adjusted for neonatal medical confounders was associated with reduced salivary cortisol levels on the test day, and salivary diurnal cortisol pattern on non-school days, primarily in boys (Grunau and colleagues unpublished data). Our findings that the relationship between neonatal pain-related stress and down regulation of cortisol at age 7 years converges across multiple independent cortisol measures speaks to the robustness of our findings.</p><p>NF-&#954;B belongs to a family of transcription factors that can orchestrate many stress and inflammatory processes. Activation of NF-&#954;B represents a downstream effector for the response to stressful events and links changes in the activity of the neuroendocrine axis to the cellular response <xref rid="pone.0073926-Bierhaus1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. An example of this link is the finding by Miller and colleagues demonstrating heightened expression of genes controlled by NF-&#954;B in adults who experienced low socioeconomic status (SES) in early life <xref rid="pone.0073926-Miller5" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Genetic variation in the promoter region of <italic>NFKBIA</italic>, which alters the &#8216;tuning&#8217; of stress and immune responsiveness, has been linked to alterations in susceptibility to infectious and inflammatory diseases, and a variety of cancers <xref rid="pone.0073926-Ali1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073926-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. In this study we identified a novel association in boys between <italic>NFKBIA</italic> rs2233409 genotype, hair cortisol and neonatal procedural pain-related stress. Intriguingly, rs2233409 lies in the putative binding site of octamer binding transcription factor-1 (Oct-1) that interacts synergistically with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to bind DNA <xref rid="pone.0073926-Gene1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Disruption of Oct-1 binding due to the rs2233409 polymorphism would be predicted to reduce the anti-inflammatory effects of ligand bound GR, since DNA binding of Oct-1 strictly depends on GR binding <xref rid="pone.0073926-Brggemeier1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Our present findings that the minor allele (CT or TT) of <italic>NFKBIA</italic> rs2233409 may influence the long-term effects of neonatal pain-related stress provide evidence of an association only, and animal experimental work is required to establish a causal pathway.

A previous study by Jones et al., <xref rid="pone.0073926-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref> found that in 7&#8211;9 year old children, lower birth weight was significantly associated with a higher salivary cortisol response to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) in boys, but not in girls. In line with this, Elzinga et al. 2008 <xref rid="pone.0073926-Elzinga1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref> reported a blunted cortisol response to the TSST in subjects with early trauma, which was more prominent in men than in women. However, the direction of effects can vary, and in some studies no gender differences were found in neuroendocrine regulation after early stress or trauma (for review see: <xref rid="pone.0073926-Kajantie2" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. Our findings extend these previous data, demonstrating downregulation of HPA activity in hair cortisol, which provides an integrated measure of cortisol levels over time.</p><p>Taken together, early life stress appears to be more strongly associated with HPA axis function in males than in females <xref rid="pone.0073926-Kajantie2" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, consistent with our current results of a negative association of early life pain-related stress and hair cortisol in preterm boys but not girls. Importantly, similar differences in prepubertal children have been reported previously <xref rid="pone.0073926-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Thus variation in concurrent sex steroid concentrations cannot sufficiently explain the observed gender differences <xref rid="pone.0073926-Kajantie2" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. Instead, evidence from animal studies suggests that there may be an important interaction between early stress and regulation of gonadal hormone production, suggesting that early adverse experiences may interfere with gonadal programming of a sexually dimorphic brain <xref rid="pone.0073926-Bale1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. However, little is known about disturbances of the normal hormonal milieu and surges due to premature birth and early stress exposure. It is clear that more research is needed to better understand the impact of gender on neuroendocrine function after early life stress in this population, and relationships between HPA axis regulation and clinical problems.</p><p>We have recently reported that infants born very preterm exposed prenatally to chorioamnionitis with funisitis (inflammation of the umbilical cord) had a different pattern of cortisol levels at 18 months corrected age, compared to infants exposed to chorioamnionitis alone or no prenatal infection, suggesting that presence of a <italic>fetal</italic> inflammatory response may alter programming of the HPA axis. In the present study, in school-age children, we did not have the results of placental histopathology, which places a limitation on our current findings. However, this does not alter our conclusion that functional genetic variation of stress and inflammatory responses appears to play a role in altered cortisol expression in boys born very preterm. Another important limitation to the present study is that the sample size was too low to evaluate the role of factors such as sources of current child stress (beyond parent depression and trait anxiety), socioeconomic status, parent-child behavioral interactions, and childhood illness after the NICU. In fact, given the wide range of past and concurrent factors that might affect the expression of cortisol, it was noteworthy that the association between neonatal pain-related stress and hair cortisol persisted to school-age (albeit only in boys).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Altered programming of the HPA axis indexed by cumulative cortisol levels, persists to school age in children born very preterm. In contrast to the elevated cortisol levels observed previously at 8 and 18 months, at age 7 years, cortisol was downregulated in preterm relative to full-term children. These findings suggest that these children may be experiencing some level of chronic stress over the long term, consistent with the pattern seen in post-traumatic stress disorder long after the stressor has ended. Importantly, this study is the first, to our knowledge, to reveal that functional genetic variation in the promoter of <italic>NFKBIA</italic>, which is a critical negative regulator of stress and inflammatory processes, plays a key role in long-term programming effects of neonatal pain-related stress on HPA function in children born very preterm.
