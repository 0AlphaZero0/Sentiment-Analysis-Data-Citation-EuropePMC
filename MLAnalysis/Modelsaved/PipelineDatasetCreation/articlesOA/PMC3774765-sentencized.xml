</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It is well established that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis or stress system is particularly sensitive to programming by early life events [1]–[8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Dysregulation of immune/inflammatory responses may play a central role in mediating early programming effects [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Studies in the field of early programming have focused primarily on heightened stress reactivity later in life, often measured in terms of HPA responses to acute stressors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In contrast little is known about effects of programming on endogenous stress levels long after a period of early stress has terminated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Infants born very preterm (≤32 weeks gestation) are exposed to considerable procedural pain-related stress during weeks to months of life-saving procedures during hospitalization in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), that appears to impact the HPA axis long after NICU discharge [8], [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the neuroendocrine system, the immune system and the central nervous system are linked in a complex regulatory network, with extensive bidirectional communication between and among these systems (e.g. [11], [9]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Glucocorticoid hormones can regulate expression of immunologically related genes [11], [12], and conversely, dysregulation of immune/inflammatory responses may play a central role in mediating early programming effects of the HPA axis [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The potential role of stress hormones in mediating immune/inflammatory function and in turn, the role of immune function/inflammation in mediating changes in the HPA axis in children born very preterm have not been addressed to our knowledge. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Cortisol levels are known to be relatively low while preterm infants are in the NICU [13]–[16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Long after NICU discharge, the trajectory of cortisol activity over time appears to be altered [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In a longitudinal cohort, we found that greater cumulative neonatal pain-related stress (higher number of skin-breaking procedures from birth to term adjusted for neonatal medical confounders) was associated with altered baseline cortisol levels at 8 and 18 months corrected age compared to infants born full-term term [8], [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Importantly, endogenous cortisol levels play an important role in brain function [17]–[19] and in physiology and metabolism [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Thus alterations in HPA activity and responsiveness at school age in children born preterm have important functional implications. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Stress and adversity in early life can program a phenotype of exaggerated adrenocortical and inflammatory responses to challenge [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Environmental stress can enhance or suppress aspects of the immune response by altering activity of the cellular signaling pathways that regulate inflammation, including the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-κB [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Long-term alterations in HPA responsiveness that result from early life stress and adversity may also play a role in modulating immune function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Moreover, early life stress, including pain, shows sex-specific effects in rodents, however the direction varies depending on numerous factors such as age and type of exposure (e.g. [22]); therefore, we examined gender differences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Several studies have reported associations between maternal depression and altered child basal cortisol levels [23], therefore we examined maternal depression and anxiety as potential social confounders. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In the present study we first determined whether the increased cortisol levels observed in children at 8 and 18 months persist to school age in children born very preterm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Then to address the etiology of HPA alterations in these children, we examined whether neonatal inflammation may be involved in programming of the HPA axis by early life stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Specifically, we investigated whether common genetic variants in the promoter region of the NFKBIA gene modulate the long-term associations of neonatal procedural pain-related stress with HPA axis programming in children born very preterm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The NFKBIA gene encodes IκBα, a critical negative regulator of the transcription factor NF-κB [24], [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>NF-κB regulates the expression of the majority of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and leukocyte adhesion molecules, as well as pro-survival and anti-apoptosis genes; moreover, dysregulation of NF-κB is a known consequence of early life stress [26], [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Specifically, we assessed functional genetic variants in the promoter of NFKBIA. It has been established that individuals carrying the minor allelic variants at rs3138053 and rs2233409 have lower expression of both the NFKBIA gene expression and IκBα protein and this decrease in negative regulation is associated with higher Toll-like receptor-mediated inflammatory responses [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Importantly, in the present study, we used hair cortisol as an integrated measure of chronic stress that provides a well-validated index of endogenous HPA axis activity over time [29]–[31] in contrast to salivary or serum cortisol that provides an acute measure at a single point in time, varies with time of day, and reflects the more immediate stress context. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in a subset of children born preterm that consented to provide a blood sample at age 7 years, we compared the levels of NF-κB-driven secretion of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor-necrosis-factor alpha (TNFα) between subjects who varied in the promoter regions of the NFKBIA gene. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Cumulative neonatal pain-related stress was operationalized as the sum of all skin-breaking procedures, adjusted for medical confounders. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of response to a procedure in preterm neonates does not directly reflect the degree of invasiveness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Rather, sensitization to what has occurred in the past hour [32], past 24 hours [33], and cumulatively since birth [34], underlies reactivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Sensitization is mediated at the spinal cord level, and is a phenomenon of the immature central nervous system that is excitable to incoming stimuli, inducing a wind-up phenomenon that affects reactivity to subsequent stimuli [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Therefore we use the number of skin-breaking procedures from birth to hospital discharge as an index of “pain-related stress” and did not adjust for extent of each procedure. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Our approach reflected the theoretical framework of long-term effects of major psychological childhood stress proposed by Miller, Chen and Parker [9], and aimed to extend their model to long term effects of physical stress in very immature preterm neonates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that at age 7 years: 1) hair cortisol levels will differ in children born very preterm compared to full-term, and differ by gender; 2) among the very preterm children, procedural pain-related stress in the NICU, quantified as number of skin-breaking procedures from birth to term equivalent (adjusted for medical and social confounders), will be associated with altered hair cortisol levels at age 7 years; and 3) genetic variation that impacts the regulation of NF-κB will interact with the degree of pain-related stress in the NICU and be reflected in hair cortisol levels at age 7 years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first study in very preterm children to address the etiology of HPA activity in relation to a transcription factor critical in stress and immune function, and the first study in this population of a cumulative index of stress long after hospital discharge. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we utilized normal variation in the NFKBIA gene to examine whether genetic modulation of the inflammatory phenotype influences the effects of early stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>We found that for both boys and girls, hair cortisol levels as an integrated index of chronic stress, were lower in children born very preterm compared to full-term. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship between neonatal pain-related stress (adjusted for multiple confounders associated with prematurity) and hair cortisol was affected by presence of the minor allele for NFKBIA rs2233409 in boys, but not girls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>These findings are the first to reveal that long-term effects of early pain-related stress exposure on the HPA axis are associated with normal genetic variation affecting NFKBIA/IκBα–the major negative regulator of NF-κB activity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>The present study extends our earlier work showing an altered trajectory of baseline salivary cortisol expression in very preterm-born infants from the same longitudinal cohort [8], [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>These previous studies demonstrated upregulation of resting cortisol levels at 8 and 18 months corrected age in the the subset of preterm infants born at extremely low gestational age (ELGA, 23–28 weeks gestation). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we now found downregulation of hair cortisol overall in children born very preterm (both ELGA, 23–28 weeks and very low gestational age, VLGA, 28–32 weeks), in the same cohort at school age, suggesting persistent early programming. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Cortisol levels in humans exposed to early adverse conditions can later show upregulation or downregulation depending on multiple factors including time since the stress occurred and the nature of the stress or trauma ([43], [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>In particular, post-traumatic stress disorder is associated with a pattern of higher cortisol closer to the period of substantial stress, then lower cortisol later. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, fetal stress has been associated with low cortisol in adulthood, but only in a subset of individuals born low birthweight and post-mature (i.e. after 40 weeks gestation), whereas other subgroups of low birthweight adults displayed the opposite association between fetal stress and later cortisol concentrations [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Whether among infants born very preterm or growth-restricted at full-term, the lack of prospective longitudinal studies limits understanding of the etiology of early life stress and later variation in direction of cortisol. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest such developmental trajectories long-term to be complex and likely gender-specific, requiring a lot of further research to elucidate the factors involved. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Relationships between dysregulation in cortisol levels and clinical manifestations are complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>A recent review of research on hair cortisol described contradictory findings on the direction of cumulative cortisol in relation to depression [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>In general, long-term associations between HPA axis dysregulation and clinical manifestations, and the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying variation in direction of these relationships, are not well understood [47]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Our data are unique to our knowledge, as they arise from the only longitudinal cohort study of the developmental trajectory of HPA activity in children born very preterm compared to full-term, spanning infancy to school-age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>In the only other study to compare cortisol levels in preterm versus full term children, high awakening salivary cortisol was reported in early adolescence in the preterm group [48], indicating that different information about HPA function may be revealed by measures of diurnal patterns of salivary cortisol compared to a more integrated measure of cortisol levels over time as evaluated in hair. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Importantly, consistent with our hair cortisol findings in the present study, we found that the extent of pain-related stress adjusted for neonatal medical confounders was associated with reduced salivary cortisol levels on the test day, and salivary diurnal cortisol pattern on non-school days, primarily in boys (Grunau and colleagues unpublished data). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Our findings that the relationship between neonatal pain-related stress and down regulation of cortisol at age 7 years converges across multiple independent cortisol measures speaks to the robustness of our findings. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>NF-κB belongs to a family of transcription factors that can orchestrate many stress and inflammatory processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Activation of NF-κB represents a downstream effector for the response to stressful events and links changes in the activity of the neuroendocrine axis to the cellular response [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>An example of this link is the finding by Miller and colleagues demonstrating heightened expression of genes controlled by NF-κB in adults who experienced low socioeconomic status (SES) in early life [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Genetic variation in the promoter region of NFKBIA, which alters the ‘tuning’ of stress and immune responsiveness, has been linked to alterations in susceptibility to infectious and inflammatory diseases, and a variety of cancers [28], [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>In this study we identified a novel association in boys between NFKBIA rs2233409 genotype, hair cortisol and neonatal procedural pain-related stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, rs2233409 lies in the putative binding site of octamer binding transcription factor-1 (Oct-1) that interacts synergistically with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to bind DNA [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Disruption of Oct-1 binding due to the rs2233409 polymorphism would be predicted to reduce the anti-inflammatory effects of ligand bound GR, since DNA binding of Oct-1 strictly depends on GR binding [53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Our present findings that the minor allele (CT or TT) of NFKBIA rs2233409 may influence the long-term effects of neonatal pain-related stress provide evidence of an association only, and animal experimental work is required to establish a causal pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>We have shown that in boys born preterm, the minor allele (CT or TT) of NFKBIA rs2233409 was associated with higher secretion of inflammatory cytokines, providing support to the idea that neonatal pain-related stress may act as a proinflammatory stimulus that induces long-term immune cell activation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>2008 [63] reported a blunted cortisol response to the TSST in subjects with early trauma, which was more prominent in men than in women. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>However, the direction of effects can vary, and in some studies no gender differences were found in neuroendocrine regulation after early stress or trauma (for review see: [64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Our findings extend these previous data, demonstrating downregulation of HPA activity in hair cortisol, which provides an integrated measure of cortisol levels over time. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Taken together, early life stress appears to be more strongly associated with HPA axis function in males than in females [64], consistent with our current results of a negative association of early life pain-related stress and hair cortisol in preterm boys but not girls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Importantly, similar differences in prepubertal children have been reported previously [62]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Thus variation in concurrent sex steroid concentrations cannot sufficiently explain the observed gender differences [64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Instead, evidence from animal studies suggests that there may be an important interaction between early stress and regulation of gonadal hormone production, suggesting that early adverse experiences may interfere with gonadal programming of a sexually dimorphic brain [61]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about disturbances of the normal hormonal milieu and surges due to premature birth and early stress exposure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>It is clear that more research is needed to better understand the impact of gender on neuroendocrine function after early life stress in this population, and relationships between HPA axis regulation and clinical problems. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>We have recently reported that infants born very preterm exposed prenatally to chorioamnionitis with funisitis (inflammation of the umbilical cord) had a different pattern of cortisol levels at 18 months corrected age, compared to infants exposed to chorioamnionitis alone or no prenatal infection, suggesting that presence of a fetal inflammatory response may alter programming of the HPA axis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>In the present study, in school-age children, we did not have the results of placental histopathology, which places a limitation on our current findings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>However, this does not alter our conclusion that functional genetic variation of stress and inflammatory responses appears to play a role in altered cortisol expression in boys born very preterm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Another important limitation to the present study is that the sample size was too low to evaluate the role of factors such as sources of current child stress (beyond parent depression and trait anxiety), socioeconomic status, parent-child behavioral interactions, and childhood illness after the NICU. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>In fact, given the wide range of past and concurrent factors that might affect the expression of cortisol, it was noteworthy that the association between neonatal pain-related stress and hair cortisol persisted to school-age (albeit only in boys). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Altered programming of the HPA axis indexed by cumulative cortisol levels, persists to school age in children born very preterm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the elevated cortisol levels observed previously at 8 and 18 months, at age 7 years, cortisol was downregulated in preterm relative to full-term children. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that these children may be experiencing some level of chronic stress over the long term, consistent with the pattern seen in post-traumatic stress disorder long after the stressor has ended. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Importantly, this study is the first, to our knowledge, to reveal that functional genetic variation in the promoter of NFKBIA, which is a critical negative regulator of stress and inflammatory processes, plays a key role in long-term programming effects of neonatal pain-related stress on HPA function in children born very preterm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, higher secretion of inflammatory cytokines was related to the minor allele (CT or TT) of NFKBIA rs2233409, consistent with the possibility that neonatal pain-related stress may act as a proinflammatory stimulus that induces long-term immune cell activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>The finding that these effects were gender-specific, with boys driving the association, has major clinical implications for understanding possible gender differences in vulnerability of these children. </plain></SENT>
