<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Psychiatric disorders affect a large percentage of the general population [1], and affected individuals present with mood alterations, psychosis, and in some cases combinations of both. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Consequently, accurate diagnoses of mood and psychotic disorders may be deferred until certain criteria are met, resulting in treatment delays and decreased patient compliance with most patients undergoing multiple drug treatments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Given the plethora of treatment options available and the trial and error approach used in their administration, most patients do not respond favorably to treatment, and there is little data to predict individual treatment response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Whereas there is no “one size fits all” treatment course for the current diagnostic classifications, the possibility remains that, at an individual level, distinct medications may yield superior efficacy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is important to continue efforts to identify new ways to personalize treatment and improve outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This approach may lead to a subgroup of patients, based upon molecular subtyping, that show better response to medications than other patients with a different molecular subtype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This review will focus on gene expression studies pertaining to treatment response in major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia (SZ) and will provide an example of a biomarker study in individuals with first-episode SZ. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Pharmacogenetic studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with treatment response to antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and antidepressants (for reviews, see [2–5]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Serotonin and dopamine receptor polymorphism genotype, homovanillic acid levels, and severity of illness are a few of the predictive factors available, but the task of selecting the most effective treatment for each patient still remains a challenge [3, 6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Identification of novel early response biomarkers may enable patients to receive more individualized treatment, thereby reducing symptoms and adverse effects and increasing quality of life for patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>One area of genetic research that may in the future prove to be useful in classification of treatment and nontreatment responders will be the examination of methylation status of genomic DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>This approach has been tried in peripheral samples in BD and SZ for demonstrating differences in methylation levels of single genes and genomewide between affected individuals and controls [7–10], while in MDD, a majority of methylation studies have been performed in postmortem brain [11, 12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In MDD, there have also been studies investigating the association of methylation and histone modifications with antidepressant treatment response (reviewed in [13]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>For example, Lopez et al. [14] found that there is a significant decrease in H3K27me3 levels at promoter-IV of the BDNF gene in MDDs responding to 8 weeks of treatment with citalopram. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>BDNF is a gene of interest in depression since there is much evidence linking it to the etiology of depression, and its treatment [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Decreased BDNF gene expression has been associated with stress and depression and this downregulation can be reversed with antidepressant treatment [16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The use of gene expression classifiers of antipsychotic, mood stabilizer, or antidepressant responses is an alternative strategy that may allow for prediction of individual drug response prior to or in the early phase of drug administration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Gene expression can change dynamically or remain state independent, as opposed to SNPs that are fixed and do not respond to medications or changes in psychiatric symptoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Gene expression profiling has been successfully used in the investigation of response to treatment for several medical conditions, such as breast cancer [17–19], colon cancer [20], and cardiovascular disease [21–23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>These studies highlight the potential for the use of peripheral gene expression in investigations of the underlying pathophysiology of mood disorders and SZ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Although highly heritable, MDD, BD, and SZ are believed to be the product of multiple interacting genetic and environmental variables which can be investigated using gene expression [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The examination of gene expression alterations as potential biomarkers may allow for trait- as well as state-dependent markers of BD, MDD, and SZ subgroups, perhaps allowing insight into potential key biological processes implicated in these disorders. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Peripheral Gene Expression </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The main interest in using peripheral blood for potential classifiers of antidepressant, antipsychotic, and mood stabilizer response, as opposed to brain tissue samples, is the relative ease of acquisition and the practical utility of blood samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The peripheral blood transcriptome shares greater than 80% homology with genes expressed in the brain [25], heart, liver, spleen, colon, kidney, prostate, and stomach [26], as well as having its intensity of gene expression for a number of biological processes comparable to that of the prefrontal cortex [27]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The use of blood cells to perform microarray studies has become increasingly popular due to the numerous advantages it provides, including the possibility to collect larger sample sizes with a minimally invasive procedure [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The use of blood, from living subjects, to study gene expression avoids the influence of confounding variables associated with postmortem brain studies, such as the postmortem interval, low pH, and other factors that decrease the integrity of mRNA and which must consequently be accounted for in subsequent analyses [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>A recent gene expression study among psychiatric patients demonstrated the possibility of discriminating between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder using a blood-based protocol [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>This same group has also confirmed findings implicating the selenium-binding protein 1 gene in schizophrenia using both brain and blood samples [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Recently, Rollins et al. [25] demonstrated considerable overlap between gene expression in brain and peripheral blood, from the same individual, using two independent populations and different high-throughput array platforms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive study by Sullivan and colleagues [27] provides a pragmatic outlook on the use of peripheral gene expression and the comparability of results to that of the CNS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Sullivan et al. [27] carried out a secondary analysis on data stemming from 79 human tissues for 33,698 genes (probed using the Affymetrix U133A microarray). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>They observed that the nonparametric correlation between whole blood and CNS tissues was 0.5 and that only 21 genes from a group of 45 SZ candidate genes were expressed in both the periphery and CNS and lastly that expression levels of genes in relevant biological processes were not significantly different between tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>This study brings to attention, that although blood and brain are not 100% comparable, there are definite similarities in expression patterns which endorse the use of whole blood and its individual cells (lymphocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells) as a proxy for the brain, although some caution must be used in any interpretations made. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Middleton and colleagues [32], when exploring lymphocyte gene expression in BD and SZ, observed opposing directionality of gene expression in lymphocytes to that of the same genes in the brain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude, very importantly, that one should not disregard those findings present solely in the periphery or opposing findings made in the CNS due to their being of great potential in the use of peripheral blood in the study of psychiatric disorders. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>These reports are encouraging in that they provide positive evidence that peripheral markers are robust and are able to produce some findings that are comparable to those from postmortem studies, thus lending support to the use of peripheral blood samples as an advantageous alternative in the quest for the biological markers of brain-based disorders. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Only a few studies of noncoding RNA have been conducted for biomarkers in human subjects, while in preclinical investigations, there has been an explosion of noncoding RNA studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>An area of research related to noncoding RNA and gene expression is microRNA (miRNA). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>miRNA can control both the level and translation of mRNA [33], thereby coordinating spatial and temporal localization of gene expression and protein in tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Gardiner et al. [34] found miRNAs in the maternally expressed DLK1-DIO3 region on chromosome 14q32 to be downregulated in SZ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Lai and colleagues [35] performed a miRNA study using a test set of 30 SZ and 30 controls from which they identified a seven miRNA signature using supervised methods, and confirmed the discriminatory power of the signature in an independent cohort of 60 SZ, and 30 controls with an area under the curve of 85%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>miRNAs have not only been examined for phenotypic association, but also with regards to treatment response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Chen et al. [36] treated 20 lymphoblastoid cell lines (10 BD and 10 discordant siblings) with lithium and then analyzed the expression levels of 13 miRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>They observed significant changes in expression of seven miRNAs after four days of treatment and four of these (miR-34a, miR-152, miR-155, and miR-221) continued to exhibit expression changes at day 16. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Using miRanda and TargetScan to focus on the mRNA targets of miR-221 and miR-34a (previously found by [37] to have altered expression in rat hippocampus with lithium), they found 39 targets to be inversely correlated to miR expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Several studies have recently been carried out to probe the relationship between miRNAs and antidepressant treatment and response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Bocchio-Chiavetto and colleagues [38] found 30 miRNAs to be differentially expressed in blood samples from ten depressed individuals following twelve weeks of antidepressant treatment with escitalopram. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Oved et al. [39] profiled miRNAs, using microarrays, in eight lymphoblastoid cell lines, exhibiting high or low sensitivity to paroxetine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>A comparison of these groups identified several miRNAs with significant expression differences between groups, particularly, miR-151-3p which targets CHL1, a gene implicated in neuronal plasticity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The serotonin transporter (SERT), which is the direct target of the SSRI class of antidepressants, was found to be the target of miR-16 [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>In their study, Baudry et al. [40] determined that chronic treatment of mice with fluoxetine increased levels of miR-16 in the dorsal raphe thereby reducing SERT expression, similar to the function of SSRIs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate a likely role of miRNAs in treatment response. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Until recently, few microarray studies employing peripheral blood samples to investigate gene expression in MDD were available; the majority of studies used quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>qPCR studies of blood gene expression have revealed a number of interesting alterations in MDD patients, including a reduction of glucocorticoid receptor alpha expression [41], reduction of glyoxalase-1 mRNA levels [42], reduced expression of neurotrophic factors [43], reduced PDLIM5 gene expression [44], and increased levels of CREB and HDAC5 [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>The level of expression of the serotonin transporter in MDD patients is a source of inconsistency, with two studies showing increased levels [46, 47] in leukocytes and PBMCs and another study reporting decreased levels in lymphocytes [48]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Several studies exploring peripheral gene expression using microarray technology were recently published. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>They observed a reduction in expression of genes involved in transcriptional activation, cell proliferation, immune response, and DNA replication and repair. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Spijker et al. [50] investigated peripheral gene expression in MDD patients through stimulation and incubation of blood samples from MDDs and controls with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a lipoglycan shown to produce depressive-like behaviors in humans [51], prior to RNA extraction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>In this study, the authors found that there is a difference in LPS-stimulated gene expression in MDD patients versus controls, leading to the identification of a predominantly immune-related biomarker with 87.5% sensitivity and 61.5% specificity to differentiate between cases and controls. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Their findings for HDAC5 were recently confirmed by Hobara et al. [57] in a comparison of levels of HDAC5 in subjects with current MDD compared to a sample of MDD subjects in remission. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>This decrease in VEGF mRNA levels, however, does not appear to translate into alterations in protein serum levels [58], suggesting the possibility of posttranscriptional modifications altering VEGF protein levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>However, the sample size used in this study was quite small (N = 25); thus, replication in larger treated samples is necessary. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>The most overrepresented functional group of genes was involved in axonal guidance signaling and included several genes previously linked to schizophrenia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>An 80% cross-validation rate using two sets of subjects was obtained to predict initial responders from nonresponders to antipsychotic treatment during a six-week interval. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Although this work requires larger number of subjects and a replication study, it suggests biological pathway differences that influence antipsychotic response leading to successful treatment response. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia are devastating disorders affecting at least 15% of the general population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Many functional genetic candidates have emerged from investigations into the underlying causes of these disorders and treatment response; however, these findings have not been widely replicated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Some likely causal factors for the inconsistency of these biomarker results are the complex nature of psychiatric disorders, as well as individualized treatment response profiles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Complex psychiatric disorders are characterized by an incomplete penetrance, an absence of classic Mendelian transmission likely due to gene × gene and gene × environment interactions, genetic heterogeneity, and broad phenotype definitions which translate into decreased power to detect individual gene effects [79]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>This complexity is mirrored in treatment outcome, with the majority of subjects not reaping any or limited benefit from treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Although much effort has been put toward purely genetic markers of treatment response [2–5], genetic variation alone might not explain response, suggesting that other factors are likely to be involved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>This underlies the importance of gene expression studies of response and the need to provide increasing benefit with administered treatments through the identification of robust peripheral biomarkers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>The studies reviewed herein provide several accounts of plausible biomarkers of positive treatment response, for example, CXCL10, highlighting several interesting and biological pathways with individual variation such as the immune system, while demonstrating the need for larger studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>These further studies are a step towards the identification of biomarkers which can eventually be used in a clinical setting to provide personalized treatment to affected individuals. </plain></SENT>
