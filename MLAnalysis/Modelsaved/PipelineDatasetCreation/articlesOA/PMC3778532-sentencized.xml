</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Switzerland was one of the first countries to consequently implement the regulations of the Bologna process for all degree programmes of higher education including medical education [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The process led to a conversion from the traditional six- year single-cycle curriculum to a two-cycle structure with a three-year Bachelor and a three-year Master programme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The medical faculties seized this opportunity to evaluate the existing curriculum and implement innovative teaching and assessment formats into the new programme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Relatively new disciplines and medical competencies like communication skills, humanities, palliative medicine, medical ethics, and family medicine were reconsidered and integrated into the curriculum structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Parts of this implementation process had already started before the Bologna reform. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>It was therefore possible to rely on previously established concepts and experience [1], [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Published in 2002, before the implementation of the Bologna process, the Swiss Catalogue of Learning Objectives (SCLO) provided a definition of the educational objectives for undergraduate medical education that was accepted by all medical faculties in Switzerland. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The SCLO defined the competencies of a graduate after completing 6 years of medical education, and since implementation of the Bologna process, awards graduates with the degree “Master of Medicine”. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>A revised version of the SCLO was published 2008 [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>It is now the basis for the Swiss federal licensing examination comprising a written and a clinical examination [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec><title><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Bologna-compatible medical education in Basel </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The Bachelor and Master programme in Basel consists of both a core curriculum and special study modules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In the Bachelor programme, the core curriculum includes organ-based modules and a longitudinal curriculum called “basic competencies” (BC) which covers four areas: </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>practical skills, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, social and communicative competencies (SOKO), scientific competencies, and Humanities and medical ethics.  </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The structure of the Master programme is comparable to the Bachelor programme but the longitudinal curriculum is now called “advanced competencies” (AC). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In addition to the organ-based modules, students have to complete ten months of clinical rotations, and a master thesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>An overview of the organ-based modules is given in figure 1 (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The learning outcomes of the organ-based modules are assessed with end-of-semester examinations using a multiple choices format. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The learning outcomes of the longitudinal curriculum (BC and AC) are assessed at the end of each year with an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>For logistical reasons, in some years the OSCE is split in partial examinations after each semester. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The results of the partial examinations are then summed up to a yearly result. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Results from single OSCE stations can be compensated with results from other stations, i.e. the OSCE as a whole must be passed, not single stations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Both the multiple choice examination and the OSCE must be passed to acquire the required credit points and to proceed to the next year of studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Compensation between the written examination and the OSCE is not possible. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>In addition to the core curriculum, students have to take special study modules where they can focus on individual interests. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>During the Bachelor programme, they can choose different topics from a set of options. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>During the Master programme, students are attached to family medicine, pharmacotherapy, and public health. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Participation is obligatory. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Assessment is integrated into the modules. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Consensus statements and recent publications call for integrating communication skills training into the clinical context [7], [8], [9], [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Van Dalen and colleagues demonstrated in a comparative study, that an integrated longitudinal curriculum resulted in more effective learning of communication skills than a concentrated course in the preclinical years [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Against this background, a longitudinal communication (SOKO) curriculum from the first Bachelor year to the first Master year was established in Basel. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The aim is to prepare students for patient contact and accompany them during the course of their studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The primary objective of the SOKO curriculum is to shape communication in such a way that patients are given an audible voice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Thereby, a student can experience each patient as an individual with a unique history and every patient can leave a distinct and lasting impression on the student. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Appropriate communication skills are used to open the space for the patient in terms of patient-centred communication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>With this approach, each patient contact has the potential of being a valuable learning opportunity in which students can experience how the patient’s personal history is connected to his or her health, illness, and coping with suffering. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec></sec></sec></SecTag><sec><title><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Description of the SOKO curriculum </plain></SENT>
</text></title><sec><title><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Underlying models and concepts of effective communication </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The aim of the Basel SOKO curriculum is to train students to gather correct and complete data (e.g. history taking) and to share information with patients in order to enable them to act as well-informed partners in the decision making processes [12], [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>A limited number of communication techniques are trained that are then applied in different combinations to cope with different complex tasks such as breaking bad news or shared decision making. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>In principle, the techniques can be divided into two categories: “opening space” and “limiting space”. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The task is, therefore, not necessarily to give patients room for an infinite narrative [14] but to provide students with techniques to manage encounters with different focal points. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>A typical field of application of opening and limiting space is classical history taking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Primarily, it is about gathering information from the patient [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>To accomplish this, there are two sets of communication techniques, those that can be used to test hypotheses and those that can be used to generate hypotheses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Testing a hypothesis in the process of history taking makes sense when the doctor already has distinct assumptions about the patient’s problem and these can be verified or falsified [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>A typical example would be a 65-year old patient in the emergency room with acute left-sided thoracic pain and dyspnoea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Due to the constellation of symptoms and the patient’s age, it is highly likely that the suspected diagnosis “angina pectoris” can be verified or falsified with few additional data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>It would be adequate to ask very directed and specific closed questions (“Did the pain appear during physical effort?”, “Have you experienced these symptoms before?”, “Do you smoke?” etc.). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Such questions are frequently used by clinical experts in university hospitals with a highly selected patient mix and therefore observed frequently by students. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Experts construct illness scripts and compare patients’ symptoms with their illness scripts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>With growing expertise, testing hypotheses and subsequent data gathering become more and more precise and direct [16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Communication techniques to generate hypotheses make sense when a constellation of symptoms do not lead to a specific diagnosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>An example would be a patient who visits the general practitioner due to increasing fatigue over the past weeks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>In this situation, the doctor would invite the patient to tell his story. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>The doctor would use communication techniques that are abbreviated in the acronym WEMS (“Waiting, Echoing, Mirroring, Summarising”) to open the narrative space for the patient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Comparable techniques are called “reflecting back” and are used in the field of motivational interviewing when it is important to learn more about the patient’s individual reasons in order to enable or change a specific behaviour [17], [18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Communication techniques that limit space also help students to structure an encounter, e.g. in relation to time, topic, and language flow. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Students learn to verbalise their own function and task, to ask the patient for specific expectations and to match these expectations with their own tasks and the given time schedule for the encounter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Students are encouraged to redirect patients to the topics that were negotiated at the beginning of the interview (“I notice that you do have urging questions about the financial aspects of your new wheel chair. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>We cannot talk about that at this moment but I would like to come back to this issue tomorrow when we see each other during the ward round.”). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Sharing complex information requires very explicit structuring during the interview. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>For this task the so-called “book metaphor” can be applied effectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>The book metaphor transfers the structure of a book to the interview: title, table of contents, title of chapters, and text. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Meta-communication techniques are used to help patients to re-orientate themselves during the encounter: providing overviews (“at the moment, we are talking about …”), signposting (“now, we will come to the next issue…”), summarising (“I would like to summarise what we have talked about already….”). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Pieces of information are presented in small coherent portions (“chunking”) after which a pause follows to check the understanding of the patient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Only if the patient verbally or non-verbally signalises that he or she is able to follow and continue does the student provide the next portion of information. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>If the student is able to open and limit space, another educational objective, namely dealing with emotions, will be trained. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Students are often, but often unspectacularly, confronted with patients’ emotions, concerns, and fears, and students have to react to these. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>In Basel, students are trained in specific skills to handle emotions and concerns that are abbreviated in the acronym NURSE, which means naming emotion, understanding emotion, respecting = showing respect for the patient, supporting, exploring emotion [19], [20]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Another important task of clinical work is making decisions together with the patient about diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and treatment plans, especially if there are several equally effective options. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Depending on the patient’s preference, decisions can be made either by the doctor, or by the patient, or in a shared manner [21], [22], [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>The first step in communication with the patient would be for the doctor to identify the patient’s preference and to provide the relevant complex information in a manner which helps the patient take part in the decision making process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>The information needs to be adapted to the patient’s health and disease concept which cannot be identified by directed questions but by listening to patient’s narrative [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>The above mentioned communication techniques are also used for breaking bad news. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>This task can be defined as a combination of providing or sharing complex information and dealing with emotions [20]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec><title><text><SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Design of the SOKO curriculum </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>The longitudinal SOKO curriculum combines lectures, seminars, and small group learning from the first Bachelor to the first Master year (see table 1 (Tab. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>The course contents refer to requirements and course contents of other parts of the medical curriculum. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec><title><text><SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Bachelor year 1 </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>In the first year of studies, students are introduced into the basics of clinical communication and into the biopsychosocial model as a complement to the biomedical model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Students meet clinical role models and use communication skills to interview the clinicians about their attitude towards their profession. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>The clinicians share their knowledge and experience either by answering the students’ direct questions or in the form of narratives. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Students also attend exercises about dealing with stress and how to provide and receive feedback. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>The latter is intended to support students’ teamwork in their problem-based tutorials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>It trains students to observe the behaviour of others and helps them to distinguish between describing and interpreting observable phenomena (“I noticed that your feet were tapping during the whole interview” versus “you look nervous”). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>The exercises are conducted by peer tutors who accompany and support the students for the entire first year during the special study modules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>The peer tutors therefore slip into the role of mentors for the first-year students. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>In small groups of four, students meet four simulated patients (SP), one after another. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Each student has to interview a SP and functions as an observer for the other three student-SP encounters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>After the interviews, students identify communication techniques as well as communication challenges and provide feedback for each other. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>The interviews are videotaped and given to a peer tutor after the first session. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>The peer tutor watches the videos and identifies so-called teachable moments, which are sequences that are interesting from the point of view of communication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>These teachable moments are discussed with the students in a second session together with the peer tutor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>In a third session, four groups of four students (i.e. 16 students) meet an expert who is a clinician and a communication expert. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>The students and the expert discuss unclear or complex or particularly interesting teachable moments. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Over the last few years, different educational activities related to communicative and social competencies were integrated into four consecutive years of the medical programme in Basel. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Thereby, a longitudinal curriculum was implemented that allows cumulative learning. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Course contents build on each other, are related to other competencies and contents of the medical programme, and are assessed continuously with OSCEs [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Special emphasis was placed on a limited number of specific communication techniques which are trained in simulated and real situations time and time again with a growing level of difficulty. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>The selection of the communication techniques is based on two criteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Within the overall objective of patient-centred communication, the techniques aim to give the patient room and a voice in the conversation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>In addition, they aim at helping students gather complete and correct data and share information with the patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>This enables patients to become well-informed partners in the decision-making process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>The second criterion is related to the scientific foundation and validation of communication techniques with empirical studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>For some of the communication techniques, effectiveness has been shown [19], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>For other techniques, no evidence has been provided yet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>It is the explicit aim for the next years to conduct research studies to evaluate the effectiveness of these communication techniques. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>To decide which contents and conversational challenges a longitudinal curriculum should address, it is important to consider what kind of competencies and encounters students can train during their undergraduate medical studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Some communication challenges may occur for the first time during postgraduate training. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Others may only be important for some clinical disciplines so that students might focus on them during their special study modules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>A number of consensus statements and catalogues of learning objectives give details and recommendations to answer this question [10], [32], [33], [34], [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>If we compare the objectives and contents of the Basel SOKO curriculum with the SCLO and the Basel Consensus statement [33] - a position paper of the German Association for Medical Education - it becomes obvious, that some of the recommended objectives are not or rarely trained within the SOKO curriculum: social accountability, communication of errors, team work, leadership, self-management and self-organization, integration into professional contexts (socialization), written communication, and one’s own role and identity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Balint groups are a very suitable method to reflect on one’s identity as a medical doctor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Balint groups have been offered to students in the third Bachelor year and in the first and second Master year on a voluntary basis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>However, students showed little interest and scarcely used the voluntary offer. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>The selection of course content and the amount of hours a longitudinal communication skills curriculum should include are related. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>In Basel, approximately one per cent of the total amount of teaching hours during the undergraduate programme seems to be quite low. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>However, at the moment, there are no recommendations or data on how many teaching hours a communication skills curriculum should include. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>Dedicating time to a specific element of medical education will also always be a political question that has to be negotiated in teaching committees or similar bodies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>New competencies, contents or disciplines will always struggle to receive time in an existing educational programme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Even if they are integrated additively with extra hours, logistical issues (e.g. organising rooms, time scheduling) may well limit the design and delivery of a course. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>The amount of teaching time for a course therefore results from a combination of content-related considerations and the impact of the negotiation skills of the course leader and his or her fellow campaigners. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="219" pm="?"><plain>Who are the significantly involved supporters and fellow campaigners of the SOKO curriculum in Basel? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>The major effort of teaching, assessing, and organising the educational activities is borne by the psychosomatic staff which is part of the department of internal medicine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Other engaged clinicians come from very different clinical disciplines including general practitioners and specialised physicians in their own practice, as well as psychotherapists. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>It remains to be seen, whether this organisational structure is sufficient to sustainably maintain the high quality of the SOKO curriculum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>At the moment, quality is very much dependent on the commitment of individuals, who score OSVE stations, offer Balint groups, and train teachers in their spare time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>The future challenge will be to establish and anchor sustainable structures in the faculty and in the university hospital to provide a longitudinal communication skills curriculum not only by a small group of enthusiasts but by the majority of clinical teachers. </plain></SENT>
