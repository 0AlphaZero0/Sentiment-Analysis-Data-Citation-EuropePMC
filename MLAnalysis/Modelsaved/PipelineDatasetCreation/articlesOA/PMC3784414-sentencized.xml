<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We show that S286 belongs to the sequence O type ST23O78 and harbors 4 large plasmids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The largest one, pS286colV (∼120 kb), not related to resistance, contains genes characteristic of a Conserved Virulence Plasmidic (CVP) region initially identified in B2 extra-intestinal avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC) strains and in the B2 neonatal meningitis E. coli strain S88. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The sequence of this CVP region has a strong homology (98%) with that of the recently sequenced plasmid pChi7122-1 of the O78 APEC strain Chi7122. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A CVP plasmid-cured variant of S286 was less virulent than the wild type strain in a neonatal rat sepsis model with a significant lower level of bacteremia at 24 h (4.1±1.41 versus 2.60±0.16 log CFU/ml, p = 0.001) and mortality. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the mortality in the model of adult mice was comparable between wild type and variant indicating that pS286colV is not sufficient by itself to fully explain the virulence of S286. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Gene expression analysis of pS286colV in iron depleted environment was very close to that of pS88, suggesting that genes of CVP region may be expressed similarly in two very different genetic backgrounds (group C versus group B2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Screening a collection of 178 human A/B1 extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) strains revealed that the CVP region is highly prevalent (23%) and MLST analysis indicated that these CVP positive strains belong to several clusters and mostly to phylogroup C. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Escherichia coli is an inhabitant of the intestines of warm-blooded animals but is also a major cause of extra-intestinal diseases such as urinary tract infection, septicemia and meningitis in human or colibacillosis in poultry [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In pathogenic E. coli, different combinations of acquired virulence genes are characteristic of different pathotypes [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The acquisition of virulence determinants occurs preferentially in defined genetic backgrounds, which may correspond to the different major phylogenetic groups composing the species [2], [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Most human extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) strains belong to phylogenetic groups B2 and D, whereas strains belonging to groups A and B1 may be either commensal or intestinal pathogens and are rarely responsible for extraintestinal infections [3]–[7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>For instance, the prevalence of groups A and B1 is respectively 8% and 2% among neonatal bacteremia and meningitis strains [3] and in a collection of 161 E. coli strains responsible for bacteremia in adults, rates of groups A and B1 were 20% and 7% respectively [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>This contrasts with the prevalence of groups A and B1 among avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC) strains which may reach 38–71% and 1.8–15.5% respectively, according to different studies [9]–[11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>ExPEC strains are characterized by several virulence factors, including adhesins, invasins, protectins and toxins, as well as several uptake systems for essential nutrients such as iron (iron-uptake systems) [12], [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Most A and B1 ExPEC strains harbor fewer virulence factors and show lower experimental virulence than strains belonging to groups B2 and D [6], [10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Extraintestinal virulence genes are frequently clustered in chromosomal genomic regions acquired by horizontal transfer and termed pathogenicity islands, or on large plasmidic regions [14]–[16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>One such plasmidic region has been recently described in detail in several E. coli strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Seven sequenced plasmids, one of human, five of avian and one from environmental origin were shown to harbor a complete or almost complete conserved region named Conserved Virulence Plasmidic (CVP) region notably containing 8 operons or genes [17]–[23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The iro, iuc, and sit loci encode different iron-uptake systems, namely salmochelin, aerobactin and the sit system [24]–[26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Plasmidic OmpT (OmpTp) encodes a putative outer membrane protease (omptin) and cva encodes colicinV, whereas hlyF encodes α-haemolysin, a pore-forming toxin [27], [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The ets operon encodes a type I secretion system and iss is the increased serum survival gene [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In human ExPEC, the prevalence of the CVP region is 10–20% of uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) and 50–60% of neonatal meningitis E. coli (NMEC) and CVP region is found mainly in group B2 [5], [13], [19] while it is largely distributed in the 4 main phylogroups in APEC strains [11], [13], [29], [30]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Although B2/D strains constitute the majority of human ExPEC strains, a few A/B1 strains exhibit unexpected pathogenicity, exemplified by high lethality in a mouse model, similar to that obtained with B2/D strains [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The genetic determinants involved in this unexpected pathogenicity have not been well studied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>We recently described a K1-negative E. coli strain, named S286, responsible for a case of neonatal meningitis and virulent in a mouse model of septicemia [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Triplex PCR phylogrouping [32] suggested that it belonged to phylogenetic group A while MLST analysis showed that it belongs to the phylogroup C, which is a subgroup erroneously classified as A group by PCR triplex although it is closely related to major group B1 [33], [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>S286 was also shown to harbor a TEM-52 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) associated with resistance to nalidixic acid, chloramphenicol and tetracycline and, interestingly, harbored 3 different iron-uptake systems: aerobactin, salmochelin and yersiniabactin which are rarely present together in human A/B1 strains [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>We suspected that the simultaneous presence of aerobactin and salmochelin might be related to the presence of a plasmid containing a CVP region, which may potentially explain the unexpected virulence of this C group strain. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In this study, we showed that S286 belongs to the sequence O-type ST23O78 and harbors a CVP region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>We performed a gene expression analysis of the CVP region and investigated in vivo its role in the virulence of S286. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>To examine the potential diffusion of the CVP region among A/B1 strains, we conducted an epidemiological study of the distribution of this region in A/B1 ExPEC strains and especially in phylogroup C. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge this is only the second CVP region sequenced from a human ExPEC meanwhile similar regions have been sequenced from five APEC strains. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>We have shown previously that the plasmid containing the CVP region plays a key role in the virulence of the meningitis strain S88, yielding a level of bacteremia more than 2 log higher than the cured strain in a neonatal rat sepsis model [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>S286 appears to be less virulent than S88, as an inoculum of 4×105 CFU was necessary to induce a high mortality rate, compared to less than 103 CFU for S88, as previously reported [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>However, we showed that a cured variant induced a lower level of bacteremia and a lower mortality rate than the wild type strain, thus indicating that the plasmid bearing CVP plays an important role in the virulence of S286. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Dozois et al. were the first authors who assessed the virulence of the plasmid pChi7122-1, especially the role of aerobactin and iro locus [52], [53]. </plain></SENT>
