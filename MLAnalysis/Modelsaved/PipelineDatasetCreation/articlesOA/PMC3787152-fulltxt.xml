SMIP004 decreased the levels of positive cell cycle regulators, upregulated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, and resulted in G1 arrest, inhibition of colony formation in soft agar, and cell death. However, the mechanism of SMIP004-induced cancer cell selective apoptosis remained unknown. Here, we used chemical genomic and proteomic profiling to unravel a SMIP004-induced pro-apoptotic pathway, which initiates with disruption of mitochondrial respiration leading to oxidative stress. This, in turn, activates two pathways, one eliciting cell cycle arrest by rapidly targeting cyclin D1 for proteasomal degradation and driving the transcriptional downregulation of the androgen receptor, and a second pathway that activates pro-apoptotic signaling through MAPK activation downstream of the unfolded protein response (UPR). SMIP004 potently inhibits the growth of prostate and breast cancer xenografts in mice. Our data suggest that SMIP004, by inducing mitochondrial ROS formation, targets specific sensitivities of prostate cancer cells to redox and bioenergetic imbalances that can be exploited in cancer therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Prostate cancer</kwd><kwd>cell cycle arrest</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>small molecule inhibitor</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Despite the considerable heterogeneity of clinical tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], malignant transformation confers common characteristics to cancer cells &#8211; hallmarks - which include, among others, replicative immortality, resistance to negative growth signals and apoptosis, and the abilities to induce angiogenesis and to colonize distant organ sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Some of these phenotypic properties are now understood as results of positive selection of defined driver mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. In prostate cancer, for example, such genetic drivers include loss of NKX3.1 and PTEN, amplification of Myc and the androgen receptor (AR), Sox9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], and fusions of <italic>ETS</italic> family transcription factors to androgen-inducible promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Therapeutic targeting of driver mutations to which cancer cells have become &#8216;addicted&#8217; has proven to be highly effective, with the BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib representing a paradigm. However, many other oncogenic and tumor suppressive mutations remain difficult to target pharmacologically. In addition, molecular profiling by next generation sequencing is continuously adding further layers of complexity to the genetic make-up of cancer cells to complicate the development of broadly applicable targeted therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>].</p><p>Despite tumor heterogeneity, the expression of a common set of phenotypic properties, some of which also mark a common set of liabilities, can be exploited in therapy. The concept of &#8220;non-oncogene addiction&#8221; as introduced by Elledge and colleagues recognizes that cancer cells also rely on pathways that are not oncogenic per se but that nonetheless support their survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Often as a direct result of oncogenic signaling, cancer cells are exposed to a series of stress conditions that are not ordinarily experienced by normal cells. This stress phenotype commands an increased reliance on rate-limiting stress support systems such as chaperones, DNA repair mechanisms, and antioxidant functions. Mechanisms of stress sensitization or stress overload that interact with the cancer phenotype in a synthetic lethal manner are consequently considered viable strategies for therapeutic intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. In fact, DNA damaging chemotherapeutics, hyperthermia and proteasome inhibitors already provide proof-of-principle for this approach.</p><p>The stress environment to which cancer cells are exposed typically includes a closely intertwined and mutually reinforcing network of oxidative, genotoxic, and proteotoxic stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. For example, intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through oncogenic signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] or as a result of hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], sensitizes cancer cells to oxidative damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids. The production of ROS during mitochondrial respiration can be limited by the almost universally observed reprogramming of cancer cell metabolism toward aerobic glycolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. The increased reliance of cancer cells on glycolysis represents a requisite example of non-oncogene addiction that permits selective targeting by small molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>].</p><p>In a high-content screen for compounds that upregulate the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) p27<sup>KIP1</sup>, we previously identified <italic>N</italic>-(4-butyl-2-methylphenyl) acetamide (SMIP004) as a novel inducer of cancer cell-selective apoptosis of LNCaP human prostate cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. SMIP004 upregulated the CKIs p27 and p21 while decreasing the levels of positive cell cycle regulators, such as cyclin A, CDK4 and SKP2. The compound also suppressed intracellular CDK2 kinase activity, resulting in G1 arrest and inhibition of colony formation in soft agar. SMIP004 also induced cancer cell-selective apoptosis, but its mechanism of action remained unknown. We show here that SMIP004 has a novel activity in directing a mitochondrial pathway that leads to oxidative stress, activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), and apoptosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>SMIP004 Induces the Unfolded Protein Response</title><p>To assess global effects of SMIP004 at times when apoptosis has been initiated and to cross-reference these effects with those of other cytotoxic compounds, we obtained transcriptomic profiles of LNCaP-S14 cells exposed to SMIP004, to the DNA damaging agent camptothecin, to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BTZ), and to the CDK inhibitor roscovitine for 24 h. Our LNCaP-S14 cell line, which was generated for the high-content screen that identified SMIP004, was derived by stably overexpressing the SKP2 subunit of the CRL1<sup>SKP2</sup> ubiquitin ligase in human LNCaP prostate cancer cells. As a result of SKP2 overexpression, LNCaP-S14 cells exhibited marked downregulation of p27 and a reduced G1 population but behaved identically to parental LNCaP cells in terms of cellular responses to SMIP004 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>].</p><p>The SMIP004 mRNA expression signature was most similar to the signature induced by BTZ with a ~50% overlap in mRNAs changing more than 2-fold (p &#8804; 0.05) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) even though SMIP004 is not a proteasome inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>].

In addition, pathways involved in protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) were strongly induced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).

Activated IRE1 promotes a cascade of phosphorylation events that culminates in the activation of JUN amino-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase the sustained activation of which leads to cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Secondly, CHOP transcriptionally induces various pro-apoptotic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. We found that SMIP004 induced JNK and p38 activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E, F</xref>), whereas chemical inhibitors of these kinases partially antagonized SMIP004-induced apoptosis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E - G</xref>). In addition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of IRE1 and CHOP rescued cell death induced by SMIP004 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref> for knockdown efficiencies). Thus, UPR signaling is the primary trigger of SMIP004-induced cancer cell apoptosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><title>SMIP004 Induces Destruction of Cyclin D1 via the Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway</title><p>Before inducing apoptosis, SMIP004 arrests cell-cycle progression in G1 phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], but the mechanism of this arrest remained unidentified. Several ER stress-induced pathways have been implicated in G1 arrest, including those involving CHOP-dependent transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>], p27 accumulation through suppression of SKP2-mediated ubiquitylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>], and inhibition of cyclin D1 mRNA translation via PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2&#945; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Downregulation of CHOP or p27 did not affect SMIP004-induced G1 arrest thus ruling out these pathways ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] and data not shown). The transcriptomic analysis revealed marked downregulation of the RB tumor suppressor pathway (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) with major players such as cyclin D1, CDK4, and E2F mRNAs strongly suppressed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Consistently, cyclin D1/CDK4-mediated phosphorylation of RB on serine 780 was diminished in a dose-dependent manner beginning at 2 h after compound administration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). This effect was closely paralleled by the rapid (~ 1h) downregulation and nuclear depletion of cyclin D1 protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>), whereas CDK4 levels only declined at later times (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). However, the inhibition of eIF2&#945; phosphorylation by siRNA-mediated knockdown of PERK did not prevent SMIP004-mediated cyclin D1 downregulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), thereby implicating a mechanism that is distinct from those previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>].</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Effect of SMIP004 on cell cycle pathways</title><p>(A) RB subnetwork components downregulated by SMIP004 as revealed by Reactome network analysis (B) Kinetics and dose response of SMIP004 effects on RB pathway components as revealed by immunoblotting.

In addition, consistent with the pervasive role of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>] in cyclin D1 ubiquitylation, the NEDD8 E1 enzyme inhibitor MLN4924, which inactivate CRLs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], substantially reversed SMIP004-mediated downregulation of cyclin D1 levels and RB phosphorylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). Knockdown of individual CRL substrate receptors implicated in cyclin D1 ubiquitylation (SKP2, FBXW8, FBXO31) did not rescue cyclin D1 degradation (data not shown), suggesting that SMIP004 can direct cyclin D1 degradation through multiple redundant pathways.</p><p>In an effort to determine whether the rapid inactivation of the RB pathway is required for SMIP004-induced cell cycle arrest, we sought to overcome the arrest by overexpressing cyclin D1 and CDK4. Overexpression of both cyclin D1 and CDK4 in untreated cells reduced the fraction of cells in G1 and increased the S phase fraction, indicating that their overexpression promoted G1-S progression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). This combination also substantially rescued the inhibition of RB phosphorylation resulting from treatment of cells with SMIP004. Nevertheless, cell cycle arrest was not overcome by cyclin D1 and CDK4 overexpression even though the proteins were restored to levels considerably higher than those found in untreated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). Apparently, in addition to cyclin D1/CDK4 downregulation, SMIP004 inhibits cell cycle progression through other mechanisms. We had previously shown that SMIP004 upregulates the CDK inhibitors p21 and p27, which might restrain the CDK activity required for cell-cycle progression downstream of RB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Indeed, knockdown of p21 and p27 in cells overexpressing cyclin D1 and CDK4 partially prevented SMIP004-induced downregulation of the S phase population, suggesting that SMIP004 robustly impacts cell cycle progression at multiple levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2_3"><title>SMIP004 Induces UPR-independent Transcriptional Downregulation of the AR</title><p>The transcriptomic profile also indicated a suppression of AR signaling by SMIP004 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) with several major AR target genes being strongly downregulated (e.g. KLK2, KLK3/PSA, HOXB13, NKX3-1; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>).

In contrast, SMIP004-induced AR downregulation was not abrogated by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 either in LNCaP-S14 or parental LNCaP cells or in another AR positive prostate cancer cell line, 22RV1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). Instead, RT-PCR analysis indicated that SMIP004 downregulated AR mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>). Since AR mRNA stability was only modestly affected by SMIP004 (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 9.76 h; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>) versus DMSO (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 13.3 h), we performed reporter gene assays to determine the impact of SMIP004 on AR promoter activity. AR promoter activity was repressed by SMIP004 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4H</xref>). AR agonist-induced activity was likewise suppressed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4H</xref>). In summary, these data suggest that SMIP004 abrogates AR signaling primarily through UPR-independent transcriptional downregulation of AR expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2_4"><title>SMIP004 Induces Mitochondrial Disruption and Oxidative Stress</title><p>To gain insight into proximal mechanisms determining the pleiotropic cellular activities of SMIP004, we performed a SILAC experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>] to obtain a quantitative proteomic profile of the response of prostate cancer cells to short-term exposure to SMIP004 (3h).

For these studies, we used the more potent analog SMIP004-7 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). The analog evoked identical cellular pathways as the parental compound but had a twofold lower IC<sub>50</sub> (620 nM, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). We first determined the maximally tolerated dose of SMIP004-7 (~200 mg/kg intraperitonially, i.p.; data not shown). SCID mice bearing LNCaP-S14 tumors were dosed with 50 mg/kg i.p. daily. SMIP004-7 potently suppressed tumor growth as judged by average tumor volumes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>).

SMIP004-7 completely inhibited tumor growth in three of six animals (#1, 2 and 3) and greatly retarded tumor growth in the remaining three mice, while vehicle control mice showed an increase in tumor volume of at least 250 mm<sup>3</sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>).

During the suspension period, the residual tumors resumed growth indicating that the cells originally received by these animals were competent of forming tumors. When tumors reached ~500 mm<sup>3</sup>, the pretreated animals were subjected to a second round of treatment with an increased dose of SMIP007-4 (100 mg/kg daily) for 10 days. As in the first treatment period, SMIP004-7 receiving animals showed a strong inhibition in tumor growth whereas tumors grew to large sizes in vehicle treated mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5B</xref>). These results were confirmed by final average tumor weights and by individual changes in tumor volumes, whereas no significant weight loss was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5C &#8211; E</xref>). These data firmly suggest that pretreated animals bore growth competent tumors and that the observed tumor inhibition is thus due to the pharmacological activity of SMIP004-7.</p><p>To further validate the anti-tumor activity of SMIP004-7, we performed further xenograft studies using an additional AR-positive human prostate cancer cell line, LAPC4. SMIP004-7 elicited the same effects on LAPC4 as on LNCaP-S14 cells in terms of growth inhibition, downregulation of RB phosphorylation and AR expression, and UPR activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5F</xref>), but was ~5 times more potent than the parent compound SMIP004 in inducing cell death (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.68 vs. 3.53 &#956;M, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5G</xref>).

Treatment with SMIP004-7 for three weeks inhibited tumor growth ~5-fold without any changes in body weight (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5I</xref>), suggesting that SMIP004-7 may have broader anti-cancer activity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec id="s3_1"><title>Mechanisms of SMIP004-Directed Cell Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis</title><p>Our combined chemical genomic and proteomic profiling followed by functional validation of predicted pathways revealed a first model for the mechanism of action of SMIP004 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>). According to this scheme, SMIP004 induces oxidative stress, which then triggers independent pathways that drive cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.</p><p>Proteolytic downregulation of cyclin D1 likely initiates the cell cycle arrest because it commences within ~2 hours after SMIP004 addition. Proteolysis involves the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and members of the CRL family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, although the exact identity of the E3(s) remains to be established. Regardless, the SMIP004-induced proteolytic mechanism is very potent as it clears a large portion of cyclin D1, even when it is strongly overexpressed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). The compound might therefore be particularly effective against the abundant class of malignancies driven by high levels of cyclin D1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. Suppression of cyclin D1/CDK4 activity would result in reduced RB phosphorylation and E2F transcription factor activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. As a result, E2F target genes such as SKP2 will be suppressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>], a prediction we have confirmed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. The downregulation of SKP2 would then stabilize p21 and p27 to reinforce the G1 cell cycle arrest.</p><p>Like cyclin D1, AR is downregulated by SMIP004, albeit with slower kinetics and through a distinct mechanism involving transcriptional repression. E2F1 is a direct activator of the AR promoter, and loss of RB is associated with increased AR levels and progression of prostate cancers to castration resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. The suppressive effects of SMIP004 on the cyclin D1/RB/E2F pathway may therefore underlie transcriptional AR downregulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>). Irrespective of the exact mechanism, SMIP004-induced AR downregulation is significant for advanced prostate cancer, which typically maintains dependence on the AR protein even after progression to castration resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Whereas AR downregulation may augment SMIP004-induced cell death, we do not regard it as a primary trigger because of its delayed onset (12 &#8211; 24 h).</p><p>Rather, based on kinetics, siRNA, and chemical inhibitor studies, UPR signaling resulting in MAPK activation was identified as the primary pathway executing SMIP004-induced cancer cell apoptosis. UPR signaling is principally geared towards cell survival but induces apoptosis upon severe insult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Many human cancers display a chronically induced UPR, potentially as adaptation to microenvironmental stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. However, with regards to the well recognized &#8220;stress phenotype&#8221; of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], such a survival strategy can turn maladaptive when confronted with therapeutic regimens that exhaust the stress support network. We propose that SMIP004 is such a regimen, and that the cancer cell selectivity of the compound derives from the differential sensitivity to proapoptotic UPR signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s3_2"><title>Mitochondrial Oxidative Stress as a Proximal Element of the Mechanism of Action of SMIP004</title><p>Several lines of evidence indicate that SMIP004 directly induced a pathway leading to oxidative stress: (i.) The compound increased mitochondrial ROS within 15 minutes. (ii.) All cellular effects of SMIP004 were rescued by two different antioxidants. (iii.) SMIP004 caused a rapid decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio. (iv.) The compound led to induction of the NRF2 transcriptional pathway, in particular the mRNA for HMOX1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G</xref>).</p><p>Notably, a relatively small increase in mitochondrial ROS (~40%) led to a dramatic decrease in cell viability. This finding highlights the low tolerance of cancer cells for extraneous stressors, presumably because their endogenous stress defense mechanisms are already stretched to the limits. Consistently, we noticed that LNCaP-S14 cells display very high basal levels of ROS relative to primary human fibroblasts (data not shown). Presumably as an adaptive measure, NRF2 is already localized in the nucleus and thus activated in untreated LNCaP-S14 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3E</xref>). While SMIP004 caused an additional activation of the NRF2 transcriptional program geared toward stress defense (GCLM, X<sup>&#8722;</sup><sub>C</sub> system, NQO, TRXR1, HMOX1, Supplementary Data File 2), compound exposed cells could no longer capitalize on the pro-survival function of this program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. This may be due to paradoxical SMIP004-mediated downregulation of prominent NRF2 target genes involved in glutathione utilization and regeneration (GLRX, GSR, GPX1, 2, 4, most glutathione-S-transferases, Supplementary Data File 2). Whereas it remains unclear how SMIP004 promotes the selective activation of NRF2 target genes, this imbalance may contribute to the observed decrease in the GSH-GSSG ratio and the lethal consequences of oxidative stress.</p><p>The mechanism of ROS-induced apoptosis are not well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>] but UPR induction is a known consequence of oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. ROS can cause protein misfolding in the ER through oxidation of amino acids or by perturbing calcium-dependent ER chaperone activity. Conversely, ER stress can trigger oxidative stress through CHOP-mediated induction of ERO1-like enzymes, which release H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> during protein disulfide isomerase-catalyzed formation of disulfide bonds. ERO1-LB mRNA was upregulated ~3.5-fold by SMIP004. Since the ER is a highly oxidizing environment, it is particularly susceptible to oxidative stress and the vicious cycle resulting from it. Cancer cells originating from secretory tissues with high traffic through the ER, such as prostate epithelial cells, are expected to be preferentially sensitive to such conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3_3"><title>Potential Utility of Disruptors of Mitochondrial Redox Balance for Cancer Therapy</title><p>Insights gained over the past 15 years have put the concept of pharmacological targeting of the increased oxidative stress sensitivity of cancer cells on a firm foundation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. Several high profile compounds, including erastin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>], piperlongumine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>], and elesclomol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>] have emerged, which cause ROS-dependent cell death selectively in cancer cells. While mechanisms and targets vary, some of these compounds are already being tested in the clinic.</p><p>The molecular target(s) of SMIP004 remain to be identified. Based on the instant kinetics with which the compound inhibits mitochondrial ATP production and stimulates mitochondrial ROS (5 &#8211; 30 minutes), it is tempting to speculate that SMIP004 directly interferes with the ETC. SMIP004 may therefore have a similar mechanism of action as the chelating agent elesclomol. This compound does not appear to have a protein target per se but rather to interfere more broadly with the mitochondrial electron transport process through copper-dependent redox cycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>]. The coordinated upregulation of ETC components observed in our proteomic profile (3 h) may therefore reflect a compensatory but ultimately futile effort of SMIP004 exposed cells to uphold electron transport. Interestingly, a yeast screen for elesclomol sensitive heterozygous diploids identified a network of mitochondrial and protein anabolic processes that largely overlapped with that we obtained through proteomic profiling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>].</p><p>In the era of &#8220;targeted therapy&#8221; and &#8220;personalized health care&#8221;, there remain questions as to the viability of pleiotropic stress response pathways as cancer drug targets. The following points may be considered: (i.) Many clinically efficacious cancer drugs, including bortezomib, cisplatin, and etoposide, rely on ROS formation for efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. (ii.) Just like redox disruptors, a surprising number of &#8220;targeted&#8221; drugs in advanced stages of clinical testing, including proteasome, MAPK, and mTOR inhibitors, target molecules that are essential to the survival of normal cells and thus not per se cancer cell selective. Here, cancer selectivity appears to come from the phenomenon of non-oncogene addiction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. (iii.) Redox active therapeutics are not necessarily incompatible with the emerging concept of personalized medicine. To the contrary, they stand to benefit from the development of biomarkers just as much as any other form of therapy. In the future, detailed redox pheno- and genotyping could guide the selection of specific drugs such as SMIP004 that efficiently target the redox vulnerability of individual cancers.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Chemical Compounds</title><p>SMIP004 was purchased from Ryan Scientific and verified by HPLC-MS.

Briefly, labeled cRNA was generated from total RNA utilizing an RNA amplification kit developed for Illumina (Ambion). First-strand cDNA was synthesized after priming with a T7 promoter-oligo(dT) primer, followed by second strand cDNA synthesis in the presence of biotin-16-UTP. The amplified, biotinylated cRNA was labeled by incubation with streptavidin-Cy3. Hybridization was conducted on the HumanRef-8 v2 Expression BeadChip (Illumina cassettes), which contain ~23,000 human transcript probes and controls. Standard hybridization and wash protocols were used as recommended by the manufacturer. Following high-resolution scanning of the array slides, the BeadStation software was used to deconvolute and present the data in a MIAME compatible tabular form.

Briefly, proteins were reduced by TCEP, alkylated using iodoacetamide, and digested by trypsin overnight at 37&#176;C. The peptides were then desalted using Sep-Pak (Millipore), and separated by strong cation chromatography (SCX) using an automated Paradigm HPLC instrument (Michrom Bioresources). The SCX gradient proceeded from 5% &#8211; 40% buffer D (25% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid/ 500 mM KCl), and 24 SCX fractions were collected. Each SCX fraction was analyzed by reversed-phase LC-MS/MS on a Magic C18 column and a LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). The peptides in each SCX fraction were separated on a 60-120 min gradient of 8%-30% buffer B (100% acetonitrile/ 0.1% formic acid). Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra were collected during the LC/MS runs. Each scan was set to acquire a full MS scan, followed by MS/MS scans on the top four precursor ions from the preceding MS scan. The LC-MS/MS analysis of the 24 fractions was repeated 3 times for each biological sample.</p><p>Both the protein identification and the SILAC quantification were performed by Integrated Proteomics Pipeline (IP2, Integrated Proteomics Application Inc) which includes SEQUEST, ProLuCID, DTASelect, and Census (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). First, MS1 and MS2 files were extracted by RawExtract (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) from the raw MS/MS spectra obtained on the LTQ-Orbitrap XL. Then an IPI human database was uploaded into IP2, which automatically generated a reverse protein database. The MS1 and MS2 files of each technical replicates were combined and searched using ProLuCID and the semi-tryptic decoy database. Modifications included 16 Da on methionine for oxidation, 6 Da on lysine and 10 Da on arginine for heavy SILAC labels. The identification results from ProLuCID were filtered and organized by DTASelect. The DTASelect parameters were set so that the false positive rates on the protein level were below 1.2%. The false positive rates on the peptide level were &lt; 0.2%. Finally, protein ratios (light/heavy) and the standard deviation were calculated by Census. As expected, the vast majority of proteins showed a ratio very close to 1.0 in the SMIP004-treated versus DMSO-treated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>) thus documenting the accuracy of the protein quantification.</p><p>Network analysis was performed with the Cytoscape Reactome FI plugin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>].
