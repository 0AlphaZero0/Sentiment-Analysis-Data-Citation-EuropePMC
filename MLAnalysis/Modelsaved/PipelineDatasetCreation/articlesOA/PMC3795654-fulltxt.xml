Their eponymous motif comprises a rigid structured core formed by six disulfide-connected cysteine residues, which accounts for its exceptional stability towards thermic or proteolytic degradation. Since they display a remarkable sequence tolerance within their disulfide-connected loops, these molecules are considered promising frameworks for peptide-based pharmaceuticals. Natural open-chain cystine-knot trypsin inhibitors of the MCoTI (<italic>Momordica cochinchinensis</italic> trypsin inhibitor) and SOTI (<italic>Spinacia oleracea</italic> trypsin inhibitor) families served as starting points for the generation of inhibitors of matriptase-1, a type II transmembrane serine protease with possible clinical relevance in cancer and arthritic therapy. Yeast surface-displayed libraries of miniproteins were used to select unique and potent matriptase-1 inhibitors. To this end, a knowledge-based library design was applied that makes use of detailed information on binding and folding behavior of cystine-knot peptides. Five inhibitor variants, four of the MCoTI family and one of the SOTI family, were identified, chemically synthesized and oxidatively folded towards the bioactive conformation. Enzyme assays revealed inhibition constants in the low nanomolar range for all candidates. One subnanomolar binder (K<sub>i</sub>&#8202;=&#8202;0.83 nM) with an inverted selectivity towards trypsin and matriptase-1 was identified.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dfg.de/en/index.jsp">http://www.dfg.de/en/index.jsp</ext-link>) through grants KO-1390/9-1 and SPP 1623 grant 1390/10-1.

Pro-uPA is activated through non-inhibited matriptase-1 and substrate turnover was measured and compared to the previously reported small molecule inhibitor S1 of matriptase-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076956-g004">Figure 4</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0076956-Steinmetzer1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>.

We chose a knowledge-based strategy that takes into account the expected contribution to target binding, as well as the natural variability and the contribution to structure and folding of each residue at each position. While we followed a classical variegation scheme for SOTI-III with a full randomization that is restricted to the carboxy terminal loop, a position-specific randomization scheme was applied for oMCoTI-II.</p><p>Screening of the SOTI-III library resulted in the isolation of a variant that displayed 29 nM K<sub>i</sub> with respect to matriptase-1 inhibition and contained the sequence motif RRAR in the inhibitor loop. This agrees with the consensus sequence for matriptase-1 substrates and the highly potent inhibitor peptide <italic>H</italic>-R-Q-A-R-<italic>Bt</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0076956-Uhland1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076956-Avrutina3" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076956-Colombo1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076956-Yamasaki1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Despite the fact that the absolute position of the P<sub>1</sub> arginine residue within the inhibitor loop remained unchanged, increased inhibitory activity towards matriptase-1 interestingly led to the total loss of trypsin inhibition. Hence, in comparison to the <italic>wild type</italic> miniprotein, the isolated SOTI-based matriptase-1 inhibitor (Var. 1) showed improved inhibitory activity and selectivity. Notably, the recently reported crystal structure of SOTI-III <italic>wild type</italic> revealed that out of the 10 carboxy terminal loop residues only 8 were in direct contact to trypsin <xref rid="pone.0076956-Glotzbach1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Thus, exclusion of core-forming residues from the randomization scheme of SOTI-based inhibitor Var. 1 and generating a sub-library for the flanking residues might result in variants with further improved binding characteristics. Moreover, experiments on co-crystallization of matriptase-1 and SOTI Var. 1 are required to understand the mode of interaction of protease and inhibitor. Additionally, it would be beneficial to gain further knowledge on whether the conformational constraints that are imposed on the SOTI-III <italic>wild type</italic> inhibitor loop <italic>via</italic> integration into the cystine-knot scaffold are also conserved in the matriptase-1 inhibitor Var. 1. Assuming an unchanged mode of action, the knottin-based peptide acts as a matriptase-1 inhibitor rather than as a substrate that is readily and irreversibly cleaved.</p><p>Screening of the oMCoTI-scaffold-derived library resulted in several inhibitors that all displayed K<sub>i</sub> values in low nanomolar to sub-nanomolar range. Despite the fact that the library diversity was 10-fold lower than for the SOTI scaffold and with 2&#215;10<sup>7</sup> clones relatively small, more potent binders were isolated corroborating the concept of knowledge-based library design. It should also be noted that oMCoTI-II <italic>wt</italic> in contrast to SOTI-III <italic>wt</italic> already displayed inhibitory activity against matriptase-1 and therefore may be the more suitable scaffold for optimization towards matriptase-1-binding and inhibition. Branched aliphatic residues were observed at the P<sub>1&#8217;</sub> position of isolated matriptase-1-binding oMCoTI library variants, while leucine was the preferred P<sub>2&#8217;</sub>-positioned amino acid. In contrast to reported substrates and inhibitors, lysine was obviously favored over an arginine residue at the P<sub>1</sub> position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076956-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0076956-Uhland1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076956-Colombo1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. While amino acid residue 1 displayed a large variability, replacements of the &#8216;GV-motif&#8217; at positions 2 and 3 rarely occurred, demonstrating the importance of these residues for binding and/or folding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076956-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Whereas no substitutions within loop 2 (flanked by CysII and CysIII) were observed, Arg24 was exchanged for leucine in the most potent inhibitor Var. 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076956-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). It remains to be elucidated, whether this residue replacement contributes to enhanced inhibition.</p><p>To investigate the inhibition of pro-uPA activation cell culture upon matriptase-1 inhibition, miniproteins SOTI Var. 1 and MCoTI Var. 4 as well as reference compound S1 were applied to human pancreatic PC-3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076956-g004">Figure 4</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0076956-Uhland1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076956-Suzuki1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. MCoTI-based knottin Var. 4 that had a subnanomolar K<sub>i</sub> towards matriptase-1 also displayed the lowest IC<sub>50</sub> with respect to the inhibition of proteolytic activity in a PC-3 cell line <xref rid="pone.0076956-Chen3" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0076956-Uhland2" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. This indicates that inhibitor-mediated reduction of matriptase-1 activity contributes to the decrease of uPA activity. IC<sub>50</sub> values ranged from a nanomolar to micromolar range and MCoTI-based inhibitor Var. 4 was found to be 10-fold more potent than recently described peptidomimetic small-molecule inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076956-g004">Figure 4</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0076956-Steinmetzer1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>.</p><p>All three inhibitors investigated displayed IC<sub>50</sub> values of protease inhibition on PC-3 cells more than 100-fold higher compared to their K<sub>i</sub> of matriptase-1 inhibition. This discrepancy may arise from the complicated situation in cell culture since matriptase-1 activity is regulated by the cognate natural tight-binding inhibitor HAI-1. Co-expression of HAI-1 and matriptase-1 suppresses matriptase-1 proteolytic activity. Interestingly, HAI-1 has also been considered to be required for activation of matriptase-1 and to be involved in its expression and autoprocessing <xref rid="pone.0076956-Oberst1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076956-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076956-List1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076956-Yamasaki1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076956-Domoto1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>. Moreover, absence of HAI-1 seems to cause rapid turnover of active matriptase-1 <xref rid="pone.0076956-Yamasaki1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076956-Domoto1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>. Hence, the complicated conditions in the cell-culture media, in the cell and on its surface may account for the observed differences of K<sub>i</sub> and IC<sub>50</sub>.</p><p>In recent years, matriptase-1 has attracted keen scientific interest as a target for the development of inhibitors. Steinmetzer and coworkers reported small molecule inhibitors that display similar potency and selectivity <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as in cell-based assays as the miniproteins generated in this study <xref rid="pone.0076956-Steinmetzer1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076956-Uhland2" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. In addition, two types of peptidic matriptase-1 inhibitors have been identified to date <xref rid="pone.0076956-Avrutina3" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076956-Colombo1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. The short substrate-derived inhibitor <italic>H</italic>-R-Q-A-R<italic>-Bt</italic> displays an inhibition constant in the double-digit picomolar range. Due to the small size and susceptibility to proteolytic degradation, <italic>in vivo</italic> half-life can be expected to be short. Moreover, the universal sequence is not selective for matriptase-1, but inhibits various proteases in the pico- to nanomolar range <xref rid="pone.0076956-Colombo1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Compared to the tetrapeptide, the sunflower trypsin inhibitor (SFTI)-based matriptase-1 inhibitor that has been described recently has an increased size (14 residues) combined with a constrained structure, thus being potentially more stable and applicable for <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments <xref rid="pone.0076956-Avrutina3" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Recently, Daly and coworkers obtained by rational design and positional scanning mutagenesis a cyclic MCoTI-II variant with subnanomolar inhibition constant of matriptase-1 that was found to be more potent than SFTI derived variants, corroborating the notion that the McoTI-II miniprotein scaffold provides an excellent structural environment for the development of potent and selective matriptase inhibitors <xref rid="pone.0076956-Quimbar1" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. Serum stability and potential oral availability has been shown for several knottins and it will be interesting to see whether the MCoTI-derived inhibitors display similar stability in cell culture and serum while maintaining activity and selectivity.</p><p>Knottins have been introduced by Cochran and coworkers as a new class of agents for imaging of tumor marker expression in living systems <xref rid="pone.0076956-Kimura1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076956-Jiang2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076956-Jiang3" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>. For example, <sup>64</sup>Cu-DOTA-conjugated knottin peptides were stable in mouse serum, and <italic>in vivo</italic> metabolite analysis showed minimal degradation in blood or tumor rendering this type of stable peptides very promising candidates as clinical diagnostics for a variety of cancers <xref rid="pone.0076956-Jiang3" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>. The spectrum of tumor targeting knottins, which is currently restricted to cystine-knot peptides containing integrin binding RGD sequences in their binding loops, can be extended by matriptase-1 binders for imaging applications. The miniproteins described in this study selectively detect cell-surface-exposed and enzymatically active matriptase-1 on tumor cells that is not complexed with the natural inhibitor HAI-1. In contrast, with one notable exception most antibodies cannot distinguish between the active and inactive form of matriptase-1, due to their binding to accessible epitopes that are not linked to the active site or conformational changes upon activation. Recently, Craik and coworkers showed that an active-site-specific, recombinant human antibody for matriptase-1 can be used to visualize the tumorigenic epithelium using near-infrared and single-photon emission computed tomography imaging, corroborating the notion that the active form of matriptase-1 is a tumorigenic biomarker <xref rid="pone.0076956-LeBeau1" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>. Since matriptase-1 provides the major contribution to tumor invasion and progression, knottins selectively addressing the active site of matriptase-1 may become valuable tools for tumor imaging, particularly for the prediction of tumor invasiveness.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>To conclude, we have proven the applicability of a knowledge-based miniprotein library design to the development of potent inhibitors of human matriptase-1 using a codon-based, weighted, and selective randomization scheme. A set of cystine-knot miniprotein variants was generated that included a relatively large number of residues that may contribute to binding while the average number and position-specific frequency of amino acid replacements was carefully controlled. As a consequence, screening of a relatively small library revealed (sub&#8722;) nanomolar inhibitors. Bioactivity was confirmed in cell culture through a dose-response inhibition assay on the surface of human cancer cells. Taking into consideration the high affinity and selectivity combined with the high general thermodynamic stability of miniproteins, the variants described here may become promising tools for applications in cancer diagnostics. <italic>In vivo</italic> experiments towards tumor targeting with labeled synthetic miniproteins are currently in progress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0076956.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
