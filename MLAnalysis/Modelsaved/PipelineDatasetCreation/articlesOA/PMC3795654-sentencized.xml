</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Cystine-knot peptides, often referred to as knottins, can be considered as one of Nature’s combinatorial libraries [1]–[4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>These peptides have been identified in various organisms, among them fungi, plantae, porifera, mollusca, arthropoda, and vertebrata. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>While they share a common fold, they display a notably large diversity within the primary structure of flanking loops that is also correlated with a diversity of biological activities [2]–[5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Their amide backbone of about 30 to 40 amino acid residues is compacted by three disulfide bonds which form the characteristic mechanically interlocked structure [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Three β-strands linked through three disulfide bonds define their structural core, where the ring-forming connection of CysI to CysIV and CysII to CysV is penetrated by a third cystine between CysIII and CysVI (Figure 1) [1]–[4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>NMR measurements of dynamics of backbone NH groups revealed high structural rigidity [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Considering the extensive network of hydrogen bonds which permeates the inner core, especially via the β-strands, thus adding a substantial thermodynamic stability, the cystine-knot motif displays an exceptional structural and thermal robustness [8]–[10]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Both share the typical architecture of an ICK peptide with the functional loop comprising six amino acids located between CysI and CysII (Figure 1) [3], [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In contrast, recently reported miniproteins isolated from spinach Spinacia oleracea (SOTI I–III, Figure 1B) have shown no similarity to known plant protease inhibitors, but to antimicrobial peptides from the seeds of Mirabilis jalapa with the inhibitory loop located between CysV and CysVI (Figure 1) [12], [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Structural information is available for the members of both inhibitor families [13]–[17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Sequence and structure alignments of members of a respective miniprotein family reveal a conserved structural core, while the surface-exposed loops possess a high flexibility in terms of primary structure [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Thus, through substitution of surface-exposed residues bioactive variants can be generated that can serve as tailor-made compounds for potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications [10], [18]–[20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Several knottins have already been optimized by rational design or combinatorial library screening towards binding to targets of medical relevance [18], [21]–[32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>For example, a MCoTI-II-derived miniprotein comprising a non-native hydrazone macrocyclization motif was reported to simultaneously inhibit all four monomers of human mast cell tryptase β, a protease of clinical relevance related to allergic asthma [27], [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Several rounds of directed evolution and rational design of the scorpion-derived miniprotein Leiurotoxin I from Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus resulted in its enhanced binding to gp120 of the viral particle of HIV, thus inhibiting cell entry [25], [26], [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cancer-related integrins have been successfully labeled in vivo with radioactive 64Cu and 111In via selective targeting with knottins containing an integrin-binding RGD motif and used for PET (positron emission tomography) and SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography) imaging [21]–[24]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Knottins are readily accessible both by recombinant production and SPPS (solid-phase peptide synthesis) [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Indeed, obvious difficulties arising upon on-support chain assembly can be easily overcome using the wide-ranging repertoire of modern peptide synthesis, and the crucial step, regioselective formation of a tridisulfide pattern, can be efficiently controlled using optimized oxidation conditions [3], [34]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Matriptase-1, a TTSP (type II transmembrane serine protease) of about 855 amino acids, belongs to the family of S1 trypsin-like proteases [35], [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>It combines an amino terminal hydrophobic transmembrane region with an extracellular section of several domains, among them a trypsin-like catalytic and a low-density lipoprotein region [35]–[37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Autocatalytic activation of the zymogen is assisted by its cognate inhibitor HAI-1 (hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-1) and does not depend on other proteases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>To date, the mechanism of autocatalytic activation has not been fully understood [35], [37]–[39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, matriptase-1 is also activated via acidification of the enzyme, therefore indicating its role in cellular acidosis [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Studies on knock-out mice have shown that matriptase-1 is essential for epidermal barrier functions, hence postnatal survival, as well as growth of hair follicles, and thymic homeostasis [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Moreover, matriptase-1 has been reported to be expressed not only in epithelial cells, but also in mast cells, B-cells, and blood monocytes [42]–[44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Among its numerous substrates of which most are important for cell adhesion and tissue remodeling, processing of pro-uPA (pro-urokinase plasminogen activator) and pro-HGF (pro-hepatocyte growth factor) have been shown to be significantly involved in tumor growth and metastasis [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Expression rates of matriptase-1 were reported to reflect the degree of tumor progression in several types of cancerous cells, thus indicating a crucial role of this protease in tumor metastasis [46]–[48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>This was evidenced through various experiments, both in vitro and in vivo, in which the enzyme was inhibited [35], [49]–[51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The ratio of matriptase-1 and HAI-1, which is shifted towards matriptase-1 in cancer cells, is of major importance for tumor invasiveness [45], [52], [53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Moreover, matriptase-1 has been reported to be implicated in a number of other diseases, among them osteoarthritis and atherosclerosis, and to induce cancer itself [42], [54], [55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, matriptase-1 has become a promising target for drug development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>To date, only one peptide-based inhibitor of matriptase-1 with a picomolar Ki has been reported [56], [57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Despite its excellent inhibition constants against matriptase-1, this four-amino-acid peptide with the sequence H-R-Q-A-R-Bt (Bt stands for carboxy terminal benzothiazole substituent) displays a low selectivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Since for in vivo experiments a high selectivity and serum half-life are indispensable, this inhibitor presumably is not suitable for experiments towards tumor targeting in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Here we describe the isolation of selective cystine-knot peptides of high affinity from knowledge-based combinatorial miniprotein libraries and their functional characterization in vitro and in cell culture. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>A codon-based randomization of the oMCoTI-II scaffold was used for library generation (Figure 3A and 3B), which included the inhibitor loop and neighboring residues that may contribute to target binding [61]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>It is well known that a proline is required at position P2 (amino-terminal to P1, Figure 1) of the inhibitor loop [2], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Thus, Pro5 was not modified since it is essential for the formation of the six-residue canonical inhibitor loop conformation that is found in many protease inhibitors [1], [2], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Codon 6 was randomized to code for Arg or Lys (50% each), and positions 7–10 were randomized to code for the full set of 19 canonical amino acids, excluding cysteine, using a codon-based randomization scheme (Figure 3A) [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>In addition, neighboring residues were also included into the variegation scheme to enable improved subsite binding that may contribute to both enhanced affinity and specificity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Since these residues outside the inhibitor loop may be of relevance for oMCoTI-II folding and stability, simultaneous full randomization was avoided by maintaining the original residue at each position for 50% of the variants. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Assuming an unchanged mode of action, the knottin-based peptide acts as a matriptase-1 inhibitor rather than as a substrate that is readily and irreversibly cleaved. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Screening of the oMCoTI-scaffold-derived library resulted in several inhibitors that all displayed Ki values in low nanomolar to sub-nanomolar range. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that the library diversity was 10-fold lower than for the SOTI scaffold and with 2×107 clones relatively small, more potent binders were isolated corroborating the concept of knowledge-based library design. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>It should also be noted that oMCoTI-II wt in contrast to SOTI-III wt already displayed inhibitory activity against matriptase-1 and therefore may be the more suitable scaffold for optimization towards matriptase-1-binding and inhibition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Branched aliphatic residues were observed at the P1’ position of isolated matriptase-1-binding oMCoTI library variants, while leucine was the preferred P2’-positioned amino acid. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>While amino acid residue 1 displayed a large variability, replacements of the ‘GV-motif’ at positions 2 and 3 rarely occurred, demonstrating the importance of these residues for binding and/or folding (Figure 3D). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>This indicates that inhibitor-mediated reduction of matriptase-1 activity contributes to the decrease of uPA activity. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>This discrepancy may arise from the complicated situation in cell culture since matriptase-1 activity is regulated by the cognate natural tight-binding inhibitor HAI-1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Co-expression of HAI-1 and matriptase-1 suppresses matriptase-1 proteolytic activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, HAI-1 has also been considered to be required for activation of matriptase-1 and to be involved in its expression and autoprocessing [38], [39], [41], [57], [77]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>Moreover, absence of HAI-1 seems to cause rapid turnover of active matriptase-1 [57], [77]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>Hence, the complicated conditions in the cell-culture media, in the cell and on its surface may account for the observed differences of Ki and IC50. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>In recent years, matriptase-1 has attracted keen scientific interest as a target for the development of inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>Steinmetzer and coworkers reported small molecule inhibitors that display similar potency and selectivity in vitro as well as in cell-based assays as the miniproteins generated in this study [51], [76]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>In addition, two types of peptidic matriptase-1 inhibitors have been identified to date [49], [56]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>The short substrate-derived inhibitor H-R-Q-A-R-Bt displays an inhibition constant in the double-digit picomolar range. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Due to the small size and susceptibility to proteolytic degradation, in vivo half-life can be expected to be short. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the universal sequence is not selective for matriptase-1, but inhibits various proteases in the pico- to nanomolar range [56]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>Compared to the tetrapeptide, the sunflower trypsin inhibitor (SFTI)-based matriptase-1 inhibitor that has been described recently has an increased size (14 residues) combined with a constrained structure, thus being potentially more stable and applicable for in vivo experiments [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>Recently, Daly and coworkers obtained by rational design and positional scanning mutagenesis a cyclic MCoTI-II variant with subnanomolar inhibition constant of matriptase-1 that was found to be more potent than SFTI derived variants, corroborating the notion that the McoTI-II miniprotein scaffold provides an excellent structural environment for the development of potent and selective matriptase inhibitors [78]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>Serum stability and potential oral availability has been shown for several knottins and it will be interesting to see whether the MCoTI-derived inhibitors display similar stability in cell culture and serum while maintaining activity and selectivity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>Knottins have been introduced by Cochran and coworkers as a new class of agents for imaging of tumor marker expression in living systems [18], [24], [79]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>For example, 64Cu-DOTA-conjugated knottin peptides were stable in mouse serum, and in vivo metabolite analysis showed minimal degradation in blood or tumor rendering this type of stable peptides very promising candidates as clinical diagnostics for a variety of cancers [79]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>The spectrum of tumor targeting knottins, which is currently restricted to cystine-knot peptides containing integrin binding RGD sequences in their binding loops, can be extended by matriptase-1 binders for imaging applications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>The miniproteins described in this study selectively detect cell-surface-exposed and enzymatically active matriptase-1 on tumor cells that is not complexed with the natural inhibitor HAI-1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>In contrast, with one notable exception most antibodies cannot distinguish between the active and inactive form of matriptase-1, due to their binding to accessible epitopes that are not linked to the active site or conformational changes upon activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>Recently, Craik and coworkers showed that an active-site-specific, recombinant human antibody for matriptase-1 can be used to visualize the tumorigenic epithelium using near-infrared and single-photon emission computed tomography imaging, corroborating the notion that the active form of matriptase-1 is a tumorigenic biomarker [81]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>Since matriptase-1 provides the major contribution to tumor invasion and progression, knottins selectively addressing the active site of matriptase-1 may become valuable tools for tumor imaging, particularly for the prediction of tumor invasiveness. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>To conclude, we have proven the applicability of a knowledge-based miniprotein library design to the development of potent inhibitors of human matriptase-1 using a codon-based, weighted, and selective randomization scheme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>A set of cystine-knot miniprotein variants was generated that included a relatively large number of residues that may contribute to binding while the average number and position-specific frequency of amino acid replacements was carefully controlled. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, screening of a relatively small library revealed (sub−) nanomolar inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>Bioactivity was confirmed in cell culture through a dose-response inhibition assay on the surface of human cancer cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>Taking into consideration the high affinity and selectivity combined with the high general thermodynamic stability of miniproteins, the variants described here may become promising tools for applications in cancer diagnostics. In vivo experiments towards tumor targeting with labeled synthetic miniproteins are currently in progress. </plain></SENT>
