</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Schizophrenia (SZ) and Bipolar disorder (BD) are considered as severe multifactorial diseases, stemming from genetic and environmental influences (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>SZ and BD are characterized by abnormalities of thought, behavior, cognition, and mood with overlap and similarities in the presentation and clinical course in many cases (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic instability in both disorders, frequency of schizoaffective cases, familial co-aggregation, and efficacy of new antipsychotics in both disorders challenged the traditional Kraepelinian binary classification of SZ and BD (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these observations of commonalities of SZ and BD are emphasized by growing and recent evidences from developmental, genetic, cognitive, neuroimaging, and environmental risk studies (3, 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>With regard to family studies, relatives of patients with SZ have an increased risk for both disorders with a higher risk for SZ (10%) than for BD (8%) and relatives of patients with BD have also an increased risk for both disorders with a higher risk for BD (10%) than for SZ (3.5%) (5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The largest available familial study observed an heritability for SZ and BD about 60% for both (with thus 40% for environmental effects) with partly shared genetic and environmental causes (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Shared genetic effects for SZ that were in common with BD accounted for 52% of the genetic variance in SZ and for 69% in BD (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Molecular studies demonstrated shared genetic etiology for SZ and BD with high genetic correlation (about 0.7) between both disorders (6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Moreover, prenatal maternal nutritional deficiency, maternal infection during pregnancy, season of birth, urbanicity, and obstetrical complications are environmental risk factors that have long been demonstrated and associated in both SZ and BD (7–15). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>These commonalities between SZ and BD can be also observed at the brain structure level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the recent structural meta-analysis of controlled magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) studies of De Peri et al. shows significant overall effect sizes for intracranial, whole brain, total gray and white matter (WM) volume reduction as well as for an increase of lateral ventricular volume at disease onset for both BD and SZ (16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, some overlapping brain abnormalities may be already present at the onset of both diseases (16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>However, both SZ and BD may present neurodevelopmental specificities as whole gray matter (GM) volume deficits and lateral ventricular enlargement that appear to be more prominent in first-episode SZ, whereas WM volume reduction seems more prominent in first-episode BD (16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>These genetic and environmental influences with brain abnormalities might result in a cascade of events that manifest across a wide range of neurocognitive abnormalities in both SZ and BD that can be partly shared (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>However, worse performance exist in SZ, which can be recognized as a “generalized deficit,” compared to BD (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>This is particularly true for premorbid and current intelligence quotient and also perhaps attention, verbal memory, and executive functions (18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>BD is rather characterized by generalized moderate level of neuropsychological impairment with deficits in some specific domains such as attention, executive function, and to a lesser extent verbal memory and spatial working memory (19). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>As a simple binary classification of these two disorders seems an oversimplification of contemporary evidence, Insel and others have promoted the need to rethink investigative approaches and examine evidence of deficits or abnormalities in different research domains (e.g., cognitive, neuroimaging studies, environment risks) to build a dimensional picture of clinical presentations (20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>This strategy helps clinicians identify similarities as well as differences between disorders and is in keeping with emerging research such as the family genetic studies of Lichtenstein and colleagues we previously presented (1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>To summarize, several lines of evidence support the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of SZ and BD where both diseases can be considered as pathophysiological processes starting early in life and resulting in pathological conditions during adulthood (21, 22). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The implication of common genetic vulnerability and environmental risk factors, that may act early during development and even during fetal life, are well documented (23). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In this context, neuroimaging appears to be a relevant tool to identify putative intermediate phenotypes associated with neurodevelopmental abnormalities present in SZ and BD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Indeed, it is suggested that GM cortical reductions, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and hippocampal decrease volumes are associated with both SZ and BD patients and also observed among their relatives (24, 25). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>As we detailed previously, the common causative factors in SZ and BD, have been also observed with neuroimaging studies that showed substantial overlaps of brain abnormalities between both disorders (26). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Further it is observed that brain volume is highly heritable in both disorders, but more consistently in SZ than in BD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the Schizophrenia Twins and Relatives consortium recently observed that the heritability of most brain volumes were ranged between 52% (temporal cortical GM) to 76% (cerebrum) (27). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, it has been shown that the genetic influences and the disease-related deficits affect GM in partially non-overlapping areas of predominantly heteromodal association cortex, thus suggesting synergistic actions to produce the symptom severity and cognitive dysfunction of the disorder (28). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>First results of the influence of genetic and environmental risks on brain structures came from monozygotic twin pairs concordant and discordant for SZ or BD (29). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>These studies cannot specifically test the biological gene x environment (GxE) interaction effects, but twin studies might contribute to (1) validate the GxE interaction postulate, (2) quantify the relative effect of genetic and environmental factors on brain structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Twin studies with monozygotic twin pairs concordant and discordant for SZ or BD, observe that total brain volume and most brain regional volumes are highly heritable (about 85%), whereas cerebral GM and lateral ventricles volumes showed more common environmental effects (about 65%) (27, 30–33). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Growing evidence supports GxE interactions in these disorders. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>But there are few studies about the mechanisms by which G and E interact in SZ and BD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>To this purpose, neuroimaging studies can help us to understand how those factors mechanistically interact. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review that synthesizes the existing data of neuroimaging studies of this issue. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Three classes of OCs have been studied: hypoxia-associated OCs, maternal infection during pregnancy, and maternal stress during pregnancy (35). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>First results came from Cannon and colleagues in 1989 who used computed tomographic (CT). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>They measured ventricular, cortical, and cerebellar abnormalities to assess the effects of SZ genetic liability and perinatal complications (36). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Later, the same research team found, with obstetric hospital records and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans (MRI), that the effect of birth complications on ventricular enlargement was greater among the offspring with two parents with SZ compared with those with one affected parent, who in turn had greater enlargement compared to those with healthy parents (37). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>They demonstrated that the interaction effects of the familial genetic risk for SZ and OC (as perinatal exposure to ether anesthesia) strongly predict the type and degree of brain abnormalities shown by adult subjects (37). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Cannon and colleagues further clarified their findings comparing subjects with SZ or schizoaffective disorder, their siblings and healthy controls with the same records and MRI methods through two studies (38, 39). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>They replicated the environmental risk effect of fetal hypoxia that predicted reduced GM and increased CSF in the whole cortex (most strongly in the temporal lobe) in patients and their siblings but not among healthy controls at low risk for SZ (38). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Haukvik and colleagues tested the interaction effects between severe fetal hypoxia and variation in four hypoxia-regulated SZ susceptibility genes (BDNF, DTNBP1, GRM3, and NRG1) on hippocampal volume in subjects with SZ and healthy controls (40). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Of the 32 single nucleotides polymorphisms (SNPs) studied, an allele variation in GRM3 rs13242038 was associated with effects of severe fetal hypoxia on hippocampal volume in this relatively small sample (54 patients with SZ and 53 controls) (40). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>This study is of interest because variation in hypoxia-regulated genes, in combination with severe OCs leading to hypoxia, is thought to increase the risk of SZ (41). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Further, the effect of severe OCs on disease risk was shown to be modified by SNP variation in BDNF, DTNBP1, and GRM3 (41). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Thus interestingly this preliminary study shows that the effect of OCs on hippocampal volume could be modified by variation in hypoxia-regulated genes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>In sum, these studies converge toward the existence of an interaction between genetic liability to SZ or schizoaffective disorder and OCs (especially fetal hypoxia) on GM, CSF, and hippocampal volumes. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Cannabis use during early adolescence is associated with a twofold increased risk for SZ in psychosis-free persons and with a poor prognosis for those with an established vulnerability to psychotic disorder (severe level of psychotic symptoms and increase need for care) (42). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>McGrath et al. recently precised, using sibling pair analysis in a cohort of young adults, that young adults who commenced cannabis use before 15 years were twice as likely to develop a non-affective psychosis (43). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Further, longer duration since first cannabis use was associated with higher risk of psychosis-related outcomes by a “dose-response” relationship (43). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>The effects of exogenous cannabis and endo-cannabinoids are mostly mediated by cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1 or CB1R), which is widely expressed in the brain (44). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Habets and colleagues first examined the impact of cannabis use and developmental trauma associated with SZ on cortical thickness (45). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>These authors found for cannabis a significant interaction effect with stronger reductions of cortical thickness for both SZ groups and their healthy siblings than healthy controls, thus suggesting cannabis use and genetic liability interaction effects on the cerebral cortical thickness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>An interaction effect between developmental trauma and cortical thickness was only observed in the SZ group but not with their healthy siblings and so did not demonstrate a GxE interaction as for cannabis use (45). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Further, Ho and colleagues examined among subjects with SZ the interactions between CNR1 genetic variants and heavy cannabis use on brain volumes and cognitive function (46). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Significant CNR1 genotype-by-cannabis use interaction effects were observed on WM volumes and neurocognitive impairment in patients with SZ suggesting that heavy cannabis use in the context of specific CNR1 genotypes may contribute to confer WM abnormalities and cognitive impairment in SZ (46). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>The same team recently examined the effect of another cannabinoid-related gene, mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14): they assessed the MAPK14-CNR1 gene–gene interactions in conferring brain volumes abnormalities among subjects with SZ with cannabis abuse (47). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>Authors observed significant main effects of the MAPK14 CNR1 diplotype and diplotype × cannabis interaction on WM brain volumes. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Our review revealed that only very few environmental factors have been explored (mainly cannabis and obstetrical complications). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Each of these factors has been studied by one or two groups at most, requiring replication studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Other factors, such as migration, urbanicity, season of birth, early stress, or infections during pregnancy have not been explored despite being consistently associated with risk for SZ and BD (7–15). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Further GxE interactions neuroimaging studies only used sMRI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>However, other neuroimaging methods might be of interest as functional MRI (fMRI) that has demonstrated to be efficient in genetic and environmental explorations (49, 50). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>In addition, no study has assessed the GxE interactions with neuroimaging in BD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, these preliminary findings in SZ and schizoaffective disorder are paving the way to address more specifically this question in BD. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>We need further neuroimaging studies for which we may propose a framework focusing on existing GxE interactions data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Such study is quite challenging, regarding the high number of environmental factors known to increase risk for SZ or BD (infections, season of birth, early stress, or abuse, urbanicity, substance abuse, migration). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>The tremendous number of genetic variants identified in BD and SZ is even higher, and still growing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>It is therefore not conceivable to study all GxE interactions, as it would require very huge sample sizes, unrealistic for neuroimaging study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>We propose to focus on already clinically and epidemiologically known GxE interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>They include interactions between genetic risk for SZ and BD and OCs (51, 52), urbanicity (53, 54), early stress (55–57), and cannabis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Other potential GxE interactions are more debated and are currently being assessed by large studies such as EU-GEI (58). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Regarding genetic risk, we can assess differential effects of environment on MRI patterns between siblings of affected subjects and controls; or, within controls, between carriers of different allelic variants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, this second approach may be criticized as only very few genetic variants have consistently been shown to have GxE interaction effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>An intermediate solution may be the calculation of indirect measures of genetic risk such as a “genetic risk score” from GWAS data (6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>However, none of the currently reported gene variants have come up as highly significant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Indeed, Candidate genes associated with BD and SZ display relatively low odds ratios (OR) and minor allele frequencies (MAF), and therefore it is unlikely that both disorders are determined by common variants with large effect sizes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Thus, future studies could benefit from investigations of polygenic risk scores, genetic pathways, and gene expressions rather than single variants. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Additionally, some studies have explored GxE interactions on cognition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>A recent report on 234 adult healthy twins found a significant interaction between childhood maltreatment and COMT genotype on cognition (59). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>This was in accordance with a previous experimental study that reported a moderation of the effects of cannabis on cognition by the same COMT genotype (60). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>As cognitive performance is closely linked to neuroimaging features, such GxE interaction studies of cognition may bring us clues to potentially interesting GxE interactions to study with MRI. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>The sample size required for such studies can also be decreased by cautious high-quality measurement of environmental risk factors, selection of frequent environmental risk factors, repeated measures, and selection of extreme exposure groups (58). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, such GxE neuroimaging studies will probably require sample sizes that will need multi-site inclusion and imaging. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>The identification of GxE interactions is reported to require at least a fourfold larger sample size than the identification of a main genetic effect of comparable magnitude (without including imagery, which increase this number) (61). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Another solution can be to focus on recent findings on main genetics effects in SZ and/or BD (62). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>In addition to sample size issues, future studies in order to increase their reliability will probably need to consider independent replication samples in their study design, which is basic standard by now in genetic studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Several others methodological aspects will need to be addressed in the future as the imaging GxE corrections for multiple testing and issues such as low MAF and environmental exposure rates, the multitude of possible environmental influences on the genome (negative and positive influences), and the developmental stage of the individual since environmental experiences may differ in their impact (63). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Finally, we have to highlight that neuroimaging studies are relatively indirect measures of cellular activity and so cannot explain by themselves the underpinning mechanistic of these GxE interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>But, multimodal human and animal studies can probably help address cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying brain activity (63). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Indeed, molecular biology findings from animal studies can generate targets for human neuroimaging GxE research, which can focus on the genes of interest and neuroimaging probes of the relevant brain circuits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, findings from human research can generate putative targets in animal models to study the underpinning molecular mechanisms of these neuroimaging GxE observations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Such translational researches would definitely help to better understand the whole picture of GxE interactions. </plain></SENT>
