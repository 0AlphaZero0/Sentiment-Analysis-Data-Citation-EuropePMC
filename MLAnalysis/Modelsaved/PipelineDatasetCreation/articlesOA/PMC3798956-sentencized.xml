<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Several mRNAs were differentially expressed in highly aggressive osteosarcoma cell lines compared with non-aggressive cell lines, including RUNX2, several S100 genes, collagen genes and genes encoding proteins involved in growth factor binding, cell adhesion and extracellular matrix remodelling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most notably, four genes—COL1A2, KYNU, ACTG2 and NPPB—were differentially expressed in high and non-aggressive cell lines for all the cancer-related phenotypes investigated, suggesting that they might have important roles in the process of osteosarcoma tumorigenesis. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>While overall incidence is low, accounting for &lt;1% of all cancers (Mirabello et al, 2009), osteosarcoma predominantly affects children and adolescents, representing 5–10% of malignancies in this group (van den Berg et al, 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The prognosis of osteosarcoma is very poor, and despite advances in surgery and multiagent chemotherapy, the 5-year survival rate remains at 60–70% for patients with localised disease, and as low as 20–30% for patients with metastasis (reviewed in PosthumaDeBoer et al, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>This makes osteosarcoma the second most important cause of cancer-related death in children and adolescents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The poor prognosis of this disease is mainly due to lack of response to drug and radiation therapies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>It is therefore important to better understand the underlying mechanisms of tumour progression and metastasis to identify or develop more efficient therapies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Cancer cell lines and xenograft models are important tools for studying these mechanisms, as well as for evaluation of novel targeted therapies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Mesenchymal stem cells are highly motile, and can migrate through the body to repair tissue damage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>This mesenchymal phenotype can be reactivated in cancer cells, making also well-organised epithelial cells motile and invasive through the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is shown to increase the tumour aggressiveness (Mani et al, 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Properties associated with cancer development and aggressiveness include the capability to sustain proliferative signalling, evade growth suppressors, resist cell death, enable replicative immortality, induce angiogenesis and activate invasion and metastasis (reviewed in Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by inducing mRNA degradation or by translational repression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Aberrant miRNA expression has been observed in several diseases, including cancer (reviewed in Kong et al, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>miRNAs can target multiple genes simultaneously, and this property increases their potential as therapeutics, preventing tumours to escape the inhibition of a single pathway by using compensatory mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Several deregulated miRNAs have recently been identified for osteosarcoma (reviewed in Drury et al, 2012). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>We have previously characterised a collection of osteosarcoma cell lines and xenografts at the genomic, epigenomic and phenotypic level as part of EuroBoNet, an European Network of Excellence for research on bone tumours (Ottaviano et al, 2010; Kuijjer et al, 2011; Mohseny et al, 2011; Kresse et al, 2012; Namløs et al, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have extended this panel, and evaluated 22 osteosarcoma cell lines for properties important for cancer development; that is, in vivo tumorigenicity, in vitro colony-forming ability, invasive/migratory potential and proliferation capacity. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>The cell lines G-292, HAL, IOR/MOS, IOR/OS9, IOR/OS14 and KPD proliferated more slowly (Figure 4, green curves). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>The cell line 11T254 also proliferated slowly but is not included in the figure as we were not able to get satisfying live-cell images of this cell line due to weak cell contrast. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>To improve the understanding of oncogenic mechanisms and how they affect the efficacy of therapies, it is important to have relevant preclinical models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>The collection of osteosarcoma cell line models characterised here is to date the most extensive panel of this kind available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>As an overture to more focussed mechanistic studies, we have characterised these cell lines for the most relevant malignant phenotypes, and we anticipate that this will also facilitate preclinical studies on this orphan disease. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>We determined in vitro abilities to migrate, invade, proliferate and form colonies, as well as the in vivo ability to form tumours for 22 osteosarcoma cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we identified mRNAs and miRNAs that were differently expressed in aggressive vs non-aggressive cell lines, and associated them with specific properties of osteosarcoma tumorigenesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Growth in immunodeficient mice is probably the best way to evaluate the tumour-forming ability of patient samples, although false negatives are common. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that osteosarcoma cell lines in general are highly tumorigenic, as 17 of the 22 cell lines in the panel were able to form tumours in NSG mice within the 6-month duration of the experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Out of these 17, 10 of the cell lines formed tumours extremely rapidly. Mohseny et al (2011) have previously investigated in vivo tumorigenicity in nude mice of 19 of the cell lines in our panel. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>All lines scored as non-tumorigenic here got the same score by Mohseny et al, and the majority of their highly tumorigenic lines fall in the same group here. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>However, in their study only 8 of 19 cell lines were found to be tumorigenic. Quintana et al (2008) demonstrated how the choice of mouse strain or conditions for implantation greatly affected the efficiency of tumour formation in mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>It is also known that the age and health conditions of the mice may affect these properties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>It should therefore not be surprising that some of the lines that were tumorigenic here (HOS, MG-63, Saos2, IOR/OS15, KPD, HAL and ZK58) were scored as non-tumorigenic in nude mice by Mohseny et al, even though those cultures originated from the same cell bank as used here, and the assay was of the same duration. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>In this study, we find a strong correlation between invasion, motility and colony formation, especially for the highly aggressive cell lines, such as HOS, HOS-143B and OSA, which were highly aggressive for all phenotypes analysed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>11T254 and IOR/MOS, on the other hand, were in general non-aggressive, as they were non-tumorigenic, non-clonogenic, as well as non-invasive/non-migrative. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we identified mRNAs and miRNAs that were differentially expressed in cell lines with high vs low capacity for these cancer-related phenotypes, which could suggest some mechanistic association. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Most notably, four genes—COL1A2, KYNU, ACTG2 and NPPB—were differentially expressed in all the high/low comparisons performed (tumorigenic, clonogenic, invasive/motile and proliferative). COL1A2 and KYNU were downregulated in the highly aggressive cell lines for all properties investigated, and are thereby suggested to be associated with tumour suppression in osteosarcoma. COL1A2 encodes the pro-α2 chain of type I collagen, which is the fibrillar collagen found in most connective tissues, and the main component of the organic part of bone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>The gene is mutated in some skeletal diseases (Horton, 1996; Marini et al, 2007) and is epigenetically silenced in several cancer types (Sengupta et al, 2003; Chiba et al, 2005; Mori et al, 2009; Bonazzi et al, 2011; Caren et al, 2011; Misawa et al, 2011). Mori et al (2009) has further presented data indicating that COL1A2 inactivation contributes to increased proliferation and migration activity of bladder cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Our findings would be consistent with this, showing reduced expression of COL1A2 in the highly proliferative and motile cell lines. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>The other downregulated gene, KYNU, encodes the protein kynureninase, which is involved in the biosynthesis of NAD cofactors from tryptophan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>KYNU expression is reduced in invasive ductal carcinoma vs normal fibroadenoma (Perou et al, 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>In addition, the level of the metabolite kynuerine is 27-fold higher in human embryonic stem cells than in their oncogenic counterpart human embryonal carcinoma (Dawud et al, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in a recent study, gene expression profiles of acute myeloid leukemia patients with IDH mutation were compared with patients with wild-type IDH, revealing a deregulated tryptophan metabolism and a significant downregulation of KYNU expression in the IDH-mutated cases (Damm et al, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>This connects KYNU to the rediscovered concept of metabolic switching in cancer development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>The switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis appears to be a hallmark also for stem-cell function in normal tissue growth, and it is also associated with epigenetic programming (reviewed in Ward and Thompson, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>It seems likely that such epigenetic reprogramming could be involved in the downregulation of both KYNU and COL1A2. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Both the genes ACTG2 and NPPB were upregulated in the aggressive group for all the properties analysed, and they were the two most significantly upregulated genes in the clonogenic high/low comparison. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Since gamma actins are involved in cellular motility, it makes sense that expression of ACTG2, which encodes actin gamma 2, is increased. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Such increased expression in cancer has previously been reported (Edfeldt et al, 2011; Lin and Chuang, 2012). NPPB is a member of the natriuretic peptide family and encodes the secreted protein brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), which functions as a cardiac hormone and has a key role in cardiovascular homeostasis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this gene has not been linked to the process of tumorigenesis before. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>However, accumulating evidence suggests that natriuretic peptides also have a role outside the cardiovascular system, and they have been reported to be important regulators of bone and cartilage differentiation and maintenance; that is, overexpression of BNP results in skeletal overgrowth in transgenic mice (Suda et al, 1998), and variations in the promoter of NPPB is linked to rapid bone loss (Kajita et al, 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>In agreement with a regulative role of NPPB in bone differentiation and growth, dysregulation of this gene might be associated with impaired differentiation in cancer. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Another interesting finding was that RUNX2 expression inversely correlated with proliferation capacity. RUNX2 encodes a master transcription regulator of bone development and osteoblast maturation (reviewed in Komori, 2010), and is shown to be highly elevated in osteosarcoma tumours (reviewed in Martin et al, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>In accordance with this, we observe an upregulation of RUNX2 expression in the highly tumorigenic cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, our results further show that RUNX2 expression is reduced in the highly proliferative cell lines, which is consistent with a recent study demonstrating that overexpression of RUNX2 suppresses cell growth of several osteosarcoma cell lines (Lucero et al, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Thus, the cancer cells must be able to fine-tune RUNX2 expression to promote tumorigenesis without repressing tumour growth. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>miRNAs are interesting as their expression patterns appear to be more tissue and cancer type specific, and their small size make therapeutic applications possible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Here, we found that miR-199b-5p and mir-100-3p were downregulated, or even absent, in the highly tumorigenic cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>This is in agreement with recent publications showing that low levels of miR-199b-5p are observed in several cancer types (Garzia et al, 2009; Andolfo et al, 2012), and inversely correlate with survival rates (Wang et al, 2011). Garzia et al (2009) also more directly demonstrated that miR-199b-5p overexpression reduces the cancer stem-cell population in a xenograft mouse model, resulting in impaired medulloblastoma tumour development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Our results further revealed that miR-155-5p was upregulated in the highly clonogenic cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Oncogenic functions of miR-155 have been reported previously (reviewed in Lujambio and Lowe, 2012); in fact, miR-155 was the first example of an miRNA that in a transgenic setting was able to initiate cancer (Costinean et al, 2006; O'Connell et al, 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>The level of miR-155 is found to be high in mesenchymal stroma cells, and overexpression blocks their differentiation (Skårn et al, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Another oncogenic miRNA described in the literature is miR-135b, which was recently identified as a biomarker for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Munding et al, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, its expression was found to correlate with metastasis and clinical stage in colorectal cancer (Faltejskova et al, 2012; Xu et al, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, miR-135b-5p was in our analyses upregulated in the highly motile and invasive cell lines, consistent with a possible function of this miRNA in cancer metastasis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of this miRNA in osteosarcoma has also been reported by others (Lulla et al, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Also, miR-146a-5p was upregulated in the highly motile and invasive cell lines, and might also have a role in the process of osteosarcoma metastasis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>A large number of miRNAs were correlated with proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>miR-155-5p, miR-135b-5p and miR-146a-5p were highly upregulated in the rapidly proliferating group, whereas miR-199b-5p was downregulated, consistent with findings in the other comparisons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, upregulation of miR-155 and miR-135b in rapidly proliferating and clonogenic stem-like cells fits well with the requirement for downregulation for mesenchymal differentiation (Schaap-Oziemlak et al, 2010; Skårn et al, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>miR-34c-5p and miR-449a, both members of the miR-34/449 family, were downregulated in the highly proliferating cell lines, in agreement with the role of this family in tumour suppression through induction of cell-cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis (reviewed in Hermeking, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Inactivation of these miRNAs has been shown for a diverse set of cancer types, including osteosarcoma (He et al, 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, it has been suggested that miR-34a expression might be a potential predictor of therapy response, and that restoration of miR-34a expression might prevent chemotherapy resistance (Hermeking, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>If that is the case also for the miR-34/449 family of miRNAs, which are downregulated in osteosarcoma, this would be of great importance, since the poor prognosis of this disease is mainly due to lack of response to chemotherapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, intravenous administration of an miR-34a mimic has been shown to inhibit tumour growth and metastasis of human prostate and lung cancer cells in mouse models (Liu et al, 2010; Wiggins et al, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the current data, it would be interesting to investigate the use of such mimics in our osteosarcoma models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Notably, the miRNAs downregulated in the aggressive groups might be good candidates as therapeutics. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the data obtained from this study demonstrate that osteosarcoma cell lines in general are highly tumorigenic, and points to some candidate biomarkers for aggressive tumours. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>The panel should be a valuable resource for studies of the various cancer-related phenotypes, of the mechanisms involved and for preclinical therapy studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we identified a number of candidate genes associated with these phenotypes, the involvement of which in osteosarcoma development should be pursued further. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>However, further studies are required to evaluate whether any of the candidate genes are actual drivers of the disease. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Depending on the preclinical questions investigated, our classification of the cell line panel can be used to identify relevant models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>We encourage the exchange of model systems, both to allow critical evaluation by other scientists, and as common tools to the advantage of the scientific community. </plain></SENT>
