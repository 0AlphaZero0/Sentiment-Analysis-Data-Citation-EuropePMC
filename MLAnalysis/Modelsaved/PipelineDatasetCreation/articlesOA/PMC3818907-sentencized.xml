<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As part of the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC), miRNAs guide the complex to repress target messenger RNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation of Argonaute (AGO) protein family members followed by global profiling of bound RNA has provided an experimental high-throughput approach to map miRNA targets genome-wide2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In particular, cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) of AGO proteins provides specific regions of likely AGO binding and miRNA target sites3,4. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P3"><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The resolution of CLIP experiments has been generally insufficient to unambiguously identify the acting miRNA via sequence matches4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Recent protocols, including iCLIP and PAR-CLIP, increased resolution by providing additional signals diagnostic of cross-linked locations5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In particular, PAR-CLIP obtains high cross-linking efficiency due to the presence of the nucleoside analog 4-thiouridine, which leads to characteristic thymine-to-cytosine transitions in the library reads in the vicinity of protein-mRNA cross-linking4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>To define a narrow region (typically ~30nt) most likely bound by the protein, our previously published PARalyzer software6 quantifies this T-to-C transition profile relative to background read density via a kernel density estimator (Fig. 1a). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P4"><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>MiRNA target sites are characterized by one of several types of seed sequence matches unique to each miRNA family7 (canonically, a perfect 7nt complement to positions 2–8 of the miRNA). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In AGO-immunoprecipitated libraries, the cross-linking site indicates a radius for RISC-mediated miRNA heteroduplex formation on the mRNA substrate, and restricts the search space for functional seed matches. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the PAR-CLIP transition signal is preferentially located directly 5′ of the miRNA seed match on the mRNA4,6,8, likely due to the biophysical properties of the heteroduplex within functional miRNP complexes7 (Fig. 1b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>mRNA conservation levels immediately 3′ of peaks indicate that many of these seed matches are selectively maintained (Fig. 1c). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P5"><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Despite continuous improvements in de novo computational predictions of target sites, efforts have been fundamentally limited by the brevity of sequence motifs describing functional miRNA-target relationships. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The quantitative information in AGO PAR-CLIP datasets motivated us to develop an integrative computational method to identify miRNA target sites at the nucleotide level with high accuracy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>It combines the T-to-C transition signal with miRNA seed-pairing and its evolutionary conservation, as well as the spatial relation between binding and sequence features. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>We implemented the model within a general-purpose hidden Markov model (HMM) framework9 called MUMMIE (Multivariate Markov Modeling Inference Engine). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>We model the shape of PAR-CLIP signals with a 6-state topology (Fig. 1d), in which state 5 expands into a 41-state submodel for detection of seed matches of various types (Fig. 1e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The model is parameterized to preferentially predict seed matches that are long, are located closely 3′ to a PAR-CLIP peak, and are highly conserved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Tradeoffs between these features are naturally accounted for during prediction so that suboptimal sites can still be detected, albeit with lower scores (posterior probabilities; Supplementary Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P6"><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Most current target predictors identify candidate sites within whole transcripts, usually parameterized on the indirect cumulative effect on mRNA or protein steady-state levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The availability of in vivo direct binding data changes the problem of target prediction into one of assigning the most likely miRNA(s) to each of the observed AGO binding locations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>We applied suitable site-level target predictors to cross-linked regions from multiple datasets, and evaluated the improvement obtained by the explicit joint model in the new target predictor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Analyses were limited to regions covered by aligned PAR-CLIP reads (termed groups); this dramatically increases the accuracy of methods compared to their application without the benefit of CLIP information (Supplementary Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Because the identity of the miRNA in bound AGO complexes is unknown, we assessed the relative prediction accuracy via signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) based on randomized shuffling of miRNA sequences (i.e., enrichment of complementary miRNA seeds over decoy sequences among the predictions; see Online Methods). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P7"><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Specifically, we compared MUMMIE to the following alternatives: The latest release of the state-of-the-art de novo miRNA target site predictor, TargetScan10, utilizes conservation evidence as well as various sequence context scores, but makes no explicit use of CLIP information. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>MIRZA11 implements a new biophysical model of target recognition, based on context-specific RNA duplex formation estimated on high-quality PAR-CLIP data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>We contrasted these model-based approaches to two baseline strategies for identifying miRNA target sites from PAR-CLIP data: choosing the nearest seed match to each PARalyzer peak, or predicting all seed matches within each PARalyzer cluster (the maximal interval in which T-to-C transition rate exceeds background expectation6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>All approaches used the 100 most highly-expressed miRNAs in the cell line, which delivered the best trade-off between SNR and sensitivity (Supplementary Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P8"><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>On a PAR-CLIP dataset from a lymphoblastoid cell line infected with Epstein-Barr virus (LCL-BAC)12, our model achieves higher sensitivity, specificity, and SNR than other approaches (Fig. 1f, g). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Thus, the joint model has a greater ability to discriminate real from decoy target sites (higher SNR), and it does so by predicting fewer randomized decoy sites within those CLIP groups (higher specificity). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>TargetScan limits predictions to the three “canonical” seed matches (7mer-A1, 7mer-m8, 8mer-A1), while our model predicts seven types (6mer3–8, 6mer2–7, 7mer-m8, 7mer-m1, 7mer-A1, 8mer-A1, 8mer-m1; see also Supplementary Fig. 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>MIRZA’s energy-based model scores the whole duplex and is therefore agnostic to specific seed matches. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>While it reaches a higher sensitivity than MUMMIE, by far the largest contribution of “noncanonical” targets appear to involve the 6mer seeds included in MUMMIE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The baseline models exhibited competitive sensitivity, but at very low SNR/specificity levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Results on additional PAR-CLIP data sets prepared by MNase digestion13, in place of the double RNase T1 digestion used in the original protocol, confirmed all of the observed performance trends (Supplementary Fig. 5; Supplementary Table 1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P9"><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>To make results as comparable as possible, we used TargetScan’s branch length score as conservation evidence10, which is unavailable for 6mer seed matches. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>This effectively biases our model against predicting 6mer sites when parameterized to weight conservation highly, and helps improve specificity and SNR at the low-sensitivity end of the spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Increasing the number of miRNAs represented in our model beyond the 100 most highly expressed ones progressively degrades performance (Supplementary Fig. 3), illustrating the complementary benefit of miRNA expression measurements in addition to RISC binding information. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Examples of several previously or newly experimentally validated MUMMIE predictions12 involving different seed types are given in Supplementary Figs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>6 and 7. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P10"><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>To directly address the question of whether predicted targets were due to the presence of the specified miRNA, we contrasted the LCL-BAC predictions with those from three additional Epstein-Barr infected cell lines, each of which has one viral miRNA deleted (BHRF1-1, BHRF1-2, and BHRF1-3, respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The PAR-CLIP signal in the deletion lines was nearly absent at the locations of predictions involving a BHRF miRNA in the original cell line (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>For two miRNAs, the loss of sites was accompanied by consistent upregulation in steady-state target mRNA levels as measured by Illumina sequencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>MUMMIE-based observations agreed with MIRZA-predicted targets (Supplementary Fig. 9). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P11"><text><SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>As shown in previous studies, the presence of a perfect seed match cannot explain all CLIP groups4,6,14. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>In the LCL-BAC dataset, the sensitivity of MUMMIE does not exceed 80% at the most lenient settings; a naive scan for 6-mer seed matches to the top 100 expressed miRNAs does not exceed 84% (Supplementary Fig. 10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>This motivated us to investigate the extent to which binding with an imperfect seed match might explain remaining CLIP groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>We focused on a recently described class of imperfect targets, namely “bulge” sites, which have been suggested to explain as many as 25% of all the HITS-CLIP clusters for miR-12414. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>We adapted our model to sites in which one of the mRNA residues pairs with the miRNA only during an initial annealing step but becomes unpaired in the final duplex, forming a bulge in the mRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>In addition to the previously proposed pivot pairing between mRNA positions 5–6, we investigated potential bulges between positions 4–5 and positions 3–4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Bulge site predictions showed distinctly lower SNR profiles, and when combining all three pivot locations, predictions covered only ~15–20% of orphan groups (~1–2% of total groups; Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary Figs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>11, 12, and 13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Even MIRZA, which does not make any seed type assumptions, assigns miRNAs to only a small fraction of additional clusters. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P12"><text><SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Our findings illustrate the superiority of transcriptomic assays over de novo sequence analysis for identifying functional sites active in a specific condition, as well as of principled modeling techniques over ad hoc strategies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>By jointly modeling multiple relevant variables — including evolutionary conservation, residue transition rates, spatial positioning, and sequence composition — MUMMIE provides for finer discrimination between true and decoy sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>There is room for further improvement, via incorporation of additional evidence including structural accessibility, and relative or absolute production or steady-state levels of miRNAs or mRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>The framework provides flexibility in the ability not only to incorporate additional covariates, but also to choose the desired compromise between sensitivity and specificity, and to define additional classes of seed matches (e.g., centered sites15 or compensatory 3′ binding16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>However, in our comparative evaluation, genuinely imperfect seed sites appeared to account for a small fraction of total targets only. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The remaining 20% of AGO clusters may reflect low-affinity transitory binding, experimental noise, or AGO targets that do not involve miRNAs17. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P13"><text><SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Due to the exploitation of complementary information sources, we have arrived at a performance level where the question of miRNA targeting is no longer a binary one, but one of quantitative impact of a miRNA on a transcript (cf. Supplementary Fig. 6; this idea has specifically been pursued in the concurrently developed MIRZA). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>To this aim, however, multiple genomic data sets have to be generated; recent sequence-only target predictors remain more generally applicable18, albeit at the cost of significant reductions in accuracy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Yet, distinct transition patterns are also observed for other post-transcriptional regulators such as Quaking and Pumilio4, suggesting the utility of such models for RNA-binding protein target identification in general. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>PAR-CLIP data for LCL-BAC, LCL-BAC-D1 and LCL-BAC-D3 was previously published by us12 (GEO GSE41437); PAR-CLIP data for LCL-BAC-D2 was newly generated following the same protocol, which involved treatment with double RNase T1 digestion. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P15"><text><SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>LCL-BAC libraries were prepared using the original PAR-CLIP protocol4, which includes double RNase T1 digestion steps to fragment cross-linked RNA prior to sequencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>This has raised concerns that identified binding events may exhibit biases due to sequence preferences of the digestion enzymes13,14. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>We therefore additionally analyzed previously published PAR-CLIP data from HEK 293 cells, two biological replicates involving MNase digestion of isolated RNA in place of double T1 digestion (“MNase A”, GEO GSM714646; “MNase B”, GSM714647)11. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P17"><text><SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>PAR-CLIP data for all cell lines were processed by PARalyzer6 to produce sequences of continuous values. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>PARalyzer smoothes the sequence of discrete read count values via kernel density estimation, and the resulting continuous values represent relative frequencies of T-to-C transitions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>This sequence is referred to as the “signal track” for use in MUMMIE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>In practice, the PARalyzer signal track for a complete UTR will typically be sparse; i.e., zero everywhere except at and around an occupied binding site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>These nonzero regions, which correspond to scaffolds of aligned PAR-CLIP reads, are termed “groups.” When binding sites are close together, their scaffolds may coalesce, resulting in one group for multiple occupied sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>PARalyzer therefore defines individual “interaction sites” by identifying maximal intervals in which the T-to-C transition signal is higher than the background; we term these intervals “clusters.” Clusters therefore occur within groups, and generally provide for a higher resolution of RBP target sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>However, their utility in pinpointing miRNA target sites in AGO libraries is complicated due to lack of T-to-C transition signal within the miRNA-mRNA duplex site: the signal “peak” generally does not overlap the actual miRNA seed match, and the PARalyzer software therefore provides an option to “pad” and increase the size of AGO clusters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Here, other than for the baseline seed match comparison, we do not explicitly use PARalyzer clusters; instead, we run MUMMIE on the complete UTR, after normalization of the signal for individual groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Normalization of groups ensures that the maximum signal value for each group is 1.0, and helps to control for differing binding affinities, sequencing biases, and miRNA/mRNA abundance. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P18"><text><SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>To validate library-specific predictions, we compared the PAR-CLIP signal at predicted “true” sites, for a miRNA expressed in LCL-BAC, against the signal in one of the LCL-BAC-D1/2/3 libraries not expressing the miRNA of interest (Fig. 2a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>The significance of the signal difference was assessed by a non-parametric test, in which we first ranked target sites of all top 100 expressed miRNAs by their difference in signal and quantified the enrichment of true targets at the top, i.e. among the most-changed sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>This implicitly accounts for the overall difference in signal observed across all targets, due to incomplete saturation of the deep sequencing libraries (Fig. 2b). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>A Markov model is a probabilistic generative model for sequential data with a fixed set of discrete states Q={q0, q1, …, qN−1}. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>We here consider discrete-time models, in which observations are available for T={0,1,…,L−1} positions in a biological sequence S=s0s1…sL−1, which the model is assumed to have emitted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Emitted sequence elements may take continuous values; for multivariate models, each sequence element is a vector of continuous values (each emitted by a separate “emission channel”). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>In hybrid continuous/discrete models, each emission channel is either discrete or continuous. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>Thus, for each vector in the emission sequence, each component of that vector will be a value that is either a symbol drawn from a discrete alphabet, or a numerical value. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>For example, an RNA emission channel would accept symbols from the set {A,C,G,U}, an “aligned read-count” channel would accept nonnegative integers denoting numbers of reads aligned at a given genomic position, and a “probability of being unpaired” track would accept real values between 0 and 1. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P24"><text><SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>The model M emits a biological sequence S as follows. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Beginning in a special silent state q0, at each time step t the model chooses a state to transition into, by drawing a new state xt+1∈Q from a transition probability distribution, P(x|xt), which is conditional on the current state, xt. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Upon entering the new state, it draws a random vector y∈V from the emission distribution P(y|xt+1), where V is the set of all possible emission vectors for the model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>After emitting the vector’s components into the respective emission channels, the model chooses the next transition according to P(x|xt). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>If state q0 is chosen, the machine terminates and S is taken to be the complete emission; otherwise, it continues its run by alternating between transitions and emissions, until state q0 is eventually chosen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Note that q0 never makes emissions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P25"><text><SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Because the emission distribution is conditional only on the current state, each emission is conditionally independent of all other emissions, given the associated state. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>This is the case of 0th-order emissions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>A model with higher-order emissions may condition each emission on events (transitions or emissions) progressively further into the past. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>For the present work we consider only higher-order discrete emissions, in which the emission of a symbol may be conditioned on some number of immediately preceding symbols emitted into the same channel; this permits us to model seed matches for many different miRNAs while using a relatively small number of states (see below). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P26"><text><SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>For miRNA target prediction, we designed a 47-state Markov model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>The model is a hybrid continuous/discrete multivariate hidden Markov model with three emission channels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>The first channel is the PARalyzer signal representing the relative abundance of T-to-C transitions in aligned CLIP scaffolds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>This channel is continuous and modeled via a four-component Gaussian mixture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>The second channel, branch length score (BLS), provides a continuous measure of conservation; it was computed using a script from the TargetScan package. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Our default model detects seven types of miRNA binding: 6mer3–8, 6mer2–7, 7mer-m8, 7mer-m1, 7mer-A1, 8mer-A1, and 8mer-m1. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P28"><text><SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>The model in Fig. 1d preferentially visits state 5 (the miRNA binding site) a short distance 3′ of a PAR-CLIP peak (which is generally matched by state 3); this preference reflects the strong enrichment of miRNA seed matches 3′ of peaks (Fig. 1b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>In consequence, model predictions also show a strong preference for this location relative to the peak (Supplementary Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P29"><text><SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Fig. 1b suggests a small fraction of sites 5′ of the peak, and the model predicts a fraction of these 5′ sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>This illustrates the flexibility of this class of models: when the most promising site occurs 5′ of the peak, the decoding algorithm will permit state 3 to be visited earlier in the sequence so that state 5 can match the putative target site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Likewise, when no promising seed match is present, the decoding algorithm may choose to not predict any binding site for the PAR-CLIP group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>This flexibility is a function of the model parameters, in particular the variance of the emission distribution for the PAR-CLIP signal: for low variances (~0.01) the model predicts many sites (typically one per PAR-CLIP group), while for high variances (~1.0) it predicts fewer sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>The different points in Fig. 1f, g correspond to different settings of the PARalyzer signal variance, with a high variance parameter corresponding to high specificity and high SNR, and a low variance parameter corresponding to high sensitivity (the following variances were used for these plots: 1.5, 1.25, 0.75, 0.5, 0.375, 0.25, 0.20, 0.15, 0.1, 0.075, 0.05, 0.01, 0.005). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P30"><text><SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>To model bulge sites with bulges at specific positions complementary to the seed, we use the same metamodel structure shown in Fig. 1d, but simplify the submodel for state 5 to include only a single linear chain of seven states to match the six seed residues plus the bulge position embedded within the seed. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p id="P32"><text><SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Viterbi decoding identifies the single most probable path through the HMM states for emitting the multivariate sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Any occurrence of metastate 5 in that most probable path is interpreted as a predicted miRNA binding site; the exact sequence of states within the metastate dictates the type of binding (e.g., 6mer2–7, 7mer-m1, etc.), and the matching nucleotides in the emitted sequence identify the miRNA family (seed sequences may or may not be unique to a given miRNA within a family; when multiple miRNAs share a predicted seed, all are listed as the potential binding miRNA). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P33"><text><SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>In contrast to Viterbi decoding, posterior decoding utilizes the well-known forward and backward algorithms25 to compute the posterior probability P(q,k) that state q was active at position k when the sequence was generated by the HMM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>In addition to providing this standard functionality, MUMMIE also computes for each 8bp interval the posterior probability that a miRNA binds within that 8bp interval, via any of the modeled binding modes (i.e., by summing the posteriors for each binding mode for that miRNA within that 8bp interval). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P34"><text><SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Finally, MUMMIE supports a combination of posterior and Viterbi decoding via the posterior Viterbi algorithm26, in which emission and transition probabilities in the Viterbi algorithm are replaced with posterior probabilities. </plain></SENT>
