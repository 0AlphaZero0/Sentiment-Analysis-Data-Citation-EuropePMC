In flowering plants, TE expression can be activated (de-repressed) under certain stressful conditions, both biotic and abiotic, as well as by genome stress caused by hybridization. In this study, we examined the effects of these stress agents on TE expression in two diploid species of coffee, <italic>Coffea canephora</italic> and <italic>C. eugenioides</italic>, and their allotetraploid hybrid <italic>C. arabica</italic>. We also explored the relationship of TE repression mechanisms to host gene regulation via the effects of exonized TE sequences. Similar to what has been seen for other plants, overall TE expression levels are low in <italic>Coffea</italic> plant cultivars, consistent with the existence of effective TE repression mechanisms. TE expression patterns are highly dynamic across the species and conditions assayed here are unrelated to their classification at the level of TE class or family. In contrast to previous results, cell culture conditions <italic>per se</italic> do not lead to the de-repression of TE expression in <italic>C. arabica</italic>. Results obtained here indicate that differing plant drought stress levels relate strongly to TE repression mechanisms. TEs tend to be expressed at significantly higher levels in non-irrigated samples for the drought tolerant cultivars but in drought sensitive cultivars the opposite pattern was shown with irrigated samples showing significantly higher TE expression. Thus, TE genome repression mechanisms may be finely tuned to the ideal growth and/or regulatory conditions of the specific plant cultivars in which they are active. Analysis of TE expression levels in cell culture conditions underscored the importance of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathways in the repression of <italic>Coffea</italic> TEs. These same NMD mechanisms can also regulate plant host gene expression via the repression of genes that bear exonized TE sequences.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by grants provided by the Brazilian agencies Funda&#231;&#227;o de Amparo &#224; Pesquisa do Estado de S&#227;o Paulo (2008/05894-1 to CMAC and fellowship 2007/55985-0 to FRL) and Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#237;fico e Tecnol&#243;gico (to CMAC).

As a result of this characteristic, they are responsible for donating regulatory sequences <xref rid="pone.0078931-Jordan1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> and transcription regulatory signals <xref rid="pone.0078931-Thornburg1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, as well as for creating considerable genomic instability, mediating chromosome rearrangements <xref rid="pone.0078931-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, altering both gene expression and function <xref rid="pone.0078931-Jordan1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, and creating novel genes and exons <xref rid="pone.0078931-Kidwell1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

According to a unified classification system proposed for eukaryotic transposable elements <xref rid="pone.0078931-Wicker1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, TEs can be grouped into two classes according to their transposition mode: Class I elements (retrotransposons), which use the enzyme Reverse Transcriptase (RTase) to transpose via an RNA intermediate to a new genome insertion site, and Class II elements, which are transposed directly via DNA molecule using a transposase (Tpase) enzyme. Class I elements are divided into five orders (LTR, DIRS, PLE, LINEs, SINEs), each of which is subdivided into superfamilies (LTR: <italic>Copia</italic>, <italic>Gypsy</italic>, <italic>Bel-Pao</italic>, <italic>Retrovirus</italic>, <italic>ERV</italic>; DIRS: <italic>DIRS</italic>, <italic>Ngaro</italic>, <italic>VIPER</italic>; PLE: <italic>Penelope</italic>; LINEs: <italic>R2</italic>, <italic>RTE</italic>, <italic>Jockey</italic>, <italic>L1</italic>, <italic>I</italic>; SINEs: <italic>tRNA</italic>, <italic>7SL</italic>, <italic>5S</italic>). Class II (DNA transposons) elements are split into two subclasses: subclass I contains superfamilies either with terminal inverted repeats (<italic>Tc1-Mariner</italic>, <italic>hAT</italic>, <italic>Mutator</italic>, <italic>Merlin</italic>, <italic>Transib</italic>, <italic>P</italic>, <italic>PiggyBac</italic>, <italic>PIF-Harbinger</italic> and <italic>Cacta</italic>) or without terminal inverted repeats (<italic>Crypton</italic>), whereas subclass II comprises the Helitron and Maverick superfamilies.</p><p>Plant genomes are massively invaded by repetitive DNA, primarily LTR retrotransposons <xref rid="pone.0078931-Kumar1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Many of these retrotransposons are located near host genes and thus could impact the expression of these neighboring genes whose expression is mediated by a variety of mechanisms, such as RNAi <xref rid="pone.0078931-Zaratiegui1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, DNA methylation <xref rid="pone.0078931-Kinoshita1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, and readout transcription <xref rid="pone.0078931-Kashkush1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.

To our knowledge, detailed analyses of the abundance, activity and regulation of transcriptionally active TEs in <italic>Coffea</italic> genomes, as well as analyses of the relationship of these to their chromosomal distribution, have yet to be performed. We previously searched the Brazilian Coffee Genome Project database (LGE database, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lge.ibi.unicamp.br/cafe">http://www.lge.ibi.unicamp.br/cafe</ext-link>) aiming to identify TE fragments within coding regions in expressed sequences (ESTs) of three <italic>Coffea</italic> species (<italic>C. arabica</italic>, <italic>C. canephora</italic> and <italic>C. racemosa</italic>). The ESTs and unigenes harboring TEs were analyzed regarding the size of the TE fragment, the functional categories to which they were assigned to and to their contribution to the proteome <xref rid="pone.0078931-Lopes1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In the present study, we rescreened the LGE database using a more sensitive method, which allowed for a substantial increase in the number of unigenes harboring TEs, and used the gene sequences to identify paralogous unigenes that do not contain TEs. Expression levels of isoforms with and without TEs in <italic>C. arabica</italic> and <italic>C. canephora</italic> transcriptome were analyzed in cell culture and plants grown under different irrigation conditions. This approach was taken in order to understand the regulatory effects that exonized TEs may exert on <italic>Coffea</italic> host genes. The expression levels of TE transcripts themselves were also assayed across the same conditions in order to better understand how they are regulated and how they respond to various stresses including different drought and irrigation conditions as well as cell culture and polyploidization. The chromosomal distribution of <italic>Coffea</italic> TEs was interrogated genome-wide for the first time here using FISH.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Frequency and Classification of Expressed TEs in the Transcriptomes of <italic>Coffea spp</italic>

When hierarchical clustering is used to relate the expression patterns of individual TE transcripts, there is no apparent coherence within TE classes or families; individual members of TE classes and families are dispersed throughout the resulting tree (Figure S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078931.s004">File S4</xref>).

There is no statistical difference in the average distances between TE expression profiles within or between families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078931-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). This same lack of overall coherence in TE expression patterns can be seen at the level of individual TE families, where there is generally no difference in the distances between expression profiles within or between families (Figure S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078931.s004">File S4</xref>).

This may include both sequence-based and epigenetic factors for the surrounding genomic environment. However, it should be noted that changes in TE expression in response to cycloheximide treatment appear to be more consistent across individual TE insertions. On average, TEs are expressed at higher levels in callus treated with cycloheximide (CHX+ versus CHX&#8211; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078931-g003">Figure 3</xref>); although, the difference is only marginally significant owing to the high level of variation in TE expression under cycloheximide treatment. Nevertheless, there are a number of individual TE transcripts that show highly significant differences between CHX+ and CHX&#8211; conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078931-g002">Figure 2E</xref> and Figure S5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078931.s004">File S4</xref>). Cycloheximide (CHX) is a compound that blocks translation and thereby inactivates the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway (NMD). The NMD pathway provides for the detection and degradation of aberrant mRNAs that contain premature termination codons resulting from point mutations, rearrangements or errors during transcription or RNA processing <xref rid="pone.0078931-Brogna1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. More to the point, NMD may also represent a genome defense mechanism against the proliferation of TEs since mRNA sequences derived from TEs are frequent targets of NMD <xref rid="pone.0078931-Mendell1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Thus, the up-regulation of TE expression upon CHX treatment would seem to reflect the mitigation of the plant genome&#8217;s NMD based defense against TE expression. The consistency of this pattern seen across TE transcripts assayed here underscores the likely importance of NMD in genome defense against plant TE expression.</p><fig id="pone-0078931-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0078931.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>TE expression level differences for paired cultivar samples.</title><p>Overall TE expression levels are compared for cycloheximide treated (CHX+) versus untreated (CHX&#8211;) <italic>C. arabica</italic> callus and irrigated (I) versus non-irrigated (NI) leaves for drought tolerant <italic>C. arabica</italic> and <italic>C. canephora</italic> as well as drought sensitive <italic>C. arabica</italic>.

This result indicates that the presence of TEs in genic transcripts leads to their down-regulation and suggests the possibility that mechanisms similar to those used to repress TE transcript, such as NMD, may be involved in this process.

Differences and similarities with other plant genomes were observed. For instance, it has been reported that cell culture conditions increase the expression levels of some TEs in plants, as for example <italic>Tnt1</italic> from tobacco <xref rid="pone.0078931-Courtial1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>; <italic>Tos10, Tos17 and Tos19</italic> from rice <xref rid="pone.0078931-Hirochika2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>; several DNA transposons and retrotransposons from sugarcane <xref rid="pone.0078931-deAraujo1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>; and LTR retrotransposons from rice <xref rid="pone.0078931-Vicient1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In contrast to these previous observations, our results show that cell culture conditions <italic>per se</italic> do not elevate TE expression levels in <italic>C. arabica</italic>.

These results suggest that TE regulatory and/or suppression mechanisms remain largely intact in <italic>C. arabica</italic> cell culture conditions. This conclusion is supported by the observation that treatment of <italic>C. arabica</italic> cell culture with CHX, a repressor of NMD, leads to a significant increase in TE expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078931-g003">Figure 3</xref>).

Although the mechanisms of these changes are poorly understood, increasing TE transpositional activity is a possibility since quiescent TEs in a diploid genome can become activated in the new polyploid genetic environment. Additionally, the genetic redundancy in a polyploid genome can mitigate the deleterious effects of transposition <xref rid="pone.0078931-Voytas1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, thereby allowing TEs to proliferate in allotetraploids and insert within gene-rich chromosomal regions.

<italic>Coffea arabica</italic> and <italic>C. canephora</italic> showed a low TE&#8211;like mRNA abundance; only 0.17% of ESTs were expressed TEs (320 out of 181,405 <italic>EST</italic>s).

However, a recent systematic search in the maize transcriptome showed that 1.5% of its ESTs (25,282 ESTs out of more than 2 million) were similar to 56 well characterized TE families <xref rid="pone.0078931-Vicient1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.
