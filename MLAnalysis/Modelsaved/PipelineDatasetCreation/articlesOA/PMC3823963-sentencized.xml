</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Transposable elements (TEs) are genetic entities with an intrinsic mobilization capacity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>As a result of this characteristic, they are responsible for donating regulatory sequences [1] and transcription regulatory signals [2], as well as for creating considerable genomic instability, mediating chromosome rearrangements [3], altering both gene expression and function [1], and creating novel genes and exons [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Such mobilization can also result in host genome contraction and expansion [5], [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>According to a unified classification system proposed for eukaryotic transposable elements [7], TEs can be grouped into two classes according to their transposition mode: Class I elements (retrotransposons), which use the enzyme Reverse Transcriptase (RTase) to transpose via an RNA intermediate to a new genome insertion site, and Class II elements, which are transposed directly via DNA molecule using a transposase (Tpase) enzyme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Class I elements are divided into five orders (LTR, DIRS, PLE, LINEs, SINEs), each of which is subdivided into superfamilies (LTR: Copia, Gypsy, Bel-Pao, Retrovirus, ERV; DIRS: DIRS, Ngaro, VIPER; PLE: Penelope; LINEs: R2, RTE, Jockey, L1, I; SINEs: tRNA, 7SL, 5S). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Class II (DNA transposons) elements are split into two subclasses: subclass I contains superfamilies either with terminal inverted repeats (Tc1-Mariner, hAT, Mutator, Merlin, Transib, P, PiggyBac, PIF-Harbinger and Cacta) or without terminal inverted repeats (Crypton), whereas subclass II comprises the Helitron and Maverick superfamilies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Plant genomes are massively invaded by repetitive DNA, primarily LTR retrotransposons [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Many of these retrotransposons are located near host genes and thus could impact the expression of these neighboring genes whose expression is mediated by a variety of mechanisms, such as RNAi [9], DNA methylation [10], and readout transcription [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>While the transcriptional activity of TEs seems to be tightly controlled by host genomes [12], e.g. by transcriptional gene silencing mechanisms such as those that prevent the access of the host transcriptional machinery [13], reports also show that TEs can be activated under certain stress conditions, such as pathogen infection, physical injuries, abiotic stress [14] or cell culture [15], [16], [17], [18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Of the approximately one hundred species in the Coffea genus, only C. arabica and C. canephora are used in commercial production, representing ∼70% and 30% of global coffee production, respectively [19]. C. arabica is a unique polyploidy species of the genus (4n = 4X = 44 chromosomes) and was derived from a recent (1 million years ago) natural hybridization between C. canephora and C. eugenioides [20]. C. canephora is a diploid (2n = 2x = 22 chromosomes) and is an auto-incompatible species that grows in humid and lowland habitats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>It is usually more resistant to pests and diseases as well as to abiotic stresses like water deprivation and is also characterized by a higher productivity and bean caffeine content than C. arabica. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>However, the quality of the beverage is regarded as inferior to that of C. arabica [21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The identification of transposable elements in Coffea was initiated only recently [22], [23], [24], [25], [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, detailed analyses of the abundance, activity and regulation of transcriptionally active TEs in Coffea genomes, as well as analyses of the relationship of these to their chromosomal distribution, have yet to be performed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>We previously searched the Brazilian Coffee Genome Project database (LGE database, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lge.ibi.unicamp.br/cafe">http://www.lge.ibi.unicamp.br/cafe</ext-link>) aiming to identify TE fragments within coding regions in expressed sequences (ESTs) of three Coffea species (C. arabica, C. canephora and C. racemosa). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The ESTs and unigenes harboring TEs were analyzed regarding the size of the TE fragment, the functional categories to which they were assigned to and to their contribution to the proteome [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we rescreened the LGE database using a more sensitive method, which allowed for a substantial increase in the number of unigenes harboring TEs, and used the gene sequences to identify paralogous unigenes that do not contain TEs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Expression levels of isoforms with and without TEs in C. arabica and C. canephora transcriptome were analyzed in cell culture and plants grown under different irrigation conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>This approach was taken in order to understand the regulatory effects that exonized TEs may exert on Coffea host genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of TE transcripts themselves were also assayed across the same conditions in order to better understand how they are regulated and how they respond to various stresses including different drought and irrigation conditions as well as cell culture and polyploidization. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The main difference between diversity of TE families between the two species is due to higher number of Ty1-Copia families in C. arabica, which harbors seven families of this superfamily of LTR retrotransposon, but excepting Tst1, all occurring in just one EST (Figure 1, Tables S1 &amp; S2 in File S1). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Regarding the DNA transposons, the most expressed families in C. arabica were MuDR (12 ESTs: 12% of the TEs and 24% of Class II), Jittery (11 ESTs: 11% of the TEs and 22% of Class II) and Soymar (11 ESTs: 11% of the TEs and 22% of Class II). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Likewise, in C. canephora the most expressed retrotransposons were dea1 (94 ESTs: 43% and 49%), Retrosat2 (56 ESTs: 25% and 29%) and Del1 (18 ESTs: 8% and 9%) and, the most expressed DNA transposons were MuDR (7 ESTs: 3% and 24%), AtMu and Activator (6 ESTs each: 2.7% and 21%), and Jittery (5 ESTs: 2% and 17%). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>For instance, it has been reported that cell culture conditions increase the expression levels of some TEs in plants, as for example Tnt1 from tobacco [31]; Tos10, Tos17 and Tos19 from rice [32]; several DNA transposons and retrotransposons from sugarcane [17]; and LTR retrotransposons from rice [18]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>This conclusion is supported by the observation that treatment of C. arabica cell culture with CHX, a repressor of NMD, leads to a significant increase in TE expression (Figure 3). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Polyploid genomes are subjected to extensive changes, such as insertions/deletions, inversions and translocations, as well as alterations in gene expression patterns [33], [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanisms of these changes are poorly understood, increasing TE transpositional activity is a possibility since quiescent TEs in a diploid genome can become activated in the new polyploid genetic environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the genetic redundancy in a polyploid genome can mitigate the deleterious effects of transposition [35], thereby allowing TEs to proliferate in allotetraploids and insert within gene-rich chromosomal regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Another possibility is the relaxation of host silencing mechanisms (e.g., methylation) in allotetraploids, which should also allow for increased transposition rates [36]. </plain></SENT>
