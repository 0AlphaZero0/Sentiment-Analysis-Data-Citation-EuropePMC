ginseng</italic> Meyer (Araliaceae). To expand our understanding of the action of KRG on central nervous system (CNS) function, we examined the effects of KRG on tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)/plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) expression in rat primary astrocytes. KRG extract was treated in cultured rat primary astrocytes and neuron in a concentration range of 0.1 to 1.0 mg/mL and the expression of functional tPA/PAI-1 was examined by casein zymography, Western blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. KRG extracts increased PAI-1 expression in rat primary astrocytes in a concentration dependent manner (0.1 to 1.0 mg/mL) without affecting the expression of tPA itself. Treatment of 1.0 mg/mL KRG increased PAI-1 protein expression in rat primary astrocytes to 319.3&#177;65.9% as compared with control. The increased PAI-1 expression mediated the overall decrease in tPA activity in rat primary astrocytes. Due to the lack of PAI-1 expression in neuron, KRG did not affect tPA activity in neuron. KRG treatment induced a concentration dependent activation of PI3K, p38, ERK1/2, and JNK in rat primary astrocytes and treatment of PI3K or MAPK inhibitors such as LY294002, U0126, SB203580, and SP600125 (10 &#956;M each), significantly inhibited 1.0 mg/mL KRG-induced expression of PAI- 1 and down-regulation of tPA activity in rat primary astrocytes. Furthermore, compound K but not other ginsenosides such as Rb1 and Rg1 induced PAI-1 expression. KRG-induced up-regulation of PAI-1 in astrocytes may play important role in the regulation of overall tPA activity in brain, which might underlie some of the beneficial effects of KRG on CNS such as neuroprotection in ischemia and brain damaging condition as well as prevention or recovery from addiction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd><italic>Panax ginseng</italic></kwd><kwd>Compound K</kwd><kwd>Tissue plasminogen activator</kwd><kwd>Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1</kwd><kwd>Astrocyte</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Astrocytes are the most abundant type of cells in the brain, which regulate energy and ion homeostasis of extracellular milieu in central nervous system (CNS). Astrocytes not only provide structural support in CNS but also actively involved in the proper maintenance of synaptic environment by dozens of mechanisms such as trophic support, anti oxidant defense, neurotransmitter uptake, production of proteases and protease inhibitors and modulation of extracellular matrix components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B001">[1]</xref>.</p><p>Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and its endogenous inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is not only involved in clot dissolution in peripheral blood vessel, but also plays important role in brain such as regulation of neurite outgrowth, cell migration during development, regulation of synaptic plasticity and much more <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B002">[2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B003">3]</xref>. It is also clear that the tight regulation of this enzymatic system is important because they are involved in the regulation of cellular function and pathogenesis of several CNS disorders including addiction, Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and stroke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B002">[2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B004">4]</xref>.</p><p>Although most of the cells in CNS express tPA, PAI-1 is exclusively expressed in astrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B005">[5]</xref> and the regulation of PAI-1 activity and expression plays important role in the modulation of overall tPA activity in brain. Considering tPA/PAI-1 may play both protective and destructive role in cellular function as well as cell survival, it is very important to understand the regulatory mechanism of tPA/PAI-1 in brain, which may provide better way to control a myriad of neurological processes ranging from cellular differentiation and synaptic plasticity to neuronal death and regeneration.</p><p>Korean Red Ginseng (KRG) is an oriental herbal preparation used for medicinal and nutritional supplemental purposes. KRG is obtained from <italic>Panax ginseng</italic> by a series of process including drying, heating and steaming. Studies using both human and animal models suggested that ginseng and related compounds provides beneficial effects in many CNS diseases including Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, addiction, depression and stroke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B006">[6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B010">10]</xref>. However, no reports are available regarding the role of KRG on tPA/PAI-1 system in brain cells. Studies using endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells suggested that ginseng or ginsenosides may affect tPA and PAI-1 activity and expression in a variety of different ways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B011">[11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B016">16]</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we examined the effects of KRG on tPA/PAI-1 system in rat primary neuron and astrocytes. The results show that KRG and ginsenoside compound K (CK) up-regulates PAI-1 in astrocytes thereby down-regulate tPA activity in rat primary astrocytes. The regulation of tPA/PAI-1 activity by KRG and CK may contribute to the KRG&#8217;s effects on various CNS conditions and diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>Dulbecco&#8217;s modified Eagle medium (DMEM)/F12, fetal bovine serum (FBS), and other culture reagents were obtained from Gibco BRL (Grand Island, NY, USA). Bovine plasminogen and urokinase was obtained from American Diagnostica (Stamford, CT, USA). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, serotype O26:B6) and other chemicals including casein were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). SB203580, SP600125, U0126, and LY294002 were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA, USA). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against rat PAI-1 was obtained from American Diagnostica. Phosphospecific or total antibodies to ERK1/2, JNK, p38, PI3K, Akt, and I&#954;B&#945; were obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA, USA). Ginsenosides CK, Rb1, and Rg1 was purchased from Ambo Institute (Seoul, Korea). Standardized KRG was manufactured and kindly provided by Korea Ginseng Corporation (Seoul, Korea). The preparation of KRG and analysis of the composition of major ginsenosides in the extract were reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B017">[17]</xref>. In brief, roots of a 6-year-old fresh <italic>P. ginseng</italic> were extracted three times at 85&#8451; to 90&#8451; for 8 h with circulating hot water. The water content of pooled extract was 36% of total weight.</p></sec><sec><title>Rat primary astrocyte culture</title><p>All animal experimental procedures were carried out using protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Konkuk University. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat pups were obtained from Samtako (Seoul, Korea). Cultured rat astrocytes were prepared as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B005">[5]</xref>. Briefly, prefrontal cortices of 2-day-old SD rat pups were dissected out and digested with trypsin for 10 min at 37&#8451;. A single cell suspension was obtained by trituration, and cells were seeded onto poly-d-lysine (20 &#956;g/mL) coated plates. Cultures were maintained in DMEM/F12 with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. Confluent cells were rinsed twice with serum-free media and then detached with 0.25% trypsin with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and subcultured by replating at low density (5,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>) in 24-well or six-well plates (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Cells reached confluence within 10 days after subculture, and 13 to 14-day-old cells were used for this study. At this point, more than 95% of cells were glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes, as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B018">[18]</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Rat primary cortical neuron culture</title><p>Cultured rat cortical neurons were prepared as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B005">[5]</xref>. Briefly, primary cortical neurons were obtained from embryonic day 18 cortex of SD rats. The cortices were mechanically triturated three times with a flame-polished Pasteur pipette in the culture medium (Eagle&#8217;s minimal essential medium supplemented with 20 mM glucose, 5% FBS, 5% horse serum, and 2 mM glutamine). The cells were seeded onto 50 &#956;g/mL poly-d-lysine-coated plate in the culture medium. The cultures were maintained at 37&#8451; in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator.</p></sec><sec><title>Drug treatment</title><p>Cells were washed twice with serum-free media and then treated with 0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/mL KRG or ginsenosides CK, Rb1, or Rg1(1, 5, or 10 &#956;M) for 24 h under serum-free conditions to prevent the contamination of casein-digesting activity from serum. After each treatment, the culture supernatants were collected and assayed for tPA/PAI-1 activity. In some cases, MAPK inhibitors (10 &#956;M) such as U0126, SB203580, SP600125, or a PI3K inhibitor LY294002 were pretreated for 30 min before KRG treatment (1.0 mg/mL). In all assay conditions used in this study, no cellular toxicity was observed, as determined by morphological examination and 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of cell viability</title><p>Cultured cortical neurons and astrocytes were treated with KRG. After 24 h, cell viability was assessed by MTT assay. MTT is a water-soluble tetrazolium salt that is reduced by metabolically viable cells to a colored, water-insoluble formazan salt. MTT (1 mg/mL) was added to the cell culture medium. After incubating the plates at 37&#8451; for 2 h in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere, the MTT-containing medium was replaced with dimethylsulfoxide. The absorbance was read at 570 nm with a microplate reader (Spectramax 190; Molecular Devices, Palo Alto, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Casein zymography</title><p>The tPA activity was determined by casein zymography as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B005">[5]</xref>. Cell lysates or culture supernatants from astrocyte or neuron culture were mixed with sample buffer (sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS]-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis [PAGE] sample buffer lacking &#946;-mercaptoethanol). Samples were resolved by electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS, casein (1 mg/mL, Sigma) and plasminogen (13 &#956;g/mL, American Diagnostica). After electrophoresis, the gel was washed twice in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min to remove excess SDS, and the caseinolytic proteins were re-natured in situ. The re-natured gel was incubated for 24 h at room temperature in reaction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6). To reveal the caseinolytic activity, the gel was stained with 0.1% Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 and destained with 20% methanol and 10% acetic acid. tPA activity was visualized as light bands resulting from casein degradation. To detect PAI-1 activity by one-phase inverse zymography, the gel was incubated with urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA, 0.5 IU/mL, American Diagnostica) for 5 h in a reaction buffer, after re-naturation of the SDS-PAGE gel by incubating the gel in 2.5% Triton X-100 solution. uPA digested the casein in the gel and PAI-1 inhibited the proteolytic action of uPA, leaving dark bands of casein at a molecular weight of 48 kDa after Coomassie blue staining. The gel pictures were taken using the LAS-3000 image detection system (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan) and were inverted for clarity.</p></sec><sec><title>Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction</title><p>The <italic>tPA</italic>, <italic>Pai-1</italic>, <italic>iNOS</italic>, <italic>Mmp9</italic>, <italic>Il6</italic>, and <italic>Gapdh</italic> mRNA expressions were determined by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

Although we did not find changes in tPA expression by KRG, there was decrease in tPA activity due to the up-regulation of PAI-1 in rat primary astrocytes, which is also recapitulated with CK. In cultured endothelial cells, total ginseng saponin and individual saponins such as ginsenoside Rg1 and Rb1 has been reported to increase the release of tPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B011">[11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B022">22]</xref>. In addition, inconsistent results were reported on the regulation of PAI-1 by ginseng saponins, which showed no changes, increased or decreased expression in endothelial or smooth muscle cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B011">[11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B015">15]</xref>. These results suggest that the regulation of tPA/PAI-1 by different preparations of ginseng or ginseng saponins is modulated in a cell type- or stimulus protocol-dependent manners.</p><p>The diverse physiological and pathological action of tPA/PAI-1 includes regulation of neurite outgrowth, activation of trophic factors, regulation of cell migration during development, regulation of synaptic plasticity, modulation of apoptosis or cell death, clearance of A&#946; peptide, too much to mention them all <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B023">[23]</xref>. Therefore, the activity of tPA/PAI-1 should be tightly regulated and astrocytes, the main CNS cell type expressing PAI-1, may fine-tune the regulation of tPA activity by modulating the level of PAI-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B005">[5]</xref>. Moreover, increased PAI-1 activity and expression might be both positively and negatively involved in the cell migration, axonal growth and cell death depending on the differential cell types and experimental conditions used. Therefore, final outcome of PAI-1 induction in astrocytes on neuronal cell survival and modulation of CNS function would be delicately modulated by differences in kinetic profile of PAI-1 and tPA activity as well as the local concentration of both molecules in the context of physiological or pathological changes in brain tissues.</p><p>In this study, KRG induced PAI-1 expression as well as other inflammatory mediators such as iNOS and MMP-9 in astrocytes. In immunologically stimulated condition such as cerebral ischemia, ginseng or ginsenosides has been reported to protect brain by anti-inflammatory action <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B024">[24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B025">25]</xref>. In our condition, along with massive PAI-1 induction, a weak induction of inflammatory mediators such as iNOS was observed. The induction of iNOS might be explained by the difference of the effects of ginseng on basal and immune-stimulated conditions. For example, red ginseng acidic polysaccharide components activated macrophage in basal status. However, it slightly but significantly inhibited LPS-induced activation of macrophage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B026">[26]</xref>. Similar to our results, treatment of Rg3 induced expression of iNOS and NO production in Raw264.7 cells as well as in vascular smooth muscle cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B027">[27]</xref>. Further studies are required to unequivocally prove the role of ginseng-induced changes in tPA/PAI-1 system in basal and immunologically challenged situation.</p><p>In this study, activation of MAPK and PI3K by KRG induced the expression of PAI-1. In our previous study, we reported the essential role of Erk1/2 in the regulation of PAI-1 by &#945;-synuclein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B028">[28]</xref>. In the present study, all three members of MAPK pathway, i.e., p38, Erk1/2 and JNK were involved in the regulation of PAI-1 induction by KRG in rat primary astrocytes. The use of crude extract of <italic>P. ginseng</italic>, which contains a variety of different components, may account for the activation of all three MAPK pathways, as well as the differential effect of specific pharmacological inhibitors such as SP600125 on PAI-1 expression and activity. The involvement of all three members of MAPK in the regulation of PAI-1 is not unprecedented. In a model system of plasminogen-induced expression of PAI-1 in rat primary astrocytes, the involvement of multiple MAPK pathways has been suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B029">[29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B030">30]</xref>. In PAR-2 activated NO production in astrocytes, all three MAPK pathways were also involved suggesting they can regulate same intracellular target proteins through either pathway alone or in combination with other members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B031">[31]</xref>. In this study, we found KRG activated PI3K pathway but there was no changes in Akt phosphorylation. Even though Akt is generally regarded as immediate downstream of PI3K pathway, the independent regulation of PI3K and Akt by KRG in this study suggests that KRG may affect the activity of other regulators of Akt activation such as mTOR2C, PDK1 and PP2A, which needs experimental verification in the future.</p><p>Although all the MAPK and PI3K inhibitors prevented PAI-1 induction by KRG, the strongest inhibition was observed with SP600125, which is a JNK inhibitor. The result might suggest the essential role of JNK in the regulation of KRG-induced PAI-1 expression. In case of plasminogen-induced upregulation of PAI-1 in astrocytes, Nakajima et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B029">[29]</xref> reported p38 and JNK but not ERK1/2 play major role in the up-regulation of PAI-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B031">[31]</xref>. In RAW264.7 cells, SP600125 efficiently inhibited red ginseng acidic polysaccharide (RGAP)-induced NO production suggesting the role of JNK activation in mediating RGAP-induced macrophage activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B026">[26]</xref>. KRG consists of various ginsenoside components including Rg1, Rb1, Rc, Rf, Re, Rb2, and Rg2, which may differentially regulate signaling pathways and PAI-1 expression. Recent reports suggested an array of different effects of individual ginsenosides on JNK activity in many cell types; i.e., no effects by Rh2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B032">[32]</xref>, inhibition by Rb1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B033">[33]</xref>, and activation by Rg3 or CK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B034">[34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B035">35]</xref>. Interestingly, we did not observe any effects of Rb1 and Rg1 on PAI-1 activity in rat primary astrocytes. Instead, CK, a metabolite of the protopanaxadiol-type saponins of <italic>P. ginseng</italic>, strongly induced PAI-1 activity as well as mRNA and protein expression, thereby down-regulating tPA activity in rat primary astrocytes. Dissection of the role of individual components of KRG on the regulation of activation of signaling pathways and PAI-1 expression may provide us more definite answer regarding the molecular mechanism of KRG-induced regulation of PAI-1 expression.</p><p>KRG and CK induced PAI-1 expression in cultured rat primary astrocytes. Although the functional significance of the elevated PAI-1 expression in astrocytes by KRG on brain function and responses to pathological insults should be experimentally investigated in the future, the results from the present study suggest that regulation of tPA/PAI-1 activity by pretreatment of KRG may position the balance of tPA/PAI-1 activity in brain in a way beneficial for the challenged situation. PAI-1 regulates overall tPA activity in brain, which may play important role in stimulus or inflammation induced neuronal cell death in ischemic or neurodegenerative condition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B036">[36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B037">37]</xref>. It is also reported that tPA activity is essential in the process of addiction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B023">[23]</xref>. Therefore, PAI-1-induced down-regulation of tPA activity by KRG may contribute to protect neuron from cell death in ischemia and traumatic brain injury as well as inhibiting manifestation of addiction to drugs of abuse. In addition, considering the essential role of tPA/PAI-1 in the regulation of endothelial permeability, the regulation of PAI-1 activity in astrocytes by KRG may play important roles in the final pathological outcome in cerebrovascular diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by a grant of the Korean Health Technology R&amp;D Project, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Republic of Korea (no.
