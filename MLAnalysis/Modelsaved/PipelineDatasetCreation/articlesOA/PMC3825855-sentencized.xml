</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Astrocytes are the most abundant type of cells in the brain, which regulate energy and ion homeostasis of extracellular milieu in central nervous system (CNS). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Astrocytes not only provide structural support in CNS but also actively involved in the proper maintenance of synaptic environment by dozens of mechanisms such as trophic support, anti oxidant defense, neurotransmitter uptake, production of proteases and protease inhibitors and modulation of extracellular matrix components [1]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and its endogenous inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is not only involved in clot dissolution in peripheral blood vessel, but also plays important role in brain such as regulation of neurite outgrowth, cell migration during development, regulation of synaptic plasticity and much more [2,3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It is also clear that the tight regulation of this enzymatic system is important because they are involved in the regulation of cellular function and pathogenesis of several CNS disorders including addiction, Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and stroke [2-4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Although most of the cells in CNS express tPA, PAI-1 is exclusively expressed in astrocytes [5] and the regulation of PAI-1 activity and expression plays important role in the modulation of overall tPA activity in brain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Considering tPA/PAI-1 may play both protective and destructive role in cellular function as well as cell survival, it is very important to understand the regulatory mechanism of tPA/PAI-1 in brain, which may provide better way to control a myriad of neurological processes ranging from cellular differentiation and synaptic plasticity to neuronal death and regeneration. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Studies using endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells suggested that ginseng or ginsenosides may affect tPA and PAI-1 activity and expression in a variety of different ways [11-16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the effects of KRG on tPA/PAI-1 system in rat primary neuron and astrocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The results show that KRG and ginsenoside compound K (CK) up-regulates PAI-1 in astrocytes thereby down-regulate tPA activity in rat primary astrocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The regulation of tPA/PAI-1 activity by KRG and CK may contribute to the KRG’s effects on various CNS conditions and diseases. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Although there are mixed reports on the role of individual components from ginseng in tPA system in endothelial or peripheral tissues [11,14,15,21,22], this is the first report describing the effects of KRG on tPA/PAI-1 system in neuron and astrocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Although we did not find changes in tPA expression by KRG, there was decrease in tPA activity due to the up-regulation of PAI-1 in rat primary astrocytes, which is also recapitulated with CK. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>In cultured endothelial cells, total ginseng saponin and individual saponins such as ginsenoside Rg1 and Rb1 has been reported to increase the release of tPA [11,22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>In addition, inconsistent results were reported on the regulation of PAI-1 by ginseng saponins, which showed no changes, increased or decreased expression in endothelial or smooth muscle cells [11,14,15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the regulation of tPA/PAI-1 by different preparations of ginseng or ginseng saponins is modulated in a cell type- or stimulus protocol-dependent manners. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>The diverse physiological and pathological action of tPA/PAI-1 includes regulation of neurite outgrowth, activation of trophic factors, regulation of cell migration during development, regulation of synaptic plasticity, modulation of apoptosis or cell death, clearance of Aβ peptide, too much to mention them all [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the activity of tPA/PAI-1 should be tightly regulated and astrocytes, the main CNS cell type expressing PAI-1, may fine-tune the regulation of tPA activity by modulating the level of PAI-1 [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Moreover, increased PAI-1 activity and expression might be both positively and negatively involved in the cell migration, axonal growth and cell death depending on the differential cell types and experimental conditions used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Therefore, final outcome of PAI-1 induction in astrocytes on neuronal cell survival and modulation of CNS function would be delicately modulated by differences in kinetic profile of PAI-1 and tPA activity as well as the local concentration of both molecules in the context of physiological or pathological changes in brain tissues. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>In this study, KRG induced PAI-1 expression as well as other inflammatory mediators such as iNOS and MMP-9 in astrocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>In immunologically stimulated condition such as cerebral ischemia, ginseng or ginsenosides has been reported to protect brain by anti-inflammatory action [24,25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>In our condition, along with massive PAI-1 induction, a weak induction of inflammatory mediators such as iNOS was observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>The induction of iNOS might be explained by the difference of the effects of ginseng on basal and immune-stimulated conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>For example, red ginseng acidic polysaccharide components activated macrophage in basal status. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>However, it slightly but significantly inhibited LPS-induced activation of macrophage [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Similar to our results, treatment of Rg3 induced expression of iNOS and NO production in Raw264.7 cells as well as in vascular smooth muscle cells [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to unequivocally prove the role of ginseng-induced changes in tPA/PAI-1 system in basal and immunologically challenged situation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>In this study, activation of MAPK and PI3K by KRG induced the expression of PAI-1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>In our previous study, we reported the essential role of Erk1/2 in the regulation of PAI-1 by α-synuclein [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>In the present study, all three members of MAPK pathway, i.e., p38, Erk1/2 and JNK were involved in the regulation of PAI-1 induction by KRG in rat primary astrocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>The use of crude extract of P. ginseng, which contains a variety of different components, may account for the activation of all three MAPK pathways, as well as the differential effect of specific pharmacological inhibitors such as SP600125 on PAI-1 expression and activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>The involvement of all three members of MAPK in the regulation of PAI-1 is not unprecedented. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>In a model system of plasminogen-induced expression of PAI-1 in rat primary astrocytes, the involvement of multiple MAPK pathways has been suggested [29,30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>In PAR-2 activated NO production in astrocytes, all three MAPK pathways were also involved suggesting they can regulate same intracellular target proteins through either pathway alone or in combination with other members [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>In this study, we found KRG activated PI3K pathway but there was no changes in Akt phosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Even though Akt is generally regarded as immediate downstream of PI3K pathway, the independent regulation of PI3K and Akt by KRG in this study suggests that KRG may affect the activity of other regulators of Akt activation such as mTOR2C, PDK1 and PP2A, which needs experimental verification in the future. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Although all the MAPK and PI3K inhibitors prevented PAI-1 induction by KRG, the strongest inhibition was observed with SP600125, which is a JNK inhibitor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>The result might suggest the essential role of JNK in the regulation of KRG-induced PAI-1 expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>In case of plasminogen-induced upregulation of PAI-1 in astrocytes, Nakajima et al. [29] reported p38 and JNK but not ERK1/2 play major role in the up-regulation of PAI-1 [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>In RAW264.7 cells, SP600125 efficiently inhibited red ginseng acidic polysaccharide (RGAP)-induced NO production suggesting the role of JNK activation in mediating RGAP-induced macrophage activation [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>KRG consists of various ginsenoside components including Rg1, Rb1, Rc, Rf, Re, Rb2, and Rg2, which may differentially regulate signaling pathways and PAI-1 expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Recent reports suggested an array of different effects of individual ginsenosides on JNK activity in many cell types; i.e., no effects by Rh2 [32], inhibition by Rb1 [33], and activation by Rg3 or CK [34,35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we did not observe any effects of Rb1 and Rg1 on PAI-1 activity in rat primary astrocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Instead, CK, a metabolite of the protopanaxadiol-type saponins of P. ginseng, strongly induced PAI-1 activity as well as mRNA and protein expression, thereby down-regulating tPA activity in rat primary astrocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Dissection of the role of individual components of KRG on the regulation of activation of signaling pathways and PAI-1 expression may provide us more definite answer regarding the molecular mechanism of KRG-induced regulation of PAI-1 expression. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>KRG and CK induced PAI-1 expression in cultured rat primary astrocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Although the functional significance of the elevated PAI-1 expression in astrocytes by KRG on brain function and responses to pathological insults should be experimentally investigated in the future, the results from the present study suggest that regulation of tPA/PAI-1 activity by pretreatment of KRG may position the balance of tPA/PAI-1 activity in brain in a way beneficial for the challenged situation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>PAI-1 regulates overall tPA activity in brain, which may play important role in stimulus or inflammation induced neuronal cell death in ischemic or neurodegenerative condition [36,37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>It is also reported that tPA activity is essential in the process of addiction [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Therefore, PAI-1-induced down-regulation of tPA activity by KRG may contribute to protect neuron from cell death in ischemia and traumatic brain injury as well as inhibiting manifestation of addiction to drugs of abuse. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>In addition, considering the essential role of tPA/PAI-1 in the regulation of endothelial permeability, the regulation of PAI-1 activity in astrocytes by KRG may play important roles in the final pathological outcome in cerebrovascular diseases. </plain></SENT>
