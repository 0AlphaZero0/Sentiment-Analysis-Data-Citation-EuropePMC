<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In patients with end stage renal failure on dialysis, the plasma concentration of β2m therefore rises from the normal 1–2 mg/liter to persistently raised values of ∼ 50–70 mg/liter, leading to the serious and intractable condition of dialysis-related amyloidosis with β2m amyloid fibrils deposited in bones and joints, causing painful arthropathy, bone cysts, pathological fractures, and rarely visceral β2m amyloid deposits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The normal structure and function of β2m are well characterized, and although wild type β2m is poorly amyloidogenic in vitro, its fibrillogenesis and its tissue-specific deposition have been intensively investigated (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Despite much progress, there is neither general agreement about the underlying molecular mechanisms nor an understanding of the forces involved in vivo during the destabilization and subsequent amyloid aggregation of either β2m or any of the other natively folded globular proteins that form amyloid fibrils in disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>We lately reported (2) the first naturally occurring structural variant of β2m, D76N, discovered in members of a French family who developed progressive bowel dysfunction with extensive visceral β2m amyloid deposits despite normal renal function and normal circulating β2m concentrations and with none of the osteoarticular deposits characteristic of dialysis-related amyloidosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Here we elucidate in detail the biophysical parameters of amyloid fibrillogenesis by this uniquely tractable protein and develop a paradigm that could be applicable generally to the in vivo pathophysiology of amyloidogenesis by the whole range of globular proteins that cause clinically significant systemic amyloidosis. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>β2m is among the most extensively studied globular protein precursors of human amyloid fibrils. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>The discovery of the first natural variant of human β2m as the cause of hereditary systemic amyloidosis uniquely enables a very informative comparison of two different types of β2m amyloidosis with distinctly different clinical and pathological features. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>The D76N residue substitution allows a fully folded three-dimensional structure almost identical to that of the wild type protein that forms amyloid fibrils in dialysis-related amyloidosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>However, dissection of the mechanism of D76N β2m fibrillogenesis confirmed our previously established paradigm that the amyloidogenicity of monomeric globular proteins is intimately connected to destabilization of the native fold (64). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Importantly, a specific intermediate of the folding pathway of wild type β2m, which was previously structurally characterized and shown to play a crucial role in priming the amyloid transition (47), is particularly abundantly populated by the D76N variant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>It is therefore possible that this specific residue substitution facilitates the molecular mechanism responsible for the inherent amyloidogenicity of wild type β2m and thereby enables the variant to cause clinical pathology even at a normal plasma concentration rather than the grossly increased abundance of wild type β2m responsible for dialysis-related amyloidosis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Our elucidation of the structural properties and folding dynamics of the highly amyloidogenic D76N variant has validated several earlier interpretations of the molecular basis of the amyloid transition of the wild type β2m. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>The characterization of conditions for rapid fibrillogenesis of the variant in a physiological milieu is therefore particularly significant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>D76N β2m forms amyloid fibrils within a few hours in physiological buffers in vitro that is enhanced by fluid agitation and exposure to a hydrophobic surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>In contrast, fibrillogenesis of wild type β2m is extremely slow under physiological conditions, being minimal or absent after 100 days of incubation (61). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Fluid agitation has been shown previously to be crucial in priming amyloid fibrillogenesis of other polypeptides including amyloid β (31), insulin (65), apolipoprotein C-II (66), and α-synuclein (67), but all these precursors were either natively unfolded (apolipoprotein-CII, amyloid β, and α-synuclein) or induced to unfold by a denaturing buffer (insulin). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>Our present demonstration that the interfacial forces, acting in a physiologically relevant fluid flowing over natural hydrophobic surfaces, can prime fibrillar conversion of D76N β2m monomers identifies this protein as a genuine paradigm for amyloidogenic globular proteins causing systemic amyloidosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>Although critically destabilized by comparison with the wild type protein, it nevertheless folds in the wild type native conformation and evades intracellular quality control so that it is secreted at a physiological rate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, when, like all globular proteins, its stability is challenged by the physiological extracellular environment (51), the variant's propensity to misfold and aggregate as amyloid fibrils becomes evident. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>Within the extracellular space where amyloid is deposited in the systemic amyloidoses, the interstitial fluid flows over the extensive surfaces of the fibrous network of elastin, collagen, and leucine-rich proteoglycans (68), the high hydrophobicities of which play a key role in promoting local unfolding of globular proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported the capacity of collagen to prime the formation of wild type β2m amyloid fibrils stacked on the collagen surface, and here we show that elastin is a potent promoter of massive amyloid conversion of the D76N variant in solution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>Massive enhancement by graphite nanotubes of variant β2m amyloid fibrillogenesis further confirms the role of hydrophobic surfaces. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>Although Linse et al. (69) have previously noted an effect of hydrophobic surfaces on fibrillization of wild type β2m with accelerated nucleation induced by nanoparticles covering a range of sizes and hydrophobicity patterns, their experiments were done at the grossly non-physiological pH of 2.5. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>The kinetics of fibril formation by wild type β2m and its truncated form ΔN6 β2m depend on a critical nucleation step and can be accelerated by the presence of amyloid fibril seeds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>In particular, the truncated form ΔN6 β2m can catalyze the oligomerization of the wild type (70) and even prime the fibrillogenesis of the wild type protein in physiological buffer (61) although with a slower rate and lower yield than when primed by D76N β2m. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>The D76N variant is also much more potent than ΔN6 β2m in promoting formation of actual amyloid fibrils by wild type β2m. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>The apparent capacity of monomeric ΔN6 β2m to induce conformational rearrangement of the wild type protein structure has previously been ascribed to a prion-like effect (71). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>In our hands, however, monomeric D76N variant and ΔN6 β2m do not prime fibrillogenesis by wild type β2m, which only occurs when it is exposed to filaments and fibrils of the priming species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>Such a mechanism is more consistent with a surface nucleation process (72) rather than a genuine prion-like effect. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>The contrast between the potent in vitro priming and enhancement by D76N β2m of amyloid fibril formation by wild type β2m and the proteomic evidence that the wild type protein is not present in the in vivo amyloid deposits are intriguing, especially as wild type β2m clearly does form amyloid in vivo in dialysis-related amyloidosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in other types of hereditary systemic amyloidosis in which the wild type precursor protein is mildly amyloidogenic, for example transthyretin, most patients are heterozygotes for the causative mutation, expressing both amyloidogenic variant and wild type, and both proteins are present in the amyloid fibrils. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>However, as we have shown here, the capacity of D76N β2m to catalyze fibrillogenesis by wild type β2m can be modulated and even blocked by typical chaperones such as crystallin, and this inhibition depends on the stoichiometric chaperone/β2m ratio. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>A role for extracellular chaperone-like proteins in the inhibition of wild type β2m amyloidogenesis has been proposed previously (73), and it is plausible that the persistent, extremely high concentration of wild type β2m in renal failure patients on dialysis may overcome the natural protective role of physiological chaperones that otherwise protect against deposition of this rather weakly amyloidogenic protein when it circulates at its normal serum concentration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>In addition to illuminating the critically important biophysical features of the physiological milieu where amyloid formation takes place, our results thus open up novel avenues for exploration of hitherto unanswered questions about amyloidosis: why only a handful of all proteins ever form amyloid in vivo, and when, why, and where amyloid is deposited in disease. </plain></SENT>
