</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The understanding of the wide range of physical activity (PA) and total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) levels in different populations has been of utmost concern in epidemiological research, because of its relationship with health in general [1], and the metabolic syndrome (MetS)—a cluster of interrelated cardiovascular disease risk factors characterized by glucose intolerance, hypertension, dyslipidemia and obesity—in particular [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The definition of MetS, and its associated empirical cut-off points of different markers are controversial issues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the mechanisms underlying MetS pathophysiology are extremely complex, as it is both genetically and environmentally driven [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In the recent Takahata study [4], the results showed that total energy expenditure was, on average, lower among those individuals with the clustering of MetS risk factors, regardless of body mass index status. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Also, it has been suggested that moderate-to-high PA levels have a preventive effect on the development of MetS [5], [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Further, recent data suggest that distinct PA frequencies and intensities may produce different effects in MetS expression, as a study has showed that everyday activities such as walking and cycling yielded minor effects on MetS whereas high intensity activities performed for more than two hours per week were associated with a lower prevalence of MetS [7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Phenotypic variation in different MetS indicators at the population level has been studied using different approaches [8], [9], and new efforts have been employed to disentangle the highly complex architecture of their genetic foundations [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>One aspect that remains to be addressed is the understanding of the differential effects of TDEE and PA on MetS traits via a possible interaction with genetic factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>This possibility was eloquently postulated by Booth and Lee [11] in a revision of Arthur Beaudets concept of environmental-gene interaction [12] in which each “individual has their own array of disease susceptibility genes that will interact with physical inactivity to produce maladaptive changes in gene-expression that often passes a clinical threshold into a chronic disease phenotype” (pg. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>148). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Data supporting this evidence in humans is scarce. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Recently, in a 2004 statement by NIH [13] it was indicated that a previously identified type 2 diabetes (T2D) predisposing polymorphism [14] would only express itself concurrently with uncertain genetic susceptibility factors, alongside environmental factors such as PA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In a study on rats, the results showed that after 11 generations of controlled selection in which high aerobic capacity animals were mated, those with high aerobic capacity had 12% lower mean 24 h blood pressure, 16% lower fasting blood glucose, 56% lower fasting plasma insulin, and 63% lower plasma triglycerides ad those with low aerobic capacity [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The logical inference was that genetically determined aerobic capacity is related to MetS traits [16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Contemporary technological advances and new statistical models allow geneticists to study EE and PA and its impact on phenotypic variance in different MetS traits using an escalating wealth of complex genetic models [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>These developments permit the estimation of complex MetS traits using family data exploiting the elegant flexibility of maximum likelihood estimation techniques [see Elston and colleagues [17]]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>These statistical techniques, mostly based on variance components (VC) models, provide a robust framework for statistical inference, which includes parameter and model-likelihood estimation, and associated likelihood ratio testing procedures [18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Under the VC model approach, we can formally test for genotype x environment (GxE) interaction [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Very briefly, this interaction arises when a genotype yields distinct phenotypic expressions under contrasting environments [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Here we hypothesize that genotype x EE (GxEE) interaction is a potent determinant of variation in MetS traits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>This possibility deserves further consideration, because it can inform the discussion around the preventive and systematic protective effects of EE and PA on MetS traits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>For example, in the Nurses Health Study, it was concluded that PA interacts with T2D susceptibility, because among the women whose parents had T2D, a 65% greater risk of developing T2D was found for those who were on the lower quintile of PA level when compared to those in the higher quintile. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, among the daughters of non-diabetic parents, being in the lower quintile of PA was associated with twice the risk of developing diabetes than being in the most active quintile. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The main purposes of the present study, using a nuclear family design, are to estimate the magnitude of genetic factors responsible for the architecture of MetS traits, and to study potential GxEE interaction. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Heritability estimates (h2) were computed using a maximum likelihood approach to estimate variance components under the standard polygenic model as implemented in SOLAR v.4.3.1 software [26]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>To test for GxEE interaction, basic initial hypotheses were formulated regarding the variance/covariance relationship of a MetS indicator between family members with different levels of TDEE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>As regards GxEE interaction, the fundamental null hypothesis is that the expression of a polygenotype (i.e., aggregate of all genotypes related to the expression of a phenotype) is independent of TDEE level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>It can be shown from first principles that if there is no GxEE interaction, the same MetS indicator measured in subjects with different levels of TDEE will have a genetic correlation of 1.0 and the genetic variance will be homogeneous across all levels of TDEE [18], [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, if GxEE interaction is present, the genetic correlation will be significantly less than 1.0 and/or the genetic variance will not be the same among all levels of TDEE. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>The foregoing requires that we model the variance and correlation as functions of TDEE levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>For the genetic variance function (and similarly for the environmental variance function), we modeled the variance using an exponential function to ensure positivity, which is required since any variance is a squared term [18], [29]: , where  and  are parameters to be estimated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>An additional justification for the exponential function is suggested by the alternative name of this approach, namely the log-linear model of the variance: . </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>That is, on taking the natural logarithm of the variance modeled as an exponential function, we have the equation of a line. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>In this form, the variance homogeneity null hypothesis obviously holds for a slope-term equal to 0: . </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>For the genetic correlation function, we modeled the genetic correlation as an exponential decay function of the pairwise differences in TDEE levels: , where  is a parameter to be estimated as a function of the difference in TDEE levels between any two individuals i and j. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Here we also have an elegant reexpression of the interaction null hypothesis, in this case regarding the genetic correlation, in that a genetic correlation equal to 1 is equivalent to . </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Prior to examination of these hypotheses, however, we first confirmed if the overall GxEE interaction model provided a better fit to the data than the standard so-called polygenic model. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>The present report aimed to assess the genetic variance present in MetS traits as well as to examine potential GxPA interaction that has an effect on MetS traits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Our results confirm the importance of genetics on MetS traits with all h2 being significant and, more interestingly, highlight the importance of GxEE interaction in the phenotypic determination of MetS traits. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to apply a GxE interaction analysis to better understand the differential relationship between TDEE and PA with MetS risk factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>A GxE interaction effect is present when the phenotypic expressions of an environmental factor or behavior is conditional to the genotype of an individual. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>This study provides evidence that there is a genetic basis for the variability in quantitative measures of the metabolic syndrome that is mediated by energy expenditure and/or physical activity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>The present findings confirm that MetS traits are highly heritable in agreement with previous results [31], [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>HDL (h2 = 0.59) was the most heritable of the MetS traits which is consistent with results from elsewhere ranging from 0.46 in Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS), and 0.63 from the Family Heart Study (FHS) population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, TG (h2 = 0.21), in disagreement with the data from TLGS (h2 = 0.36) and FHS (h2 = 0.48) [31], [33], was the least heritable trait. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>These differences could be attributable to distinct genetic architectures, namely gene frequencies and their value, as well as distinct environmental factors specific to each population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Also, distinct analysis strategies (e.g., Tang and colleagues [31]) made adjustments for a set of confounders that were not used in the present report], and different sample sizes might explain some of the variability in the TG heritability estimates. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>It is well established that PA has a preventive effect on a variety of morbidities associated with cardiovascular diseases [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>For instance, studies on familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) in Utah families seem to demonstrate this very point. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>While FH, which leads to early-onset coronary heart disease, is caused by mutations in the LDL-receptor gene (LDLR), it was shown that heterozygous carriers of the LDLR mutation lived into their eighth and ninth decades in the 19th century but their descendants in the 20th century, who were also heterozygous carriers, lived only into their third and fourth decades [34], [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>These investigators documented that the carriers who lived in the 19th century were relatively more physically active and enjoyed a more nutritious diet than the carriers who lived in the 20th century. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>However, it has been shown that there is a considerable heterogeneity in the response to PA leading to distinct signals in terms of cardiovascular risk factors [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>For example, in the HERITAGE Family Study, after 20 weeks of supervised training sessions, a significant mean 3.6% increase in plasma HDL was observed together with a high inter-variability in responsiveness to training, ranging from a mean 9.3% decrease in Quartile 1 of HDL-C response to a mean 18% increase in Quartile 4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the authors verified that only 15.5% of the variability was due to baseline variables and training adaptations, concluding that only a minor extent of the adaptation could be predictable by nongenetic factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>This complex and controversial theme has been addressed in a recent paper by Bouchard et al. [37] in which some participants, when exposed to regular exercise, ended up having worsened metabolic profiles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>The preceding raises questions related to the importance of genetic susceptibility in explaining the variability in the response to similar levels of PA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that there is additive genetic variance heterogeneity for GLU, TC, TG, and WC across TDEE levels, and that for WC and GLU, the genetic correlation between distinct levels of TDEE was different from 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>These results may be related to work demonstrating that physical activity and inactivity have anti- and pro-inflammatory effects, respectively [38], [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>It is widely believed that the MetS and MetS-associated diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), are caused in a large part by chronic sub-clinical inflammation [40], [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>That we observed increasing additive genetic variance heterogeneity for GLU, TC, TG, and WC with increasing TDEE levels is consistent with upregulation in the genes involved in anti-inflammatory processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Recent work [42] showed significant SNP–moderate to vigorous PA interactions on BMI-for-age Z-scores in European-American at GNPDA2 and FTO genes, and in Hispanic-American at LZTR2/SEC16B. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>In 2011, a robust meta-analysis of 218,166 adults and 19,268 children found that, in adults, PA attenuated the effect (p-value for interaction  =  0.001) of the minor (A2) allele of rs9939609 on obesity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Even though this interaction failed to be statistically significant in children and adolescents, in adults the minor allele of rs9939609 increased the odds of being obese less in the physically active group (odds ratio  =  1.22/allele, 95% CI 1.19–1.25) than in the inactive group (odds ratio  =  1.30/allele, 95% CI 1.24–1.36). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>These results seem to suggest that there are genes associated with increased MetS risk factors, such as obesity, that actually interact with different EE levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Further, that we observed a genetic correlation function different from 1 across TDEE differences is consistent with the activation of genes involved in pro- and anti-inflammatory processes at relatively low and high PA levels, respectively [43]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>We speculate that potential epigenetic changes driven by EE might be linked to a major epigenetic modification - DNA methylation - that suppresses gene expression by modulating the access of the transcription machinery to the chromatin or by recruiting methyl binding proteins [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>In a recent paper by Barrés et al. [45] global methylation values decreased after intense exercise, even after controlling for the effect of hemoglobin mRNA content. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>More specifically, the results highlighted that captured methylated promoters for metabolic genes, previously linked to type 2 diabetes [46], were lower after acute exercise, leading the authors to suggest that acute exercise induces gene-specific DNA hypomethylation in human skeletal muscle [45]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>As mentioned earlier we were unable to find similar papers to which we could compare our results and assess the suitability of our interpretations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>It is quite interesting that despite the great wealth of data on PA and MetS, be it from descriptive and/or interactions studies, results are still lacking on the complex and divergent effects of PA on MetS traits given individualś genotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Perhaps this may be due to the complex nature of MetS, the statistical challenges that GxE interaction poses, and the necessity of having large samples of families. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Moreover, with the development of DNA sequence analysis, and the possibility of running genome wide associations scans (GWAs), many investigators have devoted their attention to finding specific loci associated with the phenotypic variability of MetS traits [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>We feel as though it is extremely important to be able to merge the new evidence that are now being brought to life by GWAs with the results that are shown in this report and that consubstantiate that there is an underlying effect of genetic susceptibility in phenotypic expression of MetS traits. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Notwithstanding the importance of the present results, the fact that this study is based on a free health check-up, that may not be representative of the general Portuguese population, is a limitation as well as the relatively young and healthy sample of families may limit the generalizability of the results to older individuals who are more prone to develop MetS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Also, the lack of information about resting metabolic rate may influence the PAEE results, although previous work [46], [48] with this 3-day diary never considered this possibility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Another limitation is related to a lack of information on nutritional habits, although this information is never easy to evaluate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>However, the large sample size, the reliance on continuous data for MetS traits, the use of state of the art statistical procedures and the novelty of the analysis in TDEE and PA genetic epidemiology research, are strengths of the present study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present results demonstrate that MetS trait expression is significantly influenced by the way in which the genotype “deals” with distinct TDEE levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>As such, PA may be considered an environmental variable that promotes metabolic differences between individuals that are distinctively active. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>This is valuable information for health practitioners. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>More efforts should be devoted to identify specific loci that control MetS traits and to test if those loci are regulated or not by TDEE and/or PA. </plain></SENT>
