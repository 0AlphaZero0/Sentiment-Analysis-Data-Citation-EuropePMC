To test this hypothesis, a case-control study including 539 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases and 627 cancer-free controls was conducted.

Additionally, this association was stronger among adenocarcinoma cases (AA vs. GG: OR&#8202;=&#8202;1.67, 95% CI&#8202;=&#8202;1.12&#8211;2.50, <italic>P</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;0.013; A vs. G: OR&#8202;=&#8202;1.28, 95% CI&#8202;=&#8202;1.05&#8211;1.57, <italic>P</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;0.016). In the meta-analysis, a borderline significant association between the rs2736098 polymorphism and overall cancer risk was observed (AA vs. GG: OR&#8202;=&#8202;1.25, 95% CI&#8202;=&#8202;1.07&#8211;1.46; AA vs. AG+GG: OR&#8202;=&#8202;1.22, 95% CI&#8202;=&#8202;1.06&#8211;1.41; additive model: OR&#8202;=&#8202;1.10, 95% CI&#8202;=&#8202;1.02&#8211;1.18), and further stratifications demonstrated a moderately increased risk for lung and bladder cancer, Asian ethnicity and hospital-based studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results suggest that the rs2736098 polymorphism may contribute to the risk of lung cancer, especially adenocarcinoma, in the Chinese population. In addition, the current meta-analysis indicates that this genetic variant is only weakly associated with overall cancer risk.

The geographical and temporal patterns of lung cancer incidence are largely determined by tobacco consumption. Lung cancer rates are increasing in countries such as China and several other countries in Asia and Africa, where the smoking prevalence continues to either increase or show signs of stability <xref rid="pone.0076372-Jemal1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Approximately 80% of the 1.3 billion current smokers worldwide live in low- and middle-income countries, with over 300 million in China alone <xref rid="pone.0076372-Brawley1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which includes two main histological types, squamous cell carcinoma (SQC) and adenocarcinoma (ADC), accounts for nearly 85% of all lung cancer cases. Despite considerable therapeutic progress, the prognosis of NSCLC patients remains poor <xref rid="pone.0076372-Ramalingam1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>The development of lung cancer appears to be the result of a complex interaction between environmental exposures and genetic factors. Recently, independent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) <xref rid="pone.0076372-McKay1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0076372-Amos1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> have demonstrated that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in three separate chromosomal regions (5p15, 6p21, and 15q25), which contain genes that regulate nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and telomerase production, are significantly associated with lung cancer risk. 5p15.33, a crucial genomic region for telomere biology, contains two well-known genes: telomerase reverse transcriptase (<italic>TERT</italic>) and cleft lip and palate trans-membrane 1-like (<italic>CLPTM1L</italic>). TERT protein is the telomerase catalytic subunit that elongates telomeres and serves as a key regulator of telomerase activity. Telomeres, consisting of TTAGGG repeats that undergo shortening with each cell replication cycle, have long been known to be essential for the preservation of chromosomal integrity <xref rid="pone.0076372-Calado1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. As telomerase and the control of telomere length are intimately linked to the development of many tumor types, scientific attention has focused on the possibility of targeting telomerase and telomere-binding proteins in therapeutic strategies against cancer <xref rid="pone.0076372-Harley1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076372-Martnez1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Recently, it has been reported that genetic variants at the 5p15.33 locus, which contains the <italic>TERT</italic> gene (encoding the catalytic subunit of telomerase), are involved in the susceptibility of many tumor types <xref rid="pone.0076372-Mocellin1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076372-Baird1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>A common genetic variant, <italic>TERT</italic> rs2736098, which is located on chromosome 5p15.33, was recently identified as a susceptibility locus for lung cancer in a combined analysis of Icelandic and European sample sets <xref rid="pone.0076372-Rafnar1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. More recently, a Korean population study of 720 lung cancer patients and 720 healthy controls revealed that the <italic>TERT</italic> A variant genotype is associated with a significantly increased risk of lung cancer <xref rid="pone.0076372-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Given the relevance of this genomic region (5p15.33) to tumor biology and the need to verify these associations in diverse populations with different ancestries, we hypothesized that the risk genetic variant (rs2736098) identified by previous studies of Caucasian and Korean populations may potentially influence the susceptibility to lung cancer in the Chinese Han population. To test this hypothesis, we genotyped the SNP rs2736098 and analyzed its association with the risk of lung cancer in a case&#8211;control study of 539 NSCLC cases and 627 cancer-free controls matched by age and gender in a Chinese Han population.</p><p>Furthermore, many studies have investigated the role of this polymorphism in the etiology of cancer of various organs, including the bladder, liver, and breast <xref rid="pone.0076372-Savage1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0076372-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. However, the results of related published case-control studies remain conflicting rather than conclusive. Therefore, to further explore the association between the <italic>TERT</italic> rs2736098 polymorphism and cancer risk, a meta-analysis based on previously published studies and our case-control study was also performed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Case-control study</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>Study population</title><p>To exclude the possible effects of ethnicity, all subjects in this study were genetically unrelated ethnic Han Chinese.

Of these NSCLC patients, 293 patients had adenocarcinomas (ADC) and 246 had squamous cell carcinomas (SQC). Meanwhile, 627 cancer-free controls were selected from the same hospital and were frequency-matched to cases by age and sex. Subjects who were relatives or had histories of malignancy and other major diseases were excluded from this study. In addition, a structured questionnaire was completed for each case and control by a trained interviewer to collect demographic data and other relevant information, including age, sex, and smoking status. Those individuals who smoked &lt;1 cigarette per day and for &lt;1 year were defined as nonsmokers; otherwise, the patients were considered smokers.

Furthermore, to derive a more precise estimation of the association between this polymorphism and cancer risk, a meta-analysis based on previously published studies and our case-control study was also performed. Our multivariate logistic regression model demonstrated that individuals carrying the A allele or AA genotype exhibited a significantly elevated risk of NSCLC compared with those carrying the G allele or GG genotypes after adjusting for age, gender and smoking status. In the subgroup analysis by histological type, increased cancer risk was observed in adenocarcinomas but not squamous cell carcinomas under the homozygote comparison and the additive genetic model. In addition, the <italic>TERT</italic> rs2736098 variant A allele showed a marginally significant association with overall cancer risk.</p><p>The <italic>TERT</italic> rs2736098 polymorphism is mapped to a region of chromosome 5p15.33. The chromosome 5p15.33 locus contains two well-known genes, telomerase reverse transcriptase (<italic>TERT</italic>) and cleft lip and palate trans-membrane 1-like (<italic>CLPTM1L</italic>), which have been implicated in carcinogenesis. Telomerase is expressed in most tumors from virtually all types of cancers, including those of the lung. Telomerase is a relatively specific cancer target, as normal body cells express little or no telomerase for most of their lifespan <xref rid="pone.0076372-Harley1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Telomere dysfunction in tumor initiation accounts for many aspects of chromosomal instability in human cancers <xref rid="pone.0076372-Feldser1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Cancer cells have been shown to depend on two telomere maintenance mechanisms to gain unlimited proliferation capacity. Generally, telomerase activity is the main mechanism for telomere maintenance. However, 10%&#8211;20% of human tumors activate alternative mechanisms of telomere lengthening <xref rid="pone.0076372-Gnes1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The gain at chromosomal region 5p15.33, containing <italic>TERT</italic>, is one of the most frequent genetic events in early stages of non-small-cell lung cancer <xref rid="pone.0076372-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Moreover, it has been reported that telomere length may be associated with the risk of lung cancer <xref rid="pone.0076372-Lan1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0076372-Jang1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Little is known about the underlying biological mechanism or functional significance of this polymorphism. Although rs2736098 is a synonymous polymorphism, this <italic>TERT</italic> SNP has been shown to be associated with telomere length <xref rid="pone.0076372-Rafnar1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>Many studies have investigated the role of this polymorphism in the etiology of cancer of various organs, including the bladder, liver, and breast, among others. However, the results of related published case-control studies remain inconsistent <xref rid="pone.0076372-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0076372-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.For example, Zhang et al. <xref rid="pone.0076372-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> found that the rs2736098 [A] allele&#8196;contributed significantly to HCC&#8196;risk. However, Ding et al. <xref rid="pone.0076372-Ding1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> detected no association between the <italic>TERT</italic> rs2736098 polymorphism at 5p15.33 and the risk of HCC. In two population-based case-control studies conducted separately among non-Hispanic whites (NHW) and Asian populations, the <italic>TERT</italic> rs2736098 polymorphism exhibited a significant association with bladder cancer risk among non-Hispanic whites. However, an association of similar magnitude was not observed in the Asian population <xref rid="pone.0076372-GagoDominguez1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In a Polish study of 1,995 breast cancer cases and 2,296 controls, Savage et al. <xref rid="pone.0076372-Savage1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> found no evidence that the <italic>TERT</italic> rs2736098 polymorphism at 5p15.33 was associated with breast cancer risk. However, in stratified analysis, this variant exhibited evidence of being associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer among individuals with a family history of breast cancer. Although it is difficult to explain the controversial results in these studies, different genetic backgrounds, cancer types and study designs may contribute to the discrepancies. Interestingly, our case-control study demonstrated that the AA homozygote in <italic>TERT</italic> rs2736098 exhibited a significantly increased risk of developing NSCLC (OR&#8202;=&#8202;1.48, 95% CI&#8202;=&#8202;1.05&#8211;2.09, <italic>P</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;0.025), especially adenocarcinoma (OR&#8202;=&#8202;1.67, 95% CI&#8202;=&#8202;1.12&#8211;2.50, <italic>P</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;0.013), compared with those who carry the GG genotype. The homozygous AA alleles may be correlated with increased lung adenocarcinoma susceptibility. The results of our case-control study support 5p15.33 (<italic>TERT-CLPTM1L</italic>) as a susceptibility region for lung cancer in the Chinese population <xref rid="pone.0076372-Hsiung1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076372-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. More recently, a Chinese female population study of 501 cancer cases and 576 cancer-free controls also found that the variant allele of rs2736098 was significantly associated with an increased risk of lung cancer, especially in lung adenocarcinomas <xref rid="pone.0076372-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Although the underlying biological mechanisms remain largely unknown, differential expression of <italic>TERT</italic> has been observed between adenocarcinoma and other histological carcinomas of lung cancer <xref rid="pone.0076372-Lantuejoul1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0076372-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.</p><p>In the current meta-analysis, a borderline significant association between this polymorphism and cancer risk was observed in the overall analysis, with obvious between-study heterogeneity. However, when stratified by tumor sites, the subgroups of lung cancer and bladder cancer failed to exhibit heterogeneity, suggesting that different tumor sites might be a potential source of heterogeneity. Similarly, after stratifying by ethnicity, heterogeneity was largely reduced in both Asian and European populations, suggesting that ethnicity could partly explain the heterogeneity. Therefore, it may be presumed that the heterogeneity exists mainly owing to differences of ethnicity and tumor types. Furthermore, in the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, we found that individuals carrying the A allele or AA and AA/AG genotypes of the <italic>TERT</italic> rs2736098 polymorphism were more likely to exhibit an increased cancer risk among Asians but not among Europeans, possibly because of the differences in genetic backgrounds among different populations. Another plausible hypothesis suggests that the <italic>TERT</italic> rs2736098 polymorphism, a synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism, is only a marker SNP of other functional variants in <italic>TERT</italic> or other nearby genes. However, this hypothesis remains to be tested. In addition, different study designs and inadequate adjustments for confounding factors might explain, to some extent, the inconsistent results in different cancer types and different populations. The evaluation of heterogeneity, influence analysis, and publication bias confirmed the reliability of the meta-analysis.</p><p>Some limitations should be addressed in interpreting the results of our case-control study and meta-analysis. First, the sample size of our case-control study was relatively small. Therefore, well-designed population-based studies with large sample sizes and detailed exposure information are needed to further confirm our findings. Additionally, the meta-analysis was based on unadjusted estimates. A more precise analysis should be conducted if more detailed individual data are available, which will allow for an adjusted estimate. Further, in the subgroup analysis stratified by cancer type, the number of studies and subjects analyzed was small, and caution should be taken in interpreting these results. It might be difficult to make a concrete conclusion because few studies were included in the subgroups. Despite these limitations, our meta-analysis also had some advantages. First, significant data were extracted from the related published case-control studies. Second, all studies included in this meta-analysis were case-control investigations and contained available genotype frequencies, which met our inclusion criteria very well.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that the <italic>TERT</italic> rs2736098 polymorphism identified in the 5p15.33 region in Caucasians may also predispose to lung cancer, especially adenocarcinomas, in the Chinese population. Moreover, meta-analysis by tumor type suggested that this genetic variant may modify individual susceptibility to lung and bladder cancer. Further studies are required to validate these findings and explain the inconsistent results in different ethnicities and cancer types.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0076372.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
