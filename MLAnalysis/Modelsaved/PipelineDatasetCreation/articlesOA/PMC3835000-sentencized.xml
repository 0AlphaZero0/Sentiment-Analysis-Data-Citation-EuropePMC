</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Generation of the syncytial trophoblast during embryonic development, formation of syncytial skeletal muscle fibers, and development of osteoclasts highlight important developmental processes in mammals which are underpinned by somatic cell fusion events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of somatic cell fusion has been reported in additional tissues including heart (Dedja et al. 2006), liver (Faggioli et al. 2008; Fujimiya et al. 2007), brain (Alvarez-Dolado et al. 2003; Johansson et al. 2008), prostate (Placencio et al. 2010), and the intestinal epithelium (Davies et al. 2009; Rizvi et al. 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that somatic cell fusion could be a mechanism enabling cancer metastasis and in generating resistance to chemotherapy treatments (Duelli and Lazebnik 2003; Pawelek and Chakraborty 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The diverse array of cell types affected by somatic cell fusion events demonstrates the need for intense study of this rudimentary understood process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In specific tissue types, such as skeletal muscle, thousands of cell fusion events can take place during the development of a single human muscle fiber in vivo (Peckham 2008); however, these fusion events are asynchronous and hence suggest that the somatic cell fusion process is under temporal control of specific genes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Significant advances have been made in improving our understanding of how the somatic cell fusion process is regulated during embryonic development of the body wall musculature in the invertebrate model system, Drosophila melanogaster (Abmayr and Pavlath 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Research findings from Drosophila are increasingly utilized in diverse research disciplines to strengthen and develop hypotheses regarding the molecular underpinnings of development and diseases in humans (Botas 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Indeed, evidence is emerging which supports the concept of conservation of key signaling networks between Drosophila and mammals in regulating the somatic cell fusion process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The dedicator of cytokinesis (Dock) protein family member Dock1, which is an atypical guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rac1 has been demonstrated to be an important regulator of the in vivo muscle cell fusion process in Drosophila (Erickson et al. 1997) and mouse models (Laurin et al. 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In addition, an mRNA transcript for the Type-1 transmembrane protein Nephrin which is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily has recently been reported to be present in human primary skeletal muscle cell cultures and in mouse skeletal muscle during the healing response to cardiotoxin-induced injury (Sohn et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Nephrin is the mammalian homolog to the Drosophila gene sticks and stones (SnS) (Bour et al. 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Loss of SnS results in inhibition of the muscle cell fusion process during embryonic development in Drosophila (Bour et al. 2000), and intriguingly, loss of Nephrin in zebrafish and in mouse muscle cells in vitro results in decreased somatic cell fusion events (Sohn et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>During the occurrence of muscle cell fusion events in Drosophila SnS colocalizes in trans at the cell membrane of fusing muscle cells with an additional Type-1 transmembrane protein and member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, Kin of Irre (Kirre) (Galletta et al. 2004; Sens et al. 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Present within the Drosophila genome is a Kirre paralog termed Roughest (Rst) (Strünkelnberg et al. 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Elimination of both Kirre and Rst results in complete inhibition of the muscle cell fusion process (Strünkelnberg et al. 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The mammalian homologs to Rst and Kirre are the Kirrel gene family, Kirrel, Kirrel2, and Kirrel3 (Neumann-Haefelin et al. 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Currently we have rudimentary knowledge regarding the murine Kirrel family in skeletal muscle as the vast majority of research on this gene family has focused on its role in the slit diaphragm of the mammalian kidney (Donoviel et al. 2001; Gerke et al. 2003; Liu et al. 2003) or in brain development (Gerke et al. 2006; Nishida et al. 2011; Tamura et al. 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The Caenorhabditis. elegans homolog of the Kirrel family is synaptogenesis abnormal 1 (SYG-1) and it has been implicated in neural synapse formation (Shen and Bargmann 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>We therefore wished to initially examine one of the Kirrel family members, Kirrel, during in vitro myogenesis to assess if evidence could be found which would support a possible role for Kirrel in regulating the somatic cell fusion process in murine skeletal muscle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Our results identify a previously unreported splice variant of Kirrel which is present in murine muscle cells during in vitro myogenesis and also in the mouse brain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Alternative splicing is predicted to lead to the production of a truncated protein compared to the previously reported Kirrel (Liu et al. 2003) which would result in significant alternations in the cytoplasmic domain of Kirrel. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>We termed this truncated Kirrel transcript Kirrel B. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>We also present evidence that expression levels of the Kirrel B protein isoform are surprisingly inverse to occurrence of somatic cell fusion events during in vitro myogenesis which is in stark contrast to the expression profile of Kirre and Rst during myogenesis in Drosophila, whereby their expression is highest when the greatest number of cell fusion events are occurring (Ruiz-Gómez et al. 2000; Strünkelnberg et al. 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, to substantiate the inverse link between Kirrel B expression levels and somatic cell fusion events, we chemically inhibited the cell fusion process which resulted in significant upregulation of the Kirrel B protein isoform. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Our results are particularly noteworthy in light of work on Kirrel homologs Rst and Kirre in Drosophila myogenesis (reviewed in Abmayr and Pavlath 2012 and additionally on the C. elegans homolog of Kirrel, SYG-1 in synaptogenesis [Shen and Bargmann 2003]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Further work is required to ascertain how Kirrel B may be involved in regulating diverse physiological processes such as muscle cell fusion and neurogenesis. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, evidence is also beginning to emerge that the occurrence of somatic cell fusion may be more widespread than previously recognized, as evidence of somatic cell fusion events have also been reported in brain (Alvarez-Dolado et al. 2003; Johansson et al. 2008), intestinal epithelium (Davies et al. 2009), liver (Faggioli et al. 2008), prostate (Placencio et al. 2010), and also cancer cells (Carter 2008; Duelli and Lazebnik 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Such findings are suggestive that improved mechanistic understanding of the somatic cell fusion process may elucidate novel therapeutic tools. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>However, to date it has been unsuccessful in generating clinically beneficial results thus further supporting the need for increased knowledge of the molecular underpinnings of the somatic cell fusion process. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>In light of such findings we investigated the Kirrel gene, a mammalian homolog of the Drosophila genes Rst and Kirre (Neumann-Haefelin et al. 2010), which have been shown to be key regulators of muscle cell fusion events during embryonic development in Drosophila (Strünkelnberg et al. 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Currently, rudimentary knowledge is available regarding Kirrel in mammalian skeletal muscle. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Significant structural differences are predicted to exist in the cytoplasmic domains of Kirrel A and B, which likely confer differential signaling capabilities to either isoform. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Of particular note with regards to cell fusion is the loss of the GRB2-binding motif from Kirrel B. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>The GRB2-binding motif present in Kirrel A has been demonstrated to enable Kirrel A to induce actin nucleation at the plasma membrane of mammalian cells (Garg et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Actin nucleation at the plasma membrane is essential for the muscle cell process in Drosophila and also in mammals (Abmayr and Pavlath 2012; Sens et al. 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Expression profiling of Kirrel B protein levels during in vitro myogenesis found its expression to be highest 1 day postaddition of DM, lowest 2 days postaddition of DM, and intermediate expression levels 3 days postaddition of DM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>This expression pattern inversely matches the rate of occurrence of cell fusion events of C2C12 cells which is lowest 1 day postaddition of DM and highest 2 days postaddition of DM (Veliça and Bunce 2011). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly we observed that Kirrel A protein expression levels, as assayed via the presence of a likely heavily posttranslationally modified immunoreactive band migrating at ∼125 kDa, did not display any significant perturbations in expression levels such as those described for Kirrel B. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Our findings with regards to Kirrel A protein levels were similar to those observed for total Kirrel mRNA expression levels, which displayed small alterations during in vitro myogenesis and in response to our experimental interventions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>The structural analysis of Kirrel A and B highlights that both isoforms share an identical extracellular domain, therefore, Kirrel A and B may compete for interaction with the same extracellular ligand. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>The recent finding with regards to the importance of the murine homolog of SnS, Nephrin in murine skeletal muscle cell fusion, and the expression pattern of Nephrin being positively correlated with muscle cell fusion events (Sohn et al. 2009) makes it tempting to hypothesize that the decreased expression of Kirrel B when fusion rates are high may enable increased interactions between Kirrel A and Nephrin as protein expression levels of Kirrel A remain relatively constant throughout the differentiation time course of C2C12 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Such a scenario of Kirrel A and Nephrin interaction would mirror research findings from Drosophila Schneider cells demonstrating that Kirre and SnS can interact in trans (Galletta et al. 2004) and that they colocalize in trans in vivo at sites undergoing muscle cell fusion during embryonic development in Sens et al.

<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly in mouse L fibroblasts Kirrel A has been reported to interact in trans with Nephrin (Heikkilä et al. 2011), thus providing support for the possibility that a similar interaction may occur in mammalian muscle cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Notably in Drosophila at sites of fusion where SnS and Kirre colocalize in trans, significant actin nucleation occurs (Sens et al. 2010), likely due to the recruitment of pronucleation factors by Kirre and SnS (Abmayr and Pavlath 2012; Richardson et al. 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>If components of the actin nucleation pathway such as the Wiskott Aldrich protein (WASP) are absent from muscle cells, the fusion process is blocked at the cell–cell adhesion stage between Kirre and SnS (Sens et al. 2010), thus highlighting the importance of localized actin nucleation at the cell membrane to the cell fusion process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Considering that Kirrel B lacks the GRB2-binding domains which enable Kirrel A to induce localized actin nucleation at the plasma membrane of mammalian cells (Garg et al. 2007), it could be hypothesized that Kirrel B may negatively regulate the cell fusion process by sequestering potential trans interactions of Kirrel A with other profusion partners such as Nephrin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Actin nucleation may therefore be prevented from occurring in the cell which expresses Kirrel B, thus, inhibiting cell fusion events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>In Drosophila, it has been shown that actin nucleation occurs in both the cells which are undergoing fusion (Sens et al. 2010). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>It is noteworthy that Kirrel B protein expression levels are inverse to the expression levels of myogenin, which is a key transcription factor for skeletal muscle differentiation (Rawls et al. 1995), a process which is characterized by the formation of multinucleated muscle fibers in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Interestingly it has been demonstrated that as C2C12 cells differentiate and begin to form multinucleated myotubes, changes occur in the alternative splicing of mRNA transcripts (Bland et al. 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the alternative splicing of Kirrel to yield both A and B protein isoforms may be indirectly regulated by myogenin via the ability of myogenin to drive the differentiation program of skeletal muscle cells and, hence, alter splicing events of mRNA transcripts such as Kirrel in skeletal muscle cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Decreased production of the Kirrel B mRNA transcript due to changes in the spliceosome as a result of the differentiation process may as hypothesized above favor cell fusion events via enabling Kirrel A and Nephrin interaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Overexpression studies of the Kirrel B isoform should provide an answer as to whether Kirrel B may be capable of inhibiting the somatic cell fusion process of skeletal muscle. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>In the mammalian genome there are two additional Kirrel family members Kirrel2 and Kirrel3 (Neumann-Haefelin et al. 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Currently it remains unclear whether Kirrel3 is present or absent in mammalian skeletal muscle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>A Kirrel3 mRNA transcript was not detected in an analysis of murine skeletal muscle (Ueno et al. 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>However, contrary to this, it has been reported that sera raised against Kirrel3 detected a strong immunoreactive band in murine skeletal muscle at approximately 100 kDa which the authors suggest to possibly be a posttranslationally modified form of Kirrel3 (Gerke et al. 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it has been reported that in embryonic murine skeletal muscle (E17.5), Kirrel3 and Nephrin coimmunoprecipitate (Morikawa et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>This interaction was suggested as occurring at muscle spindle sites due to results from in situ hybridization studies, which found Kirrel3 to be present in proprioceptive neurons of the dorsal root ganglia while Nephrin was reported to be present in Neurotrophin 3–positive intrafusal muscle fibers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>It will therefore be of interest to examine in detail the entire Kirrel family and possible interactions with Nephrin to ascertain their possible multiple diverse functions during myogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Due to the highly similar extracellular domain present among mammalian Kirrel, Kirrel2, and Kirrel3 and their shared capability of interacting with similar proteins such as Podocin (Sellin et al. 2003), the possibility of redundancy among this family of genes is suggested. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Such potential redundancy will need to be considered when attempting to elucidate how these genes may be involved in developmental processes, such as somatic cell fusion, where the absence of one family member, generated using knock-out technology, may be compensated for by another and hence no overt developmental or physiological defects may be displayed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>The presence of Kirrel B in murine brain tissue also requires further examination as the C. elegans homolog of Kirrel, SYG-1, is known to be involved in synaptogenesis (Wanner et al. 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Kirrel has been reported to be present at synapses in the murine brain (Gerke et al. 2006), however, the antibody used was directed toward the extracellular domain of Kirrel and so would not have been able to distinguish between Kirrel A and B. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>With the development of isoform-specific antibodies it will be of interest to examine the spatial distribution of both Kirrel isoforms in murine tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Finally, 3′ and 5′ race experiments will be required to examine whether both Kirrel isoforms originate from the same genomic locus and whether the untranslated regions of the transcripts vary between cell types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Such information will help elucidate possible regulatory mechanisms such as micro-RNAs (miRNAs) controlling expression of the alternatively spliced Kirrel transcripts in different cell types. </plain></SENT>
