While many regulators of pathogenic angiogenesis have been identified, our understanding of this process is incomplete. Here we explored the transcriptome of retinal microvessels isolated from mouse models of retinal disease that exhibit vascular pathology and uncovered an up-regulated gene, leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein-1 (<italic>Lrg1</italic>), of previously unknown function. We show that in the presence of TGF&#946;1, LRG1 is mitogenic to endothelial cells and promotes angiogenesis. Mice lacking <italic>Lrg1</italic> develop a mild retinal vascular phenotype but exhibit a significant reduction in pathological ocular angiogenesis. LRG1 binds directly to the TGF&#946; accessory receptor endoglin which, in the presence of TGF&#946;1, results in promotion of the pro-angiogenic Smad1/5/8 signalling pathway. LRG1 antibody blockade inhibits this switch and attenuates angiogenesis. These studies reveal a novel regulator of angiogenesis that mediates its effect through modulating TGF&#946; signalling.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P3">The formation of new blood vessels by angiogenesis is a key feature of a number of diseases including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and cancer. The factors that promote neovascularisation have been the subject of extensive research, with the vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) and their receptors emerging as master regulators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Despite the prominent role of VEGF, other factors contribute to neoangiogenesis through coordinated crosstalk that is often highly context-dependent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Such complexity is exemplified in transforming growth factor beta (TGF&#946;) 1 signalling, which can switch from being mostly angiostatic to pro-angiogenic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. What regulates this switch is not fully understood but activation of the pro-angiogenic pathway involves TGF&#946; receptor-II (T&#946;RII) recruitment of the predominantly endothelial TGF&#946; type I receptor, activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)1, which in turn initiates activation of the transcription factors Smad 1, 5 and 8 resulting in a pro-angiogenic phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. The regulation of this differential signalling is contingent on multiple factors including the concentration of TGF&#946;, its bioavailability and the presence or absence of other regulatory factors such as bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) and accessory receptors such as endoglin (ENG) and betaglycan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Our incomplete understanding of the role of the fine-tuning of angiogenesis suggests that additional modulators have yet to be identified. Our objective in this study, therefore, was to identify novel regulators of pathogenic angiogenesis that may lead to the development of more effective treatment strategies.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Retinal vascular expression of LRG1</title><p id="P5">To identify novel regulators of neovascularisation we exploited three mouse mutants that exhibit marked remodelling of the retinal vasculature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Movies 1</xref> to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">4</xref>). Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of retinal microvessel fragments isolated from the retinal dystrophy (RD)1 mouse, the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) knockout mouse and the <italic>Grhl3<sup>ct</sup></italic>/J curly tail mouse (The Jackson Laboratory) and appropriate wild type (WT) control mice yielded 62 genes that were differentially regulated but common to all three retinal disease models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). When ranked according to fold change, a gene encoding a secreted glycoprotein of unknown function, namely leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein-1 (<italic>Lrg1</italic>), emerged as the most significantly up-regulated. LRG1 is a highly conserved member of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) family of proteins, many of which are involved in protein-protein interactions, signalling and cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 2a and b</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Validation of the microarray data revealed that in the retina LRG1 is restricted almost exclusively to the vasculature, is expressed under normal conditions and is up-regulated during retinal vascular remodelling in the three mouse models of retinal disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1a-d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 3</xref>). However, LRG1 expression was not restricted to the retina as we also observed LRG1 staining in the choriocapillaris of the mouse eye (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 4a</xref>). Consistent with the data obtained in the mouse, we observed low levels of constitutive LRG1 expression in normal adult human retinal vessels and weakly, but not exclusively, in vessels in other human tissues including breast, skin and intestine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 4b</xref>).</p><p id="P7">We next investigated whether the <italic>Lrg1</italic> transcript is also increased in the retinae of models of choroidal and retinal neovascularisation. Choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) was induced in WT mice, and one week after laser injury we observed a significant increase in <italic>Lrg1</italic> transcript levels in both the retina and RPE/choroid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 1e and 1f</xref>). We then examined intra-retinal/pre-retinal neovascularisation in the mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR), which displays hypoxia-driven retinal angiogenesis. At P17, during the ischaemic proliferative phase of OIR when neovascularisation is most prevalent, <italic>Lrg1</italic> transcript levels were also up-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1g</xref>). However, at the end of the hyperoxic phase (P12) <italic>Lrg1</italic> mRNA was significantly reduced. Indeed, the pattern of <italic>Lrg1</italic> expression at the two time points observed mirrored the expression of the hypoxia-responsive genes <italic>Vegfa</italic>, <italic>Apln</italic> (Apelin) and its receptor <italic>Aplnr</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 5</xref>). To determine whether LRG1 is up-regulated in human retinal disease in which there is neovascular pathology, vitreous samples from human subjects with PDR were analysed by western blot which revealed increased LRG1 expression compared to control vitreous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1h</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 6</xref>). It is unclear, however, whether this increase is the consequence of increased local production, leakage from the systemic circulation or a combination of both.</p><p id="P8">These data show that in the retina LRG1 expression is predominantly vascular, is constitutive and is increased during neovascular growth.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>LRG1 and angiogenesis</title><p id="P9">To investigate the function of LRG1 we used cultured endothelial cell (EC) assays and <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> models of angiogenesis. We observed that over-expression of <italic>LRG1</italic> in ECs increased proliferation whereas <italic>Lrg1</italic> knockdown decreased proliferation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 7</xref>). In addition, EC migration was inhibited by an anti-LRG1 polyclonal antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">8</xref>). In the Matrigel human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) tube-formation assay, supplementation of media with recombinant human LRG1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 8</xref>) caused a significant increase in tube formation and branching, whereas an anti-LRG1 antibody significantly blocked tube formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">9</xref>). Consistent with the latter observation, LRG1 was found to be present in the conditioned media of these assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 10</xref>). We next investigated whether LRG1 promotes blood vessel growth in two <italic>ex vivo</italic> models of angiogenesis. Mouse metatarsals (E16.5) and aortic rings (P7) were prepared using tissues from WT mice. Vessel outgrowth and branching from explanted metatarsals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 11</xref>) or aortic rings in the absence of other added growth factors were significantly increased upon addition of exogenous LRG1 and inhibited in the presence of the anti-LRG1 polyclonal antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2b</xref>). Again, conditioned media from both assays was found to contain LRG1 protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 10</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Having demonstrated that LRG1 influences vascular growth <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> we then investigated the retinal vasculature of the <italic>Lrg1</italic> knock-out mouse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 12</xref>). <italic>Lrg1</italic><sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> mice were viable but exhibited a delay in the development of the deep vascular plexus at P10 to P12 and the intermediate vessels between P17 and P25 that resolved by postnatal day 35 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 13</xref>). In addition, the hyaloid vessels failed to regress fully, with vessel persistence beyond P35 and integration into the inner retina (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 14</xref>). Defective retinal vascular development and persistent hyaloid vessels were also reported in mice with deletions in <italic>Ndp</italic> (Norrin), <italic>Fzd4</italic> (Frizzled-4), <italic>Lrp5</italic> and <italic>Angpt2</italic> (angiopoietin-2) which also contribute to angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. We also observed an increase in the incidence of cross-over of the radial arteries and veins and of their side branches, with occasional small vessels forming arteriovenous anastomosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 15</xref>). Arteriovenous crossing has been reported in the retina of the hypomorphic <italic>Vegfa</italic> mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and is associated with susceptibility to branched vein occlusion in the human retina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. In this context it was interesting to note that <italic>Vegfa</italic> gene expression in the <italic>Lrg1</italic><sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> mouse retina is significantly lower than in control mice in contrast to <italic>Plgf</italic> which is unchanged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 16</xref>). Aside from these mild defects, the retinal vasculature of the <italic>Lrg1</italic><sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> mice exhibited similar pericyte coverage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 17</xref>) and barrier properties (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 18</xref>) to WT controls.</p><p id="P11">As we had observed that LRG1 inhibition or supplementation had a significant effect on vessel formation in the metatarsal and aortic ring assays, we hypothesised that <italic>Lrg1</italic> knockout would lead to reduced angiogenesis in these models. Indeed, vessel formation was significantly reduced in <italic>Lrg1</italic><sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> mice in both the metatarsal and aortic ring assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 19</xref>), and could be rescued by the addition of exogenous LRG1. Together these data support the hypothesis that LRG1 contributes to, and is necessary for, robust vascular growth.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>LRG1 and pathogenic neovascularisation</title><p id="P12">As our data thus far had demonstrated increased <italic>Lrg1</italic> transcript expression in CNV and OIR in WT mice we investigated whether neovascularisation in these models is attenuated in <italic>Lrg1<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup></italic> mice. CNV was induced in WT and <italic>Lrg1<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup></italic> mice, and at 7 days post-laser fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) at 90 seconds revealed a diminished neovascular response in the <italic>Lrg1</italic><sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> mice compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a</xref>; P&lt;0.01). Concomitant with this was an equivalent reduction in fluorescein leakage at 7 minutes post injection. This effect was confirmed in a group of animals in which the neovascular lesion was visualised in posterior eyecup whole mounts, quantitative analysis of which showed that mean lesion size was ~70% smaller in <italic>Lrg1</italic><sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> than WT mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 20</xref>). The reduction in lesion size in the <italic>Lrg1</italic><sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> mouse was similar to that reported in <italic>Plgf</italic><sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> and <italic>Ccr3</italic><sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> mice, two other pro-angiogenic factors, and could not be explained by changes in macrophage recruitment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 20</xref>) or pericyte coverage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 21</xref>). We next investigated intra-retinal/pre-retinal neovascularisation, as observed in PDR, in the OIR model of angiogenesis. Following the 5-day hyperoxia phase, the size of the avascular region at P12 was not significantly different between the <italic>Lrg1</italic><sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> and WT animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 22</xref>). Furthermore, after 5 days in normoxia revascularisation of the avascular region with ordered vessels was similar between the two groups, demonstrating that hyperoxia-induced regression and hypoxia-induced physiological revascularisation are not affected by the loss of LRG1. However, the area occupied by disordered neovascular growth (tufts) was significantly reduced in the absence of LRG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3b</xref>; P&lt;0.01; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 22</xref>), demonstrating that LRG1 is specifically required for robust pathogenic angiogenesis.</p><p id="P13">Having demonstrated that an antibody against LRG1 inhibits angiogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic> we investigated whether this antibody would also reduce CNV lesion size. Following the laser burn, animals received intravitreal injections of the anti-LRG1 polyclonal antibody or a pre-immune IgG as control, and 5 days later lesion sizes were measured. In the anti-LRG1 antibody-treated eyes a dose-dependent reduction in CNV lesion volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3c and d</xref>) and area (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 23</xref>) was observed compared to control antibody-treated eyes. Indeed, the 58% reduction of CNV volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3d</xref>) and 46% reduction in area at a dose of 10&#956;g (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 23</xref>) was of similar magnitude as that achieved with blockade of the VEGF/PlGF signalling axis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> or the chemokine receptor CCR3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P14">As antibody blockade of LRG1 reduces CNV lesion size we investigated the effects of combination therapy with a VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2)-blocking antibody<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Antibody blockade of LRG1 alone, VEGFR2 alone, or both LRG1 and VEGFR2 inhibited CNV lesion volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 23</xref>) with the combined therapy giving the most significant inhibition. The effect of combinatorial treatment was also evaluated in OIR. Under the treatment conditions employed, where the individual antibodies elicited no significant effect, animals treated with the antibody combination exhibited a significant inhibition of both patterned revascularisation and the formation of pathogenic vascular tufts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 24</xref>). These data provide compelling evidence that inhibition of LRG1 is effective in preventing pathological angiogenesis and suggest that LRG1 has potential as a therapeutic target on its own or in combination with other anti-angiogenic therapies.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>LRG1 and TGF&#223; signalling</title><p id="P15">Whilst little is known regarding the biology of LRG1, concomitant increases in the expression levels of TGF&#946;1, T&#946;RII and LRG1 have been reported in cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> and hydrocephalus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, and LRG1 has been shown to bind to TGF&#946;1 in high endothelial venules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Consistent with this, and with earlier proteomic and transcriptome analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, we have shown here that in vitreous samples from the eyes of human subjects with PDR, both LRG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1h</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 6</xref>) and TGF&#946;1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 25</xref>) are significantly increased. Furthermore, alongside increased <italic>Lrg1</italic>, <italic>Tgfb1</italic> transcript levels were also significantly up-regulated in the retinae of laser-induced CNV mice and in OIR mice during the ischaemic proliferative phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 5</xref>). These data prompted us to investigate whether LRG1 acts as a modulator of TGF&#946; signalling.</p><p id="P16">To determine whether LRG1 associates with components of the TGF&#946; receptor complex we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. In primary brain ECs LRG1 was present in immunoprecipitates of T&#946;RII, ALK1, ALK5 and the auxiliary receptor ENG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4a</xref>). Conversely, immunoprecipitates of LRG1 from HUVEC were found to contain T&#946;RII, ALK1, ALK5 and ENG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 26a</xref>). These observations suggested that LRG1 might be involved in regulating TGF&#946; signalling through fine-tuning the stoichiometry of the TGF&#946; receptor complex. TGF&#946;1 signals in ECs through T&#946;RII recruiting either the ubiquitous ALK5 receptor or the predominantly endothelial ALK1 receptor, either on its own or together with ALK5. Stimulation of the T&#223;RII/ALK5 signalling complex results in phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factors Smad 2 and 3, which increases extracellular matrix deposition, inhibits EC proliferation and migration, and promotes cell homeostasis, whilst T&#223;RII/ALK5/ALK1 signalling, possibly in association with ENG, activates Smads 1, 5 and 8 resulting in a pro-angiogenic state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. We therefore investigated the direct one-to-one binding of LRG1 to recombinant extracellular domains of individual TGF&#946; receptors in serum-free conditioned media from transfected HEK 293 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 26b</xref>). Immunoprecipitation of the receptor ectodomain revealed coimmunoprecipitation of LRG1 with ALK5, T&#946;RII and ENG indicating a direct interaction of LRG1 with these individual receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4b</xref>). This occurred in the absence of TGF&#946;1, which was not present in HEK 293 cell conditioned medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 10</xref>). Addition of conditioned medium containing non-tagged ENG, ALK5 or T&#946;RII out-competed tagged receptor binding to LRG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4c</xref>) confirming the specificity of these protein-protein interactions. The observation that ENG appears to be one of the receptors for LRG1 is germane, given its proposed role in switching TGF&#946; signalling towards the pro-angiogenic Smad1/5/8 pathway. A potential functional relationship between LRG1 and ENG was additionally strengthened by our observation that <italic>Eng</italic> is up-regulated in CNV and OIR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 27</xref>). To further define the LRG1-ENG interaction we undertook surface plasmon resonance analysis (BIAcore) and obtained an affinity rate constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 2.9 &#956;M (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 28</xref>) for binding of the ENG ectodomain to LRG1.</p><p id="P17">These data raise the possibility that LRG1 facilitates a receptor configuration conducive to the pro-angiogenic signalling pathway. To investigate this, LRG1 was incubated with conditioned media containing the extracellular domains of either ALK1 or ALK5 in the presence or absence of different combinations of TGF&#946;1 and the extracellular domains of ENG and T&#946;RII. These studies revealed that LRG1 only associated with ALK1 in the presence of ENG, to which it bound, and this was enhanced by the addition of TGF&#946;1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4d</xref>). Conversely, ALK5 binds LRG1 in the absence of ENG but in its presence this interaction is attenuated, suggesting competition between ENG and ALK5 for LRG1, whilst the addition of TGF&#946;1 results in complete loss of the LRG1-ALK5 association. Moreover, neither TGF&#946;1 nor T&#946;RII on their own, nor a combination of both, affects ALK1-LRG1 or ALK5-LRG1 association in the absence of ENG. However, in the presence of ENG, T&#946;RII is able to form a complex with ALK1-LRG1 or ALK5-LRG1, with the former association being enhanced and the latter being further inhibited by TGF&#946;1. In accordance with previously suggested models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, these data imply that LRG1 may be able to form an intermediate complex with ALK5, ALK1, T&#946;RII and ENG but that in the presence of TGF&#946;1 the LRG1/ALK1/T&#946;RII/ENG complex predominates. An association between LRG1 and TGF&#946;1 may therefore lead to more efficient ALK1/T&#946;RII/ENG receptor complex formation and consequently to the promotion of pro-angiogenic Smad1/5 signalling.</p><p id="P18">To test this hypothesis we treated mouse brain ECs with TGF&#946;1 (5ng/ml) and showed that both Smad2/3 and Smad1/5 phosphorylation are induced in WT cells but in <italic>Lrg1</italic> null cells only Smad2/3 is activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5a</xref>). The addition of LRG1 alone did not activate Smad2/3 or Smad1/5, but in combination with TGF&#946;1 there was a dramatic induction of Smad1/5 phosphorylation showing that LRG1 requires the presence of TGF&#946;1 to stimulate the pro-angiogenic T&#223;RII-ALK1-Smad1/5/8 pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5a</xref>). As TGF&#946;1 is an EC mitogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> we also investigated whether LRG1 augmented TGF&#946;1-mediated cell proliferation.

Moreover, in the metatarsal angiogenesis assay the combined addition of LRG1 and TGF&#946;1 led to a substantial increase in vessel formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5c</xref>). The observation that LRG1 alone induced a small increase in vessel formation implies that TGF&#223;1 is produced constitutively by the metatarsal tissue, which was confirmed by western blotting of conditioned medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 10</xref>).</p><p id="P19">To confirm that the pro-angiogenic effect of LRG1 was mediated through the ALK1-Smad1/5/8 pathway, ALK1 was knocked down with siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 29</xref>) or inhibited with LDN193189 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 29</xref>), resulting in prevention of LRG1-induced Smad1/5 phosphorylation without affecting Smad2 phosphorylation. As predicted, in the Matrigel assay ALK1 inhibition led to a significant decrease in HUVEC tube and branch formation and blocked the angiogenic activity of LRG1 in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5f</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 29</xref>). Conversely, knockdown of ALK5 with siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 5d and f</xref>) or inhibition with SB43152 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 29</xref>), which inhibited constitutive Smad2 phosphorylation, did not prevent LRG1-induced HUVEC tube formation. siRNA knockdown of T&#946;RII or ENG also resulted in the abrogation of LRG1-induced Smad1/5 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 29</xref>) and HUVEC tube and branch formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5g</xref>).

The multiplicity of regulatory mechanisms together with variable combinations of receptors/co-receptors creates complex patterns of TGF&#946; activity that define its context-dependent effects. In particular, the balance between the ALK5 and ALK1 signalling pathways is considered to be central in determining the angiogenic switch with ENG being proposed as a key regulatory molecule in promoting signalling through the ALK1 pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. In searching for mediators of vascular remodelling in the diseased/damaged retina we have discovered a novel regulator of TGF&#223; signalling. The data presented here support a hypothesis that LRG1 activates the TGF&#946; angiogenic switch by binding to the accessory receptor ENG and, in the presence of TGF&#946;1, promotes signalling via the T&#946;RII-ALK1-Smad1/5/8 pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 32</xref>). Moreover, our evidence suggests that LRG1 may play a more dominant role in disorganised pathological rather than developmental/physiological angiogenesis. Whilst in the retina this is clearly supported by our <italic>in vivo</italic> data, the <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies indicate that LRG1 angiogenic activity is not restricted to the eye. The modulating effect of LRG1 on TGF&#223;1 signalling is the first demonstration of a definitive function for LRG1 and raises the intriguing possibility that it may influence other major biological processes in which TGF&#223; plays a role including neoplasia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> and the immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Inhibition of LRG1, which we show here causes a shift away from angiogenic signalling, could present an alternative way of preventing pathogenic activation of this pathway, whilst leaving homeostatic ALK1 signalling unperturbed. From these studies we suggest, therefore, that LRG1 is a highly promising therapeutic target for controlling pathogenic angiogenesis in ocular disease, and potentially in other diseases such as cancer and atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S7" specific-use="web-only"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Animals</title><p id="P22">C57/BL6 mice were purchased from Harlan laboratories (Blackthorn, UK).

LRG1 was covalently immobilized via primary amino groups on a CM5 sensor chip as per manufacturer&#8217;s instructions (specific contact time 20 s at a flow rate of 10 &#956;l/min; LRG1 concentration at 25 &#956;g/ml diluted using 10 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0). The amount of immobilized LRG1 corresponded to 2000 Response Units (RU) in flow cell 2. Flow cell 1 on the same sensor chip, reserved for control runs, was treated identically but without LRG1 immobilization. For all SPR measurements, GST-tagged ENG was diluted in running buffer (1 x PBS, pH 7.2). The association was monitored by injecting different concentrations (1-50 nM) of the analyte (ENG) into channels 1 and 2 starting with the lowest analyte concentration. All experiments were conducted in triplicates at 25&#176;C at a flow rate of 30 &#956;l/min. The association time for ligand-analyte steady state binding was optimised to 180 s and a subsequent 300 s were allowed for dissociation. Between injections the sensor chip surface was regenerated with Glycine HCl pH 2.0 at a flow rate of 30 &#956;l/minute for 30 s. All curves were corrected for non-specific binding by subtraction of control curves obtained from injection of the analyte through the blank flow cell 1. The affinity and dissociation constants were calculated from the plots of the steady-state binding as a function of protein concentration, using the Biacore T200 evaluation software and a homogenous 1:1 Langmuir binding kinetic model. The analysis provided values for the dissociation affinity constant (K<sub>D</sub>), the association rate constant (K<sub>a</sub>) and the dissociation rate constant (K<sub>d</sub>).</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p id="P43">Data are represented as means &#177; s.e.m.
