<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The factors that promote neovascularisation have been the subject of extensive research, with the vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) and their receptors emerging as master regulators1-3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Despite the prominent role of VEGF, other factors contribute to neoangiogenesis through coordinated crosstalk that is often highly context-dependent4-6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Such complexity is exemplified in transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) 1 signalling, which can switch from being mostly angiostatic to pro-angiogenic7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>What regulates this switch is not fully understood but activation of the pro-angiogenic pathway involves TGFβ receptor-II (TβRII) recruitment of the predominantly endothelial TGFβ type I receptor, activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)1, which in turn initiates activation of the transcription factors Smad 1, 5 and 8 resulting in a pro-angiogenic phenotype7-10. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The regulation of this differential signalling is contingent on multiple factors including the concentration of TGFβ, its bioavailability and the presence or absence of other regulatory factors such as bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) and accessory receptors such as endoglin (ENG) and betaglycan11. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P4"><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Our incomplete understanding of the role of the fine-tuning of angiogenesis suggests that additional modulators have yet to be identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Our objective in this study, therefore, was to identify novel regulators of pathogenic angiogenesis that may lead to the development of more effective treatment strategies. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P5"><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>To identify novel regulators of neovascularisation we exploited three mouse mutants that exhibit marked remodelling of the retinal vasculature (Supplementary Fig 1 and Supplementary Movies 1 to 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of retinal microvessel fragments isolated from the retinal dystrophy (RD)1 mouse, the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) knockout mouse and the Grhl3ct/J curly tail mouse (The Jackson Laboratory) and appropriate wild type (WT) control mice yielded 62 genes that were differentially regulated but common to all three retinal disease models (Supplementary Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>When ranked according to fold change, a gene encoding a secreted glycoprotein of unknown function, namely leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein-1 (Lrg1), emerged as the most significantly up-regulated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>LRG1 is a highly conserved member of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) family of proteins, many of which are involved in protein-protein interactions, signalling and cell adhesion (Supplementary Fig 2a and b). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P6"><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Validation of the microarray data revealed that in the retina LRG1 is restricted almost exclusively to the vasculature, is expressed under normal conditions and is up-regulated during retinal vascular remodelling in the three mouse models of retinal disease (Fig 1a-d; Supplementary Fig 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>However, LRG1 expression was not restricted to the retina as we also observed LRG1 staining in the choriocapillaris of the mouse eye (Supplementary Fig 4a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the data obtained in the mouse, we observed low levels of constitutive LRG1 expression in normal adult human retinal vessels and weakly, but not exclusively, in vessels in other human tissues including breast, skin and intestine (Supplementary Fig 4b). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P7"><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>We next investigated whether the Lrg1 transcript is also increased in the retinae of models of choroidal and retinal neovascularisation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) was induced in WT mice, and one week after laser injury we observed a significant increase in Lrg1 transcript levels in both the retina and RPE/choroid (Figs 1e and 1f). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>We then examined intra-retinal/pre-retinal neovascularisation in the mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR), which displays hypoxia-driven retinal angiogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>At P17, during the ischaemic proliferative phase of OIR when neovascularisation is most prevalent, Lrg1 transcript levels were also up-regulated (Fig 1g). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>However, at the end of the hyperoxic phase (P12) Lrg1 mRNA was significantly reduced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the pattern of Lrg1 expression at the two time points observed mirrored the expression of the hypoxia-responsive genes Vegfa, Apln (Apelin) and its receptor Aplnr (Supplementary Fig 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>To determine whether LRG1 is up-regulated in human retinal disease in which there is neovascular pathology, vitreous samples from human subjects with PDR were analysed by western blot which revealed increased LRG1 expression compared to control vitreous (Fig 1h; Supplementary Fig 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>It is unclear, however, whether this increase is the consequence of increased local production, leakage from the systemic circulation or a combination of both. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P8"><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>These data show that in the retina LRG1 expression is predominantly vascular, is constitutive and is increased during neovascular growth. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P9"><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>To investigate the function of LRG1 we used cultured endothelial cell (EC) assays and in vitro and ex vivo models of angiogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>We observed that over-expression of LRG1 in ECs increased proliferation whereas Lrg1 knockdown decreased proliferation (Supplementary Fig 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>In addition, EC migration was inhibited by an anti-LRG1 polyclonal antibody (Supplementary Fig 7 and 8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>In the Matrigel human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) tube-formation assay, supplementation of media with recombinant human LRG1 (Supplementary Fig 8) caused a significant increase in tube formation and branching, whereas an anti-LRG1 antibody significantly blocked tube formation (Fig 2a; Supplementary Figs 8 and 9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the latter observation, LRG1 was found to be present in the conditioned media of these assays (Supplementary Fig 10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>We next investigated whether LRG1 promotes blood vessel growth in two ex vivo models of angiogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Mouse metatarsals (E16.5) and aortic rings (P7) were prepared using tissues from WT mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Vessel outgrowth and branching from explanted metatarsals (Supplementary Fig 11) or aortic rings in the absence of other added growth factors were significantly increased upon addition of exogenous LRG1 and inhibited in the presence of the anti-LRG1 polyclonal antibody (Fig 2b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Again, conditioned media from both assays was found to contain LRG1 protein (Supplementary Fig 10). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P10"><text><SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Having demonstrated that LRG1 influences vascular growth in vitro and ex vivo we then investigated the retinal vasculature of the Lrg1 knock-out mouse (Supplementary Fig 12). Lrg1−/− mice were viable but exhibited a delay in the development of the deep vascular plexus at P10 to P12 and the intermediate vessels between P17 and P25 that resolved by postnatal day 35 (Supplementary Fig 13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>In addition, the hyaloid vessels failed to regress fully, with vessel persistence beyond P35 and integration into the inner retina (Supplementary Fig 14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Defective retinal vascular development and persistent hyaloid vessels were also reported in mice with deletions in Ndp (Norrin), Fzd4 (Frizzled-4), Lrp5 and Angpt2 (angiopoietin-2) which also contribute to angiogenesis12-14. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>We also observed an increase in the incidence of cross-over of the radial arteries and veins and of their side branches, with occasional small vessels forming arteriovenous anastomosis (Supplementary Fig 15). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Arteriovenous crossing has been reported in the retina of the hypomorphic Vegfa mouse15 and is associated with susceptibility to branched vein occlusion in the human retina16,17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>In this context it was interesting to note that Vegfa gene expression in the Lrg1−/− mouse retina is significantly lower than in control mice in contrast to Plgf which is unchanged (Supplementary Fig 16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Aside from these mild defects, the retinal vasculature of the Lrg1−/− mice exhibited similar pericyte coverage (Supplementary Fig 17) and barrier properties (Supplementary Fig 18) to WT controls. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P11"><text><SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>As we had observed that LRG1 inhibition or supplementation had a significant effect on vessel formation in the metatarsal and aortic ring assays, we hypothesised that Lrg1 knockout would lead to reduced angiogenesis in these models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Indeed, vessel formation was significantly reduced in Lrg1−/− mice in both the metatarsal and aortic ring assay (Fig 2c; Supplementary Fig 19), and could be rescued by the addition of exogenous LRG1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Together these data support the hypothesis that LRG1 contributes to, and is necessary for, robust vascular growth. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P12"><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>As our data thus far had demonstrated increased Lrg1 transcript expression in CNV and OIR in WT mice we investigated whether neovascularisation in these models is attenuated in Lrg1−/− mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>CNV was induced in WT and Lrg1−/− mice, and at 7 days post-laser fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) at 90 seconds revealed a diminished neovascular response in the Lrg1−/− mice compared to controls (Fig 3a; P&lt;0.01). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Concomitant with this was an equivalent reduction in fluorescein leakage at 7 minutes post injection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>This effect was confirmed in a group of animals in which the neovascular lesion was visualised in posterior eyecup whole mounts, quantitative analysis of which showed that mean lesion size was ~70% smaller in Lrg1−/− than WT mice (Supplementary Fig 20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>The reduction in lesion size in the Lrg1−/− mouse was similar to that reported in Plgf−/− 18 and Ccr3−/− 19 mice, two other pro-angiogenic factors, and could not be explained by changes in macrophage recruitment (Supplementary Fig 20) or pericyte coverage (Supplementary Fig 21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>We next investigated intra-retinal/pre-retinal neovascularisation, as observed in PDR, in the OIR model of angiogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Following the 5-day hyperoxia phase, the size of the avascular region at P12 was not significantly different between the Lrg1−/− and WT animals (Fig 3b; Supplementary Fig 22). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, after 5 days in normoxia revascularisation of the avascular region with ordered vessels was similar between the two groups, demonstrating that hyperoxia-induced regression and hypoxia-induced physiological revascularisation are not affected by the loss of LRG1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>However, the area occupied by disordered neovascular growth (tufts) was significantly reduced in the absence of LRG1 (Fig 3b; P&lt;0.01; Supplementary Fig 22), demonstrating that LRG1 is specifically required for robust pathogenic angiogenesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P13"><text><SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Having demonstrated that an antibody against LRG1 inhibits angiogenesis in vitro we investigated whether this antibody would also reduce CNV lesion size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Following the laser burn, animals received intravitreal injections of the anti-LRG1 polyclonal antibody or a pre-immune IgG as control, and 5 days later lesion sizes were measured. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>In the anti-LRG1 antibody-treated eyes a dose-dependent reduction in CNV lesion volume (Fig 3c and d) and area (Supplementary Fig 23) was observed compared to control antibody-treated eyes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the 58% reduction of CNV volume (Fig 3d) and 46% reduction in area at a dose of 10μg (Supplementary Fig 23) was of similar magnitude as that achieved with blockade of the VEGF/PlGF signalling axis20 or the chemokine receptor CCR319. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P14"><text><SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>As antibody blockade of LRG1 reduces CNV lesion size we investigated the effects of combination therapy with a VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2)-blocking antibody20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Antibody blockade of LRG1 alone, VEGFR2 alone, or both LRG1 and VEGFR2 inhibited CNV lesion volume (Fig 3e; Supplementary Fig 23) with the combined therapy giving the most significant inhibition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>The effect of combinatorial treatment was also evaluated in OIR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Under the treatment conditions employed, where the individual antibodies elicited no significant effect, animals treated with the antibody combination exhibited a significant inhibition of both patterned revascularisation and the formation of pathogenic vascular tufts (Supplementary Fig 24). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>These data provide compelling evidence that inhibition of LRG1 is effective in preventing pathological angiogenesis and suggest that LRG1 has potential as a therapeutic target on its own or in combination with other anti-angiogenic therapies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="S4"><title><text><SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>LRG1 and TGFß signalling </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="P15"><text><SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Whilst little is known regarding the biology of LRG1, concomitant increases in the expression levels of TGFβ1, TβRII and LRG1 have been reported in cancer cells21 and hydrocephalus22, and LRG1 has been shown to bind to TGFβ1 in high endothelial venules23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this, and with earlier proteomic and transcriptome analyses24,25, we have shown here that in vitreous samples from the eyes of human subjects with PDR, both LRG1 (Fig 1h; Supplementary Fig 6) and TGFβ1 (Supplementary Fig 25) are significantly increased. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, alongside increased Lrg1, Tgfb1 transcript levels were also significantly up-regulated in the retinae of laser-induced CNV mice and in OIR mice during the ischaemic proliferative phase (Supplementary Fig 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>These data prompted us to investigate whether LRG1 acts as a modulator of TGFβ signalling. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P16"><text><SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>To determine whether LRG1 associates with components of the TGFβ receptor complex we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>In primary brain ECs LRG1 was present in immunoprecipitates of TβRII, ALK1, ALK5 and the auxiliary receptor ENG (Fig 4a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Conversely, immunoprecipitates of LRG1 from HUVEC were found to contain TβRII, ALK1, ALK5 and ENG (Supplementary Fig 26a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>These observations suggested that LRG1 might be involved in regulating TGFβ signalling through fine-tuning the stoichiometry of the TGFβ receptor complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>TGFβ1 signals in ECs through TβRII recruiting either the ubiquitous ALK5 receptor or the predominantly endothelial ALK1 receptor, either on its own or together with ALK5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of the TßRII/ALK5 signalling complex results in phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factors Smad 2 and 3, which increases extracellular matrix deposition, inhibits EC proliferation and migration, and promotes cell homeostasis, whilst TßRII/ALK5/ALK1 signalling, possibly in association with ENG, activates Smads 1, 5 and 8 resulting in a pro-angiogenic state7,8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated the direct one-to-one binding of LRG1 to recombinant extracellular domains of individual TGFβ receptors in serum-free conditioned media from transfected HEK 293 cells (Supplementary Fig 26b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation of the receptor ectodomain revealed coimmunoprecipitation of LRG1 with ALK5, TβRII and ENG indicating a direct interaction of LRG1 with these individual receptors (Fig 4b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>This occurred in the absence of TGFβ1, which was not present in HEK 293 cell conditioned medium (Supplementary Fig 10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Addition of conditioned medium containing non-tagged ENG, ALK5 or TβRII out-competed tagged receptor binding to LRG1 (Fig 4c) confirming the specificity of these protein-protein interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>The observation that ENG appears to be one of the receptors for LRG1 is germane, given its proposed role in switching TGFβ signalling towards the pro-angiogenic Smad1/5/8 pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>A potential functional relationship between LRG1 and ENG was additionally strengthened by our observation that Eng is up-regulated in CNV and OIR (Supplementary Fig 27). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>To further define the LRG1-ENG interaction we undertook surface plasmon resonance analysis (BIAcore) and obtained an affinity rate constant (KD) of 2.9 μM (Supplementary Fig 28) for binding of the ENG ectodomain to LRG1. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P17"><text><SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>These data raise the possibility that LRG1 facilitates a receptor configuration conducive to the pro-angiogenic signalling pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>To investigate this, LRG1 was incubated with conditioned media containing the extracellular domains of either ALK1 or ALK5 in the presence or absence of different combinations of TGFβ1 and the extracellular domains of ENG and TβRII. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>These studies revealed that LRG1 only associated with ALK1 in the presence of ENG, to which it bound, and this was enhanced by the addition of TGFβ1 (Fig 4d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Conversely, ALK5 binds LRG1 in the absence of ENG but in its presence this interaction is attenuated, suggesting competition between ENG and ALK5 for LRG1, whilst the addition of TGFβ1 results in complete loss of the LRG1-ALK5 association. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Moreover, neither TGFβ1 nor TβRII on their own, nor a combination of both, affects ALK1-LRG1 or ALK5-LRG1 association in the absence of ENG. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>However, in the presence of ENG, TβRII is able to form a complex with ALK1-LRG1 or ALK5-LRG1, with the former association being enhanced and the latter being further inhibited by TGFβ1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>In accordance with previously suggested models8, these data imply that LRG1 may be able to form an intermediate complex with ALK5, ALK1, TβRII and ENG but that in the presence of TGFβ1 the LRG1/ALK1/TβRII/ENG complex predominates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>An association between LRG1 and TGFβ1 may therefore lead to more efficient ALK1/TβRII/ENG receptor complex formation and consequently to the promotion of pro-angiogenic Smad1/5 signalling. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P18"><text><SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis we treated mouse brain ECs with TGFβ1 (5ng/ml) and showed that both Smad2/3 and Smad1/5 phosphorylation are induced in WT cells but in Lrg1 null cells only Smad2/3 is activated (Fig 5a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>The addition of LRG1 alone did not activate Smad2/3 or Smad1/5, but in combination with TGFβ1 there was a dramatic induction of Smad1/5 phosphorylation showing that LRG1 requires the presence of TGFβ1 to stimulate the pro-angiogenic TßRII-ALK1-Smad1/5/8 pathway (Fig 5a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>As TGFβ1 is an EC mitogen7 we also investigated whether LRG1 augmented TGFβ1-mediated cell proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Brain ECs from Lrg1−/− mice proliferated more slowly than those from WT animals (Fig 5b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>Addition of TGFβ1 significantly enhanced EC proliferation from WT animals but inhibited the growth of cells from Lrg1−/− mice, presumably through enhanced ALK5-Smad2/3 signalling in the absence of activation of the ALK1-Smad1/5/8 arm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>The addition of LRG1 on its own had no effect, but TGFβ1 and LRG1 in combination increased proliferation significantly in both WT and Lrg1 null ECs (Fig 5b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in the metatarsal angiogenesis assay the combined addition of LRG1 and TGFβ1 led to a substantial increase in vessel formation (Fig 5c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>The observation that LRG1 alone induced a small increase in vessel formation implies that TGFß1 is produced constitutively by the metatarsal tissue, which was confirmed by western blotting of conditioned medium (Supplementary Fig 10). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P19"><text><SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>To confirm that the pro-angiogenic effect of LRG1 was mediated through the ALK1-Smad1/5/8 pathway, ALK1 was knocked down with siRNA (Fig 5d; Supplementary Fig 29) or inhibited with LDN193189 (Supplementary Fig 29), resulting in prevention of LRG1-induced Smad1/5 phosphorylation without affecting Smad2 phosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>As predicted, in the Matrigel assay ALK1 inhibition led to a significant decrease in HUVEC tube and branch formation and blocked the angiogenic activity of LRG1 in this assay (Fig 5f; Supplementary Fig 29). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Conversely, knockdown of ALK5 with siRNA (Figs 5d and f) or inhibition with SB43152 (Supplementary Fig 29), which inhibited constitutive Smad2 phosphorylation, did not prevent LRG1-induced HUVEC tube formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>siRNA knockdown of TβRII or ENG also resulted in the abrogation of LRG1-induced Smad1/5 phosphorylation (Fig 5e; Supplementary Fig 29) and HUVEC tube and branch formation (Fig 5g). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>To further corroborate the involvement of ENG in LRG1-mediated signalling, lung ECs derived from Rosa26-CreERT:Engfl/fl mice26 were treated with 4OH-tamoxifen to deplete ENG (MLEC;Eng−/−) (Fig 5h). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Unlike control cells, treatment of MLEC;Eng−/− with a combination of TGFβ1 and LRG1 failed to induce Smad 1/5 phosphorylation (Fig 5h). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this, similar treatment resulted in a significant increase in control cell division whilst that of MLEC;Eng−/− was significantly reduced and refractive to treatment with TGFβ1 ± LRG1 (Fig 5i). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>In addition, we employed an endothelial-specific conditional knockout approach in which metatarsals were harvested from Eng-floxed mice (Cdh5(PAC)-CreERT2;Engfl/fl)27 and treated with 4OH-tamoxifen (to generate Eng-iKOe metatarsals). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>This resulted in a loss of vascular ENG expression, compared to Engfl/fl controls (Supplementary Fig 30), and a 51% reduction in LRG1-induced vessel growth (P&lt;0.01; Fig 5j) and a 53% reduction in vessel branching (P&lt;0.05; Fig 5k). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>In agreement with these data, there were fewer pSmad1/5/8 positive cells in CNV lesions in Lrg1−/− mice compared to WT animals (Supplementary Fig 31). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in both CNV and OIR (during the neovascular phase) the Smad1/5 mediated pro-mitogenic gene inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (Id1) was significantly up-regulated (Supplementary Fig 5). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P20"><text><SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>TGFβ signalling plays an important role in determining EC function during both development and vascular pathology7,8,28,29 and its activity is regulated at multiple levels from gene expression to control of extracellular bioavailability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>The multiplicity of regulatory mechanisms together with variable combinations of receptors/co-receptors creates complex patterns of TGFβ activity that define its context-dependent effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>In particular, the balance between the ALK5 and ALK1 signalling pathways is considered to be central in determining the angiogenic switch with ENG being proposed as a key regulatory molecule in promoting signalling through the ALK1 pathway29-31. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>In searching for mediators of vascular remodelling in the diseased/damaged retina we have discovered a novel regulator of TGFß signalling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>The data presented here support a hypothesis that LRG1 activates the TGFβ angiogenic switch by binding to the accessory receptor ENG and, in the presence of TGFβ1, promotes signalling via the TβRII-ALK1-Smad1/5/8 pathway (Supplementary Fig 32). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our evidence suggests that LRG1 may play a more dominant role in disorganised pathological rather than developmental/physiological angiogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Whilst in the retina this is clearly supported by our in vivo data, the ex vivo and in vitro studies indicate that LRG1 angiogenic activity is not restricted to the eye. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>The modulating effect of LRG1 on TGFß1 signalling is the first demonstration of a definitive function for LRG1 and raises the intriguing possibility that it may influence other major biological processes in which TGFß plays a role including neoplasia32 and the immune response33. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of LRG1, which we show here causes a shift away from angiogenic signalling, could present an alternative way of preventing pathogenic activation of this pathway, whilst leaving homeostatic ALK1 signalling unperturbed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>From these studies we suggest, therefore, that LRG1 is a highly promising therapeutic target for controlling pathogenic angiogenesis in ocular disease, and potentially in other diseases such as cancer and atherosclerosis. </plain></SENT>
