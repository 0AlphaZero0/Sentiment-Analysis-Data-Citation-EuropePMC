</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The Poaceae family of grass species includes some of the most economically important agricultural crop species in the world. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Plants such as rice (Oryza sativa), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), maize (Zea mays), wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) provide a large share of the world’s food. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In order to increase crop productivity, genome sequencing projects have been initiated to provide genetic tools for plant improvement [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Grass species such as rice [2], sorghum [3], Brachypodium distachyon [4] have had their genomes completely sequenced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>For barley, a partial genome sequence became recently available which covers gene space but is incomplete in repetitive intergenic regions [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Model genomes such as rice [2], sorghum [3] and Brachypodium [5] have been used to infer gene order in wheat and barley: positional information of genes from syntenic regions in these three model genomes was compiled for the production of “chromosome zippers” [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>These were used to deduce a virtual gene order of the barley genome [7] and wheat group 1 chromosomes [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>However, these studies as well as sequencing of large contigs of chromosome 3B [9] also showed that both wheat and barley contain approximately 50% of non-colinear genes which cannot be ordered based on synteny to model genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Thus, the production of physical maps and ultimately a complete genome sequence are essential for map-based cloning and to determine the correct order of genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In wheat however, genome sequencing efforts are hampered by a large 17,000 Mb genome size (over 43 times larger than the rice genome), &gt;80% repetitive sequence [10], [11] and hexaploid (AABBDD) genome structure. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>One of the most important resources for physical mapping are bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Whole genome sequencing projects of Arabidopsis [12], rice [2] and maize [4], [13], [14] have all benefited from BAC-based physical maps to produce a scaffold structure for the construction of large, assembled chromosome sequences or pseudomolecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Contigs constructed from BAC clones provide a backbone to which sequence contigs can be anchored. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>This is especially valuable in large and repetitive genomes where simple whole-genome shotgun sequencing usually leads large numbers of un-ordered sequence contigs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>To reduce complexity of the wheat genome analysis, individual chromosomes (for the largest chromosome 3B) or chromosome arms can be isolated through cytometric flow-sorting based on their individual ‘flow karyotype’ [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Ditelosomic chromosome-specific wheat lines are used to purify individual chromosome arms that can then be used for the production of chromosome-specific BAC libraries, survey sequencing and physical maps [9], [15], [16], [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Chromosome 3B, the largest chromosome in wheat (∼1 Gb), was the first chromosome to be physically mapped. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>A chromosome 3B-specific BAC library was produced from flow-sorted chromosomes which was then used for the development of the physical map of wheat chromosome 3B [18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Flow-sorted chromosome arms were used recently for shotgun sequencing with Illumina technology in the framework of the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The sequence assemblies of this so-called “whole chromosome survey sequencing” are available through the IWGSC website (wheatgenome.org). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The assemblies resulted in hundreds of thousands of sequence contigs per chromosome arm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>These sequence contigs are mostly un-ordered but, nevertheless, are expected to cover almost the complete gene space of the individual chromosome arms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>A fraction of these sequences was ordered based on synteny using the chromosome zipper method [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the entire genome of wheat was recently surveyed by whole-genome shotgun sequencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>However, due to the large size and high repeat content of the genome, sequence assembly had to be limited on the gene-containing fraction [19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>BAC clones are typically digested with restriction enzymes which produces a specific fragment pattern for each BAC clone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>This “fingerprint” is then used to find overlaps between BACs and arrange them into physical BAC contigs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Modern high information content fingerprinting (HICF) is currently using restriction enzymes that produce particularly diverse fingerprint patterns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>FPC [20] has been the most popular fingerprint construction program for previous grass genome projects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>However, the application of FPC is limited when dealing with complex genomes such as wheat because highly repetitive, chimeric or poorly fingerprinted “questionable” clones (Q-clones) can create false overlaps and thus wrongly assemble contigs (called Q-contigs [21]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>To improve fingerprint contig assembly in highly repetitive genomes, the Linear Topological Contig (LTC) algorithm [21] was developed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>It improves contig assembly by avoiding large branching structures from multiple neighbouring BAC connections, to create physical contigs with linear topology. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The available genomic sequence resources in wheat described above are complemented by over 1 million expressed sequence tags (ESTs) which are publicly available at NCBI (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>These allow the characterisation of expressed genes as well as the assembly of so-called UniGene EST contigs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>For wheat, a NimbleGen 12×135 K microarray was designed containing 40,349 probes made from wheat UniGene sequences [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>This microarray can be used as a proxy to associate gene content with BAC clones without having the complete sequence information: hybridising BAC pools to that microarray allows the rapid identification of BAC clones containing a homolog of a UniGene that is present on the microarray. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>However, the results have to be used with caution because hybridisation signals do not distinguish between orthologs, paralogs, pseudogenes or gene fragments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, this resource was successfully used for the construction of a 3,000-locus transcriptome map for wheat chromosome 3B [22]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Low resolution physical mapping of genes has been done for several years on wheat lines which contain partial deletions of chromosome arms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>This so-called “deletion-bin mapping” was done with wheat ESTs across all wheat chromosomes [23], [24] and showed that genes were more frequently found in distal chromosomal regions than in proximal regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Recent studies using transcriptome mapping [22], [25] largely confirmed these findings but also indicated that about 75% of the genes on chromosome 3B are located in small gene islands containing on average three genes [25], thereby supporting earlier studies that suggested clustering of genes in certain regions [26], [27]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The short arm of chromosome 1A is one of the smallest chromosome arms of wheat and was estimated through cytogenetic methods to have a size of 275 Mb [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Chromosome arm 1AS is free of large C-banding regions that indicate regions of constitutive heterochromatin [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>It contains the disease resistance genes Pm3 [29] and Lr10 [30] as well as gene underlying other important traits such as low molecular weight (LMW) glutenin genes [31] and the tiller inhibition gene (tin) [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it contains at least three families of resistance gene analogs (RGAs, [33]). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>As member of the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium, we have produced a physical map of the short-arm of chromosome 1A. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>This physical map was assembled through high-information content fingerprinting (HICF) of a chromosome 1AS-specific BAC library using two different physical mapping algorithms and anchored to a chromosome 1AS transcriptome map using high-throughput microarray hybridisation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we produced an integrated sequence model that consists of genomic sequences that were ordered based on all available information resources. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>It comprises at total of 3.8 Mbp of sequences and consists of BAC-end sequences and 1AS survey sequence contigs that were anchored to the BAC contigs through genetic mapping and NimbleGen hybridisation data. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Second, the complexity of the wheat sequence limited the use of the standard physical mapping software FPC, because non-linear contigs were produced already at the initial contig construction, creating a faulty base for the map. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="380" pm="."><plain>Two markers (whs179 and F640) were integrated based on local genetic maps of the Pm3 [29] and Lr10 loci [55], respectively. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="381" pm="."><plain>The 16 genetic markers anchor 16 BAC contigs to a compiled genetic map of 50 cM (Figure 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="382" pm="."><plain>The order of the genetic maps largely corresponds to the order of the BAC contigs that was inferred from synteny to Brachypodium, rice and sorghum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="383" pm="."><plain>In only two cases (barc148 and fba393), the position on the genetic map contradicted the synteny-based anchoring. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="384" pm="."><plain>Synteny-based anchoring placed barc393 close to the centromere while it genetically maps close to the telomere. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="385" pm="."><plain>The inverse situation was found for marker barc148. Based on synteny, barc148 was anchored distantly at reference zipper gene 48 (Bradi4g38230). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="395" pm="."><plain>In the cases described here, the genetic centromere is spread out over almost 10 cM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="396" pm="."><plain>This is because the centromere is at different cM position depending on the population that was used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="397" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the 12 cM genetic distance between the Pm3 and Lr10 loci in the distal region of the physical map should not be taken at face value because different populations were used to map these two genes [29], [30]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="398" pm="."><plain>Although limited, the genetic data that we could integrate in the 1AS map is nevertheless insightful and it has implications for future genetic mapping and breeding projects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="399" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, it shows that large parts of the 1AS chromosome arm show very little recombination (at least in the genetic data that was available for this study). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="400" pm="."><plain>Previous studies on wheat chromosomes indicated that recombination frequencies are highest in distal regions while centromeric region show almost no recombination [57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="401" pm="."><plain>For example, on chromosome 3B, 42% of the physical map corresponds to only 2.2% of the genetic map in the centromeric regions [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="402" pm="."><plain>On 1AS, approximately half of the 1AS genetic map represents only about 100–120 genes of the 1S reference zipper. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="403" pm="."><plain>This means that half of all recombination events take place in a physical region that contains less than the distal 15% of genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="404" pm="."><plain>Thus, different approaches such as radiation hybrid mapping that are independent of recombination [58] will be necessary to precisely map most of the wheat chromosomes. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="448" pm="."><plain>Here, resources from 454 whole-genome sequencing [62] can be used to produce markers based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="449" pm="."><plain>Once a target gene is genetically located, BAC contigs can provide direct access to candidate gene sequences. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="452" pm="."><plain>The map also allows the reverse approach of identifying homologous regions of important chromosome 1AS genes in model systems, providing more efficient strategies in studying gene function [64], [65]. </plain></SENT>
