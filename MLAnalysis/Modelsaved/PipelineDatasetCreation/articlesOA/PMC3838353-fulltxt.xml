Undigested gliadin peptides P31-43 and P57-68 induce innate and adaptive T cell-mediated immune responses, respectively. Alterations in the cell shape and actin cytoskeleton are present in celiac enterocytes, and gliadin peptides induce actin rearrangements in both the CD mucosa and cell lines. Cell shape is maintained by the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesions, sites of membrane attachment to the extracellular matrix. The locus of the human Lipoma Preferred Partner (LPP) gene was identified as strongly associated with CD using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The LPP protein plays an important role in focal adhesion architecture and acts as a transcription factor in the nucleus. In this study, we examined the hypothesis that a constitutive alteration of the cell shape and the cytoskeleton, involving LPP, occurs in a cell compartment far from the main inflammation site in CD fibroblasts from skin explants. We analyzed the cell shape, actin organization, focal adhesion number, focal adhesion proteins, LPP sub-cellular distribution and adhesion to fibronectin of fibroblasts obtained from CD patients on a Gluten-Free Diet (GFD) and controls, without and with treatment with A-gliadin peptide P31-43. We observed a &#8220;CD cellular phenotype&#8221; in these fibroblasts, characterized by an altered cell shape and actin organization, increased number of focal adhesions, and altered intracellular LPP protein distribution. The treatment of controls fibroblasts with gliadin peptide P31-43 mimics the CD cellular phenotype regarding the cell shape, adhesion capacity, focal adhesion number and LPP sub-cellular distribution, suggesting a close association between these alterations and CD pathogenesis.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by PRIN 2009 (Research Programs of National Interest), code CUP E61J11000300001.

LPP also plays an important role in tumor metastasis and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2/neu-mediated mammary oncogenesis <xref rid="pone.0079763-Shepherd1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Recently, LPP was identified as a substrate of the protein-tyrosine-phosphatase 1B, a negative regulator of multiple signaling pathways downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases, and functionally associated with Ras signaling <xref rid="pone.0079763-Mertins1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0079763-Dub1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>The locus of the human LPP gene was strongly associated with CD through GWAS studies in different populations <xref rid="pone.0079763-Abadie1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. An association between LPP-SNP rs1464510 &#8220;AA&#8221; and CD has also been revealed in potential CD (patients with normal intestines and HLA DQ2/8 and anti-tTg antibodies in the serum) <xref rid="pone.0079763-Sperandeo1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. None of the CD-associated SNPs mapped to the coding sequence of LPP. More recently four SNPs were associated with transcription factor-binding sites, suggesting that the dysregulation of transcription-binding properties might be the causal mechanism underlying the association of CD with the LPP region <xref rid="pone.0079763-Almeida1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Therefore, we studied the localization of LPP in focal adhesions and the expression and sub-cellular localization of this protein in CD fibroblasts compared with controls. We found that LPP co-localized with paxillin in focal adhesions and that the number of paxillin focal adhesions co-stained with LPP was increased in CD fibroblasts. Although paxillin and FAK proteins were increased, there was no increase of LPP protein and mRNA levels in CD fibroblasts, indicating a different sub-cellular distribution of LPP in CD cells with respect to the controls.</p><p>The different distribution of LPP protein in CD cells might have several biological effects. For example, the increased LPP localization at the focal adhesions could alter cellular adhesion, motility and shape, and the reduced amount of LPP in the nucleus could alter the transcriptional activity of this protein. We found that the levels of LPP protein, in the nuclear fraction, was reduced in CD fibroblasts compared with control cells. This result was consistent with the hypothesis that the altered transcriptional activity of LPP might be involved in celiac disease <xref rid="pone.0079763-Grunewald1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. No differences between patients with the LPP &#8220;AA&#8221; risk allele and other CD patients were observed with regard to the sub-cellular distribution of LPP protein.</p><p>Very likely alterations of phospho-paxillin and phospho-FAK and delocalization of LPP are the consequences of complex signaling involving several pathways including small-GTP binging proteins, known regulators of these cell activities. Moreover Rho A and B have been described to be involved in CD patients transglutaminase-2 targeted autoantibodies effects on endothelial differentiation <xref rid="pone.0079763-Martucciello1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0079763-Myrsky1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, we described a &#8220;CD cellular phenotype&#8221; involving LPP protein, whose gene is strongly associated with CD. This phenotype is present in all CD subjects, independent of the at-risk genotype (AA). Similarly, in other polygenic intestinal inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn's disease, a disease phenotype present in all patients has been observed <xref rid="pone.0079763-Thachil1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Indeed, an alteration of the autophagy of the Paneth cells is present in Crohn's biopsies, independent of the genetic variants of the autophagic pathway observed in Crohn's patients. This observation indicates that a disease cellular phenotype could be present in all subjects with polygenic diseases. These results suggest that SNPs could serve as a marker for the metabolic pathways involved in the disease, although their association was only observed in a small percentage of the patients.</p><p>Focal contact sites are located at the point of contact of the cells with the extracellular environment. Therefore, we evaluated the adhesion of CD and control fibroblasts to fibronectin and found that a larger number of CD fibroblasts adhere to the substrate compared to the controls.</p><p>We subsequently challenged both the controls and CD fibroblasts with gliadin peptide P31-43. Interestingly, the toxic peptide P31-43 induced the &#8220;cellular CD phenotype&#8221; in control fibroblasts. Indeed, treatment with gliadin peptide P31-43 altered the cell shape, with shortened actin stress fibers and increased area, in the control fibroblasts. In addition, the focal contact sites were also altered in controls fibroblasts after P31-43 treatment, with increased focal adhesion numbers and increased paxillin and FAK phosphorylation.</p><p>Interestingly, the distribution of LPP was affected after P31-43 treatment, with increased co-localization of LPP protein with paxillin at focal adhesions. Moreover, the adhesion of controls fibroblasts to fibronectin increased after treatment with P31-43.</p><p>Taken all together, these results suggest that the &#8220;toxic&#8221; gliadin peptide P31-43 is active in the same cellular pathways that involve cell shape and adhesion, which are constitutively altered in CD cells. Interestingly, P31-43 treatment altered the number of the focal adhesions, phosphorylation of paxillin and FAK, LPP distribution and adhesion to fibronectin also in CD fibroblasts.</p><p>Although the mechanism by which gliadin peptides affect cell shape and adhesion has not been elucidated, this might reflect the known effects of P31-43 on endocytic functions, actin remodeling, epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling <xref rid="pone.0079763-Barone1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0079763-Barone3" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079763-Reinke1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079763-Zimmer1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0079763-Hanson1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.

This &#8220;CD cellular phenotype&#8221; is reproduced in control cells through treatment with P31-43, implying a close association between these alterations and CD pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0079763.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Costaining of FAK and actin in CD and controls fibroblasts.
