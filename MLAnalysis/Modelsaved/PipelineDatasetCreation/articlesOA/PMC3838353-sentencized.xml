</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Celiac disease (CD) is characterized by mucosal inflammation due to the Th1 T cell response to certain gliadin peptides (e.g., the 33-mer A-gliadin peptide) [1] and the innate immune response to other gliadin peptides (e.g., A-gliadin peptide P31-43) [2]–[3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Recent data have shown that gliadin peptides, particularly peptide P31-43, act as growth factors for cell lines, such as CaCo-2, and induce the proliferation of celiac crypt enterocytes [4]–[6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Because both the 33-mer peptide containing P57-68 [7]–[8] and the 25-mer peptide containing P31-43 (P31-55) [9] are resistant to hydrolysis by gastric, pancreatic and intestinal proteases, these peptides remain active in vivo in the intestine after gluten ingestion. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Alterations of the actin cytoskeleton of epithelial cells are also observed in the celiac mucosa [10], and gluten-dependent shorter enterocyte heights have been described in CD [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Tight junction proteins are also altered in active CD, leading to increased permeability [12]–[13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, gliadin and gliadin peptides, including P31-43, interfere with actin rearrangements in both the CD mucosa and cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The in vivo treatment of the small intestine of celiac disease patients with gliadin peptides causes the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton in enterocytes [14]–[15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon is also detectable in Caco-2 cells, a cell line commonly used to study gliadin effects on metabolism, barrier functions and apoptosis [16]–[17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The treatment of CaCo-2 cells with peptic-tryptic gliadin digest and the truncated toxic peptide P31–43 causes rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton similar to those induced by epidermal growth factor (EGF); [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Quantitative microscopic analysis revealed that gliadin directly damages F-actin and tight junction proteins in Lovo cells [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The direct interaction of gliadin peptides with actin impairs protein trafficking in COS1 cells [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Moreover, gliadin peptides induce cytoskeleton remodeling with altered motility in dendritic cells [20]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>CD has been strongly associated with HLA-DQ 2/8 isotypes, which are necessary but not sufficient to produce this autoimmune disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>A total of 39 non-HLA susceptibility loci have recently been identified through repeated GWAS and explain approximately 10–14% of the CD heritability; combined with the HLA locus, only 50% of the CD heritability is explained [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The strongest non-HLA association signal maps to a 70-kb linkage disequilibrium (LD) block in intron 2 of the LPP gene [22]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>LPP protein localizes at focal adhesions, which are sites of membrane attachment to the extracellular matrix, in cell-cell contacts, and in the cytoplasm and nucleus [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>LPP protein is a proline-rich protein [24] previously identified in fibroblasts [25] that plays an important role in focal adhesion architecture as a versatile scaffolding and adaptor protein and also acts as a transcription factor in the nucleus [23]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>As a scaffold and adaptor protein, LPP harbors various binding sites, one of which is a VASP (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein)-binding site, which increases actin polymerization, leading to cell protrusions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>After binding to LPP, VASP is recruited to cell adhesion sites, thus directing changes in actin dynamics [23]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to analyze the actin cytoskeleton, cell shape, focal adhesions and adhesion to the substrate of skin fibroblasts, from CD patients and controls along with the sub-cellular distribution of the LPP protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Finally we studied the effects of gliadin peptide P31-43 on the shape and adhesion of controls and CD fibroblasts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Skin fibroblasts, a cell compartment far from the main inflammation site, allowed to investigate differences at base line and following gliadin peptides stimulation in CD patients and controls. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>In this study, we described a “CD cellular phenotype” characterized by altered cell shape and actin distribution, increased adhesion structures and proteins, including LPP, and increased adhesion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>The gliadin peptide P31-43 induces the same phenotype in control fibroblasts. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>Alterations in the actin cytoskeleton and tight junctions have previously been described in CD intestinal mucosa [4], [10], [15], indicating that cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell contacts might be involved in celiac lesions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>We observed an altered cell shape with shorter actin stress fibers and increased cell area in CD fibroblasts, demonstrating that alterations in the cell structure can be observed in cells far from the intestinal lesion and in the absence of gliadin peptides. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>We observed similar results in a different cell population: CD dendritic cells (DCs) showed a constitutive alteration of the cytoskeleton and the cell shape after adhesion to fibronectin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>When in contact with fibronectin, the DCs from CD patients (both active and on a gluten-free diet) were more elongated with long dendrites compared with controls (unpublished data). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>Cell structure is maintained through the actin cytoskeleton and focal contacts sites with the extracellular environment [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>These specialized cell adhesion sites play a role in the architectural organization and polarity of the cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a marker for focal contacts sites, and FAK-Src signals regulate cell motility and focal contact localization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>At the point of contact with the substrate, integrin clustering promotes FAK auto phosphorylation at Tyr-397, facilitating the formation of the focal adhesions at substrate contact points and actin filament initiation sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>Paxillin is another protein that acts at focal contact sites, and this protein binds to FAK and integrin [33]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>Paxillin- and FAK-positive focal adhesions were increased in CD fibroblasts when expressed per cell or per unit of surface area. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>We also observed an increase of the FAK and paxillin protein levels and of the phosphorylation of these proteins in CD fibroblasts, suggesting an over representation of these specialized cell adhesion sites in the absence of gluten and at locations far from the main inflammation site. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>Alterations of the actin cytoskeleton and the focal adhesions observed in CD fibroblasts prompted an examination of the expression and distribution of LPP, which is also localized at the contact sites of these cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>LPP plays a role in both the function of cell adhesion sites and the genetics of CD. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>Specialized cell adhesion sites are dynamic units that are directly involved in communicational processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>Adhesion receptors and their cytoskeletal partners regulate the nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking of signaling proteins and therefore influence gene expression [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>LPP possesses a nuclear export signal and shuttle from nucleus to focal adhesions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>Within the nucleus, LPP acts as a transcription factor, enhancing the transcriptional activity of several genes, alone or in cooperation with other proteins [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>LPP also plays an important role in tumor metastasis and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2/neu-mediated mammary oncogenesis [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>Recently, LPP was identified as a substrate of the protein-tyrosine-phosphatase 1B, a negative regulator of multiple signaling pathways downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases, and functionally associated with Ras signaling [36]–[37]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>The locus of the human LPP gene was strongly associated with CD through GWAS studies in different populations [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>An association between LPP-SNP rs1464510 “AA” and CD has also been revealed in potential CD (patients with normal intestines and HLA DQ2/8 and anti-tTg antibodies in the serum) [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>None of the CD-associated SNPs mapped to the coding sequence of LPP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>More recently four SNPs were associated with transcription factor-binding sites, suggesting that the dysregulation of transcription-binding properties might be the causal mechanism underlying the association of CD with the LPP region [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we studied the localization of LPP in focal adhesions and the expression and sub-cellular localization of this protein in CD fibroblasts compared with controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>We found that LPP co-localized with paxillin in focal adhesions and that the number of paxillin focal adhesions co-stained with LPP was increased in CD fibroblasts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>Although paxillin and FAK proteins were increased, there was no increase of LPP protein and mRNA levels in CD fibroblasts, indicating a different sub-cellular distribution of LPP in CD cells with respect to the controls. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="343" pm="."><plain>The different distribution of LPP protein in CD cells might have several biological effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>For example, the increased LPP localization at the focal adhesions could alter cellular adhesion, motility and shape, and the reduced amount of LPP in the nucleus could alter the transcriptional activity of this protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>We found that the levels of LPP protein, in the nuclear fraction, was reduced in CD fibroblasts compared with control cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>This result was consistent with the hypothesis that the altered transcriptional activity of LPP might be involved in celiac disease [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>No differences between patients with the LPP “AA” risk allele and other CD patients were observed with regard to the sub-cellular distribution of LPP protein. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>Very likely alterations of phospho-paxillin and phospho-FAK and delocalization of LPP are the consequences of complex signaling involving several pathways including small-GTP binging proteins, known regulators of these cell activities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>Moreover Rho A and B have been described to be involved in CD patients transglutaminase-2 targeted autoantibodies effects on endothelial differentiation [40]–[41]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we described a “CD cellular phenotype” involving LPP protein, whose gene is strongly associated with CD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>This phenotype is present in all CD subjects, independent of the at-risk genotype (AA). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="352" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in other polygenic intestinal inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn's disease, a disease phenotype present in all patients has been observed [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="353" pm="."><plain>Indeed, an alteration of the autophagy of the Paneth cells is present in Crohn's biopsies, independent of the genetic variants of the autophagic pathway observed in Crohn's patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="354" pm="."><plain>This observation indicates that a disease cellular phenotype could be present in all subjects with polygenic diseases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="355" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that SNPs could serve as a marker for the metabolic pathways involved in the disease, although their association was only observed in a small percentage of the patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="356" pm="."><plain>Focal contact sites are located at the point of contact of the cells with the extracellular environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="357" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we evaluated the adhesion of CD and control fibroblasts to fibronectin and found that a larger number of CD fibroblasts adhere to the substrate compared to the controls. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="358" pm="."><plain>We subsequently challenged both the controls and CD fibroblasts with gliadin peptide P31-43. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="359" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the toxic peptide P31-43 induced the “cellular CD phenotype” in control fibroblasts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="360" pm="."><plain>Indeed, treatment with gliadin peptide P31-43 altered the cell shape, with shortened actin stress fibers and increased area, in the control fibroblasts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="361" pm="."><plain>In addition, the focal contact sites were also altered in controls fibroblasts after P31-43 treatment, with increased focal adhesion numbers and increased paxillin and FAK phosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="362" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the distribution of LPP was affected after P31-43 treatment, with increased co-localization of LPP protein with paxillin at focal adhesions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="363" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the adhesion of controls fibroblasts to fibronectin increased after treatment with P31-43. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="364" pm="."><plain>Taken all together, these results suggest that the “toxic” gliadin peptide P31-43 is active in the same cellular pathways that involve cell shape and adhesion, which are constitutively altered in CD cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="365" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, P31-43 treatment altered the number of the focal adhesions, phosphorylation of paxillin and FAK, LPP distribution and adhesion to fibronectin also in CD fibroblasts. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="366" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanism by which gliadin peptides affect cell shape and adhesion has not been elucidated, this might reflect the known effects of P31-43 on endocytic functions, actin remodeling, epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling [4]–[6], [19], [43]–[46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="367" pm="."><plain>Moreover constitutive activation of the EGFR/ERK pathway in CD fibroblasts and enterocytes from CD biopsies has been demonstrated, independent of the stage of the disease, the gluten content of the diet and the site of inflammation [47]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="368" pm="."><plain>Alterations of the cell shape and interactions with the extracellular matrix have recently been described by measuring collagen production and cellular displacement in fibroblasts from intestinal biopsies of CD patients with respect to controls [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="369" pm="."><plain>The structural and functional changes of fibroblasts might play a role in the alterations of the proliferation-differentiation program of the enterocytes present in CD and the establishment of celiac intestinal lesions [49]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="370" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we described constitutive alterations involving LPP in the cell shape and adhesion of CD fibroblasts that occurred in all CD patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="371" pm="."><plain>This “CD cellular phenotype” is reproduced in control cells through treatment with P31-43, implying a close association between these alterations and CD pathogenesis. </plain></SENT>
