The biochemical function of PRC2 in depositing repressive H3K27me3 marks is well understood, but how it is regulated and directed to specific genes before and during differentiation remains unknown.

Using <italic>in vivo</italic> RNA&#8211;protein crosslinking, we show that EZH2 directly binds to the 5&#8242; of nascent RNAs transcribed from a subset of these promoters and that these binding events correlate with decreased H3K27me3.

The cellular memories orchestrated by PRC2 are critical to the maintenance of cell identity, which is an essential requisite for the existence of multicellular life<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">The central biochemical function of PRC2 is that of depositing methyl groups on histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), which in turn leads to the formation of facultative heterochromatin and transcriptional repression<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Once established, this repressive structure is thought to propagate itself via a positive feedback loop based in part on the recognition of H3K27me3 by the PRC2 subunit EED<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. However, the manner by which PRC2&#8212;and, more generally, the PcG axis&#8212;selects genes to be repressed remains the subject of intense interest, which is magnified by the recent implication of PRC2 and H3K27 in a number of malignancies<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">EZH2 is the most prominent catalytic subunit of PRC2 in pluripotent cells<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>.

Although in some cases binding to these RNAs has been shown to influence chromatin recruitment, the fact that so many RNAs can bind is a clear indication that our current models to explain the function of PRC2&#8211;RNA interactions are lacking important components and/or that immunoprecipitations and <italic>in vitro</italic> binding approaches may not suffice to determine with the required specificity the nature of the true interactions <italic>in vivo</italic>.

In fact, the binding of EZH2 and of several other chromatin-associated proteins to ncRNAs is rather promiscuous <italic>in vitro</italic> (S.K., R.B., unpublished), suggesting that additional specificity determinants must exist <italic>in vivo</italic>, and strongly supporting the use of <italic>in vivo</italic> crosslinking strategies to capture functionally relevant RNA&#8211;protein interactions on chromatin.</p><p id="P7">Because UV-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation approaches are extremely sensitive to contamination from abundant RNA-interacting proteins that may remain undetected by western blot, we generated ESC lines expressing, in an inducible manner, physiological levels of EZH2 fused to three different epitope tags (N3&#8211;EZH2, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a,b</xref>), allowing for tandem (and triple) affinity purifications, which, we reasoned, would minimize chances of contamination. As previously reported, N-terminal tagging of EZH2 did not perturb its incorporation into the PRC2 complex or its enzymatic activity (data not shown), and did not affect its distribution on chromatin (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1c,d</xref>), consistent with our earlier studies<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, as well as a recent electron microscopy reconstruction of the PRC2 holoenzyme<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p id="P8">UVC irradiation followed by HA CLIP<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> on N3&#8211;EZH2-expressing ESCs revealed the presence of a labeled protein migrating slightly above the predicted molecular weight for N3&#8211;EZH2. The radiolabeled band was only visible upon induction of N3&#8211;EZH2 expression and UVC irradiation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>), and therefore we concluded that it corresponded to RNA crosslinked to EZH2. Because the short-wavelength UVC irradiation appeared to cause extensive photodamage to EZH2 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>), in the following experiments we resorted to PAR-CLIP<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, a modification of the CLIP technology that allows for crosslinking with UV light at longer wavelengths and lower energy. After HA IP in stringent detergent conditions that disrupted the core PRC2 complex (S.K., R.B., unpublished), autoradiography revealed that EZH2 was crosslinked to <sup>32</sup>P-labeled material that was sensitive to RNase treatment (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). We also noted that higher 4-SU concentrations and irradiation with UVB (312 nm) rather than UVA resulted in more efficient crosslinking (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>) and chose these conditions for the following experiments. Together, these data support the conclusion that EZH2 establishes direct physical contacts with RNA in ESCs that can be identified by CLIP or PAR-CLIP approaches.</p><p id="P9">To recover RNA amounts sufficient to construct libraries for deep sequencing while minimizing contaminations during the IP, we scaled up our PAR-CLIP strategy and performed tandem affinity purification with StrepTactin-coupled resin followed by HA IP (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>), in 4 biological replicates. Deep sequencing of the CLIP tags eluted from the EZH2 bands (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>) yielded &#8764;60 million reads, of which &#8764;30% could be aligned to the genome (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Of these, 40% displayed the T&gt;C transition diagnostic of 4-SU mediated crosslinking (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). Initial validations of the alignments confirmed that the replicates were highly concordant (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2a,b</xref>) and that known EZH2-interacting lncRNAs, such as <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> and <italic>Meg3</italic><sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> (S.K., R.B., unpublished), accumulated considerable numbers of CLIP tags (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>).

Although several RCSs localized to lncRNAs as expected<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, the majority of them was in the body of protein-coding genes (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>), suggesting the existence of unknown interactions between EZH2 and a vast number of RNAs. Visual inspection of the genes accumulating the largest number of RCSs revealed a striking bias for CLIP tags that mapped to the 5&#8242; region of the mRNA with no apparent distinction between exons and introns (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>), suggesting that EZH2 (and therefore PRC2) made direct physical contact with nascent RNAs. This was consistent with a study in HCT116 cells, which reported several intronic CLIP tags associated with EZH2 despite shallower sequencing compared to our PAR-CLIP<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">We confirmed the 5&#8242; bias in EZH2&#8211;RNA contacts at the genome-wide level by mapping the RCSs identified above to all mouse transcripts and plotting their distribution over the body of the 250 genes that exhibited the strongest signal, and thus were more likely to reflect true <italic>in vivo</italic> interactions (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). This bias was not an artefact of RCS identification, as it was readily visible also when we mapped the raw CLIP tags to the gene models in a similar fashion (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>). In both cases (RCS or raw CLIP tag mapping), the bias became more obvious as we increased the stringency of our bioinformatic cutoff (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Both CLIP tags containing the T&gt;C mutation, diagnostic of RNA&#8211;protein crosslinks, and those not containing the mutation, more likely to be contaminants, peaked at the TSS (i.e. at the first exon) and to a lesser extent at the TTS (i.e. at the last exon), but the T&gt;C tags were more broadly enriched over the 5&#8242; of the transcript body (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>), confirming that <italic>bona fide</italic> CLIP tags crosslinked to EZH2 also originated from introns. Indeed, EZH2 CLIP tags mapped equally well to the beginning of the first exon or of the first intron of protein-coding genes (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>), lending further support to the conclusion that EZH2 establishes these contacts with RNA during transcription and before further mRNA processing can occur. To verify that the observed 5&#8242; bias was not due to misannotation of the 3&#8242; portions of some of these genes, we analyzed the distribution of conventional RNA-seq, which is expected to display a 3&#8242; bias due to oligo-dT purification. Indeed, conventional RNA-seq displayed the expected 3&#8242; bias (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>), and clear discrimination between exons and introns (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>) demonstrating that the 5&#8242; bias displayed by the CLIP tags was not an artefact of our bioinformatic analyses. Chasing the 4-SU pulse with non-crosslinkable uridine led to a fading of the EZH2-associated PAR-CLIP signal (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>), further supporting the conclusion that EZH2 bound preferentially to nascent RNAs.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>EZH2-bound RNAs originate from PRC2<sup>lo</sup> genes</title><p id="P12">Because CLIP tags mapped equally well to introns and exons (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>), we defined a moderately conservative set of EZH2-bound nascent RNAs (henceforth referred to as ezRNAs), based on the presence of at least 3 separate RCSs in their introns. Using this parameter, we identified 1,108 transcripts originating from 784 genes (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Genes encoding ezRNAs were enriched in GO terms suggestive of transcriptional control and nuclear processes, including &#8220;chromatin modification&#8221; and &#8220;regulation of transcription&#8221; (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Having observed EZH2 peaks at the promoters of visually inspected ezRNA<sup>+</sup> genes (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>), we wished to determine whether this was a general feature of RNAs crosslinked to EZH2, despite the fact that, at least based on GO enrichment, ezRNA<sup>+</sup> genes constituted a set distinct from traditional <italic>Polycomb</italic> target genes<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Indeed, EZH2 CLIP-tags tended to accumulate near chromatin regions enriched for EZH2 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>); however, plotting the distribution of ezRNAs on a heatmap of all RefSeq TSSs sorted by PRC2 occupancy revealed that they were missing not only from regions with no detectable PRC2 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>), as expected, but also from regions with very high PRC2 levels (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>), and originated, for the most part, from TSSs with intermediate levels of PRC2, which, to our surprise, comprised a majority of all annotated TSSs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). On the other hand, when the TSSs were sorted by H3K27me3 density, the ezRNA-producing TSSs clustered in the rightmost section of the heatmap, in regions depleted for this histone mark (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). We independently validated this observation by analyzing a different ChIP-seq dataset<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, generated in the same cell line and similar culture conditions. Consistent with our findings above, ezRNAs mapped to genes with intermediate levels of EZH2 and low levels of H3K27me3 also in this dataset (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4a,b</xref>). Despite the presence of PRC2, genes giving rise to ezRNAs were transcriptionally active, as demonstrated by the enrichment of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 compared to a random gene set of equal size (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>), and were by and large distinct from bivalent genes<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4c,d</xref>).</p><p id="P14">The presence of EZH2 at such a large proportion of genes, including actively transcribed ones, was unexpected; therefore, we sought confirmatory evidence for this finding. Consistent with the results above, SUZ12, another core subunit of PRC2, was also found at a majority of TSSs, (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4e</xref>), although the overall enrichment with this antibody was considerably lower (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>). Moreover, the ChIP-seq profiles obtained with HA antibodies in N3&#8211;EZH2-expressing mouse ESCs were indistinguishable from those obtained with EZH2 antibodies in the parental cell line (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1c,d</xref>), and in both cases peaks of considerable intensity were easily discernible in the promoter regions of genes that would be traditionally considered PRC2-negative (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>).</p><p id="P15">In summary, the results above show that ezRNAs originate from a subset of genes that, although occupied by intermediate levels of PRC2, are actively transcribed in mouse ESCs and devoid of H3K27me3.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Genes producing ezRNAs have lower H3K27me3 levels in ESCs</title><p id="P16">Because genes producing ezRNAs were decorated with chromatin marks consistent with productive transcription (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>) and their distribution correlated negatively with H3K27me3 density at a genome-wide level (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>), we hypothesized that, despite the presence of PRC2, their promoters might be devoid of H3K27me3. Indeed, when we compared the set of genes producing ezRNAs to a control gene set, matched gene-by-gene for the amount of PRC2 at their promoter, we found that the latter had higher amounts of H3K27me3 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>) despite equal amounts of PRC2 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Consistent with the lower levels of H3K27me3, these genes were expressed at higher levels than the control set, as shown by an average increase in RNA-seq RPKM values (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). When we matched the control by equalizing RPKMs rather than PRC2 levels, the difference in H3K27me3 was reduced but still noticeable (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>), suggesting that differences in RNA transcription alone are not sufficient to explain the changes in H3K27me3 levels and that contacts between EZH2 and nascent RNAs may influence the function of PRC2 on chromatin. Differences in the average H3K27me3 profiles were not due to a few outliers because regression curves fitted through the individual points had different slopes, confirming that in general ezRNA<sup>+</sup> genes contained less H3K27me3 than expected based on PRC2 levels alone (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). The differences in H3K27me3 at these genes was also observed in ChIP-seq profiles generated in different laboratories and even using different ESC lines and different culture conditions<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Finally, we wished to determine the fate of genes producing ezRNAs in committed cells that had lost the pluripotent characteristics of ESCs.

The difference in H3K27me3 densities on ezRNAs genes versus an EZH2-matched control was pronounced in the pluripotent V6.5 ESCs (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>), but it was much decreased in MEFs (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>), suggesting that upon differentiation, several of the genes that produced ezRNAs in ESCs can become fully repressed by acquiring H3K27me3. Presumably, repression caused decreased synthesis of ezRNAs and consequent increased deposition of H3K27me3 by PRC2, but only EZH2 PAR-CLIP in MEFs could confirm this hypothesis. Regardless, the accumulation of H3K27me3 at ezRNA<sup>+</sup> genes proves that the lack of PRC2 activity at those genes in ESCs was not due to any intrinsic property of their promoters, but rather it was a consequence of dynamic processes, specific to ESCs, likely involving the production and recognition of ezRNAs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S7"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P18">By performing PAR-CLIP-seq for EZH2 in undifferentiated mouse ESCs (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), we have identified a family of nascent transcripts that bind to EZH2 while they are being transcribed and before they are spliced and processed into mature mRNAs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The majority of these nascent transcripts originate from transcriptionally active regions containing intermediate or low levels of PRC2 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>), which we detected in multiple biological replicates and using different antibodies (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>), as well as in datasets generated by other groups (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). A peculiar characteristic of these ezRNA-producing genes is the lack of H3K27me3, despite measurable levels of PRC2 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), which hints at the possibility that PRC2 might function as RNA &#8220;sensor&#8221; (see below).</p><p id="P19">One conclusion of our study is that PRC2, at least in mouse ESCs, binds to a majority of promoters. In addition to regions where PRC2 is entrenched and large amounts of H3K27me3 accumulate (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>), low but detectable levels of EZH2 are present at a majority of TSSs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c, Fig. 3f</xref>), including many that have no detectable H3K27me3. The PRC2<sup>hi</sup> regions correlate with strong repression and contain the gene targets that have traditionally been associated with PcG function in ESCs<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>, including developmental regulators such as the <italic>Hox</italic> genes. At these genes heterochromatin has already been nucleated and is likely propagated by the known positive feedback cycles affecting PRC2<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. On the other hand, the PRC2<sup>lo</sup> promoters appear to be transcriptionally competent if not completely activated, and this is in contrast with the traditional view that PRC2 enforces epigenetic repression. What might be the reason for this constitutive and broad TSS occupancy and how can we explain that these genes are transcribed despite the presence of PRC2?</p><p id="P20">Considering that the function of the PcG axis is that of maintaining&#8212;not establishing&#8212; transcriptional repression<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>, the results presented above suggest a model wherein PRC2 exerts its epigenetic function by sensing the activation states of promoters through contacts with nascent RNAs (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The first step of this model is &#8220;promoter sampling&#8221;, that is the ability of PRC2 to interact with a majority of TSSs, at least in pluripotent mouse ESCs, using low affinity or low frequency binding events (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>), possibly directed by GC-rich sequences<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>, other protein factors<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>, and even ncRNAs<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> (S.K., R.B., unpublished). This broad promoter surveillance gives PRC2 the opportunity to survey the activation state of a large number of genes. If the surveyed gene is active and transcription is ongoing, PRC2 &#8220;senses&#8221; this by interacting with the nascent RNA, presumably still tethered to RNA polymerase II, and this interaction causes a decreased deposition of H3K27me3, allowing chromatin to stay open and the promoter to remain active. Whether and how exactly ezRNA&#8211;EZH2 contacts directly cause decreased H3K27me3 are open questions that will require further investigation. It is tempting to speculate that RNA contacts directly inhibit the enzymatic activity of EZH2 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b, I</xref>), but we can also envision more complex scenarios, in which one or more components of the PRC2 complex might be evicted from chromatin through interactions with or competition from ezRNAs (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b, II</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Whatever the mechanism may be, PRC2 responds to the activated state of ezRNA<sup>+</sup> promoters by not depositing H3K27me3, which allows the gene to remain active; however, the <italic>Polycomb</italic> axis is better known for maintenance of repression, not activation. How does this fit our model? We propose that when the cell detects a new stimulus, for example during differentiation, DNA-binding transcriptional repressors are expressed <italic>de novo</italic> or are otherwise activated, enter the nucleus, bind to chromatin, and silence their target genes, abolishing the production of nascent RNAs at these loci. Without inhibitory ezRNAs, PRC2 complexes that are still surveying these loci deposit increased amounts of H3K27me3, which establish repressed chromatin structures (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). As H3K27me3 marks accumulate, a tipping point is reached when heterochromatic structures are maintained in an epigenetic manner<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, even in absence of the original transcriptional repressor (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Although the physical contacts between RNA and EZH2 reported herein are highly suggestive of a direct regulatory mechanism, we cannot exclude that other molecular features associated with ongoing transcription may also contribute to the attenuation of PRC2 activity. For example, others and we recently showed that, in certain contexts, the presence of H3K4me3 inhibits the enzymatic activity of PRC2<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. This regulatory mechanism may function in addition to or in cooperation with the recognition of ezRNAs.</p><p id="P23">Our results and the model presented above are consistent with the genetic evidence that PRC2 does not repress transcription <italic>de novo</italic> but rather senses loci that are already silenced, and maintain their repressed state over time and cell division<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, PRC2 binds to the <italic>Polycomb</italic> responsive element of <italic>Ultrabithorax</italic> independent of its activation state, but H3K27me3 only spreads to the promoter and body of the gene in imaginal discs that repress <italic>Ultrabithorax</italic><sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. In fact, transient activation of a reporter locus controlled by <italic>Polycomb</italic> is sufficient to switch its epigenetic state from repressed to active<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>, which fits well with our proposed model in which PRC2 is inhibited by active transcription.</p><p id="P24">Although we focused our attention on the 784 top ezRNA<sup>+</sup> candidates, to our knowledge this is the first report of genome-wide PAR-CLIP for a non-canonical RNA binding protein (the second counting Guil <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>, who performed CLIP without 4-SU), and we must consider the possibility that other nascent RNAs that we cannot detect with the current protocol might bind to EZH2 <italic>in vivo</italic>. In fact, according to our model, binding to RNA is likely to be very promiscuous <italic>in vivo</italic>, because the presence of RNA, not necessarily specific sequences or structures, would suffice to deliver a regulatory signal to PRC2. This would help explain the large number of EZH2-interacting RNA species recovered by previous studies<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, but it does not exclude that other RNAs, particularly lncRNAs, may have evolved to further exploit this property of EZH2 in the context of complex regulatory scenarios such as that of X chromosome inactivation<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> or imprinting<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P25">In conclusion, we propose that, at least in mammals, PRC2 performs its epigenetic function by sensing the presence of active transcription via interactions with nascent RNAs and curtailing its activity on chromatin in their presence. The increased facility by which the genome of ESCs can be edited will soon offer the opportunity to test this hypothesis experimentally.</p></sec><sec id="S9" specific-use="web-only"><title>Online Methods</title><p id="P27">Original images of gels, autoradiographs and blots used in this study can be found in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>.</p><sec id="S10"><title>Antibodies</title><p id="P28">For the purpose of CLIP and PAR-CLIP, we used 2&#8211;10 &#956;g of anti-HA antibody (Abcam ab9110, lot GR98618-2).

(<bold>a</bold>) In ESCs, PRC2 binds to a majority of TSSs in mouse ESCs, independent of their transcriptional state, sampling their activity. (<bold>b</bold>) Regulation of PRC2 activity occurs during the &#8220;sensing&#8221; phase, when PRC2 binds to nascent ezRNAs that somehow impede the deposition of H3K27me3 on chromatin. This could happen either by (I) inhibition of PRC2 activity, possibly dependent on additional <italic>in vivo</italic> factors, or (II) eviction of PRC2 from chromatin or of other factors required for H3K27me3 deposition. This allows the cell to continue expressing genes for which activating transcription factors are present, despite the constant presence of PRC2. (<bold>c</bold>) During differentiation, lineage specific transcriptional repressors are upregulated and silence transcriptional activity at selected target genes. Lacking the inhibitory ezRNAs, PRC2 initiates deposition of H3K27me3, establishing the nucleating conditions for the formation of facultative heterochromatin. (<bold>d</bold>) By the time the differentiation program is completed, a positive feedback loop of H3K27me3 deposition, EED binding, PRC2 recruitment, and more H3K27me3 deposition gives rise to stable and self-perpetuating facultative heterochromatin, which maintains transcriptional repression even after the original transcription factor ceases to be expressed<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms527986f5"/></fig></floats-group></article>
