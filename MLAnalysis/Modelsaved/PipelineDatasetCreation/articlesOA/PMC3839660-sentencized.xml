</text></title><p id="P2"><text><SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Polycomb-group (PcG) protein complexes and, in particular, Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) are epigenetic regulators that sense the establishment of transcriptional repression during the early phases of development and maintain it after expression of the establishing factors wanes, often for very long periods of time and through several rounds of cell division. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cellular memories orchestrated by PRC2 are critical to the maintenance of cell identity, which is an essential requisite for the existence of multicellular life1-3. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P3"><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The central biochemical function of PRC2 is that of depositing methyl groups on histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), which in turn leads to the formation of facultative heterochromatin and transcriptional repression4-7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Once established, this repressive structure is thought to propagate itself via a positive feedback loop based in part on the recognition of H3K27me3 by the PRC2 subunit EED8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the manner by which PRC2—and, more generally, the PcG axis—selects genes to be repressed remains the subject of intense interest, which is magnified by the recent implication of PRC2 and H3K27 in a number of malignancies9-12. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P4"><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>EZH2 is the most prominent catalytic subunit of PRC2 in pluripotent cells13. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In addition to binding to a number of protein factors that are either part of the core PRC2 complex (SUZ12, EED, RBBP4, and RBBP6) or perform accessory functions in specific cell types2, EZH2 was also one of the first chromatin-associated proteins reported to bind to long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)14-16. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, genome-wide unbiased approaches revealed that RNA binding of EZH2 is promiscuous at best, with large fractions of the transcriptome reported to interact by both microarray- and sequencing-based techniques17,18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Although in some cases binding to these RNAs has been shown to influence chromatin recruitment, the fact that so many RNAs can bind is a clear indication that our current models to explain the function of PRC2–RNA interactions are lacking important components and/or that immunoprecipitations and in vitro binding approaches may not suffice to determine with the required specificity the nature of the true interactions in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the recruitment of PRC2 to a handful of loci by lncRNAs hardly represents a satisfying model to explain how this complex controls repressive chromatin states in an epigenetic manner. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P5"><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>To better understand the role of protein–RNA contacts in PRC2 function, we sequenced RNA that crosslinked to EZH2 in mouse ESCs and analyzed its genomic origin as compared to the distribution of PRC2 on chromatin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>We show that PRC2 occupies a large fraction of active promoters in mouse embryonic cells, where it binds to nascent transcripts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>RNA–EZH2 binding events correlate with a decrease of H3K27me3 at these promoters, suggesting a molecular mechanism by which PRC2 senses and maintains the appropriate epigenetic state at different genes. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P6"><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Although it has been widely speculated that protein–RNA interactions are integral to PRC2 function, the experimental evidence in support of this observation so far originated either from candidate-based approaches14,16,19,20 or unbiased strategies based on native RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP)17,18, which suffer from an undesirably low signal-to-noise ratio21. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In fact, the binding of EZH2 and of several other chromatin-associated proteins to ncRNAs is rather promiscuous in vitro (S.K., R.B., unpublished), suggesting that additional specificity determinants must exist in vivo, and strongly supporting the use of in vivo crosslinking strategies to capture functionally relevant RNA–protein interactions on chromatin. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P7"><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Because UV-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation approaches are extremely sensitive to contamination from abundant RNA-interacting proteins that may remain undetected by western blot, we generated ESC lines expressing, in an inducible manner, physiological levels of EZH2 fused to three different epitope tags (N3–EZH2, Supplementary Fig. 1a,b), allowing for tandem (and triple) affinity purifications, which, we reasoned, would minimize chances of contamination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>As previously reported, N-terminal tagging of EZH2 did not perturb its incorporation into the PRC2 complex or its enzymatic activity (data not shown), and did not affect its distribution on chromatin (Supplementary Fig. 1c,d), consistent with our earlier studies13,22,23, as well as a recent electron microscopy reconstruction of the PRC2 holoenzyme24 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P8"><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>UVC irradiation followed by HA CLIP25 on N3–EZH2-expressing ESCs revealed the presence of a labeled protein migrating slightly above the predicted molecular weight for N3–EZH2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The radiolabeled band was only visible upon induction of N3–EZH2 expression and UVC irradiation (Fig. 1a), and therefore we concluded that it corresponded to RNA crosslinked to EZH2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Because the short-wavelength UVC irradiation appeared to cause extensive photodamage to EZH2 (Fig. 1a), in the following experiments we resorted to PAR-CLIP26, a modification of the CLIP technology that allows for crosslinking with UV light at longer wavelengths and lower energy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>After HA IP in stringent detergent conditions that disrupted the core PRC2 complex (S.K., R.B., unpublished), autoradiography revealed that EZH2 was crosslinked to 32P-labeled material that was sensitive to RNase treatment (Fig. 1b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>We also noted that higher 4-SU concentrations and irradiation with UVB (312 nm) rather than UVA resulted in more efficient crosslinking (Fig. 1b) and chose these conditions for the following experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Together, these data support the conclusion that EZH2 establishes direct physical contacts with RNA in ESCs that can be identified by CLIP or PAR-CLIP approaches. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P9"><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>To recover RNA amounts sufficient to construct libraries for deep sequencing while minimizing contaminations during the IP, we scaled up our PAR-CLIP strategy and performed tandem affinity purification with StrepTactin-coupled resin followed by HA IP (Fig. 1c), in 4 biological replicates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Deep sequencing of the CLIP tags eluted from the EZH2 bands (Fig. 1d) yielded ∼60 million reads, of which ∼30% could be aligned to the genome (Supplementary Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Of these, 40% displayed the T&gt;C transition diagnostic of 4-SU mediated crosslinking (Fig. 1e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Initial validations of the alignments confirmed that the replicates were highly concordant (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b) and that known EZH2-interacting lncRNAs, such as Kcnq1ot1 and Meg316,18 (S.K., R.B., unpublished), accumulated considerable numbers of CLIP tags (Fig. 1f). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>We pooled the 4 replicates into a single dataset to maximize sequencing depth and proceeded to analyze the genome-wide patterns of RNA–EZH2 binding interactions. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P10"><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>We identified 13,764 high-confidence RNA contact sites (RCSs) for EZH2 genome-wide using a software package that takes advantage of the T&gt;C transitions produced by PAR-CLIP to identify bona fide interaction sites27. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Although several RCSs localized to lncRNAs as expected17,28, the majority of them was in the body of protein-coding genes (Fig. 2a), suggesting the existence of unknown interactions between EZH2 and a vast number of RNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Visual inspection of the genes accumulating the largest number of RCSs revealed a striking bias for CLIP tags that mapped to the 5′ region of the mRNA with no apparent distinction between exons and introns (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 2c), suggesting that EZH2 (and therefore PRC2) made direct physical contact with nascent RNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>This was consistent with a study in HCT116 cells, which reported several intronic CLIP tags associated with EZH2 despite shallower sequencing compared to our PAR-CLIP29. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P11"><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>We confirmed the 5′ bias in EZH2–RNA contacts at the genome-wide level by mapping the RCSs identified above to all mouse transcripts and plotting their distribution over the body of the 250 genes that exhibited the strongest signal, and thus were more likely to reflect true in vivo interactions (Fig. 2c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>This bias was not an artefact of RCS identification, as it was readily visible also when we mapped the raw CLIP tags to the gene models in a similar fashion (Supplementary Fig. 2d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>In both cases (RCS or raw CLIP tag mapping), the bias became more obvious as we increased the stringency of our bioinformatic cutoff (Supplementary Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Both CLIP tags containing the T&gt;C mutation, diagnostic of RNA–protein crosslinks, and those not containing the mutation, more likely to be contaminants, peaked at the TSS (i.e. at the first exon) and to a lesser extent at the TTS (i.e. at the last exon), but the T&gt;C tags were more broadly enriched over the 5′ of the transcript body (Fig. 2d), confirming that bona fide CLIP tags crosslinked to EZH2 also originated from introns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Indeed, EZH2 CLIP tags mapped equally well to the beginning of the first exon or of the first intron of protein-coding genes (Fig. 2e), lending further support to the conclusion that EZH2 establishes these contacts with RNA during transcription and before further mRNA processing can occur. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>To verify that the observed 5′ bias was not due to misannotation of the 3′ portions of some of these genes, we analyzed the distribution of conventional RNA-seq, which is expected to display a 3′ bias due to oligo-dT purification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Indeed, conventional RNA-seq displayed the expected 3′ bias (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 2d), and clear discrimination between exons and introns (Fig. 2e) demonstrating that the 5′ bias displayed by the CLIP tags was not an artefact of our bioinformatic analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Chasing the 4-SU pulse with non-crosslinkable uridine led to a fading of the EZH2-associated PAR-CLIP signal (Fig. 2f), further supporting the conclusion that EZH2 bound preferentially to nascent RNAs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="S5"><title><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>EZH2-bound RNAs originate from PRC2lo genes </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="P12"><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Because CLIP tags mapped equally well to introns and exons (Fig. 2e), we defined a moderately conservative set of EZH2-bound nascent RNAs (henceforth referred to as ezRNAs), based on the presence of at least 3 separate RCSs in their introns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Using this parameter, we identified 1,108 transcripts originating from 784 genes (Supplementary Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Genes encoding ezRNAs were enriched in GO terms suggestive of transcriptional control and nuclear processes, including “chromatin modification” and “regulation of transcription” (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Table 3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P13"><text><SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Having observed EZH2 peaks at the promoters of visually inspected ezRNA+ genes (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 2c), we wished to determine whether this was a general feature of RNAs crosslinked to EZH2, despite the fact that, at least based on GO enrichment, ezRNA+ genes constituted a set distinct from traditional Polycomb target genes30. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Indeed, EZH2 CLIP-tags tended to accumulate near chromatin regions enriched for EZH2 (Fig. 3b); however, plotting the distribution of ezRNAs on a heatmap of all RefSeq TSSs sorted by PRC2 occupancy revealed that they were missing not only from regions with no detectable PRC2 (Fig. 3c), as expected, but also from regions with very high PRC2 levels (Fig. 3c), and originated, for the most part, from TSSs with intermediate levels of PRC2, which, to our surprise, comprised a majority of all annotated TSSs (Fig. 3c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, when the TSSs were sorted by H3K27me3 density, the ezRNA-producing TSSs clustered in the rightmost section of the heatmap, in regions depleted for this histone mark (Fig. 3d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>We independently validated this observation by analyzing a different ChIP-seq dataset31, generated in the same cell line and similar culture conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Consistent with our findings above, ezRNAs mapped to genes with intermediate levels of EZH2 and low levels of H3K27me3 also in this dataset (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Despite the presence of PRC2, genes giving rise to ezRNAs were transcriptionally active, as demonstrated by the enrichment of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 compared to a random gene set of equal size (Fig. 3e), and were by and large distinct from bivalent genes31,32 (Supplementary Fig. 4c,d). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P14"><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>The presence of EZH2 at such a large proportion of genes, including actively transcribed ones, was unexpected; therefore, we sought confirmatory evidence for this finding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the results above, SUZ12, another core subunit of PRC2, was also found at a majority of TSSs, (Supplementary Fig. 4e), although the overall enrichment with this antibody was considerably lower (Fig. 3f). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the ChIP-seq profiles obtained with HA antibodies in N3–EZH2-expressing mouse ESCs were indistinguishable from those obtained with EZH2 antibodies in the parental cell line (Supplementary Fig. 1c,d), and in both cases peaks of considerable intensity were easily discernible in the promoter regions of genes that would be traditionally considered PRC2-negative (Fig. 3f). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P15"><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>In summary, the results above show that ezRNAs originate from a subset of genes that, although occupied by intermediate levels of PRC2, are actively transcribed in mouse ESCs and devoid of H3K27me3. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="S6"><title><text><SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Genes producing ezRNAs have lower H3K27me3 levels in ESCs </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="P16"><text><SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Because genes producing ezRNAs were decorated with chromatin marks consistent with productive transcription (Fig. 3e) and their distribution correlated negatively with H3K27me3 density at a genome-wide level (Fig. 3d), we hypothesized that, despite the presence of PRC2, their promoters might be devoid of H3K27me3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Indeed, when we compared the set of genes producing ezRNAs to a control gene set, matched gene-by-gene for the amount of PRC2 at their promoter, we found that the latter had higher amounts of H3K27me3 (Fig. 4a) despite equal amounts of PRC2 (Fig. 4a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the lower levels of H3K27me3, these genes were expressed at higher levels than the control set, as shown by an average increase in RNA-seq RPKM values (Fig. 4a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>When we matched the control by equalizing RPKMs rather than PRC2 levels, the difference in H3K27me3 was reduced but still noticeable (Fig. 4b), suggesting that differences in RNA transcription alone are not sufficient to explain the changes in H3K27me3 levels and that contacts between EZH2 and nascent RNAs may influence the function of PRC2 on chromatin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Differences in the average H3K27me3 profiles were not due to a few outliers because regression curves fitted through the individual points had different slopes, confirming that in general ezRNA+ genes contained less H3K27me3 than expected based on PRC2 levels alone (Supplementary Fig. 5a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>The differences in H3K27me3 at these genes was also observed in ChIP-seq profiles generated in different laboratories and even using different ESC lines and different culture conditions31 (Supplementary Fig. 5b). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P17"><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Finally, we wished to determine the fate of genes producing ezRNAs in committed cells that had lost the pluripotent characteristics of ESCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>To this end, we compared the H3K27me3 distribution on genes producing ezRNAs in a different pluripotent mESC line (V6.5) and in differentiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), using datasets from Mikkelsen et al.32. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>The difference in H3K27me3 densities on ezRNAs genes versus an EZH2-matched control was pronounced in the pluripotent V6.5 ESCs (Fig. 4c), but it was much decreased in MEFs (Fig. 4c), suggesting that upon differentiation, several of the genes that produced ezRNAs in ESCs can become fully repressed by acquiring H3K27me3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Presumably, repression caused decreased synthesis of ezRNAs and consequent increased deposition of H3K27me3 by PRC2, but only EZH2 PAR-CLIP in MEFs could confirm this hypothesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Regardless, the accumulation of H3K27me3 at ezRNA+ genes proves that the lack of PRC2 activity at those genes in ESCs was not due to any intrinsic property of their promoters, but rather it was a consequence of dynamic processes, specific to ESCs, likely involving the production and recognition of ezRNAs. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P18"><text><SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>By performing PAR-CLIP-seq for EZH2 in undifferentiated mouse ESCs (Fig. 1), we have identified a family of nascent transcripts that bind to EZH2 while they are being transcribed and before they are spliced and processed into mature mRNAs (Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>The majority of these nascent transcripts originate from transcriptionally active regions containing intermediate or low levels of PRC2 (Fig. 3c), which we detected in multiple biological replicates and using different antibodies (Fig. 3f), as well as in datasets generated by other groups (Supplementary Fig. 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>A peculiar characteristic of these ezRNA-producing genes is the lack of H3K27me3, despite measurable levels of PRC2 (Fig. 4), which hints at the possibility that PRC2 might function as RNA “sensor” (see below). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P19"><text><SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>One conclusion of our study is that PRC2, at least in mouse ESCs, binds to a majority of promoters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>In addition to regions where PRC2 is entrenched and large amounts of H3K27me3 accumulate (Fig. 3c), low but detectable levels of EZH2 are present at a majority of TSSs (Fig. 3c, Fig. 3f), including many that have no detectable H3K27me3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>The PRC2hi regions correlate with strong repression and contain the gene targets that have traditionally been associated with PcG function in ESCs30, including developmental regulators such as the Hox genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>At these genes heterochromatin has already been nucleated and is likely propagated by the known positive feedback cycles affecting PRC28. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the PRC2lo promoters appear to be transcriptionally competent if not completely activated, and this is in contrast with the traditional view that PRC2 enforces epigenetic repression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="?"><plain>What might be the reason for this constitutive and broad TSS occupancy and how can we explain that these genes are transcribed despite the presence of PRC2? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P20"><text><SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Considering that the function of the PcG axis is that of maintaining—not establishing— transcriptional repression33, the results presented above suggest a model wherein PRC2 exerts its epigenetic function by sensing the activation states of promoters through contacts with nascent RNAs (Fig. 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>The first step of this model is “promoter sampling”, that is the ability of PRC2 to interact with a majority of TSSs, at least in pluripotent mouse ESCs, using low affinity or low frequency binding events (Fig. 5a), possibly directed by GC-rich sequences34, other protein factors22,35,36, and even ncRNAs14,16,18 (S.K., R.B., unpublished). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>This broad promoter surveillance gives PRC2 the opportunity to survey the activation state of a large number of genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>If the surveyed gene is active and transcription is ongoing, PRC2 “senses” this by interacting with the nascent RNA, presumably still tethered to RNA polymerase II, and this interaction causes a decreased deposition of H3K27me3, allowing chromatin to stay open and the promoter to remain active. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Whether and how exactly ezRNA–EZH2 contacts directly cause decreased H3K27me3 are open questions that will require further investigation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>It is tempting to speculate that RNA contacts directly inhibit the enzymatic activity of EZH2 (Fig. 5b, I), but we can also envision more complex scenarios, in which one or more components of the PRC2 complex might be evicted from chromatin through interactions with or competition from ezRNAs (Fig. 5b, II). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P21"><text><SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Whatever the mechanism may be, PRC2 responds to the activated state of ezRNA+ promoters by not depositing H3K27me3, which allows the gene to remain active; however, the Polycomb axis is better known for maintenance of repression, not activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="?"><plain>How does this fit our model? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>We propose that when the cell detects a new stimulus, for example during differentiation, DNA-binding transcriptional repressors are expressed de novo or are otherwise activated, enter the nucleus, bind to chromatin, and silence their target genes, abolishing the production of nascent RNAs at these loci. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Without inhibitory ezRNAs, PRC2 complexes that are still surveying these loci deposit increased amounts of H3K27me3, which establish repressed chromatin structures (Fig. 5c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>As H3K27me3 marks accumulate, a tipping point is reached when heterochromatic structures are maintained in an epigenetic manner8, even in absence of the original transcriptional repressor (Fig. 5d). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P22"><text><SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Although the physical contacts between RNA and EZH2 reported herein are highly suggestive of a direct regulatory mechanism, we cannot exclude that other molecular features associated with ongoing transcription may also contribute to the attenuation of PRC2 activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>For example, others and we recently showed that, in certain contexts, the presence of H3K4me3 inhibits the enzymatic activity of PRC237,38. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>This regulatory mechanism may function in addition to or in cooperation with the recognition of ezRNAs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P23"><text><SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Our results and the model presented above are consistent with the genetic evidence that PRC2 does not repress transcription de novo but rather senses loci that are already silenced, and maintain their repressed state over time and cell division39,40. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>In Drosophila, PRC2 binds to the Polycomb responsive element of Ultrabithorax independent of its activation state, but H3K27me3 only spreads to the promoter and body of the gene in imaginal discs that repress Ultrabithorax41. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>In fact, transient activation of a reporter locus controlled by Polycomb is sufficient to switch its epigenetic state from repressed to active42, which fits well with our proposed model in which PRC2 is inhibited by active transcription. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P24"><text><SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Although we focused our attention on the 784 top ezRNA+ candidates, to our knowledge this is the first report of genome-wide PAR-CLIP for a non-canonical RNA binding protein (the second counting Guil et al.29, who performed CLIP without 4-SU), and we must consider the possibility that other nascent RNAs that we cannot detect with the current protocol might bind to EZH2 in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>In fact, according to our model, binding to RNA is likely to be very promiscuous in vivo, because the presence of RNA, not necessarily specific sequences or structures, would suffice to deliver a regulatory signal to PRC2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>This would help explain the large number of EZH2-interacting RNA species recovered by previous studies17,18, but it does not exclude that other RNAs, particularly lncRNAs, may have evolved to further exploit this property of EZH2 in the context of complex regulatory scenarios such as that of X chromosome inactivation43 or imprinting16,18. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P25"><text><SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we propose that, at least in mammals, PRC2 performs its epigenetic function by sensing the presence of active transcription via interactions with nascent RNAs and curtailing its activity on chromatin in their presence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>The increased facility by which the genome of ESCs can be edited will soon offer the opportunity to test this hypothesis experimentally. </plain></SENT>
