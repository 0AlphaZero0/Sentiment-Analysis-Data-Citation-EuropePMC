</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Septins are ubiquitous guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that have been implicated in many cellular processes such as cytokinesis, spindle positioning, morphogenesis, and exocytosis, and their mutation or overexpression is associated with neoplasia, neurodegenerative diseases and male infertility (Hall and Russell, 2004). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In yeast, four essential septins (Cdc3, Cdc10, Cdc11 and Cdc12) are found at the bud neck (Haarer and Pringle, 1987; Ford and Pringle, 1991; Kim et al., 1991), where they form an ordered ring composed of membrane-adjacent filaments (Hartwell, 1971; Byers and Goetsch, 1976). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In total seven different septins were identified in S. cerevisiae, where they form filaments of variable size and combinations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Whereas the human genome encodes thirteen septins, C. elegans has only two and plants are devoid of septin genes (Hall and Russell, 2004; Ihara et al., 2005; Kinoshita, 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Despite the genetic variability, all septins share defined structural features. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>A recent crystallographic study on the human SEPT2-SEPT6-SEPT7 complex has shed light on the structural organization of human septins at the atomic level, which differs profoundly from that of other cytoskeletal structures (Sirajuddin et al., 2007, 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Septins interact via their central guanine nucleotide-binding domains (G-domains) and/or the N- and C-terminal extensions forming oligomers and non-helical filaments. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The basic structural unit of the yeast septin complex is an octamer, composed of four subunits, namely Cdc10, Cdc3, Cdc12 and Cdc11, arranged into two tetramers with two-fold rotational symmetry (Bertin et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Cdc42 has been identified as a central regulator of septin ring assembly and disassembly during different stages of the cell cycle (Gladfelter et al., 2002; Kozminski et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Mutations that affect the GTPase activity of Cdc42 impair the initial assembly of septin rings, while after bud emergence, septin rings are maintained independently of Ccd42 (Gladfelter et al., 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>It was also reported that the activity of Cdc42’s guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and GTPase activating protein (GAP) are required for proper septin ring formation and localization, implying that one or more cycle(s) of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis are required for Cdc42 at the beginning of budding (Gladfelter et al., 2002; Caviston et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Among the essential effectors of Cdc42 in yeast are the two structurally homologous proteins Gic1 and Gic2, which are functional homologues of the human Borg protein (Joberty et al., 2001; Sheffield et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that Gic1 and Gic2 play an essential and overlapping role in cytoskeletal polarization (Brown et al., 1997; Hall and Russell, 2004) and septin recruitment (Iwase et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>However, the complex interplay between Cdc42, Gic1 and septins at the molecular level and its role during the cell cycle is not yet understood. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have used electron microscopy and cryo electron tomography (cryo-ET) to describe the structural basis for the direct interaction of Gic1 and Cdc42 with septin filaments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Gic1 interacts with Cdc10 subunits of adjacent septin filaments and cross-links them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Because of this scaffolding, septin filaments are stabilized and form long railroad-like ordered filament cables. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Cdc42-GTP directly binds to Gic1 and at higher concentrations inhibits the Gic1 interaction with Cdc10, resulting in the dissociation of the Gic1-septin complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In its GDP-state, however, in absence of Gic1 Cdc42 interacts directly with Cdc10 and thereby mechanically disassembles septin filaments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Gic1 and Cdc42-GDP therefore compete for the same septin subunit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Finally, based on our results we propose a novel regulatory mechanism for septin ring formation and dissociation involving Cdc42 and Gic1. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>EGFP-labeled septins without Gic1 (Cdc3-EGFP, Cdc10, Cdc11 and Cdc12) form relatively short and straight filaments (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, when Gic1 is added during septin polymerization, long filaments that cluster together in large bundles are formed (Figure 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Studying the same but not EGFP-labeled samples using electron microscopy (EM), we found that in contrast to blank septin polymers that form long, often pairwise arranged filaments (Figure 1C), Gic1-septin complexes display a regular railroad-like structure with many cross-linked filaments bundled together (Figure 1D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Gic1 forms cross-bridges between at least two filaments, keeping them at a distance of about 20 nm (Figure 1E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>At each cross-bridge, Gic1 binds to at least two adjacent septin subunits on each filament (Figure 1F), leaving a gap of six free subunits between individual Gic1 molecules (Figure 1G). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>However, previous yeast two-hybrid, in vitro interaction and coimmunoprecipitation data indicated that Gic1 directly interacts with Cdc12 (Iwase et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we performed additional experiments to further corroborate our findings and prepared septin-Gic1 complexes devoid of either Cdc10 or Cdc11 (Figure 2D–I). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>As expected from the results of antibody labeling, septin-Cdc10Δ, which formed short filaments, did not bind to Gic1 (Figure 2D–E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Septin-Cdc11Δ, however, which in accordance with previous studies (Bertin et al., 2010) does not polymerize (Figure 2F) produced a similar track-like structure as the wildtype when Gic1 was added (Figure 2G). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Thus, addition of Gic1 resulted not only in the binding of the protein to the septin complex but also induced septin polymerization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>We then performed single particle analysis (SPA) of the septin filaments and observed that only four subunits were located between Gic1 cross-bridges of Cdc11Δ filaments, ruling out an interaction with Cdc12 (Figure 2H–I). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>In addition, yeast two-hybrid studies supported our in vitro data, showing that Gic1 only interacts with Cdc10 (Figure 2J). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Notably, Cdc10 is mainly responsible for the specific interaction of septin filaments with PIP2, localizing them to membranes and promoting filament polymerization and organization (Bertin et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>For Gic2, which is a homologue of Gic1, a direct interaction through its polybasic region with PIP2 was also reported (Orlando et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Together with our findings, this suggests that the organization and polymerization of septin filaments is controlled by the interaction of Gics with Cdc10 and the interaction of both proteins with PIP2. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Bertin et al. reported that septin filaments are cross-linked by overlapping C-terminal extensions of Cdc3 and Cdc12 (Bertin et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Depending on the stain thickness we also observed these thin cross-links between bare septin filaments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>However, in septin-Gic1 complexes, the large Gic1 cross-bridges are very prominent, causing stain to accumulate between the Gic1 cross-bridges. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>This makes it impossible to visualize the thin coiled-coils between Cdc3 and Cdc12, although they are probably still there. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>To study the native three-dimensional structure of the filaments, we vitrified septin-Gic1 complexes and determined their structure using cryo electron tomography (cryo-ET) (Figure 3; Videos 1–4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>We observed that Gic1, instead of cross-bridging only two filaments, simultaneously interacted with up to six septin polymers, forming long filament cables (Figure 3E–G). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>The organization of these cables is such that Gic1 forms a central scaffold to which septin filaments attach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, individual septin filaments do not start at the same position and run along in parallel rigid lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>The septin-Gic1 cables are rather composed of many filaments of variable lengths that start at random positions, sometimes bypassing a Gic1 cross-bridge or changing place with another filament (Figure 3H–I). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Your article has been favorably evaluated (subject to revisions outlined below) by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this in vitro study with recombinant proteins, the role of the guanine nucleotide binding protein Cdc42 and the regulator Gic1-septin filament formation and dissociation is elucidated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using a combination of negative stain electron microscopy and cryo electron tomography, along with manipulations of the septin complex or the nucleotide state of Cdc42, a dual role of Cdc42 was discovered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the GTP-state, Cdc42 leads to disassembly of the Gic1-septin complex, whereas in the GDP-state, Cdc42 leads to further disassembly of the septin complex in absence of Gic1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the cryo EM reconstructions show that Gic1 can bind to multiple septin filaments in a heterogeneous fashion, accounting for flexibility of septin filaments during cell division and cytokinesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have linked Gic1/2 and Cdc42 nucleotide cycling to septin assembly in vivo but really how Cdc42 and its myriad of effectors actually lead to septin ring and collar formation remain mysterious. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>While Gic1/2 function has been genetically linked to septin organization and shown to physically associate with septin complexes, precisely what the Cdc42 effector does to regulate septins is unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Similarly, for Cdc42 itself, which is essential for septin assembly, it has not been determined if Cdc42 can bind septins and directly promotes filament assembly, filament bundling and/or if it simply indirectly recruits septins to the bud site. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The electron micrographs are striking and represent some of the most detailed glimpses at purified septins presented to date. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, there are significant concerns about the quality and resolution of the EM tomograms that need to be addressed, along with the other concerns outlined below, before a decision can be made. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Overall, the data indicate that 1) Gic1 can bundle septins through specific interactions at Cdc10, 2) Cdc42-GDP can bind septin octamers (through a surprisingly differently-ordered octamer than what has been shown for pure septin complex), 3) Cdc42-GTP changes how Gic1 associates with septin filaments and may itself associate with Gic1 bound to filaments, 4) high concentrations of Cdc42-GTP can lead to Gic1 dissociation for filaments and therefore ultimately destabilize the filaments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These are intriguing findings and do represent the first clean reconstitution of regulated septin assembly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Thus, the studies in this work should stimulate future studies to confirm that this is what is happening in vivo. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Required revisions: </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>1) The authors employ cryo-ET to view these fascinating assemblies 3D. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, lack of details precludes confidence in the displayed models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The authors need to detail the number of data sets collected and analyzed, post-processing and segmentation procedures, and should provide slices in X Y directions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Moreover, from reviewing the movies kindly provided the claim of isotropic resolution is inadequate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The resolution in Z direction is severely diminished, and this is the long axis of the bundles used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>There is no way of telling what type of artifacts this geometry will introduce. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>If the authors want to prove that their conclusions are supported by the data, the authors will need to come up with some more convincing arguments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Maybe the authors can apply some simulations with idealized models or make use of the bundles with their long axis running in the other directions (x, y). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>As it stands there is some probability that the data is over interpreted, at least to some extent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, because of the absence of averaging, the authors are looking at single motifs in a fairly noisy background, which is not helping in building confidence for their conclusions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>2) The bundles of septin-Gic complexes were “untangled” by adsorbing them to a lipid monolayer containing NTA-lipids that bind to His6-tags attached to the Cdc3 septin molecule. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="?"><plain>Do the His-tags themselves cause some aggregation in this system, i.e., could that be the origin of the entangling of the filaments? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="?"><plain>In other words, were EM studies attempted with a different method to tether them to the surface? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>3) Please provide the control polymerization done in absence of fluorophore to establish the lack of interference (artifacts) induced by the addition of the EGFP-tag. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="?"><plain>4) What is the estimated resolution of the cryo-EM tomograms in xy and z, respectively (see also point 1)? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="?"><plain>5) What is the concentration of Cdc42-GppNHp in Figure 5? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>6) The Gic components in the septin-Gic complexes appear rather heterogeneous. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="?"><plain>Do they consist of multiple Gic molecules or is Gic thought to be a flexible multi-domain protein? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>7) Figure 1: The fluorescence in B looks just aggregated rather than bundled: these images raise some concern about what the relevance is of filament cables to normal septin assemblies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>There is no scale bar annotation for panels C-F. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>8) Figure 2: There are no scale bar annotations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>There is only one spot along the fiber that is Cdc11 labeled. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Please mention how many particles were used for the averaging in Figure 2B. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>This is an important potential issue because previous work by Iwase et al. found Gic specifically complexing with Cdc12 not Cdc10. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>9) The interpretation of Figure 5C that the bridges get bulkier with Cdc42 added is that Cdc42 is part of enlarged bridging structure with Gic, but this could also be Gic1 oligomerization – without further experiments this can't be excluded. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="?"><plain>10) Figure 8D: How does one know that band from gel filtration is Cdc42-GDP and not a contaminant from bacteria? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="?"><plain>Could a Western blot also be included? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>11) It is perplexing that filaments breaking at Cdc10 interface in presence of excess Cdc42. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Your revised article has been evaluated by a Senior editor, a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors (Axel Brunger), and two reviewers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>We thank the authors for addressing many of the concerns raised by the reviewers and the Reviewing editor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>There are remaining significant concerns about the quality and reliability of the cryo-EM tomography results (see the comments by Reviewer 3 below). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>The reviewers and editors had considerable discussions about these concerns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>They recognize that main conclusion that is drawn from the tomograms is that Gic1 cross-bridges more than two filaments, a result that could not be drawn from the negative stain EM images alone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>The potential artifacts that are caused by the missing wedge in the EM data could have affected this particular conclusion, especially the connections between the filaments, as the authors also showed in their simulations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Ideally, the authors should revisit their existing EM tomograms at the orthogonal orientation to show that these connections are independent of the geometry (see Reviewer 3 comments). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The authors (using the geometry in Figure 19G for example) showed that there are clear extra crosslinks visible in tomograms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>However, we would be prepared to accept the paper in essentially its current form if the authors would clearly point out the limitations of their current tomography study (including the potential effects of the missing wedge, lack of averaging, the estimated very low resolution of the images). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>The authors need to make a convincing case that the main conclusion drawn from the tomograms (more than two filaments binding to Gic1) is probably not affected by these concerns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the authors must clearly state in the main text, the figure captions, and the conclusions that the images themselves may have gross errors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Comments from Reviewer 3: </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>The authors have now given a much clearer picture of the tomography data and processing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, much of what was laid out only confirmed the reviewer's initial concerns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>It is not the quality of the reconstruction that improves by changing the relationship between beam direction and tilt axis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>The data in the missing wedge is missing, still. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>The artifacts are just along a different direction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>The illusion of “improvement” is actually dangerous because it gives a false sense of quality for the reconstruction. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>The authors show themselves with their simulations that the data collection strategy they use generates severe artifacts to thin structures that are perpendicular to the beam. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The filaments adsorbed to the grid and bundles were “untangled” comparably to that seen in the experiments with Ni-NTA lipids (Figure 17), indicating that the interaction of the septin-Gic1 filaments, respectively, is not His-tag-induced. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Another good argument against the hypothesis of a His-tag-induced interaction is that we also observed the “entangling” of septin filaments when we studied unmodified wildtype septins purified from yeast (Farkasovsky et al. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The bundling of His-tagged septins is not stronger than that of the wildtype filaments. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>In our study, we showed that His-tagged Gic1 interacts with the septin Cdc10 (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>In addition, we performed experiments with GST-tagged Gic1 and observed the same railroad structures as for His-tagged Gic1, indicating that the interaction between Gic1 and Cdc10 is not induced by His-tags (Author response image 1).Author response image 1.Septin-Gic1-GST complexes. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Despite much progress in electron tomography, quantitative assessment of resolution in single tomograms remains a problematic issue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>A resolution estimate is given for only 25 of the 60 tomograms deposited in the EMDB. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>For 7 of these 25 tomograms, although a value is given, it is not described how the authors determined it. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>For 5 tomograms, the resolution was estimated by visual inspection regarding certain known features in the tomograms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>For 7 tomograms, the resolution was estimated by the first zero-crossing of the CTF in the 0˚ image (however, this criteria does not distinguish between signal and noise, and is therefore just a measure for how good the resolution could be in principle). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>For the remaining specimens, the resolution was determined by electron diffraction (this is only possible for ordered structures such as 2D crystals or helices). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>A cross validation-based criterion exists for electron tomography (Cardone et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>2005), but because of many problems it extremely underestimates the resolution of the tomograms and is therefore not used by the tomography community. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Therefore, due to the absence of a standard method, we avoid estimating the resolution of our tomograms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>However, segmentation of our tomograms was straightforward after filtering down the raw tomograms to 30 Å. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>The first zero-crossing in the CTF in the 0˚ images of the various tomograms is at about 35-45 Å. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a visual comparison, between the densities of septin filaments in our tomograms and down-filtered crystal structures of human septin (see also Figures 18-20), suggests a resolution of 40-60 Å. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Thus, for our sub-tomograms shown in the present study, we expect a resolution in the xy direction of 40-60 Å (at lower resolutions, septin filaments are expected to appear as featureless straight rods). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, based on an elongation factor of 1.14 that we derived from our simulation studies, we expect a 5-10 Å decrease of resolution in the z direction. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>To prevent any confusion we included the values now in the legend to Figure 6 (formerly Figure 5). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Taken into account that each yeast cell contains around 1000 copies of septin octamers and Gic1 (Ghaemmaghami et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>2003), the estimated concentration of septins or Gic1 in a yeast cell is around 0.05 µM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>However, the local concentration of Cdc42 and Gic1 in yeast (for example at the budding neck) can be much higher (Gladfelter et al. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>In a typical Gic1 cross-bridge up to 12 Cdc10 subunits are involved (two per filament) (Figure 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>If we assume that each of them binds independently to a Gic1 dimer, we would expect that 12 Gic1 dimers assemble into a large cross-bridge of 600 kDa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>In good agreement with this the average large volume of the Gic1 density in the electron tomograms indicates that it must contain multiple Gic1 molecules. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>Because of the work by Iwase et al. that indicated that Gic would bind to Cdc12, we did three independent studies to prove that Gic1 binds to Cdc10. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>In Figure 5 (formerly Figure 4) we show that Cdc42-GppNHp binds specifically to Gic1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>The gel filtration profile in Figure 4B does not indicate any kind of oligomerization of Gic1 and the Gic1-Cdc42-GppNHp complex elutes from the gel filtration column at the expected position (Figure 5). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Note, due to negative staining the thin cross-bridges between bare septin filaments mediated by the C-terminal extensions of Cdc3 and Cdc12 can only rarely be visualized. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>[Editors’ note: before acceptance, the following revisions were also requested.] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>There are remaining significant concerns about the quality and reliability of the cryo-EM tomography results (see the comments by Reviewer 3 below). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>The reviewers and editors had considerable discussions about these concerns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>They recognize that main conclusion that is drawn from the tomograms is that Gic1 cross-bridges more than two filaments, a result that could not be drawn from the negative stain EM images alone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>The potential artifacts that are caused by the missing wedge in the EM data could have affected this particular conclusion, especially the connections between the filaments, as the authors also showed in their simulations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Ideally, the authors should revisit their existing EM tomograms at the orthogonal orientation to show that these connections are independent of the geometry (see Reviewer 3 comments). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>The authors (using the geometry in Figure 19 G for example) showed that there are clear extra crosslinks visible in tomograms. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>We revisited our EM tomogram at the orthogonal orientation and searched for filaments running parallel to the tilt axis, exactly as simulated in Figure 19G (now Figure 20G) (see also below) and processed the tomograms as described for the other septin-Gic1 filaments (see Material and methods). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>As expected the septin-Gic1-Cdc42-GppNHp complexes look similar to the structures obtained from bundles that run parallel to the beam (new Figure 19A-C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Despite missing wedge artifacts, there are clear Gic1-Cdc42 cross-bridges (“or extra crosslinks”) that connect several, in this case five, septin filaments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>This proves that observation of Gic1 or Gic1-Cdc42 connections is independent of the geometry. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>However, we would be prepared to accept the paper in essentially its current form if the authors would clearly point out the limitations of their current tomography study (including the potential effects of the missing wedge, lack of averaging, the estimated very low resolution of the images). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>The authors need to make a convincing case that the main conclusion drawn from the tomograms (more than two filaments binding to Gic1) is probably not affected by these concerns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the authors must clearly state in the main text, the figure captions, and the conclusions that the images themselves may have gross errors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>We hope that our additional reconstructions and our answers to the reviewer’s comments (see below) are convincing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Additionally we included some sentences that explain the limits of cryo-ET, such as missing wedge artifacts, in the revised manuscript. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Comments from Reviewer 3: </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>The authors have now given a much clearer picture of the tomography data and processing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, much of what was laid out only confirmed the reviewer's initial concerns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>It is not the quality of the reconstruction that improves by changing the relationship between beam direction and tilt axis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>The data in the missing wedge is missing, still. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>The artifacts are just along a different direction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>The illusion of “improvement” is actually dangerous because it gives a false sense of quality for the reconstruction. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>This reviewer is correct in stating that the missing wedge is always there (i.e., missing), independent of the beam direction and tilt axis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>We did not claim that there are no missing wedge artifacts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>But dependent on the orientation of the complexes during tomography these artifacts have different effects on the overall computed structures of the complexes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>If the symmetry or pseudo-symmetry axis of an object is running parallel to the tilt axis of the microscope, the overall tomographic coverage of the structure improves. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>This is a fact that all EM users take seriously into account during the recording of single particles tomograms, especially when averaging is not possible. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>From the home page of SerialEM (the most common program to acquire tilt series for electron tomography; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/SerialEM/index.html">http://bio3d.colorado.edu/SerialEM/index.html</ext-link>), Strategies for Cryoelectron Tomography: “There is essentially no dual-axis capability due to the low dose requirements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>So, we are left with single-axis reconstructions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>If the sample allows you to, taking advantage of sample orientation to the tilt-axis can become very important. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>The best resolution is parallel to the tilt-axis.” </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>We were surprised that the reviewer criticized this standard approach in the first review. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>However, we agreed to provide simulation experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>They clearly show that the complexes running parallel to the tilt axis are better resolved (Figure 20E-F, H-I) than the ones running perpendicular to the tilt axis (Figure 20K-L). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Because of the longitudinal appearance of the septin-Gic1-Cdc42 complexes, tomograms with complexes running parallel to the beam (Figure 20E-F) result in a reconstruction that is more similar to the original model compared to complexes running perpendicular to the beam (Figure 20H-I). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>It is not the quality of the reconstruction that improves by changing the relationship between beam direction and tilt axis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>There must be a misunderstanding: the relationship between beam direction and tilt axis does not change during a tomography experiment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>It depends on the current microscope setup and if the user does not tilt the beam during image recording (we never tilt the beam!), this relationship will not change. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>If there are any thin connections between the filaments, it is very likely that they will not appear in the reconstruction with the chosen geometry. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>As described above we revisited our EM tomogram at the orthogonal orientation and calculated a reconstruction of filaments running parallel to the tilt axis (Figure 19A-C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>As expected, we do not see any additional thin connections between the filaments. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>The thin connections described in Bertin et al (Bertin et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>2008) are expected to be composed of two interacting thin coiled-coils. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>They are very thin and cannot be seen in 2D class averages (this work) (Sirajuddin et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>2007) and 3D reconstructions of negatively stained septin octamers at 27 Å resolution (Lukoyanova et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>2008). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>The resolution of our reconstructions is 40-60 Å at best (as pointed out in our previous rebuttal letter, there is not yet a method to measure precisely the resolution of single tomograms). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>It is therefore expected that these structures are not resolved in our tomograms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Even if the thin connections were visible, their segmentation would be highly ambiguous, independent of the chosen geometry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>This issue is pointed out in the revised manuscript more clearly. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>The modeling of the cross-links as featureless barrels is not helpful to convince the reviewer. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>We chose GROEL/GROES as a model because it has similar dimensions to Gic1 cross-bridges and has been extensively studied by electron microscopy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>The question is what would happen to finer features that may be attached to these barrels or emanate from/connect between the filaments. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>As described above, finer features will not be resolved at a resolution of 40-60 Å. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>We have used electron tomography to study these complicated structures, not X-ray crystallography. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>We therefore restrict our description and conclusion to gross features. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>We agree with the reviewer that this would be worth analyzing in future studies, but with other techniques, in particular X-ray crystallography. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>In trying to get a quantitative assessment of the assembly features (filaments and linkers) for this geometrically challenging system, the authors should have generated tomo-series in both orthogonal orientations to provide dual axis tomograms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Such data scheme would allow assessing the extent of the missing wedge and isotropic distortions for the system and thus provide measurable values to the confidence to the described conclusions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Although dual axis tomography theoretically improves the quality of tomograms, it harbors many technical problems and has therefore not been routinely used by the EM community. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Most electron microscopes, including ours, are not equipped with a dual axis tomography holder. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Therefore one has to remove the grid from the microscope after recording the first tomogram, turn it by 90˚ and enter it again. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>After finding the right position the second tomogram is recorded. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Besides many obvious technical difficulties such as ice contamination when removing the grid and problems with alignment, the electron dose of such tomograms is doubled, resulting in decreased resolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Any potential improvement of our tomograms would therefore be questionable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Instead we revisited our EM tomograms at the orthogonal orientation and searched for filaments running parallel to the tilt axis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>This showed that the overall structure of the septin-Gic1 complexes is independent of its orientation in the tomogram. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>So, we are left with single-axis reconstructions.” </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>From “Cryo-electron tomography: The challenge of doing structural biology in situ” (Vladan Lučić, Alexander Rigort, and Wolfgang Baumeister, JCB:Review, August 5, 2013), Dual-axis tomography: “Tilting around two tilt axes perpendicular to each other reduces missing wedge–induced distortions and improves information content. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>However, dual-axis tomography has rarely been used in cryo-ET due to the need to acquire an increased number of projections and difficulties with alignment....” </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Furthermore it is somewhat concerning that the whole analysis is based on five reconstructions, 2 of septin-Gic1 and 3 of septin-Gic-Cdc42-GppNHp complexes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>These numbers are on the lower side to draw robust conclusions, specifically as thousand of such assemblies were viewed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>We could provide hundreds of reconstructions with complexes running in random directions relative to the tilt axis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>However, as described above and demonstrated by simulations, only reconstructions with filaments running parallel to the tilt axis or to the beam result in analyzable reconstructions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>To find filaments in this orientation is very challenging. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>We are convinced that the number of reconstructions provided is sufficient to support our conclusions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>In summary, the reliability of the features in the reconstructions is questionable and the presentation of the data is misleading by implying that artifacts caused by the missing wedge would be somehow overcome by using a specific geometry. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>We clearly show that we do not overcome the missing wedge artifacts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>This is not possible in a single tomogram experiment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>However, we show that the orientation of the longitudinal complexes during tomography definitely has an impact on the resolution and overall quality of the reconstructions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>We rephrased this passage in the revised manuscript to prevent any misunderstandings. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Due to the overall methodical and resolution limitations our paper focuses exclusively on gross features of the complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>We can clearly determine the number of filaments and we can even fit the crystal structure of human septin into our reconstructions to verify that the overall dimensions are correct. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the density corresponding to Gic1 appears more stretched due to the missing wedge artifacts, we can state that Gic1 cross-bridges several septin filaments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>These are our conclusions from the cryo-ET data. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>We are convinced that we have carefully interpreted, and not over-interpreted, the data presented and have avoided any overstatement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we are confident that the conclusions we draw from our data, namely that Gic1 scaffolds more than two septin filaments, are robust and justified. </plain></SENT>
