</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Due to the large number of available protein structures and progress in remote homology detection, protein structure modeling is progressively focusing on smaller and smaller parts of protein structure [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Indeed, it has been suggested since several years that the diversity of the available structures may be sufficient to identify relevant templates for most of protein domains [2], and concomitantly, the number of new folds discovered has been decreasing constantly [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Protein fold identification being solved in most cases, fold adaptation under sequence divergence results however in local conformational modifications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Small or medium variations still remain to be addressed, in particular small variations in loops, or large insertion-deletions, as for instance recently illustrated in [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The search for short candidate fragments matching a sequence has been tackled within different contexts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Firstly there is interest in analyzing the structure/sequence relationship at the local level, as pioneered by Rooman and Wodak in the early 90′s[5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Many studies have focused on identifying recurring patterns in protein structures, including among others, works related to structural alphabets (SA), fragment classification and many others [6]–[10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Secondly, recurring sequence patterns have also been shown to correspond to conserved functional motifs [11]–[13], or conserved local structures, as demonstrated by the I-Sites of Bystroff and Baker [14], [15], again a motivation for many further studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Finally, protein domains too divergent in sequence can remain out of the scope of homology modeling techniques, and it is interesting that progress in de novo modeling has also come from fragment assembly techniques - see for instance [16], [17], i.e. again considering the local conformation level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Hence, fragment identification has become a key step for both protein structure analysis, annotation and modeling. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The identification of candidate fragments starts from a given amino acid sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Different strategies have been described, considering fragments of fixed or variable length, considering gaps or not. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>I-sites [15] then nnmake [18] search for fragments of fixed length having a strong correlation between sequence and conformation so as to constrain the sampling of the conformational space to generate models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Approaches such as FRAGFOLD [19], TASSER [20], I-Tasser [21] or HHfrag [22] look instead for position-specific structural fragments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Profile comparison approaches have proven valuable to drive fragment identification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>For instance, to identify fragments of variable lengths, HHfrag relies on the hhsearch Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profile comparison approach [23] - accepting gaps - adapted to short segments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Very recently, Xu et al. [24] have reported a gapless approach combining secondary structure, solvent accessibility, phi-psi angle prediction together with amino acid profiles derived from similar fragments from the PDB [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we introduce a new approach to the detection of candidate structural fragments from the amino acid sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>It is designed to search for candidate fragments of variable length at any position in the sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>A major difference with former approaches that usually make use of enriched amino acid profiles, is that the search is based on predicted structural alphabet profiles. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>A structural alphabet can be seen as a generalized secondary structure description allowing to label more accurately local conformations in the structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Here, we use a Hidden Markov Model derived structural alphabet of 27 states - or structural alphabet letters - that describes the proteins as series of overlapping fragments of 4 amino acid length [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The HMM model consists in multivariate gaussians describing the specific geometry of each letter and the transition matrix associated with the Markovian process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Given such model and a protein structure, classical HMM techniques can infer the optimal states at each position, which allows to translate the 3D coordinates of a structure of  amino acids as a series of  letters of the structural alphabet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Starting from an amino acid sequence turns into a prediction problem. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Using a machine learning approach, we have previously setup an approach that predicts the probabilities of the structural alphabet states from an amino acid sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Given a sequence, it returns, for each fragment of 4 amino acid length in the sequence, the probabilities that it is associated with each of the structural alphabet states. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Thus, given a sequence of size , it returns a series of  profiles of dimension 27, which we call here the predicted structural alphabet profile. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>In previous studies, we have shown such prediction can be used to enhance protein domain fold attribution from sequence compared to other approaches using features derived from amino acid profiles [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>We have also designed PEP-FOLD, a de novo approach to peptide modeling [27] based on such prediction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>PEP-FOLD selects, at each position in a peptide sequence, the n-best letters - 8 in the current version, so as to limit the sampling of the local conformational space to perform the 3D assembly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>PEP-FOLD results have shown that the truncated profiles are efficient to grab information about the local structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Here, we turn to the full - not truncated - comparison of the predicted structural alphabet profiles of dimension 27. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>We investigate how profile comparison can be applied to the search for candidate structural fragments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>We introduce a new approach based on such profile comparison. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>We find it outperforms state of the art profile-profile approach such as HHfrag [22] in terms of specificity and precision, while reaching a coverage of the targets close to 90%. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>We have developed a new protocol to identify candidate structural fragments given the amino acid sequence of a query. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>At each position of the sequence, it searches for candidate structural fragments of variable length by mining a bank of structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The search is performed for each query sub-sequences of size between 6 and 27 amino acids, presently using a brute force strategy: for each sub-sequence, a systematic scan of all proteins in the bank is performed, sliding the sub-sequence at each position of each protein, not allowing gap, and scoring the similarity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The scoring is based on the comparison of the structural alphabet profile of the sub-sequence with that of the protein scanned, using the Jensen Shannon divergence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>A flowchart of the complete approach is presented Figure 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>It consists in three steps. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>The first one is the generation of a structural alphabet profile given a query sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>The second one is the systematic search for matches mining a collection of pre-generated profiles for proteins of known structure, and the identification of hits, i.e. matches having a score better than a given value. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Since the number of hits is potentially very large, several mechanisms have been implemented to limit their number (see methods). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The most important consists in the clustering of the hits to identify the most relevant candidate fragments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Also, since we consider various fragment size at each position, it is possible that nested matches are identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the third step performs some redundancy elimination over the hits of different sizes collected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>The underlying strategy of this last step is to sort the matches according to their expected precision, and to favor hits having the best expected precision, while preserving protein coverage by accurate fragments (see methods). </plain></SENT>

</text></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0080493.g002"/></fig></SecTag><p><text><SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>A first observation is the apparent difference between the distributions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Three regions of stronger densities are observed for the helical fragment and only one for the beta hairpin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>In fact the two plots are consistent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Firstly and non surprisingly, in both cases, the areas with the strongest densities occur for simultaneously large cRMSD and MJS values (yellow to purple areas) and correspond to irrelevant matches. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>For the alpha helical fragment, an additional area of strong density is observed for cRMSD close to 2Å. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>It corresponds to the alpha helices of the dataset, the 2Å deviation coming from the non helical C-terminus of the query. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>The third region observed for cRMSD close to 1Å corresponds to the true hits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Its absence for the beta hairpin is only apparent and results from a threshold effect in the iso contours, as can be seen looking at individual dots in the regions of low MJS and low cRMSD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Compared to a helical fragment, fewer hits are expected for a beta hairpin because the larger conformational stability of a helical fragment compared to that of a beta hairpin makes the expected number of very low cRMSD fragments larger for helical conformations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Thus, for both cases, low  values are associated with low cRMSDs, which implies the predicted profiles can lead to the identification of relevant fragments. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>A second observation is that a rather large range of  values can be associated with low cRMSDs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>For instance, for the beta hairpin, fragments having a cRMSD less than 2Å have  values between 0.1 and 0.9. Figure 2-Bottom depicts the relationship between the cRMSD and the  collected for close to 800 fragments of eleven amino acids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>It contains over 500 000 dots. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>A similar behavior is observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>One such example of profile mismatch for low cRMSD is detailled Figure 3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>One fragment (PDB 3h3lA: 75–85) (bottom) has a profile very similar to that of the query (PDB 3nmb:84–94) (top) - distance of 0.11, and the conformations are very close - cRMSD of 0.44Å. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>For another fragment (PDB 1xauA: 95–105) (middle) the profile differs on its C-terminus end. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Particularly, at the penultimate position, the large frequency for letter L is superseded by a large frequency for the letter S, and the profile distance at this position is of 0.77 for a cRMSD of 0.72Å. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>We have investigated more in detail the reasons why such large panel of  values are associated with lows cRMSDs and we have found several reasons can explain it. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Firstly, the distance criterion presently in use measures the similarity by pairing the probabilities of identical local conformations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>It does not consider the possibility for equivalences between non identical conformations, which is over restrictive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the analysis of collections of structural alignments has shown some equivalences between the structural alphabet letters exist, an observation that has been used to derive structural alphabets similarity matrices used for structural alignment techniques [28], [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Consequently, some part of the divergence between profiles can be attributed to such equivalence between similar 3D shapes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>It turns however that considering such equivalences in the distance between profiles adds some complexity and it remains the subject for further work. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Secondly, it is possible that differences in profiles are the result of errors in the prediction, even if our previous analyses related to the 3D de novo modeling of peptides [27] suggest full misprediction of the local conformation is only marginal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>A third explanation is that the cRMSD criterion itself can be misleading [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Low cRMSD fragments can include local deformations that will correspond to different local conformations as assigned by the structural alphabet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Thus for fragments of low cRMSDs, it is possible that a correct prediction can lead to large  values. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have introduced a new approach for the identification of candidate fragments, based on the comparison of structural alphabet profiles predicted from the amino acid sequence. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>As a more detailed characterization of the local structure of proteins compared to the classical secondary structure conformations [31], structural alphabets have previously proven efficient for the analysis of protein conformations, to identify and align similar structures [28], [32], to quantify the statistical significance of structural motifs [13], or to track conformational changes through ensembles of conformations resulting from simulated annealing or molecular dynamics simulations [33]–[36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Such analyses have relied on the identification of only the most representative local conformation at each position in a conformation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>However, sub-optimal encoding can be expected to contain information as well since each state is associated with a variability and since it is well known that some equivalences between the local conformations can be inferred from structural alignments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>The need to consider suboptimal conformations is even greater when using local conformations predicted from an amino-acid sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Probability profiles are usually much smoother than those obtained from 3D structures, and the optimal conformation can be ranked at a sub-optimal position [27], [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>This can be attributed for one part to a weak sequence structure relationship for some sequences or some parts of sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, it also seems such profiles can embed information related to the intrinsic flexibility of protein structure as a function of their entropy [38], suggesting several conformations can be associated with one local sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>It thus seems highly desirable to explore ways considering not solely the best conformation predicted but also the other ones, as proven for instance during the design of the PEP-FOLD de novo prediction approach[27], [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Ultimately, all the probabilities of the local conformations at each position in a structure could be informative. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>The present study is, to our knowledge the first attempt to use the complete information of predicted profiles of local conformation, and our results clearly indicate that such predicted structural alphabet profiles are a relevant mean to grab sequence-conformation relationships at a local level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Indeed our results show that, compared to previous approaches, the major benefit of such approach is its ability to identify fewer hits, but at a better accuracy and precision. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Among the possible reasons for such improvement, the main one is that predicted structural alphabet profiles directly code for local conformation information, a difference with amino acid profiles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Since structure is known to be more conserved that sequence, such encoding could be more relevant, and our previous results about fold attribution [26] support this idea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>In a general manner, the consideration of structural features has been shown to supplement efficiently pure amino acid information. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>It is for example the case for the approach described by Xu and Zhang [24] that, even if more oriented towards contact prediction, makes use of profiles combining amino acid frequencies and predicted structural features. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>Another explanation could be that the higher dimension of the profile - 27 here - could help to grab some accurate details of the local sequence - structure relationship. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>Following, one could ask how the choice of the collection of canonical local conformations impacts the results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the protocol described here is not specific of the particular structural alphabet used, and indeed, numerous collections of short fragments - denominated as structural alphabets or not - have been described by other groups (e.g. [6], [8], [9], [40], [41] among many others). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>However, they vary largely both in the descriptors and methods used to identify them, and consequently in size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>All these differences make likely that the transposition of the protocol to other structural alphabets would require slight but specific adaptations for each step of the protocol. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Turning back to the present procedure, our goal here was primarily to assess the effectiveness of the concept. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>It is clear it could be improved on several aspects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>It is obvious that the brute force strategy used could be revisited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>Redundant Jensen-Shannon calculations are presently performed which could be optimized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>As well, the use of the Jensen-Shannon divergence instead of other criterion such as the Skew divergence could be questioned. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>Following, as discussed before, the weak sensitivity of the protocol could also be the matter for further developments, in particular accepting some equivalence between local conformations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>Such question is clearly of theoretical interest although preliminary tests show it is difficult to foresee the balance between the gain in sensitivity and a possible loss in precision when accepting equivalence between the local conformations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>In terms of candidate fragment identification however, present results clearly show that the large number of structures available already allows to identify accurate fragments for over 90% of a query sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Finally, it could be even more interesting to combine two approaches such as HHfrag and SA-Frag, two profile comparison approaches - although of different kind, to bring a significant improvement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>Embedding SA profiles in the HMM profile comparison approach of HHfrag could be a promising perspective. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>Despite this would open the door to similarity search at larger scale, this perspective still faces however the difficult question of efficiently modeling gaps in structural alphabet profile comparison. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>So far, instead of considering HMM-HMM alignment techniques such as embedded in HHpred or HHfrag for instance [22], [23], we use a more straight approach based on the Jensen Shannon distance to compare two SA profiles  of dimension 27:(1) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>The cRMSD thresholds used for clustering depend on fragment length. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>The goal is to select only the classes with the highest densities, those of low densities being expected to correspond to noise. </plain></SENT>
