He has been suffering from similar episodes of spasms frequently since the age of 5 years. He also had developmental bilateral cataract for which he was operated at the age of 6 years. At admission, he had carpopedal spasm and his vitals were normal. His weight was 29 kg (&lt;5<sup>th</sup> centile), height 132 cm (&lt;5<sup>th</sup> centile) and head circumference 49 cm (&lt;3<sup>rd</sup> centile). On examination, he had facial dysmorphism features like long face, prominent forehead, bilateral dropping of eyelids, preauricular tag on the right side, bilateral pseudophakia with posterior capsular opacification (secondary), beaked nose, depressed nasal bridge, long philtrum, high arched palate, maloccluded teeth, micrognathia and microcephaly [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Latent tetany signs Trousseau sign and chvostek sign were positive. Intelligent quotient assessment revealed mild mental retardation. Other systems examinations were normal. One of his sisters also had operated for developmental cataract at the age of 4 years, having delayed social and personal development, similar facial dysmorphism [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>] but no tetany or latent tetany signs. Both parents and other two sibs were phenotypically normal.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Facial dysmorphism features like long face, prominent forehead, bilateral dropping of eyelids, preauricular tag on the right side, beaked nose, depressed nasal bridge, long philtrum, maloccluded teeth, micrognathia and microcephaly</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJHG-19-363-g001"/></fig><p>His investigations revealed normal blood counts and peripheral smear. His serum calcium was 6.8 mg/dl, serum phosphorus 7.1 mg/dl, serum magnesium 2.2 mg/dl, serum albumin 3.2 g/dl, alkaline phosphatase 124 U/L and intact PTH was 5.46 pg/ml (<italic>N</italic> = 15-65 pg/ml). Blood urea, blood sugar, serum creatinine and electrolytes were normal. Urine chromatography was normal and urinary pH 8. His urine for sugar and ketones was absent. Chest X-ray, humerus X-ray and ultrasound abdomen was normal. Computerized tomographic (CT) scan of the head showed bilateral globus pallidus calcification. Audiogram showed mild hearing loss on the left side with normal hearing on the right side. He was started on intravenous calcium gluconate slow infusion for 2 days followed by calcium tablets. His facial dysmorphic sister serum calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, intact PTH and CT head were normal.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Hypoparathyroidism is an uncommon metabolic disorder characterized by hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia with absent or low levels of PTH.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Congenital hypoparathyroidism may be isolated or associated with syndromes. Familial occurrence of hypoparathyroidism with autosomal dominance, autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive have been well-established.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] HRD or Sanjad-Sakati syndrome (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man [OMIM] #241410) is a rare autosomal recessive syndrome predominantly seen patients of Arab origin.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] It is characterized by hypoparathyroidism, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, facial anomalies, and psychomotor retardation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] It was first reported in 1988 and confirmed by definitive report in 1991.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Clinically, the syndrome has typical facial dysmorphism features like long narrow face, deep set eyes, microcephaly, micrognathia, thin lips, long philtrum, beaked nose, depressed nasal bridge, ear anomalies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Microcephaly with various degrees of mental retardation ranging from mild to severe degree is usual.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Short stature, small hands and feet are very frequently seen. Tapering of the mandible towards the chin is a unique feature of this syndrome.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Our child facial dysmorphism findings are consistent to which are described in the literature. Even his sister has similar facial dysmorphism. However, her biochemical parameters and CT scan head were normal. This could be due to variable expression of the gene. The molecular pathology of this syndrome was shown to be due to mutations in the tubulin-specific chaperone E (TBCE) gene in chromosomal area 1q42-q43 and encoding a TBCE.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] TBCE mutations also cause Kenny-Caffey syndrome (KCS; OMIM 244460) similar to HRD syndrome with permanent hypoparathyroidism. Both syndromes commonly occur in children born to consanguineous couple of Arab ethnicity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] They share the same gene locus, but clinically Kenny-Caffey is characterized by normal intelligence, late closure of anterior fontanel, microcephaly, postnatal growth retardation along with cortical thickening and medullary stenosis of the bones.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Ophthalmic examination help to differentiate the two syndromes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Nanophthalmos and corneal opacity have been documented in KCS patients, but ocular disease has not been well-described in HRD apart from the external ophthalmic features.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Parvari <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that both maps to the same region and suggested that these were likely to be allelic disorders, if not the same condition.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Usually they manifest in the new born period with complications of hypocalcaemia as seizures or tetany.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] However, the age at the diagnosis of the previously reported cases ranged from 4 months to 12 years.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Our child also had symptoms of hypoparathyroidism as tetany at the age of 5 years along with cataract. Estimated incidence of HRD varies from 1:40,000 to 1:100,000 live births in Saudi Arabia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Affected siblings, mainly as products of phenotypically normal consanguineous parents, have been reported.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Until now more than 26 patients have been reported, of whom more than half were familial and affected siblings were reported in five non-consanguineous families also.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] The therapeutic options are limited to correct hypocalcaemia and treatment of infections.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] However, prevention could be achieved through pre-implantation genetic diagnosis and carrier detection.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] To conclude, it is better to do molecular study for TBCE gene, which confirm our clinical evaluation and help much in genetic counseling for the family.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
