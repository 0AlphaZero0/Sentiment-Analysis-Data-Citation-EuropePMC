</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Hypoparathyroidism is an uncommon metabolic disorder characterized by hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia with absent or low levels of PTH.[1] Congenital hypoparathyroidism may be isolated or associated with syndromes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Familial occurrence of hypoparathyroidism with autosomal dominance, autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive have been well-established.[13] HRD or Sanjad-Sakati syndrome (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man [OMIM] #241410) is a rare autosomal recessive syndrome predominantly seen patients of Arab origin.[12] It is characterized by hypoparathyroidism, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, facial anomalies, and psychomotor retardation.[1] It was first reported in 1988 and confirmed by definitive report in 1991.[2] Clinically, the syndrome has typical facial dysmorphism features like long narrow face, deep set eyes, microcephaly, micrognathia, thin lips, long philtrum, beaked nose, depressed nasal bridge, ear anomalies.[1245] Microcephaly with various degrees of mental retardation ranging from mild to severe degree is usual.[4] Short stature, small hands and feet are very frequently seen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Tapering of the mandible towards the chin is a unique feature of this syndrome.[5] Our child facial dysmorphism findings are consistent to which are described in the literature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Even his sister has similar facial dysmorphism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>However, her biochemical parameters and CT scan head were normal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>This could be due to variable expression of the gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The molecular pathology of this syndrome was shown to be due to mutations in the tubulin-specific chaperone E (TBCE) gene in chromosomal area 1q42-q43 and encoding a TBCE.[67] TBCE mutations also cause Kenny-Caffey syndrome (KCS; OMIM 244460) similar to HRD syndrome with permanent hypoparathyroidism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Both syndromes commonly occur in children born to consanguineous couple of Arab ethnicity.[167] They share the same gene locus, but clinically Kenny-Caffey is characterized by normal intelligence, late closure of anterior fontanel, microcephaly, postnatal growth retardation along with cortical thickening and medullary stenosis of the bones.[2589] Ophthalmic examination help to differentiate the two syndromes.[4] Nanophthalmos and corneal opacity have been documented in KCS patients, but ocular disease has not been well-described in HRD apart from the external ophthalmic features.[410] Parvari et al. demonstrated that both maps to the same region and suggested that these were likely to be allelic disorders, if not the same condition.[267] Usually they manifest in the new born period with complications of hypocalcaemia as seizures or tetany.[25] However, the age at the diagnosis of the previously reported cases ranged from 4 months to 12 years.[278] Our child also had symptoms of hypoparathyroidism as tetany at the age of 5 years along with cataract. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Estimated incidence of HRD varies from 1:40,000 to 1:100,000 live births in Saudi Arabia.[2] Affected siblings, mainly as products of phenotypically normal consanguineous parents, have been reported.[2] Until now more than 26 patients have been reported, of whom more than half were familial and affected siblings were reported in five non-consanguineous families also.[2] The therapeutic options are limited to correct hypocalcaemia and treatment of infections.[2] However, prevention could be achieved through pre-implantation genetic diagnosis and carrier detection.[2] To conclude, it is better to do molecular study for TBCE gene, which confirm our clinical evaluation and help much in genetic counseling for the family. </plain></SENT>
