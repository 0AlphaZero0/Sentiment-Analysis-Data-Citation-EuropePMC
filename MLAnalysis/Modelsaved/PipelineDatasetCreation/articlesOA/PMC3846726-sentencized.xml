</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Retinal prostheses may soon become useful clinical interventions for treating various forms of severe vision loss. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Certain conditions, such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP), result in the widespread degeneration of the photoreceptors in the eye; these are the cells responsible for transducing light into neural signals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>However, some cells in other layers of the retina remain and are potential targets for electrical stimulation with a retinal prosthesis 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Early results from human clinical trials have been promising for electrode arrays implanted in the epiretinal 2,3, subretinal 4,5, and intrascleral 6 locations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>These devices are made from different materials with different shapes, but they all use electrical pulses to activate the remaining viable neurons of the retina in order to create visual percepts. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Our wider group (Bionic Vision Australia) has developed a retinal implant that has progressed to a clinical pilot study with 3 RP patients implanted with suprachoroidal electrode arrays (Clinical Trial Number: NCT01603576). Figure 1A shows this suprachoroidal prototype retinal prosthesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Patient safety is paramount in clinical studies and thus, before commencing human trials, we performed extensive acute and chronic testing in preclinical models (Figure 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Histopathological assessments were essential to refine the surgical procedures, iterate through electrode design, and ultimately establish the safety of the implant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>To maintain an efficient workflow dovetailed with standard clinical pathology practices, a paraffin embedding technique was employed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>It was also desirable to utilize staining procedures comparable with clinical standards, such as haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E), which are readily interpreted by pathologists. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>We also wanted a technique that could be adapted for immunohistochemical analyses, in order to facilitate further cellular evaluation of the tissues. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The biocompatibility of the implant materials, and the safety of chronic electrical stimulation, need to be carefully assessed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>It is important to be able to examine the histopathology of the ocular tissue adjacent to the individual stimulating electrodes within the array. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>However, the arrays needed to be removed prior to processing the samples so they can be tested, and because their metallic components could not be readily sectioned. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Consequently, our established tissue preparation did not permit localization and mapping of tissue with respect to the implanted electrodes 7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In addition to the lack of a tissue localization method, the standard formaldehyde-based fixation and processing techniques resulted in widespread artifacts and detachment of the retinal due to the differential shrinkage of the various layers of the eye (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Due to the non-homogeneity of the retina, it was difficult to make valid comparisons with control tissue, particularly for quantitative measurements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>These combined limitations complicated accurate assessments of the potential damage caused by our implanted arrays. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Here we present novel techniques for overcoming these limitations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>We have modified specialized eye fixation and processing techniques 8-10 to maintain compatibility with paraffin-based histology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>We have modified standard histological and immunohistochemical stains to give comparable results, based on feedback from clinical pathologists. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>After rendering the scleral tissue translucent, a dye-based color-code was employed to mark the ocular tissue adjacent to each individual electrode, before removing the array from the suprachoroidal space. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>By marking the electrode array and the individual electrode sites, samples could be accurately collected from electrode adjacent regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Matched samples could be gathered from the control eye in order to facilitate pairwise comparisons. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Assessing the safety of the implant is a primary consideration for preclinical studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Before a retinal prosthesis can be implanted in humans it is essential to verify that it will not cause any harm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>This requires an assessment of both the implant biocompatibility 17-23 as well as any potential damage that could be caused by chronic electrical stimulation 24-26. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Experience with similar neural prostheses, such as the cochlear implant, provides insight into the broad range of stimulation, and physical, parameters that do not cause tissue damage 27. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>However, the retina has different characteristics to other implantation sites and therefore precise safety limits (such as maximum charge density) cannot be assumed from previous studies in other systems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Charge densities are highest at the active electrode sites and this corresponds with the greatest potential for damage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Therefore a method for localizing the tissue directly adjacent to the individual active electrodes would greatly increase the usefulness of these studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>The tissue adjacent to specific regions of the implant may also be highlighted for closer inspection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>This targeted approach permits fewer sections to be analyzed, whilst retaining confidence that the "worst case scenario" was examined. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>The scleral dye localization method described here has been extensively tested with hand-shaped and molded silicone/Pt electrode arrays 28-30. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>It has been used with thin-film polyamide arrays 7,31 and also thin-film silicone/Pt arrays 32. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Some retinal prosthesis studies employed "bullet shaped" electrodes with intrascleral implantations 33. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>The present technique should be effective for assessing this type of electrode arrays. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Feline eyes with thin sclera (thickness at posterior pole 90 - 200 Î¼m) allowed visualization of individual electrodes in an array. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>However, even if individual electrodes were not visible, their positions could be readily inferred using a silicone template when the outline of the array can be seen (similar to that used in step 2.6). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>The dye mapping limits the need to obtain non-relevant tissue sections as only sections with the dye present are obtained. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>The ability to accurately infer electrode position not only allows relevant histopathological analysis and greater statistical power, but has a major impact on time and cost management by reducing the quantity of slides and blades used as well as the cost of labor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>The use of dye that is adherent and can withstand tissue processing whilst also being visible in unstained tissue sections is an important initial consideration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of the location of the dye and orientation of the tissue at dissection and during embedding assists the cutting process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>This includes correctly orientating the block to achieve a section that is not obliquely cut and gives a full representation of the tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>It is therefore important that the person performing the cutting is present at the time of dye application, dissection and embedding. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>The overall protocol is robust to minor alteration, particularly with fixation timings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>However, the eye dissection and dye marking steps are delicate procedures that benefit from good manual dexterity to avoid damaging the specimen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Whilst Davidson's fixative has proved effective for reducing artifactual detachment of the retina near an implant, it does not prevent direct mechanical damage during dissection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Davidson's fixative was not readily compatible with some special histological and immunohistochemical procedures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Therefore there was a need to modify/optimize these steps as detailed above. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Incremental changes in staining times and concentrations were made until the optimum result was achieved - for more details, refer to the supplementary materials. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Quantification of retinal histology remains problematic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>The retina is non-homogeneous and both the thickness and the cell density change with increasing distance from area centralis 34,35. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Therefore, neighboring tissue within the implanted eye cannot be used for comparisons and a control eye is employed instead. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Pairwise matching of each section with the control eye gives us a more powerful statistical comparison of pathological changes; efficacy and safety outcomes with retinal prosthetics are better assessed when comparing the fellow eyes in a subject 36. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Special care must be taken to minimize oblique cutting as this would affect quantification. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>In summary, the methods described above have significantly improved our histopathological analysis, which in turn has led to a more efficient preclinical workflow. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>The results of preclinical studies using these methods directly led to a clinical trial in which 3 RP patients have been safely implanted with suprachoroidal retinal prostheses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>These methods are relevant both to retinal stimulators and other ocular implants where the pathological response to long term implantation needs to be evaluated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>This method provided worthwhile advantages for maintaining the cytoarchitecture and registration of the pathology to regions of interest on the implant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Although not specifically tested, a modification of these procedures may be used in other species and other anatomical locations, particularly where an array is implanted superficially. </plain></SENT>
