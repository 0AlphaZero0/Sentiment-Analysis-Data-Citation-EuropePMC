</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an epithelial malignancy that is common in regions of Southeast Asia and the Mediterranean Basin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The age-adjusted incidence rate of this tumor in Southern China, for example, is 25–30 cases per 100,000 person years, which is approximately 50 times higher than what is observed in the Western world (1–3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Infection with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is believed to be a near necessary factor for the development of NPC (3, 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>EBV is a ubiquitous infection that typically occurs in early life, establishes lifelong latent infection in B-lymphocytes, and periodically reactivates in the epithelial compartment of the pharynx (5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Since EBV infection is common and NPC is rare, it is widely agreed that other environmental and genetic factors are important determinants of NPC risk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>With respect to host genetic factors associated with NPC, human leukocyte antigens (HLA) have been proposed to be important, given their central role in presentation of viral antigens to the immune system (6). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The HLA genes comprise a family of highly polymorphic genes located within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6p21.3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>An association between HLA genes and NPC was first proposed by Simons and colleagues (7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Since that initial report, the association between HLA genes and NPC has been confirmed in over 100 candidate-gene-based association studies (3, 8, 9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>More recently, three independent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of NPC consistently identified SNPs within the MHC region (where HLA genes are located) as having the strongest evidence for association with NPC (10–12). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In this review, we summarize recent findings regarding the association between HLA genes and NPC susceptibility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>We then discuss whether the associations observed in the gene-rich MHC region, where strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns are observed, are driven only by HLA genes or whether other non-HLA genes in the region might also be involved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Finally, we compare GWAS results across cancer sites for which strong hits in the MHC region were observed, to generate new hypotheses regarding the role of HLA genes in the development of EBV-associated cancers such as NPC. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Human leukocyte antigen genes are located within the MHC region on chromosome 6p21. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The MHC region is a gene-dense region (&gt;150 genes) that also exhibits some of the strongest LD patterns within the human genome (13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>These features of the MHC region make studies of HLA-cancer association particularly challenging because it is often difficult to determine whether reported associations are causal and/or reflect LD with other genes in this region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, there is a strong biological a priori for a causal association between HLA genes and NPC, given that HLA molecules are central to the presentation of viral peptides to cytotoxic and helper immune cells, and that infection with EBV is ubiquitously associated with the development of NPC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Of relevance to this review, there are three classical HLA class I genes, namely, HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C, and three clusters of classical HLA class II genes, namely, HLA-DR, HLA-DP, and HLA-DQ that have been evaluated for their association with NPC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Both HLA class I and class II molecules can bind peptides through their peptide recognition groove and present peptides to T cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>However, HLA class I and II genes differ with respect to the types of cells in which they are expressed and the types of immune cells they regulate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>HLA class I molecules are expressed on most nucleated cells and typically present foreign peptides to cytotoxic T cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>HLA class II molecules have a more restricted expression pattern being normally expressed on B-lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells that typically present foreign peptides to helper T cells (13). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>As alluded to in the Introduction, the association between HLA and NPC was first proposed in 1974 and since that time over 100 candidate-gene association studies have consistently reported associations between HLA alleles/haplotypes and NPC (3, 8, 9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>More specifically, studies have reproducibly reported associations with NPC for the following HLA class I alleles: HLA-A*0207 (risk allele in LD with HLA-B*4601), HLA-A*1101 (protective allele in LD with HLA-B*13), and HLA-B*5801 (risk allele in LD with HLA-A*3303) (9, 14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Linkage analyses also suggested that HLA-A and HLA-B genes are associated with the development of NPC (15–17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Other HLA genes, including HLA-C and HLA class II genes, showed less consistent findings across studies (9). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>With the advent of technologies to interrogate the entire genome to better understand the genetic architecture of complex diseases (18), it has become possible to evaluate HLA-NPC associations in the context of genetic associations in other regions of the genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>To date, four NPC GWAS have been reported (10–12, 19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Of these four studies, three reported the strongest hits in the MHC region, where HLA genes reside (10–12) and only one GWAS (the smallest with a total of 110 NPC cases and 260 controls in the discovery phase) did not report genome-wide significant hits in the MHC region (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The largest NPC GWAS to date from Guangdong, China (3,477 and 6,570 individuals in discovery and replication phases, respectively) reported their strongest finding to be located in HLA-A (rs2860580; PGWAS = 1.34 × 10−28, Pcombined = 4.88 × 10−67, OR = 0.58; Figure 1, NPCb) (11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The strongest reported associations for the Taiwan (562 and 2,275 individuals in discovery and replication phases, respectively) (10) and Guangxi, China (1,043 and 985 individuals in discovery and replication phases, respectively) (12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>NPC GWAS were also located in HLA-A (Taiwan GWAS: rs2517713, PGWAS = 3.56 × 10−8, Pcombined = 3.90 × 10−20, OR = 1.88, Figure 1, NPCa; Guangxi, China GWAS: rs417162, PGWAS = 1.13 × 10−7, Pcombined = 1.05 × 10−11, OR = 0.63, Figure 1, NPCc). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>It is noteworthy to point out that rs2860580 and rs2517713 are in complete LD, and that the Guangxi, China GWAS (12) also observed strong evidence for association for rs2517713 (PGWAS = 3.03 × 10−7, Pcombined = 1.63 × 10−11, OR = 0.60, Figure 1, NPCc). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>While significant associations were reported for SNPs in the HLA-B/C and HLA-DR/DQ regions in the Guangdong, China NPC GWAS (rs2894207; PGWAS = 1.22 × 10−16, Pcombined = 3.42 × 10−33, OR = 0.61; rs28421666; PGWAS = 3.54 × 10−9, Pcombined = 2.49 × 10−18, OR = 0.67, respectively) (11) they were not as strong as those observed for SNPs located in HLA-A. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in the Guangxi NPC GWAS (12), where high resolution HLA genotyping was performed, multivariate analyses suggested that associations were driven by HLA-A*1101 and that presence of glutamine at amino acid position 62 of the HLA-A gene (which marks HLA-A*11) was strongly associated with NPC risk providing a biological basis for the SNP-based associations reported. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>In addition to HLA genes, other genes in the MHC region of chromosome 6p21.3 have been found to be associated with NPC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Notably, results from the Taiwan NPC GWAS (10) suggested significant associations for the HLA complex group 9 (HCG9) gene (rs9260734, PGWAS = 2.49 × 10−7, Pcombined = 6.77 × 10−18, OR = 1.85), and the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) B receptor 1 (GABBR1) gene (rs29232, PGWAS = 1.67 × 10−8Pcombined = 8.97 × 10−17, OR = 1.67). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>These associations were also observed in the two NPC GWAS from China (11, 12), suggesting that the associations observed are real and not driven by chance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Given the strong LD patterns observed in the MHC region, however, the issue of whether these associations implicate new genes involved in NPC or mark one or more of the HLA associations discussed above is still an open question. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>HCG9 is a non-protein coding gene located within 30 kb of the HLA-A gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Given its close proximity to HLA-A and lack of known function, it is hypothesized that SNPs within this gene reported to be associated with NPC in recently published GWAS reflect LD with causal polymorphisms within HLA-A. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>In fact, multivariate analyses of data from the Taiwan (10) and two China (11, 12) GWAS suggested that hits within the HCG9 region are not independent of the HLA-A findings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a recent pooled analysis of two NPC case-control studies in Taiwan that jointly evaluated HLA and HCG9 confirmed that the HCG9 signal observed in the original Taiwan GWAS is likely to be driven by HLA rather than an independent signal (20). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>In contrast to HCG9, GABBR1 encodes a G protein-coupled receptor that forms a heterodimer with GABAB receptor 2, thereby triggering downstream signaling events in the proliferation, differentiation, and migration of cancer cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>This known biological function provides some a priori support for a possible functional role of GABBR1 in cancer development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Following the initial Taiwan GWAS finding, sequencing of full-length GABBR1 genes, including the rs29232 region, was performed in 37 NPC cases with high-risk haplotypes and 48 controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>No germ line mutations were detected and most of the novel association signals either failed to be validated or did not reach the statistical significance of rs29232 (10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>However, in this same study expression of the GABBR1 protein in NPC tissues was also evaluated using immunohistochemical staining and the intensity of the GABBR1 signal in tumor cells was significantly higher than that detected in adjacent normal epithelial cells (P &lt; 0.001) (10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>This finding provides additional support for a potential functional role for GABBR1 in the etiology of NPC. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Statistical approaches have also been employed in an attempt to determine whether GWAS findings in HLA-A and GABBR1 represent distinct, independent associations, or whether they represent a single association marked by SNPs in both gene regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Results from these efforts have been mixed, however, multivariate logistic regression analysis of the Taiwan GWAS data indicated that the GABBR1 signal (rs29232) remained significant after controlling for the effect of HLA-A GWAS SNPs and sequence-based HLA-A alleles, namely, HLA-A*0207/0215N or HLA-A*110101/0121N (10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Similar efforts from the two China GWAS, however, suggested that the GABBR1 effect was largely driven by the HLA-A SNPs/alleles (11, 12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>An analysis of pooled data from two NPC case-control studies conducted in Taiwan that jointly evaluated HLA-A and GABBR1 reported that while the effect of GABBR1 was attenuated by adjustment for HLA-A alleles, a significant effects for GABBR1 (rs29232) remained after adjustment for HLA-A and that an independent effect of GABBR1 could therefore not be ruled out (20). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>In summary, while HLA genes, and HLA-A in particular, likely explain much of the signals observed from NPC GWAS in the MHC region on chromosome 6p21.3, the possibility that other genes in the region, such as GABBR1, might also be causally involved in NPC cannot be discarded at this time. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>We reasoned that examination of findings from the MHC region across these GWAS might provide interesting clues into the link between HLA genes and infection-associated cancers such as NPC. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>While these groupings are somewhat arbitrary (e.g., we grouped gastric cancers with EBV-associated cancers despite its strong link with H. pylori infection since approximately 8% of gastric cancers are known to be EBV-positive and the focus of this review is on NPC, another EBV-associated cancer), we believe that they provide a useful rubric for summarizing findings across a diverse set of cancers. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>The HLA class I association observed for EBV(+) HL is consistent with findings for NPC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>The HLA class II association observed for EBV(−) HL is consistent with findings for other hematopoetic cancers and cancers caused by infections other than EBV (discussed further below). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>A second HL GWAS that did not stratify by EBV status provides evidence for association with HLA class II but failed to observe and association with HLA class I (22). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Finally, a GWAS that focused on nodular sclerosis HL, a subtype of HL thought not to be EBV-associated, also reported associations with HLA class II genes only (23). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>This highlights the importance of stratifying analyses on viral status for this heterogeneous disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Finally, four gastric cancer GWAS have been published (24–27). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>None reported evidence for a significant association within the MHC region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>It should be noted, however, that &lt;10% of gastric cancers are EBV(+) and so the lack of association observed within the MHC might reflect the lack of stratification on EBV status rather than a true lack of association for EBV(+) gastric cancers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>In summary, GWAS of EBV(+) cancers have consistently reported associations in the MHC region, and within the MHC the strongest evidence points to an important role for HLA class I genes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Next, we evaluated results from GWAS for other infection-associated cancers (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Of the cancers with proven link to viral infections other than EBV, GWAS have been reported for cervical cancer (linked to human papillomavirus infection) and HCC (linked to hepatitis B and C infections, HBV and HCV respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Two cervical cancer GWAS reported the strongest evidence for association within the HLA class II region of the MHC (28, 29). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>The four HCC GWAS that specifically evaluated HCV-related or HBV-related cancers all reported strong hits within the HLA class II region (30–33). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the one HCC GWAS that did not stratify by virus status (34) observed evidence for association within the MHC region, but failed to report significant associations within HLA, again highlighting the importance of stratification by viral status for etiologically heterogeneous tumors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Of note, none the four GWAS of gastric cancer, a cancer linked with infection with the bacteria Helicobacter pylori, reported significant associations within the MHC region, suggesting differences in the HLA associations observed for bacterial- versus viral-associated cancers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>In summary, all GWAS of non-EBV virus infection-associated cancers (HPV, HBV, and HCV) that specifically considered viral status reported evidence for HLA class II associations with disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>This contrasts with EBV-associated cancers, where evidence consistently points to HLA class I involvement. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Finally, we examined GWAS for other hematopoetic and solid tumors (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Again, clear and consistent patterns emerged. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>For other hematopoetic tumors, signals observed in the MHC region were consistently located within the HLA class II region or outside of the HLA class I or II regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>In contrasts, for other solid tumors for which significant signals were observed in the MHC region, the observed signals were consistently located outside of the HLA class I or II regions and appeared to involve non-HLA genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>The one exception to this was the HLA class II (rs2395185) association observed for lung cancer in never-smoking woman in Asia (35). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>It should be noted that, in contrast to observations for infection-associated cancers, significant MHC signals were not always observed for other hematopoetic and solid tumors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>For example, amongst hematopoetic tumors, no evidence for significant associations within the MHC region were reported for GWAS of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (36–39), chronic myeloid leukemia (40), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (41). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>For other solid tumors, no evidence for significant associations within the MHC region were reported for GWAS of basal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, esophageal cancer, Ewing sarcoma, gallbladder cancer, glioblastoma, glioma, melanoma, multiple myeloma, neuroblastoma, ovarian cancer, ovarian reserve, pancreatic cancer, renal cell carcinoma, small-cell lung cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid cancer, urinary bladder cancer, and Wilms tumor (NHGRI GWAS catalog1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the present review of published cancer GWAS suggests that: HLA class I genes are important for EBV-associated cancers.HLA class II genes are important for HPV, HBV, and HCV-associated cancers.HLA class II and/or non-HLA genes in the MHC region explain associations within the MHC for other hematopoetic malignancies, andThere is less evidence for HLA (class I or II) involvement in the development of other solid tumors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Particularly striking was the tendency for EBV-associated cancers to be linked to HLA class I genes, while other cancers had stronger evidence for HLA class II gene associations (HPV, HBV, and HCV-associated cancers; and some hematopoetic malignancies) or for the involvement of non-HLA genes in the MHC region (other solid tumors and some hematopoetic malignancies). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>We therefore considered further the characteristics of EBV infection that might explain the “predilection” of EBV-associated cancers to be associated with HLA class I genes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the genetic basis for immunological responses to EBV infection, despite the belief that such responses are important mediators of cancer risk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>The only published GWAS that evaluated genetic factors associated with antibodies against EBV reported evidence for the involvement of HLA class II genes in EBV seroreactivity, measured as anti-EBV EBNA-1 IgG levels (42). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>This finding appears at face value to be inconsistent with the strong HLA class I association observed for NPC, but needs to be interpreted with caution since the anti-EBV antibody evaluated (IgG against EBNA-1) is not a good marker of NPC risk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>In the future, it will be important to evaluate genetic factors associated with anti-EBV EBNA-1 and VCA IgA responses because (1) EBNA-1 and VCA are the antigens for which strong and consistent associations with risk of NPC development have been observed and (2) IgA responses (rather than IgG responses) are thought to better reflect chronic EBV reactivation at mucosal surfaces believed to be required for NPC development. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>One hypothesis to explain the specific association of HLA class I genes with EBV-associated cancers while HPV, HBV, and HCV-associated cancers have more clear associations with HLA class II genes invokes site of infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Of all infectious agents known to be directly linked to cancer, EBV is the only one that establishes lifelong latency in B-lymphocytes and requires infection of the epithelial compartment during lytic reactivation for viral shedding and transmission. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>Perhaps HLA class I genes are important mediators of this complex biological lifecycle, although precisely how this might be remains to be established. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Of interest to note in this respect is the fact that progression to AIDS among HIV infected individuals has been consistently shown to be associated with HLA class I alleles (43). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Since HIV is a virus that, like EBV, establishes lifelong infection in lymphocytes, the commonality of these findings might suggest a parallel HLA-mediated immunological response pathway for these two pathogens that is distinct from that for other infectious agents linked to cancer development. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Human leukocyte antigen genes have long been suggested to be associated with NPC risk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Recent NPC GWAS have confirmed this association and have further indicated that the strongest genetic associations with NPC reside within HLA class I genes, particularly HLA-A. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>This contrasts with what has been observed for other tumors, suggesting a unique relationship between EBV and HLA class I genes and the need for studies to more specifically define how and which host genetic differences in antigen presentation of specific EBV antigens affects the EBV tumorigenesis process by promoting viral escape of host immune surveillance leading to NPC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>These studies could provide clues not only about EBV and NPC, but also about the relationship between other oncogenic infectious agents and their respective cancers and on the nature of HLA associations for hematopoetic malignancies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>While challenges remain, given the strong LD patterns observed in the MHC, the large number of genes in this region and the highly polymorphic nature of HLA genes themselves, the prospect of studying diverse populations with distinct HLA patterns and LD structure, and of applying new technologies such as high-throughput sequencing and molecular profiling techniques to elucidate the complex structure of the MHC and its association with NPC and other cancers could lead to better insights into our understanding of the specific mechanisms involved in cancer pathogenesis. </plain></SENT>
