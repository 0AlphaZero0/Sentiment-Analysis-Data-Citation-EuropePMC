</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Chronic alveolar hypoxia leads to the development of pulmonary hypertension (PH) which is characterized by a sustained elevation of pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance leading to the development of right ventricular hypertrophy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>This direct effect of hypoxia on vascular resistance is unique to the pulmonary circulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>On moving to high altitude previously normal but susceptible lowlanders can develop progressive pulmonary hypertension leading to right ventricular failure which is fatal if not corrected by return to low altitude [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary hypertension frequently complicates chronic hypoxic lung diseases leading to right ventricular failure and reduced life expectancy [1]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Two important mechanisms that cause elevation in pulmonary vascular resistance in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension are vasoconstriction and structural changes in the vascular bed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>First, sustained rho kinase dependent vasoconstriction contributes a major part of the total increase, 50–90% depending on the species [3]–[7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The second major mechanism is structural change to the pulmonary vascular bed that causes an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance independent of vasoconstrictor activity [3]–[7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The transcriptional mechanisms that control the changes in gene expression underlying these pulmonary specific responses are clearly unique to the lung but remain to be fully elucidated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>We recently reported that the cAMP response element binding factor CREB1 was activated by hypoxia in the lung by phosphorylation of the regulatory serine within the kinase insert domain, but not simultaneously activated in other organs, suggesting a key role for this transcription factor in the specific pulmonary responses to hypoxia [8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Previous work had shown that adenoviral mediated expression of a dominant-negative form of CREB (Ad-CREB-M1) attenuated systemic vascular smooth muscle cell hypertrophy induced by angiotensin-II [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, transfection of Ad-CREB-M1 at the site of balloon angioplasty injury reduced subsequent neointimal formation [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Taken together these reports suggested that CREB activation contributed to disease progression in systemic vascular diseases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In contrast, other reports suggested that CREB could exert a protective effect in vascular disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>These included evidence that CREB expression was reduced in diseased regions of blood vessels in which there was a high rate of proliferation and that activation of CREB could inhibit vascular smooth muscle proliferation [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In view of these contradictory data, it was unclear whether the hypoxia-induced CREB activation in the lung in vivo that we had previously reported acted to worsen or to ameliorate hypoxic pulmonary hypertension [8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The CREB1 gene encodes three functional isoforms of CREB α (also known as isoform B), Δ (isoform A) and β (isoform C) produced by alternative splicing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>CREB Δ is ubiquitously expressed in adult tissues and is the most abundant isoform in normal adult tissues, comprising approximately 60–70% of the total CREB in a tissue [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The transactivation potential of CREB α and Δ are approximately equal whereas that of CREB β is significantly less [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, CREB β when expressed together with CREB Δ does not significantly enhance promoter activity [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Thus, in normal tissues CREB β is thought to play a minor role in the control of CREB regulated gene expression [12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Deletion of the three functional splice variants of CREB1, α, β and Δ, is not compatible with postnatal survival [12], [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Mice with a homozygous disruption of exon 2 of the CREB gene which leads to loss of the α and Δ isoforms with continued expression of CREB β, are viable and have been previously used to study memory formation and cognitive performance in which they show a hypomorphic phenotype [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>To directly examine the role of the α and Δ isoforms of CREB1 in the lung in vivo, we investigated the pulmonary vascular responses of these hypomorphic, CREBαΔ−/− mice in normoxia and following sustained hypoxia and revealed a central role for these two isoforms of CREB1 in maintaining the normally low pulmonary vascular resistance. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that alveolar hypoxia, similar to that found in lung diseases and at high altitude, leads to selective phosphorylation and activation of CREB1 in the absence of similar activation in other organs, suggesting that this transcription factor has an important role to play in the pulmonary response to hypoxia [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation dependent activation of CREB by hypoxia has also previously been shown in cell studies in vitro [20]–[23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>However, others had reported reduced CREB1 expression in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle following sustained lung hypoxia and suggested that a consequent reduction in CREB1 activity played a key role in pulmonary vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension [24], [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Hypoxia induced reduction in CREB1 expression and transcriptional activity had previously been noted in gastrointestinal epithelial cells [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Subsequently the same group had reported that the hypoxia induced CREB1 reduction was transient and that stable, active CREB1 expression had returned to normal values when hypoxia persisted (&gt;24 hours) for more extended periods [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Others, using different cells types, had not found CREB depletion in hypoxia, in agreement with our previous findings in whole lung homogenates [8], [20]–[23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>The exact reasons for these different results were not apparent and, as a result, the role of CREB1 in the hypoxic lung remained unclear. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we further explored the role of CREB1 by examining the pulmonary response to hypoxia following partial loss of CREB1 due to homozygous, ubiquitous deletion of two of its three isoforms, α and Δ, and found an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance in these mice under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Right ventricular hypertrophy was observed in both hypoxic wildtype and CREBαΔ mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Of note, the right ventricular hypertrophy was significantly greater in hypoxic CREBαΔ mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>In addition, a greater increase in lung volume in response to hypoxia was observed in CREBαΔ mice associated with a reduction in the alveolar epithelial surface density suggestive of an emphysematous phenotype. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Mice in which all three functional isoforms of CREB, α, β and Δ, have been knocked out, die shortly after birth due to respiratory distress syndrome demonstrating that CREB activity is required for normal lung development [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>In the CREBαΔ mouse used in these studies, only the CREBβ isoform is expressed; no mRNA for CREB α or Δ can be detected [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>CREB Δ is the predominant isoform expressed in normal mouse tissues and in these CREBαΔ mice, it has been shown that the CREBβ isoform protein is markedly upregulated in the brain [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Another member of the CREB family of transcription factors, CREM, was increased in brain, liver and kidney of these knock-out mice [12]–[14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Thus, it has been suggested that upregulation of CREB and CREM compensate for the loss of the α and Δ isoforms permitting postnatal survival. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>However, this has not been examined previously in the lung. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>We report here for the first time upregulation of CREBβ and CREM mRNA in the lung (Figure 1) in mice lacking α and Δ isoforms of CREB, similar to that previously reported in other tissues [12]–[14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>We then examined the expression of CREB protein using three different antibodies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>No CREBα or CREBΔ isoforms were detected in the lungs of the CREBαΔ mice using an antibody that detects these two isoforms (Figure 2A), confirming effective deletion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, an antibody that detects all three isoforms, α, Δ and β showed substantially reduced total CREB1 protein in both normoxic and hypoxic lungs of the CREBαΔ mouse (Figure 2B and 2C), demonstrating that any upregulation of CREBβ protein that may have occurred still left total CREB1 protein substantially reduced below normal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Clearly post-translational mechanisms account for the low CREB protein expression in the lungs of these mice given the marked increase in CREBβ mRNA (Figure 1A) that we observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Taken together with our finding that the amount of CREB protein phosphorylated on its regulatory serine residue (serine133 in the CREBα isoform) was markedly reduced in the CREBαΔ mice, this suggests that CREB1 activity was reduced in the knockout mice (Figure 2D). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Our findings also demonstrate that in the wild type mice total CREB1 expression and regulatory serine phosphorylation were unchanged following three weeks of hypoxia, when compared to normoxoic controls (Figure 2B, 2C and 2D), a finding consistent with our previous findings in the hypoxic mouse lung and those previously reported by other groups in a variety of cell types and species [8], [20]–[23], [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Klemm and colleagues have found reduction of CREB1 expression in the hypoxic rat lung [24], [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>This difference may be due to species differences but requires further experimentation to elucidate. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>In view of our finding that CREB1 protein was reduced in the CREBαΔ mice, we examined the expression of four genes that are altered in pulmonary hypoxia, have established roles in lung disease and have bioinformatically predicted CREB binding sites in their promoters [8], [28]–[33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>For three of these, BDNF, FST and PLAT, the role of CREB1 in regulating their expression has been previously directly verified by demonstration of CREB1 binding to CRE within their promoters and attenuation of their expression following mutation of the CRE or dominant negative suppression of CREB1 activity indicating that the overall effect of CREB1 family members was to act as an enhancer of gene expression in those studies of isolated cells [34]–[36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>In our study, basal expression of these genes was increased in the lungs of CREBαΔ mice (Figure 3), demonstrating that CREB α and Δ isoforms normally act to repress their expression in the lungs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, expression of EDN1 was unaltered in the CREBαΔ mice (Figure 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>This is the one of the four genes examined in which direct confirmation of CREB binding to, and regulation of, the promoter has not been previously reported (Figure 3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>While our results show altered regulation of these three CREB1 regulated genes, it is important to note that loss of the α and Δ isoforms resulted in increased expression of these genes in the hypoxic lungs whereas it had been previously demonstrated that dominant negative suppression of CREB1 activity or mutation of the CRE site within their promoters had reduced their expression in cell culture conditions [34]–[36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Although this may at first seem surprising, different effects of CREB activation in different cells types are well recognized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Binding of the different CREB family members to the cAMP-response element within promoter elements and regulation of gene expression is cell type specific [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>This is well illustrated by tissue plasminogen activator (PLAT), one of the CREB regulated genes whose expression we examined (Figure 3), which is increased by CREB family activation in HeLa cells, an epithelial cell type, but suppressed by CREB family activation in HT1080 cells, a mesenchymal cell line [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>These differing effects in different cells types arise, at least in some cases, through competition for binding at the CRE site between the members of the CREB family including CREB1, the α, Δ and β isoforms, CREM, ATF-1 and 2, and other cyclic-AMP responsive transcription factors [38]–[40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Cell specific expression patterns of these transcription factors can contribute to the different effects of CREB activation in different cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Other mechanisms could also contribute to the changes in gene expression observed in the CREBαΔ mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>CREB interacts with nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), often antagonizing NFAT actions [41]; interestingly NFAT plays an important role in the development of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension [42], [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>CREB can bind to the hypoxia response element (HRE) within promoters and thus interact with HIF regulated transcription in hypoxia [44]–[46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>CREB1 and HIF can also interactively control gene expression by binding to CRE and HRE respectively within a gene promoter [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Similarly, CREB and NFκB can exert an interactive effect on the regulation of gene expression [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Thus, loss of CREB α and Δ might have led to altered gene expression through the partial loss of a modulating effect of CREB on HIF, NFκB and NFAT actions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>A further mechanism by which these transcription factors could interact is through competition for binding of CBP/P300 [47] and loss of CREB α and Δ could have altered the availability of CBP/P300gene for HIF and NFκB interaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>It is interesting to note that all of these transcription factors are known to be important in the transcriptional responses of the lung to hypoxia [42], [43], [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Any of these mechanisms, or several acting together, could have contributed to the altered gene expression and pulmonary phenotype that we observed in the CREBαΔ mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, it is clear that CREB α and Δ are required for normal pulmonary vascular function and a normal response to hypoxia. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>To determine the effect of hypoxia on the pulmonary vascular resistance, we used an isolated ventilated perfused lung preparation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>This preparation eliminates any potential influences of the CREBαΔ deletion on pulmonary arterial pressure mediated indirectly by changes in cardiac output, right or left heart function, endocrine and reflex influences acting on the pulmonary circulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Thus, the increased pulmonary vascular resistance that we observed in the CREBαΔ mice (Figure 4) must have resulted from changes that were intrinsic to the lung. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Moreover, since we perfused the lungs with a standard physiological buffer solution, the greater pulmonary vascular resistance in hypoxic CREBαΔ lungs could not have been the result of the differences in hematocrit in wild-type and CREBαΔ mice (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>We next examined two mechanisms of increased pulmonary vascular resistance that have previously been shown to be important in the chronically hypoxic lung, vasoconstriction and vascular remodelling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>The RhoA-ROCK pathway is particularly important in the regulation of vascular tone in the pulmonary circulation, making a greater contribution to agonist-induced vasoconstriction than in the systemic circulation under normal conditions and contributing substantially to two important specific features of the normal pulmonary vascular bed, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and the resistance of the pulmonary vessels to the vasodilator effects of hypercapnic acidosis [6], [50], [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Following long term alveolar hypoxia, this pathway is unregulated and makes a major contribution to the development of pulmonary hypertension by causing sustained vasoconstriction [3]–[5], [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in the chronically hypoxic lung, following maximal vasodilation by rho kinase inhibition, no further reduction in resistance can be achieved by chelation of Ca++, demonstrating that maximal rho kinase inhibition can be used to assess the vasoconstrictor contribution to the increased resistance of the chronically hypoxic pulmonary vascular bed [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>For these reasons we specifically analyzed the effects of CREB α and Δ loss on rho kinase mediated vasoconstriction, although it must be remembered that CREB may regulate the expression of other proteins that control pulmonary vascular smooth muscle contraction e.g. by modulating membrane potential or calcium entry mechanisms [52], [53]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>The data presented here confirm increased ROCK mediated vasoconstriction in chronic hypoxia in normal wild type lungs, as demonstrated by an increased vasodilator effect of the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (Figure 4), but did not show a statistically significant difference in this response between the two genotypes (P&lt;0.07, 2-way ANOVA, interaction). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the increased pulmonary vascular resistance observed in both normoxic and hypoxic CREBαΔ mice when compared to wild types was not caused by a difference in rho kinase activity between the two genotypes, making it unlikely that the enhanced resistance in CREBαΔ mice was the result of increased vasoconstriction. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Hypoxia has previously been reported to increase α-actin expression and RhoA dependent actin polymerization in the lung during the development of pulmonary hypertension and, in view of this, we examined the effect of the CREBαΔ mutation on the expression of smooth muscle α-actin [43], [54], [55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>In agreement with those previous reports, we observed a hypoxia-induced increase in α-actin mRNA expression in wild-type mice (Figure 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>We also observed a significant increase in α-actin mRNA expression in the normoxic CREBαΔ mice when compared to normoxic wildtypes (Figures 5D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>This actin protein increase by hypoxia is compatible with hypoxia-induced smooth muscle cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia, in keeping with the vessel wall thickening that we observed in both genotypes (Figure 7D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>It is also compatible with the enhanced vasoconstrictor tone we found in both hypoxic wild-type and hypoxic CREBαΔ mice (Figure 4B). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>A second major mechanism that contributes to increased pulmonary vascular resistance in hypoxic lungs is structural remodeling of the pulmonary vascular bed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>To analyze the contribution of structural changes in the vasculature to the elevated pulmonary vascular resistance, we examined intra-acinar vessels by quantitative stereological analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Our findings in the wild-type hypoxic group (Figure 7) are in good agreement with our previous reports using this technique, in that we found thickening of the walls of the vessels within the intra-acinar region and reduction in the mean lumen diameter when compared to normoxic controls [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>As the vessels were fixed following dilatation with Y-27632 and at standard maximal transmural pressures, these differences in diameter must have been a consequence of structural changes [4], [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>However, we did not detect any structural differences between the wild-type and CREBαΔ mice in normoxia or following hypoxic exposure that could account for the augmented resistance observed in the CREBαΔ mice. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Thus, the higher resistance observed in the normoxic and hypoxic CREBαΔ mice must be due to mechanisms that are independent of hypoxia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary vascular resistance increases with increasing lung volumes independently of changes in airway pressure [38], [56]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in more compliant emphysematous lungs, vascular resistance increases due to loss of tissue recoil which normally contributes to maintaining vessel patency [37], [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Taken together with our finding that the lungs of CREBαΔ mice were more compliant and had reduced alveolar surface area density (Figure 8), these data suggest that increased lung volume and reduced elastic recoil may have caused the increased vascular resistance that we observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, Martorana and colleagues demonstrated very similar findings in tight-skin mice in which emphysema and associated lung enlargement developed spontaneously. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Those mice developed right ventricular hypertrophy typical of pulmonary hypertension without pulmonary vascular remodeling, providing evidence of increased vascular resistance secondary to changed lung compliance [57], [58]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Thus, while our data suggest that altered lung compliance may have increased pulmonary vascular resistance in CREBαΔ mice; further work is needed to directly confirm this. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>In summary, this study represents the first direct investigation of the role of CREB α and Δ in pulmonary homeostasis in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>We show that a CREB1 mutation that leads to loss of these two isoforms, causes increased pulmonary vascular resistance in both normoxia and hypoxia, demonstrating that normal expression and function of these isoforms is essential to maintain the normal low pulmonary vascular resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Similarly enhanced lung volume with reduced alveolar epithelial surface density was observed in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions in CREBαΔ mice demonstrating normal function of all CREB1 isoforms is required to maintain the normal alveolar structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that interventions that mimic or enhance CREB α and Δ isoform activation in hypoxic lung diseases should be investigated as potential therapeutic strategies. </plain></SENT>
