</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) is the primary component of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), a pathological hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism associated with chromosome 17, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which has recently gained significant attention due to sports- and military-related injuries (1–4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The threshold between preclinical AD and the onset of cognitive symptoms is marked by the increasing burden of NFT pathology, and the accumulation of aggregated p-tau appears to be the primary mediator of cognitive dysfunction (5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As patients progress to severe dementia, the burden of tau pathology rises to peak levels (5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the classification of AD cases into subtypes and the resulting clinical phenotype is ultimately determined by the localization and distribution of tau pathology in the hippocampus and association cortices (6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the focus of drug discovery efforts has now shifted towards the prevention of abnormal accumulation of p-tau to slow the progression of AD, but the field has yet to validate a high-value therapeutic pathway to target. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Based on our recent discovery that expression of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) positively correlates with tau burden, while a decrease in HDAC6 activity or expression promotes tau clearance (7), we further investigated the basis of this relationship in the current study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of note, HDAC6 activity is upregulated in hippocampal neurons exposed to Aβ1–42 (8), as well as in the brain of transgenic mice modeling AD amyloidosis (Tg6799 mice) (8), which have been shown to accumulate p-tau (9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>HDAC6 levels have also been shown to be elevated in the brains of patients with AD (10,11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In addition, loss of HDAC6 restored cognitive function without impacting Aβ plaque burden in a transgenic mouse model of AD (12), and also rescued the abnormal behavioral phenotype in a Drosophila model of tauopathy (13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these findings suggest that Aβ-mediated stimulation of HDAC6 deacetylase activity could contribute to the development and progression of tau pathology, and that decreasing HDAC6 activity may interrupt this cycle and prevent the detrimental physiological consequences of tau pathology. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It is thus of particular interest that tau itself is a substrate of HDAC6 (14), which prompted us to critically evaluate the impact of HDAC6-mediated deacetylation on tau biology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that HDAC6 regulates the acetylation of tau on KXGS motifs (consisting of KIGS and KCGS motifs), which are localized within tau's microtubule-binding domain and play a crucial role in tau's ability to bind and stabilize microtubules (15–18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In addition, we detect a competitive relationship between acetylation and phosphorylation on this motif, such that acute administration of a selective HDAC6 inhibitor simultaneously blocks phosphorylation and increases acetylation of tau at these crucial KXGS motifs in mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>We also observe a decrease in tau aggregation following its acetylation on KXGS motifs in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, KXGS motifs are hypoacetylated and hyperphosphorylated in patients with AD, as well as a progressive mouse model of tauopathy (rTg4510), verifying that modulation of this site is linked to disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Given that tau species phosphorylated on KXGS motifs accumulate in NFTs (19), fail to bind and stabilize microtubules (15) and are also primed for phosphorylation by other kinases (20,21), our results show that augmenting acetylation of KXGS motifs on tau is a promising approach to slow or prevent disease progression in tauopathies. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>We previously demonstrated that overexpression of HDAC6 promotes the accumulation of p-tau, whereas lowering HDAC6 stimulates p-tau clearance (7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>To gain a better understanding of the relationship between the deacetylase HDAC6 and tau, we first examined the impact of acetylation on tau filament assembly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>To do so, recombinant full-length tau (4R0N isoform) was acetylated in vitro by co-incubation with acetyl CoA and the acetyltransferase p300. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>We anticipated acetylation with p300 would enhance tau assembly as previously reported with the use of the acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein (14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>However, we observed robust inhibition of tau aggregation following acetylation, as detected by thioflavin S (Fig. 1E) and electron microscopy (EM; Fig. 1B, C and F–H; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddt402/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>While heat-inactivated (h.i.) p300 failed to promote tau acetylation (Fig. 1A) or block tau polymerization (Fig. 1D–H; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddt402/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</ext-link>), we demonstrate active p300 catalyzes tau acetylation and prevents tau assembly in a dose-dependent manner (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddt402/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S2</ext-link>A and B). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Given that tau's KXGS motifs are known to be critical to tau function (15–18), we sought to assess the impact of acetylation on these motifs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>As such, we first generated a novel antibody (ac-KIGS) designed to specifically recognize acetylated-lysine residues within tau's KIGS motifs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>To assess specificity of the antibody, we performed an in vitro acetylation reaction with either 4R tau or mutant K259/353R 4R tau, containing a mutation in the lysine residue of the first and last KXGS motifs to prevent acetylation at these sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>As shown in Figure 1I, detection with an acetylated-lysine (ac-Lys) antibody confirms that both 4R and mutant tau are acetylated, while the E1 antibody confirms that total tau levels are equal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>However, our ac-KIGS antibody detected acetylated wild-type (WT) 4R tau, but not acetylated mutant tau, confirming its specificity for the K259 and K353 sites (Fig. 1I). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Next, to determine the extent to which HDAC6 regulates the acetylation of tau on the KIGS motifs, we performed the in vitro acetylation reaction with 4R tau, followed by the addition of cell lysates to the reaction where noted (Fig. 1J). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>A more dramatic loss of acetylation was observed following the addition of lysates from cells overexpressing HDAC6, though addition of lysates expressing only endogenous HDAC6 still promoted deacetylation of KIGS motifs, albeit to a lesser extent (Fig. 1J). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Adding either ACY-738, tubacin, tubastatin A, M344 or BML281 (specific HDAC6 inhibitors), or TSA (trichostatin A; pan-HDAC inhibitor), to the sample blocked the deacetylation of tau upon addition of cell lysates (Fig. 1J; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddt402/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S4</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>These results, in combination with our finding that MS275 (Class 1 HDAC inhibitor) does not block the deacetylation of tau on the KIGS motifs, confirm that the effect was due to HDAC6 activity (Fig. 1J; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddt402/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S4</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Given that SIRT1 has recently been implicated as a tau deacetylase (22), we also tested EX527 (specific SIRT1 inhibitor), AGK2 (specific SIRT2 inhibitor) and nicotinamide (pan-SIRT inhibitor) in our assay, but were unable to block the deacetylation of KIGS motifs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddt402/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S4</ext-link>), indicating that SIRT1 is not the deacetylase for tau's KIGS motifs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>To further validate that HDAC6 regulates the acetylation of tau on KIGS motifs, we again performed an in vitro acetylation reaction with p300 (Fig. 1K, lanes 2–7), using h.i. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>p300 (Fig. 1K, lane 1) as a negative control. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>In agreement with our results above, p300 increased acetylation of tau on KIGS motifs, and decreased tau polymerization (Fig. 1K, lane 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>In contrast, addition of recombinant HDAC6 both decreased acetylation of tau's KIGS motifs, and increased tau assembly in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1K–M, lanes 5–7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, addition of the HDAC6-selective inhibitor ACY-738 (Fig. 1K–M, lane 4) prevented HDAC6-mediated deacetylation of tau on the KIGS motifs, and also blocked the increase in tau polymerization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>As an additional control, we verified that h.i. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>HDAC6 influences neither the acetylation nor assembly of tau (Fig. 1K–M, lane 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that HDAC6 directly modulates the acetylation of tau by specifically deacetylating KIGS motifs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>In addition, we demonstrate that tau acetylation on KIGS motifs inversely correlates with the ability of tau to polymerize. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>To further evaluate the impact of acetylation specifically on KXGS motifs, we introduced either lysine (K) to arginine (R) mutations to prevent acetylation but maintain the charge of the residue or lysine (K) to glutamine (Q) mutations to mimic acetylation on these sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>We thus generated K259/290/321/353 (4KR or 4KQ) mutant proteins, thereby removing all four KXGS motifs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Although acetylation decreased fibrillization of WT full-length tau, acetylation had no effect on filament assembly of the 4KR mutant (Fig. 2A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>These results show that the ability of acetylation to decrease tau assembly is dependent on acetylation of the KXGS motifs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>In agreement, mimicking acetylation on all four KXGS motifs completely blocked tau assembly (Fig. 2B; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddt402/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S5</ext-link>), providing additional evidence that the ability of acetylation to decrease tau polymerization is dependent upon acetylation of the KXGS motifs.

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>To assess whether the increase in tau polymerization following addition of HDAC6 is due to modulation of acetylation on KXGS motifs, we acetylated WT or 4KQ tau, and subsequently added HDAC6 to the reaction where noted (Fig. 2C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>As previously observed, the assembly of WT tau decreased following acetylation, while HDAC6 reversed the inhibitory effect of acetylation on polymerization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>However, the 4KQ tau variant, which is less prone to aggregation, was completely resistant to modulation by either p300-mediated acetylation or HDAC6-mediated deacetylation (Fig. 2C), demonstrating that HDAC6 increases tau polymerization by promoting the deacetylation of KXGS motifs. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Given that the KXGS motifs contain acetylation sites critical to inhibiting tau aggregation, as well as serine residues that are sites of phosphorylation, we hypothesized that acetylation may disrupt this motif and prevent subsequent phosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Notably, the phosphorylation of tau on KXGS motifs by the kinase Par-1/MARK2 is required for tau toxicity in Drosophila (21) and is observed at very early stages of NFT formation in AD brain (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>In addition, the synaptic toxicity of oligomeric Aβ is dependent on the phosphorylation of tau's KXGS motifs (23,24), providing additional support for a pathogenic role of this p-tau species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, tau species phosphorylated on KXGS motifs are unable to bind and stabilize microtubules (15), and are also not recognized by the HSP chaperone network (25,26), which may explain why this particular p-tau species is prone to accumulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these findings provide strong rationale for the development of a therapeutic strategy aimed at preventing the hyperphosphorylation of tau on the KXGS motifs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we sought to assess whether HDAC6, as a deacetylase of the KXGS motifs, would impact the phosphorylation of serine residues within this motif. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>In agreement with our recent report, in which we demonstrate that HDAC6 activity regulates tau half-life (7), we observed significant tau accumulation under conditions of heightened HDAC6 levels (Fig. 3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, overexpression of the kinase MARK2 increased phosphorylation on KIGS motifs (pS262/356, detected by the antibody 12E8), while co-expression of HDAC6 further enhanced MARK2-mediated phosphorylation at the 12E8 site (Fig. 3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>To determine whether this effect could be blocked by introducing mutations at K259 and K353, site-directed mutagenesis was utilized to generate a construct containing K to Q mutations, mimicking constitutive acetylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Of note, the K259/353Q mutation completely prevented phosphorylation at the 12E8 site upon MARK2 overexpression (Fig. 3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>We also performed an in vitro phosphorylation reaction of recombinant protein using the enzyme PKA to phosphorylate the KXGS motifs as previously described (27,28), given that the only commercially available recombinant MARK2 is inactive. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>The results presented in the current report demonstrate that modulation of the acetylation state of tau's KXGS motifs is the foundation of a dynamic relationship between HDAC6 and tau. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Specifically, we show that HDAC6 inhibition increases the acetylation of KXGS motifs (Fig. 1; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddt402/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S4</ext-link>), acetylation of KXGS motifs decreases tau polymerization (Figs. 1 and 2; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddt402/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Figs. S1–S3</ext-link>) and HDAC6 expression enhances phosphorylation of tau at S262/356 (12E8 epitope), an effect that is blocked by mutation of K259/353 to mimic constitutive acetylation (Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we demonstrate that the KXGS motifs are hypoacetylated and hyperphosphorylated in disease (Figs. 5, 6 and 7), and treatment with an HDAC6 inhibitor in vivo reverses this ratio to favor acetylation of KXGS motifs (Fig. 4; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddt402/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S7</ext-link>C–E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>As summarized in Figure 7, we anticipate that HDAC6 inhibition will restore acetylation on KXGS motifs, thereby blocking subsequent phosphorylation on this epitope. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>However, given that prior phosphorylation prevents acetylation on KXGS motifs (Fig. 3D), treatment with HDAC6 inhibitors would need to be initiated early in the disease course prior to significant 12E8 accumulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>As such, we envision the use of HDAC6 inhibitors in at-risk patients, identified before the onset of neurological symptoms through improved imaging techniques, as a means to interrupt the development and progression of p-tau accumulation.

<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Under normal conditions, acetylation of KIGS disrupts the motif and prevents recognition by the kinase MARK2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>This results in a high ac-KIGS:12E8 ratio, normal tau clearance and no filament formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>In disease, hyperactivity of HDAC6 leads to decreased acetylation of KXGS motifs, exposing this motif and increasing susceptibility to phosphorylation by MARK2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>This results in a low ac-KIGS:12E8 ratio, enhanced priming of tau for hyperphosphorylation by other kinases, and ultimately leading to tau filament assembly and aggregation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>HDAC inhibitors have shown great promise in treating a wide variety of diseases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>However, to date the safety profile of broad spectrum HDAC inhibitors have precluded their use in chronic, non-oncology indications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Based on published descriptions of HDAC6 knockout mice, loss of HDAC6 activity, in contrast to Class I HDACs, is well tolerated, and HDAC6 appears to be a target with limited liability for deleterious side effects (12,30,31). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Therefore, targeting HDAC6 with specific inhibitors could provide a safe means to chronically lower pathological tau levels and block the associated disease cascade. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Of importance, HDAC6 expression has been shown to be elevated in AD patients (10,11), and HDAC6 activity is increased in a transgenic mouse model of Aβ amyloidosis, as well as primary hippocampal neurons exposed to Aβ1−42, indicating that Aβ may initiate the pathogenic cascade by increasing HDAC6 activity (8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Genetic ablation of HDAC6 in a transgenic mouse model of AD (APPPS1 mice) was shown to alleviate cognitive deficits without impacting Aβ plaque burden (12); although tau levels were not evaluated, APPPPS1 mice develop p-tau neuritic structures (32), which may indicate that the protective effect of loss of HDAC6 is due to effects on tau. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>This notion is further supported by the finding that loss of endogenous tau alleviates cognitive deficits in APP transgenic mice without affecting Aβ levels (33), which may suggest that Aβ leads to cognitive dysfunction through a cascade that involves HDAC6 upstream of tau. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Based on the demonstration that phosphorylation of tau on KXGS motifs is required for synaptic toxicity of Aβ (23,24), therapeutic intervention with an HDAC6 inhibitor to prevent deacetylation and subsequent phosphorylation of tau's KXGS motifs should halt the pathogenic cascade initiated by Aβ prior to the development of synaptic and cognitive deficits. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>A similar therapeutic intervention may also aid patients suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, since HDAC6 expression is upregulated in neurons in response to injury (34), and may be involved in disease pathogenesis and generation of toxic tau species following head injury. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Given that we observe a decrease in p-tau in non-transgenic mice following HDAC6 inhibition (Fig. 4), we anticipate that treatment of mice with an HDAC6 inhibitor would prevent the development of tau pathology in a mouse model of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which similarly employ non-transgenic mice (4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the demonstration that HDAC6 expression is relatively high in the hippocampus and cortex in comparison to the cerebellum (12) may provide the basis for the increased susceptibility of these brain regions to develop tau pathology following the initial insult (i.e. Aβ or contact injury). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>As the rationale for targeting HDAC6 for the treatment of tauopathies is based on elevating tau acetylation on KXGS motifs, it should be mentioned that recent reports have suggested a pathogenic role for tau acetylation in disease (14,22). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>However, Min and colleagues utilized the synthetic peptides spanning amino acids 160–182 and 264–287 of the full-length (4R2N isoform) tau sequence to generate acetylated-tau antibodies; therefore, both antigens would fail to produce antibodies against acetylated-KXGS motifs (22). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, using these acetylated-tau antibodies (referred to as Ab708 and 9AB), SIRT1 was identified as the deacetylase for the acetylation sites contained within amino acids 160–182 and 264–287, while HDAC6 had no effect on the acetylation of these particular residues (22). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Given that our current results demonstrate that deacetylation of KXGS motifs is mediated by HDAC6 and not SIRT1 (Fig. 1; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddt402/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S4</ext-link>), this may indicate that the pattern of acetylation on tau is determined by more than one deacetylase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>As such, future studies will be required to map the specific acetylation sites regulated by different deacetylases, in order to determine the ultimate consequence(s) of modulators of deacetylase (HDAC6 versus SIRT1) activity on tau function and biology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Regardless, given that lysine residues are unique in their ability to participate in electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (35), and are also known to play a critical role in tau assembly and toxicity (36–38), it is not surprising that modifying lysine residues by acetylation would have a dramatic impact on tau polymerization. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Given the escalating number of posttranslational modifications identified on tau (14,19,22,39,40), it will be particularly important in future studies to document how posttranslational modifications at specific residues differentially impact tau function and basic biological properties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>It is becoming increasingly clear that a complex interplay exists between these various posttranslational modifications, and a greater understanding of how they compete with each other at specific residues is needed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Herein, we demonstrate that acetylation and phosphorylation compete to modify tau's KXGS motifs, and based on the finding that hyperphosphorylation of KXGS motifs is observed early in AD (19), this may indicate that hypoacetylation of KXGS motifs is a key event in the onset of pathology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Although tau acetylation has also been proposed to be pathogenic due to the removal of lysine residues available for ubiquitination (22), insufficient ubiquitination is unlikely to be the cause of tau accumulation in disease given that tau species present in NFTs are already polyubiquitinated (40). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>In fact, given that ubiquitination would also remove lysine residues available for acetylation, the finding that pathological tau species have been reported to be both ubiquitinated and hyperphosphorylated on KXGS motifs (19,40) would appear to provide additional evidence that decreased acetylation on these critical sites is involved in disease pathogenesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Another important implication of the present findings is that while MARK2 phosphorylates KXGS motifs present in each microtubule-binding repeat of tau, KXGS motifs are also present in other microtubule-binding proteins, such as MAP2 and MAP4, and are also substrates of MARK2 (17,41,42). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Acetylation and phosphorylation may therefore also compete to modulate the function of all microtubule-binding proteins that contain KXGS motifs, and, by extension, the balance between kinase/phosphatase and acetyltransferase/deacetylase activity may ultimately regulate microtubule dynamics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Given that tubulin acetylation and acetylation of tau on KXGS motifs are both controlled by HDAC6, this would allow for tight regulation of microtubule dynamics and axonal transport. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>While increased tubulin acetylation promotes microtubule stability (43), increased tau acetylation may allow tau to dissociate from stabilized microtubules, providing molecular motors (such as dynein and kinesin) greater access to microtubules and facilitating axonal transport. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Conversely, under conditions of HDAC6 overexpression, tubulin acetylation decreases and microtubules become destabilized; however, the loss of tau acetylation under these same conditions may promote tau–microtubule interactions, leading to increased microtubule stability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Given that phosphorylation within KXGS motifs, which prevents acetylation, has also been reported to release tau from microtubules (15), this event would be expected to uncouple the coordinated regulation of tubulin and tau acetylation, which may further contribute to the pathogenicity of this particular p-tau species. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we identify and validate a novel, therapeutic mechanism designed to block the formation of abnormal p-tau species that mediate neuronal dysfunction and death in disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Specifically we demonstrate that HDAC6 drives the deacetylation of KXGS motifs, leaving tau vulnerable to pathogenic mechanisms that promote hyperphosphorylation and polymerization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, selective HDAC6 inhibition shifts the ratio between acetylation and phosphorylation on tau's KXGS motifs to favor acetylation, preventing tau accumulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>As such, the use of HDAC6 inhibitors to alleviate tau burden through the enhanced acetylation on KXGS motifs represents a very promising therapeutic strategy that should be investigated as a potential treatment for AD, as well as other tauopathies, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy. </plain></SENT>
