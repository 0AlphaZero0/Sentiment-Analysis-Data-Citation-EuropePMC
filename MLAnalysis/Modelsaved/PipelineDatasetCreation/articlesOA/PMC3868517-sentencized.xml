</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The existence of complex immune systems implies that interactions with pathogens represent major selective forces shaping the evolution of animal and plant species [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Vertebrate immune systems not only protect the adult organism against infections but also increase reproductive success through parental transfer of innate and adaptive immune factors via the placenta, colostrum and milk or via the egg yolk [2]–[4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>This maternal transfer of immunity is critical for species survival as embryos and neonates are immunologically immature and unable to fight off infections at early life stages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Parental transfer of protection has also been found in invertebrates hosting mutualists and many vertically transmitted arthropod symbionts are able to protect offspring against specific infections [5], [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Despite the impressive advances recently made in characterizing invertebrate immune systems [7], [8], data on the nature of the symbiont-mediated or parentally transmitted protection across generations are scarce [9]–[11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>How the estimated 1.3 million of invertebrate species [12] protect their offspring against pathogens remains therefore an intriguing question. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The freshwater snail Biomphalaria glabrata is particularly well studied as it is the intermediate host of the human blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni, responsible for schistosomiasis affecting millions of people in developing countries [13]. Biomphalaria snails live in various resting water biotopes such as, ponds, marshes, irrigation channels or open sewer drains that are particularly rich in pathogenic organisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Egg masses are laid on solid substrates under water where they remain for approximately a week before hatching [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In a proteomic study on the content of B. glabrata egg masses, 16 defense-related polypeptides were partially identified, among which a lipopolysaccharide binding protein/bactericidal permeability increasing protein (LBP/BPI) representing a major protein band [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>LBP/BPIs are structurally related proteins belonging to the lipid transfer/binding protein (LT/LBP) family [16], which represent important components of the innate immune system against Gram-negative bacterial infections [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In mammals, LBPs and BPIs have been extensively studied due to their role in regulating transducing cellular signals from Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [18], [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>LBP functions as a carrier of LPS monomers onto CD14 and together with the TLR4-MD2 receptor complex, mediates the activation of monocytes and macrophages, which produce inflammatory mediators [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>BPI is an antibacterial protein specifically active against Gram-negative bacteria that acts by damaging bacterial membranes [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>BPI also enhances adaptive immune responses by promoting LPS uptake and presentation to dendritic cells [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Although these two proteins present similarities in sequence and activities, they exert different effects on interactions of the host with Gram-negative bacteria [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>BPI neutralizes the inflammatory properties of LPS decreasing its uptake by LBP whereas LBP is an acute phase protein with LPS-dependent cell stimulatory activity [24], [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>These antagonist functions efficiently regulate host response to bacterial invasion and allow the host immune system to return to its normal resting state. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The distinction between LBPs and BPIs has not been established in invertebrates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>LBP/BPI family members have been reported only in a few invertebrate phyla such as annelids [26] and molluscs [27], [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>To date, a single functional study of LBP/BPI has been performed, showing that the oyster Crassostrea gigas expresses a BPI-like protein endowed with the conserved LPS-binding and bacterial permeability increasing activity [27]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>As B. glabrata snails apparently heavily invest in the production of LBP/BPI in their eggs [15], we investigated whether this protein showed the expected anti-bacterial activity and whether it could provide protection against other pathogens. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The sequence of BgLBP/BPI1 displayed the typical features of LBP/BPI family members, including a N-terminal LBP/BPI domain (pfam PF01273, Interpro IPR017942) containing conserved lysines involved in the interaction with LPS, a central proline-rich domain, and a C-terminal LBP/BPI domain (Figure S1) [17], [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Expression studies showed that the major site of expression for BgLBP/BPI1 was the albumen gland (Figure 1, A and B). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>With the exception of helminths such as S. mansoni, information on natural pathogens of B. glabrata is scarce. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Oomycetes or water molds are a large group of eukaryotic microbes that can infect plants and animals and can cause devastating diseases in agriculture, aquaculture, and natural (aquatic) ecosystems [37], [38]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Many invertebrate species lay fertilized eggs in nutritive egg masses that are highly suitable to the development of microorganisms [42], [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Although parental protection of eggs seems crucial to the survival of species, studies on the immune protection of invertebrate eggs are scarce. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>For example, an antibacterial activity was shown in eggs from 32 mollusk, 2 polychaete and 1 coral species, out of, respectively 34, 4 and 11 species tested [9], [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>An antibacterial protein, the aplysianin-A was identified from eggs of the gastropod Aplysia kurodai [44], and an N-acetyl-galactosamine-binding lectin that agglutinates bacteria was identified in eggs from the pulmonate snail Helix pomatia [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Together with peptides of aplysianin, peptides of LBP/BPI proteins were identified in a proteomic study on Biomphalaria glabrata egg masses [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Here we characterized a B. glabrata LBP/BPI family member that is produced in the albumen gland and abundantly loaded into the egg masses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the study on the BPI-like protein from Crassostrea gigas [27], we showed that the LPS and lipid A-binding activities against Gram-negative bacteria are conserved in BgLBP/BPI1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>BgLBP/BPI1s did not exert any effect against the panel of microorganism tested. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>However, bacterial permeability activity was observed against E. coli SBS363, a mutant strain containing short-chain LPS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>This is in agreement with previous studies reporting the resistance of Gram-negative bacteria harboring long lipopolysaccharide chain to the activity of hBPI [34], [46]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>In addition to this expected anti-bacterial activity, we discovered a yet unsuspected anti-oomycete activity and demonstrated that BgLBP/BPI1 is a major fitness-related protein affecting both egg production under control conditions and offspring survival in the presence of pathogens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>It is possible that the positive effect of BgLBP/BPI1 on the number of eggs produced is related to the glycoprotein nature of the molecule rather than to its antimicrobial activities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the glycoprotein HdAGP, identified from the snail Helisoma duryi albumen gland, was reported as the major nutritive glycoprotein secreted in the perivitelline fluid, and is also sharing sequence similarities with LBP/BPIs [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>The content in BgLBP/BPI1 may therefore affect egg production as a major nutritive egg mass compound, independently of its antimicrobial action. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>However, once the egg masses are laid, we demonstrated that the biocidal activity of BgLBP/BPI1 affects offspring survival in the presence of oomycete pathogens. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>LBP and BPIs are pleiotropic molecules, well characterized for their interactions with LPS from Gram-negative bacteria, but also reported to interact with other organisms such as Gram-positive bacteria and fungi [18], [47], [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>A wide range of lipidic ligands have been reported for human LBP and BPI [18], [47], [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Our results further evidence the diversity of binding capabilities of LBP/BPIs as both BgLBP/BPI1 and hBPI can interact with an oomycete lipidic ligand that remains to be identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Oomycetes do share physical characteristics with true fungi, including polarized hyphal extensions but they have a distinct evolutionary history and belong to the kingdom Stramenopila, which also includes brown algae and diatoms [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>In contrast to fungi, they produce bi-flagellated swimming spores (zoospores) and the cell-wall of their cysts is composed of cellulose, β-glucans and hardly any chitin [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Oomycetes include some of the most devastating animal and plant pathogens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>A few species cause Saprolegniosis in the aquaculture industry [38]. Saprolegnia species are endemic to freshwater habitat worldwide and are partly responsible for declining natural populations of salmonids and amphibians [50], [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the potato and tomato late-blight pathogen, Phytophthora infestans triggered the Irish Famine in the mid-1840s [37], [50], [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>The potent oomycete killing activity of both BgLBP/BPI1 and hBPI was observed with three species belonging to two major oomycete orders, the Perenosporales and Saprolegniales [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Our observations demonstrate a conserved and broad-spectrum oomycete killing activity of BgLBP/BPI1, which may be of interest for both the agricultural and aquacultural sectors [53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the specificity of this biocidal activity for the zoospore stage suggests that the ligand may be expressed specifically at this developmental stage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>To date, despite the economic impact of oomycetes, there is no biochemical information on the membrane compounds of zoospores as studies have focused on identifying surface components of the cell wall of cysts [54], [55]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>The precise binding and killing activity of the zoospores is unknown, but it is clear that BgLBP/BPI1 represents a major fitness-related protein transferred from parents to their clutches protecting snail eggs from widespread and lethal oomycete infections. </plain></SENT>
