The common key feature of DM pathogenesis is nuclear accumulation of mutant RNA which causes aberrant alternative splicing of specific pre-mRNAs by altering the functions of two RNA binding proteins, MBNL1 and CUGBP1. However, DM1 and DM2 show disease-specific features that make them clearly separate diseases suggesting that other cellular and molecular pathways may be involved. In this study we have analysed the histopathological, and biomolecular features of skeletal muscle biopsies from DM1 and DM2 patients in relation to presenting phenotypes to better define the molecular pathogenesis. Particularly, the expression of CUGBP1 protein has been examined to clarify if this factor may act as modifier of disease-specific manifestations in DM. The results indicate that the splicing and muscle pathological alterations observed are related to the clinical phenotype both in DM1 and in DM2 and that CUGBP1 seems to play a role in classic DM1 but not in DM2. In conclusion, our results indicate that multisystemic disease spectrum of DM pathologies may not be explained only by spliceopathy thus confirming that the molecular pathomechanism of DM is more complex than that actually suggested.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by FMM-Fondazione Malattie Miotoniche, AFM-Association Francaise contre les Myopathies and Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI).

Two DM loci are associated with two types of the disease. DM type 1 (DM1) is caused by the expansion of an unstable CTG trinucleotide repeat in the 3&#8242; untranslated region of the DM protein kinase (<italic>DMPK</italic>) gene <xref rid="pone.0083777-Brook1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083777-Mahadevan1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The DM type 2 (DM2) mutation consists in the expansion of an unstable CCTG tetranucleotide within the first intron of the CCHC-type zinc finger, nucleic acid-binding protein (<italic>CNBP</italic>) gene (previously named <italic>Zinc Finger Protein 9, ZNF9</italic> gene) <xref rid="pone.0083777-Liquori1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Both DM1 and DM2 are progressive multisystemic disorders characterized by muscle weakness, myotonia, cataracts, cardiac conduction defects, cerebral involvement and endocrinological disturbances such as increased insulin resistance and male hypogonadism. Experimental evidence supports an RNA gain-of-function mechanism of expanded transcripts in both DM1 and DM2 in which repeat containing transcripts from the expanded allele accumulate in nuclei as foci and alter the functions of RNA binding proteins involved in regulating alternative splicing and mRNA translation <xref rid="pone.0083777-Ranum1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083777-KuyumcuMartinez1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The alteration of pre-mRNA processing strengthens the hypothesis of a spliceopathy which leads to inappropriate expression of embryonic splicing isoforms in adult tissues thus explaining, at least in part, the multisystemic aspect of the disease <xref rid="pone.0083777-Osborne1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Expanded CUG/CCUG repeats mediate their effects on alternative splicing regulation through at least two RNA binding proteins: muscleblind like 1 (MBNL1) and CUGBP/Elav-like family member 1 (CELF1/CUGBP1) <xref rid="pone.0083777-Meola1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. MBNL1 preferentially recognizes CUG or CCUG repeats when they are pathologically expanded <xref rid="pone.0083777-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083777-Kino1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and is sequestered by ribonuclear foci in DM1 and DM2 cells <xref rid="pone.0083777-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083777-Mankodi1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083777-Fardaei1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> resulting in a loss of MBNL1 activity. In contrast, CUGBP1 does not colocalize with ribonuclear foci in DM1 cells <xref rid="pone.0083777-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083777-Fardaei2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083777-Mankodi2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, however this protein may have a role in the pathogenesis of splicing abnormalities because it is overexpressed in DM1 myoblasts, skeletal muscle and heart tissues <xref rid="pone.0083777-Dansithong1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0083777-Timchenko1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>Although DM1 and DM2 have similar clinical and genetic characteristics, they also present a number of very dissimilar features. DM1 is characterized by the phenomenon of anticipation, by which the disease has an earlier onset and more severe course in subsequent generations. Thus the clinical spectrum of DM1 include four main categories, each presenting specific clinical features: the congenital form that presents the most severe phenotype characterized mainly by CNS involvement and mental retardation, the childhood-onset form with school mating and psychological problems, the adult-onset (&#8220;classical&#8221; DM1) where the core features are facial weakness with ptosis, myotonia and distal muscle weakness, and the late-onset or oligosymptomatic patients where only limited features are found on clinical and paraclinical assessment. The DM1 mutation length predicts the clinical outcome to some extent: oligosymptomatic 50&#8211;100 repeats, classical DM1 100&#8211;1.000 repeats; congenital &gt;1.000 repeats <xref rid="pone.0083777-Ashizawa1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083777-Schoser1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. There is a relative correlation between the length of CTG repeat expansions and age of onset for DM1 patients with CTG &lt;400, but correlation between repeat length and disease severity is poor for long repeats <xref rid="pone.0083777-Harper1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083777-Schara1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083777-MachucaTzili1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In DM2 there are no distinct clinical subgroups although initially, different phenotypes of DM2 with proximal muscle weakness were described: DM2/Proximal Myotonic Myopathy (PROMM) and Proximal Myotonic Dystrophy (PDM) <xref rid="pone.0083777-Thornton1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0083777-Rotondo1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. PDM patients show many features similar to those found in PROMM, including proximal muscle weakness, cataracts, and electrophysiologically detectable myotonia. Unlike PROMM patients, however, they do not report myalgias, symptomatic myotonia, or muscle stiffness. Instead they present traits not present in PROMM, such as pronounced dystrophic-atrophic changes in the proximal muscles and late-onset progressive deafness <xref rid="pone.0083777-Udd1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The most important discrepancy between DM1 and DM2 is absence of a congenital form in DM2 <xref rid="pone.0083777-Day1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083777-Udd2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In DM2 the smallest reported mutation vary between 55&#8211;75 CCTG <xref rid="pone.0083777-Liquori1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083777-Bachinsky1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and the largest expansions have been measured to be up about 11.000 repeats <xref rid="pone.0083777-Liquori1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, however the size of CCTG repeat expansion in leukocyte DNA in DM2 seems to relate in large part to the age of the patient and not necessarily to the severity of symptoms or manifestations. Despite the CCUG expansions are longer than DM1 CUG expansions, DM2 shows a less severe phenotype. Clinical myotonia is usually milder in DM2 and histopathological features in DM1 and DM2 are also different. In DM2 a subpopulation of extremely atrophic type 2 fibers, including the nuclear clump fibers, are present <xref rid="pone.0083777-Harper1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083777-Vihola1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083777-Schoser2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>Recent studies have indicated that cardinal features of DM1 can be reproduced in the absence of nuclear inclusions and that RNA foci formation and splicing defects are separable <xref rid="pone.0083777-Ho1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083777-Mahadevan2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Moreover, DM1-associated splicing defects have been observed in mouse models of other muscular dystrophies indicating that spliceopathy is secondary to muscle damage <xref rid="pone.0083777-Orengo1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. However to date, literature has been focused on reinforcing the prevailing common model of DM pathogenesis based on the presence of mutant RNA foci in cell nuclei and spliceopathy. On the other hand, the existence of disease-specific features that make DM1 and DM2 clearly separate diseases and the existence of DM1 and DM2 distinct subtypes suggest that other cellular and molecular pathways are involved besides the shared pathogenetic model hypothesized. Moreover, the RNA gain of function toxicity has been better characterized in DM1 than in DM2 probably due to a greater availability of DM1 samples and mouse models. Importantly, the role of CUGBP1 in DM2 is particularly intriguing with contradictory results being reported. Indeed it appears that in DM1 a combined effect of decreased MBNL1 and increased CUGBP1 activity lead to misregulated alternative splicing and other changes of the muscle transcriptome <xref rid="pone.0083777-Ranum1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083777-Salisbury1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Instead in DM2, splicing abnormalities are also associated with the sequestration of MBNL1 protein by expanded transcripts <xref rid="pone.0083777-Ranum1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083777-Fardaei1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, however evidence that CUGBP1 upregulation also occurs in DM2 is conflicting <xref rid="pone.0083777-Salisbury1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0083777-Pelletier1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Timchenko and colleagues reported an increase of CUGBP1 in DM2 cultured myoblasts and muscle biopsies analyzing cytoplasmic extracts <xref rid="pone.0083777-Salisbury1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Moreover they reported that expression of pure RNA CCUG repeats in normal human myoblasts, in C2C12 cells and in a DM2 mouse model also increased levels of CUGBP1 <xref rid="pone.0083777-Salisbury1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. On the contrary, in two different reports, the analysis of total cellular extract from DM2 cultured myoblasts and from muscle biopsies of DM2 patients did not show differences in CUGBP1 levels <xref rid="pone.0083777-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083777-Pelletier1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Nevertheless, it should be noted that in these works no mention is made of either the number or the clinical features and muscle histopathology of the patients used. In DM2 patients the role of ZNF9/CNBP expression is still controversial and requires additional investigation since some DM2 patients show reduced protein levels but others do not <xref rid="pone.0083777-Pelletier1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083777-Botta1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0083777-Raheem1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.

This is the first study where the expression of CUGBP1 protein has been examined in a large cohort of DM2 patients.

An increase of CUGBP1 protein level is present in DM muscles as compared to controls even if not statistically significant due to the high interindividual variability observed in all groups. However, the increase of protein expression appears to be higher in DM1 than in DM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083777-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). When considering the 3 DM1 different phenotypes separately, the increase is evident only in DM1-E2 while in DM1-CDM and DM1-E1 muscles the protein levels appear to be equal to those observed in control muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083777-g003">Figs. 3C</xref>). A clear correlation between the AFs and the CUGBP1 expression levels has been observed in DM1 muscles (p&lt;0.01, data not shown). A slight increase in CUGBP1 protein expression is observable in DM2 muscles compared to controls and this increase is present in DM2-PDM and DM2-PROMM phenotypes but not in DM2-PS.

Nevertheless, it has been reported that the increase of CUGBP1 steady state protein level in DM1 cultured cells or animal models is related to protein hyperphosphorylation <xref rid="pone.0083777-KuyumcuMartinez2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Several kinases phosphorylate CUGBP1 at different residues and multiple functions of the protein are regulated by phosphorylation at distinct sites. While the specific sites of phosphorylation by PKC have not yet been identified, it has been demonstrated that Akt phosphorylates CUGBP1 at serine-28 (S28) and cyclin D3/cdk4 at serine 302 (S-302) <xref rid="pone.0083777-Huichalaf1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083777-KuyumcuMartinez2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083777-Salisbury2" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Since it has been reported that activation of Akt pathway increases CUGBP1 phosphorylation at S-28 in DM1 myoblasts and skeletal muscle, we tested if the increase of CUGBP1 expression observed in our DM cohort is related to an increase of CUGBP1 phosphorylation at S-28. Phosphorylation at S-28 controls nucleus-cytoplasm distribution of CUGBP1, thus it appears that an increase of the expression of CUGBP1-p-S28 isoform may affects CUGBP1 homeostasis since CUGBP1 regulates splicing in the nucleus and stability and translation of mRNA in the cytoplasm, Among all the DM muscles analysed, an increase of CUGBP1-p-S28 was observed only in DM1-E2 which also showed the higher level of CUGBP1 expression. In all other groups, CUGBP1-p-S28 levels are similar to those observed in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083777-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). We additionally analysed DM muscle samples through 2D-GE in order to evaluate the CUGBP1 phosphorylation pattern and thus investigate in human biopsies the reported striking protein shift toward a more acidic position previously described in cell system. We analysed CUGBP1 phosphorylation pattern in 12 DM muscle samples confirming an overexpression of CUGBP1 protein only in DM1-E2 respect to control and DM2 biopsies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083777-g003">Fig 3D</xref>). In particular, CUGBP1 showed a typical 3 spots pattern in the majority of the sample tested, whereas an additional more acid spot appears only in DM1-E2 sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083777-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). The appearance of this left spot confirms an increase of the expression of CUGBP1-p form in DM1-E2 patients. Moreover, this additional spot suggests the presence of a more phosphorylated CUGBP1 isoform in DM1-E2, however increased abundance of this isoform should be justified by the overexpression of CUGBP1 in DM1-E2. In order to understand whether CUGBP1 phosphorylation pattern is also altered in DM2 muscles we have compared similar signals of 2D patterns among controls, DM1-E2 and DM2-PROMM to evaluate abundance of different phosphorylation isoforms. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083777-g003">Figure 3E</xref>, the CUGBP1 phosphorylation pattern does not show significant alteration in protein spot relative abundance and it does not highlight a hyperphosphorylation of the protein suggesting a similar phosphorylation pattern among the DM phenotype investigated.</p><fig id="pone-0083777-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0083777.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>CUGBP1 expression in biceps brachii muscle samples from healthy, DM1 and DM2 patients.</title><p>

It is important to underline that DM1 and DM2 phenotypes present a wide clinical spectrum that includes different clinical subphenotypes indicating that molecular pathomechanism of DM is more complex than that actually suggested. The results of our study carried out on skeletal muscle from different DM1 and DM2 subphenotypes seem indicate that the splicing and muscle pathological alterations observed are related to the clinical phenotype. Muscle histopathology of most of DM1 and DM2 patients examined in this work showed the characteristic myopathic features of these diseases. Moreover, in DM2 muscles the mainly affected fiber type is type 2 fibers as previously reported by other authors <xref rid="pone.0083777-Vihola1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083777-Bassez1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083777-Pisani1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. However this is true for DM1 and DM2 patient groups showing the more severe multisystemic phenotypes but not for the groups of paucisymptomatic patients, i.e. DM1-E1 and DM2-PS, who present none or minimal muscle histopathological alterations. Moreover as expected, alteration of alternative splicing of <italic>IR</italic>, <italic>CLCN1</italic>, <italic>MBNL1, SERCA1</italic> and <italic>CAPZB</italic> genes is evident in both DM1 and DM2 muscle biopsies despite the clinical phenotype. However it appears that DM1-E1 and DM2-PS patients, who show the less severe clinical and muscle histopathological phenotype, also present a milder spliceopathy profile than those observed in the other DM patients analyzed. It should be noted that the degrees of <italic>CLCN1</italic> splicing misregulation in DM2-PDM is similar to that observed in DM2-PROMM despite myotonia in DM2-PDM is not evident at clinical level. Also, the <italic>CLCN1</italic> mRNA expression levels appear to be similar in DM2-PDM and DM2-PROMM. However it is possible that symptomatic myotonia is not detectable in DM2-PDM patients due to the high degree of atrophy factor observed in skeletal muscle. It is well known that in DM the clinical myotonia is not present at elevated degree of dystrophy or atrophy. Since an elevated concentration of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> has been suggested to be a possible cause of muscle degeneration <xref rid="pone.0083777-Jacobs1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, we have analysed if there is a correlation between histopathological alterations observed in DM muscles and the expression of pathological isoform of <italic>SERCA1</italic> which is one of the main regulators of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in skeletal muscle cells. Both in DM1 and DM2 we have found a positive correlation between the muscle alterations and the <italic>SERCA1</italic> splicing alteration thus strengthen the hypothesis that aberrant splicing of this transcript might contribute to severe histopathological alterations in DM patients.</p><p>To better define the molecular pathways which may be involved in disease-specific manifestations, we have analysed the role of CUGBP1 particularly intriguing in DM2 since contradictory results have been reported <xref rid="pone.0083777-Salisbury1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0083777-Pelletier1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. While it is clear that MBNL1 is depleted from nucleoplasm through recruitment into ribonuclear inclusions both in DM1 and DM2 even when clinical symptoms and muscle alterations are very mild <xref rid="pone.0083777-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083777-Cardani2" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0083777-Gates1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, CUGBP1 overexpression has been clearly demonstrated in DM1 but not in DM2 muscle biopsies. Our western blotting analysis of CUGBP1 protein expression confirms that CUGBP1 is overexpressed in DM1 muscle biopsies however the increase is evident only in DM1-E2 while CUGBP1 protein levels in DM-E1 and DM1&#8211;CDM appear to be similar to those observed in healthy controls. Moreover CUGBP1 overexpression in DM1-E2 biopsies is accompanied by a parallel increase of the amount of phosphorylated isoform. These data correlate with the splicing analysis of the <italic>CAPZB</italic> gene which is regulated specifically by the CUGBP1 protein.</p><p>Except for E1-CDM, our data are in line with those reported by Timchenko et al. <xref rid="pone.0083777-Timchenko2" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref> on DM1 muscle biopsies. In this work, CUGBP1 appear to be overexpressed in CDM and E2 patients but not in E1 patients. However, only one CDM was examined and no mention was made about the age of the patient.</p><p>It has been suggested that in DM1 CUGBP1 may be responsible for muscle wasting since the transgenic mice with skeletal muscle-specific expression of CUGBP1 reproduces the dystrophic muscle histology characteristic of DM1 <xref rid="pone.0083777-Ward1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref> while MBNL1 knockout mice do not exhibit severe muscle wasting suggesting that MBNL1 depletion alone is not able to reproduce this disease feature <xref rid="pone.0083777-Kanadia1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. In our work we have found a clear correlation between CUGBP1 expression and the atrophy factors found in DM1 muscles. However when considering the different DM1 clinical phenotypes, DM1-E2 and DM1-CDM show the higher values of atrophy factor and the most severe muscle histopathological alterations nevertheless CUGBP1 is overexpressed only in DM1-E2 muscles. It should be noted that the extreme muscle weakness observed in the congenital form of DM1 is not caused by degenerative changes but by developmental defects. Analysis of muscles from CDM patients has shown that muscle fibers are immature in foetuses and that the skeletal muscle maturation is impaired in children <xref rid="pone.0083777-FarkasBargeton1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083777-Sarnat1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. However, the analysis of two successive muscle biopsies of CDM patients showed that in time the muscle is able to gain a certain degree of maturity but never becomes normal since it retains discrepancies in fiber size and the degenerative muscle process begins starting from the second decade when the morphological alterations become identical to those described in late onset myotonic dystrophy <xref rid="pone.0083777-Tanabe1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. Since we have analysed adult-young CDM patients where muscle histopathological alterations might be due more to the developmental defects than to the degenerative process, it is possible that CUGBP1 expression in our DM1-CDM muscles appears to be similar to DM1-E1 more than to DM1-E2.</p><p>Contrary to DM1, in DM2 muscle biopsies examined in this work a slight increase of the CUGBP1 protein levels is observed in DM2-PDM and DM2-PROMM but not in DM2-PS However this increase is not related to an increase of protein phosphorylation. In addition our data on DM2 muscle seem suggest that perturbation of CUGBP1 amount are not required to produce histopathological or splicing regulation defects in DM2. We have observed that the greater expansion in DM2 leads to ribonuclear foci greater than in DM1 which can sequester larger amount of MBNL1. Therefore, the depletion of MBNL1 from nucleoplasm appears to be more extensive in DM2 than in DM1 despite DM1 shows a greater severity of the muscle degeneration (unpublished data). Thus, since sequestration of MBNL1 evidently has a central role in splicing misregulation in both types of DM, it appears likely that in DM1 CUGBP1 overexpression might be an additional pathogenic mechanism not shared by DM2.</p><p>It is relevant to highlight that we do not find differences in phosphorylation pattern between the DM phenotypes suggesting that CUGBP1 does not result hyperphosphorylated in DM compared to control muscles. The discrepancy observed between our data on CUGBP1 expression/phosphorylation in DM muscles and those reported by other Authors may be accounted for the model used: measurements made in cultured cells or in animal models which have been used to induce DM pathomechanism may be different from results obtained in human muscle <italic>in vivo.</italic> Moreover differences may exist between different muscle types used.</p><p>It has been suggested that also the reduction of ZNF9/CNBP expression in DM2 patients may explain some of the phenotypic disparities between both types of DM. It has been shown that reduction of ZNF9/CNBP levels is sufficient to produce multiorgan symptoms resembling those of DM as observed in heterozygous <italic>Znf9</italic>
<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> knockout mice <xref rid="pone.0083777-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. We have determined that ZNF9/CNBP protein and mRNA levels in muscle biopsies of biceps brachii from DM2 patients are significantly reduced compared with non-DM2 individuals, including patients with DM1. Our findings are consistent with recent reports of reduced ZNF9/CNBP expression in DM2 <xref rid="pone.0083777-Pelletier1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083777-Huichalaf1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083777-Raheem1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> and these data indicate that ZNF9/CNBP expression might play a role in phenotypic differences between DM1 and DM2. However ZNF9/CNBP protein appears to be equally expressed in the three DM2 phenotypic groups examined in our work, thus ZNF9/CNBP expression levels do not explain the extreme variability of clinical phenotype evident among DM2 patients. Indeed the expression of ZNF9/CNBP protein in DM2-PS is similar to those observed in DM2-PROMM and DM2-PDM despite paucisymptomatic patients show minor muscle histopathological alterations and the frequency of abnormal isoforms of the genes analysed is lower than in symptomatic patients.</p><p>This is the first study on a large number of muscle biopsies from DM1 and DM2 patients analysed at histopathological and biomolecular level. Our results indicate that CUGBP1 seems to play a role in classic DM1 more evidently than in DM2 however no definitive conclusions can be drawn due to the high interindividual variability observed in the different parameters analysed in this study. Nevertheless, it appears that the multisystemic disease spectrum and the phenotypic variability of DM pathologies may not be explained only by spliceopathy thus confirming that the molecular pathomechanism of DM is more complex than that actually appreciate.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to thank Prof. Clemente C. and Dr. Procacci E. of Anatomia Patologica e Citopatologia, IRCCS Policlinico San Donato, Milan for their support at slide scanner.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0083777-Harper1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book">Harper PS (2001) Myotonic Dystrophy.
