<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>To better understand the molecular basis of the selective anti-cancer effect of ACR, we performed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based and capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS)-based metabolome analyses in JHH7 and Hc cells after treatment with ACR. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>NMR-based metabolomics revealed a distinct metabolomic profile of JHH7 cells at 18 h after ACR treatment but not at 4 h after ACR treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CE-TOFMS analysis identified 88 principal metabolites in JHH7 and Hc cells after 24 h of treatment with ethanol (EtOH) or ACR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The abundance of 71 of these metabolites was significantly different between EtOH-treated control JHH7 and Hc cells, and 49 of these metabolites were significantly down-regulated in the ACR-treated JHH7 cells compared to the EtOH-treated JHH7 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Of particular interest, the increase in adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP), the main cellular energy source, that was observed in the EtOH-treated control JHH7 cells was almost completely suppressed in the ACR-treated JHH7 cells; treatment with ACR restored ATP to the basal levels observed in both EtOH-control and ACR-treated Hc cells (0.72-fold compared to the EtOH control-treated JHH7 cells). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Moreover, real-time PCR analyses revealed that ACR significantly increased the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases 4 (PDK4), a key regulator of ATP production, in JHH7 cells but not in Hc cells (3.06-fold and 1.20-fold compared to the EtOH control, respectively). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The results of the present study suggest that ACR may suppress the enhanced energy metabolism of JHH7 cells but not Hc cells; this occurs at least in part via the cancer-selective enhancement of PDK4 expression. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents approximately 85% of all primary liver cancers and is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, especially in Eastern Asia [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The prognosis of HCC remains very poor; this poor prognosis is due in part to its high rate of recurrence after initial treatment, which reaches approximately 70% within 5 years [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Acyclic retinoid (ACR), a synthetic retinoid with a vitamin A-like structure, prevents the recurrence and development of HCC in patients after the surgical removal of primary tumors [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>ACR is currently undergoing phase II/III clinical trials (JapicCTI-121828) in Japan and is expected to become the first chemopreventive agent. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Another important characteristic of ACR is that it selectively suppresses the growth of HCC cells (JHH7 and others) but not normal hepatic cells (Hc) [5], [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanism underlying this effect is not fully understood, previous basic and clinical studies by our group and others have suggested that both non-genomic and genomic signaling pathways may be responsible for the cancer-selectivity of ACR [5], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>A typical example is the prevention by ACR of the aberrant hyper-phosphorylation and inactivation of retinoid X receptor (RXR) α that occurs during carcinogenesis in HCC [12] and the subsequent induction of apoptosis in HCC cells by the restoration of the expression of RXRα downstream genes such as p21 [11], transglutaminase 2 (TG2) [5] and more. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>However, to the best of our knowledge, no information is available regarding the effect of ACR on the metabolism of HCC cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Recently, the approach of targeting cancer metabolism to develop and improve cancer therapeutics has received a great deal of attention [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>A distinguishing feature of cancer is that the metabolic pathways of cancer cells are adapted to support rapid and uncontrolled cell proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>One of the best-known alterations in cancer cell metabolism is a switch from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to cytoplasmic glycolysis; this switch is known as the Warburg effect [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>It is possible that targeting cellular metabolism may suppress cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In fact, several metabolism-targeting therapies have been already proven to be effective in the treatment of diverse human tumors [13], [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Although chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are believed to account for approximately 80% of HCC [16], a growing body of evidence indicates that metabolic syndrome is also a risk factor for the development of HCC [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Indeed, it is extremely difficult to find a single essential target for cancer therapeutics, due to the remarkable heterogeneity and adaptability of cancer cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>It is likely that further investigations into the effect of ACR on cancer cell metabolism will improve our understanding of the molecular pathways underlying the cancer-selective growth suppressive effect of ACR and benefit the development of more effective cancer drugs and therapies against HCC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>To achieve this, both nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based and capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS)-based metabolome analyses were performed in JHH7 and Hc cells after treatment with ACR. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>The war on cancer has continued for more than 40 years, but the gains have been limited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>One potential reason for this limited success that typical drug development in oncology has focused on targets that are essential for the survival of all dividing cells, leading to narrow therapeutic windows [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Recent advances in metabolite profiling methodologies have generated an alternative window for cancer therapy in targeting cancer metabolism [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>ACR, a very promising drug that is currently in clinical trials for HCC treatment, has been shown to markedly prevent the recurrence of HCC [3] and selectively inhibit HCC cell growth [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>We have previously exploited the potential target molecules of ACR that are associated with the promotion of tumor cell proliferation [5] or angiogenesis [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>In this study, we performed metabolome analyses in JHH7 and Hc cells treated with ACR using both NMR and CE-TOFMS technologies to further understand the molecular pathways that underlie the cancer-selective growth suppressive effect of ACR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>We found that ACR selectively suppressed the enhanced nucleotide synthesis and energy metabolism of HCC cells, suggesting that metabolic pathways may be important targets for ACR's anti-cancer activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>The further study of these pathways will benefit the development of more effective cancer drugs and therapies against HCC. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Generally, the metabolic patterns of JHH7 and Hc cells were almost completely opposite to each other (Figure 2), which is consistent with previous reports that cancer cells exhibit considerably different metabolic requirements than most normal differentiated cells and supports the hypothesis that cancer may be a type of metabolic disease [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Although the primary cause of cancer is assumed to be at the level of gene expression, metabolites can be considered to be the end products of the cellular regulatory processes that underlie malignant cell growth such as genome instability and mutability [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Metabolomic comparison of HCC and control liver tissues have been carried out in several animal and human studies aiming to define metabolomic biomarkers for the early detection of HCC [35], [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>In this study, the abundance of 71 metabolites was found to be significantly different between JHH7 and Hc cells; 49 of these metabolites were significantly down-regulated by ACR in JHH7 cells (Figure 2 and Table S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>It is not unexpected that an IPA analysis revealed that most of these metabolites are involved in the amino acids and nucleotide biosynthetic pathways, such as “tRNA Charging”, “Purine Nucleotides De Novo Biosynthesis II” and “Pyrimidine Ribonucleotides De Novo Biosynthesis” (Tables 2 and 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>It is well known that cancer cell metabolism must provide a large increase in lipid, protein, and nucleotide synthesis (biomass) to support their uncontrolled high rate of cell growth and proliferation [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that ACR may exert its anti-cancer effect by blocking the biosynthetic processes of cancer cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a bioinformatics-based anticancer drug screening program in Japan revealed that ACR shares similar anticancer activity pattern with the antipyrimidine drugs doxifluridine and cytarabine and an antipurine drug, 6-mercaptopurine, as assayed by growth inhibition against a panel of 39 human cancer cell lines (JFC39) [37], [38], [39]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>ATP is the main energy source for the majority of cellular functions, and impaired cellular energy metabolism is the defining characteristic of nearly all cancers regardless of cellular or tissue origin [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Of particular interest, ACR can selectively inhibit the production of ATP in JHH7 cells but not in Hc cells (Figure 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>It has been proven that chemical depletion of ATP can inhibit the growth of HCC cells [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>This may partially explain the cancer-selective growth suppression effect of ACR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>To further understand the molecular signaling mechanisms that underlie this effect, we examined the effect of ACR on the expression of energy production-related genes and observed that the expression of PDK4 was significantly enhanced by ACR in JHH7 cells but not in Hc cells (Figure 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>PDK4 is a key regulator of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle; PDK4 phosphorylates and inactivates the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex and thereby switches the energy source for the production of ATP from glucose to fatty acids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Although the cellular pyruvate level was not detected by CE-TOFMS and no effect of ACR was found on the phosphorylation of PDHA1 by western blot analysis (Figure 5C), the knockdown of PDK4 expression using RNA interference in JHH7 cells can rescue the decreased cellular ATP levels induced by ACR (Figure 6B), suggesting that PDK4 may be an important feature of ACR's anti-cancer activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we performed data mining using the GEO database and found that PDK4 expression is significantly down-regulated in liver tumors compared to adjacent non-tumor liver tissues (Figure 7A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>The role of PDK4 in cancer therapy is complex; the inhibition of PDK4 is sufficient to inhibit the proliferation of and induce apoptosis in lung cancer cells [41], but the overexpression of PDK4 is also able to decrease ATP levels and suppress de novo lipogenesis and proliferation in breast cancer cells [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>The specific role of PDK4 in HCC remains to be fully determined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that PDK4 up-regulation has a suppressive effect on HCC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this implication, the results of IPA analysis suggest that the cancer-selective, growth-suppressive effect of ACR in inhibiting the ATP production of HCC cells may be related to a putative PDK4-dependent molecular signaling mechanism involving RXR and PPARs, as has been reported in certain fatty acid signaling pathways [42] (Figure 7B). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Although the Warburg effect is a well-recognized hallmark of cancer metabolism, it remains controversial [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Warburg hypothesized that tumor cells convert most of their glucose to lactate due to mitochondrial defects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>However, subsequent studies showed that most tumor mitochondria are not defective in their ability to carry out oxidative phosphorylation [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>In fact, we propose that mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation may be important in supporting HCC cell proliferation based on the following observations: 1) the content of lactate, the major end product of glycolysis, is lower in JHH7 cells than in Hc cells (0.40-fold, Table S2) and 2) ACR up-regulates the expression of PDK4, which attenuates the flux of glycolytic carbon into mitochondrial oxidation and can reduce the production of ATP and inhibit the growth of JHH7 cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>In summary, our study is the first to investigate the effect of ACR on cancer cell metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>A comparison of the metabolic effects of ACR in JHH7 and Hc cells was performed, and a JHH7-selective inhibitory effect of ACR on the production of ATP was observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>The underlying molecular signaling mechanism may relate in part to the cancer-selective enhancement of PDK4 expression, suggesting that mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is important in the energy metabolism of HCC cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>However, it should be noted that although PDK4 knockdown can rescue the decreased cellular ATP levels induced by ACR, no effect was observed on the inhibitory effect of ACR on the proliferation of JHH7 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed to combine the cancer-selective metabolic pathways identified in this study and other signaling pathways to increase our knowledge of ACR's selective anti-cancer activity and to develop more effective cancer drugs and therapies to help us win the war against HCC. </plain></SENT>
