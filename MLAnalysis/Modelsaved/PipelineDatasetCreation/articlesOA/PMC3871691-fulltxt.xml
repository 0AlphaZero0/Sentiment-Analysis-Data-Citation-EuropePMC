<italic>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</italic> (Aa) is a Gram-negative bacterium that colonizes the oral cavity of one third or more of the population aged up to 18 years [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It has been highly implicated as the causative agent of aggressive periodontitis (AgP), a group of less frequent, often severe, rapidly progressive forms of periodontitis, with a more localized presentation of the disease (LAP) [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. LAP is also characterized by an early age of onset, tendency for familial involvement, and bone loss affecting specifically molar and incisor teeth, [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Importantly, recent papers have pointed out the importance <italic>Aa</italic>, a particularly highly leukotoxic clone (JP2), in the initiation of attachment loss in young individuals [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Our group has recently demonstrated a hyper-inflammatory trait in response to bacterial endotoxin in an LAP cohort of African-Americans, which results in the over-expression of pro-inflammatory cyto/chemokines [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We also observed an exacerbated local inflammatory response, along with high systemic levels of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Additionally, we have reported <italic>Aa</italic> to be highly associated with LAP in this cohort [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, we could not detect <italic>Aa</italic> in every patient with LAP in our cohort, which is also consistent to previously reported literature [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Little is known regarding the impact of <italic>Aa</italic>&#8217;s presence on LAP disease presentation (clinical parameters and bacterial colonization) or the accompanying inflammatory response (regulation and local presentation). </p><p>Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate our LAP cohort in relation to the presence of <italic>Aa</italic> and determine whether the detection of this species in LAP affected sites correlate with clinical presentation of disease, local cyto/chemokines, plasma LPS levels and the level of hyper-responsiveness of these individuals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study was conducted in full conformity with the principles set forth in The Belmont Report: Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research, as drafted by the US National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research (April 18, 1979) and codified in 45 CFR Part 46 and/or the ICH E6; 62 Federal Regulations 25691 (1997).

This study is part of a larger clinical trial (Clinical trial registration: <italic>#NCT01330719</italic> at www.clinicaltrials.gov). A comprehensive microbiological profile as well as local and LPS-induced inflammatory response from initial subjects enrolled in this study has been reported in our previous publications [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Both historical data and newly generated data were part of the present analysis. Specifically, all subjects enrolled in the clinical trial that had their baseline microbiological analysis completed were included in the present report[<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and new data on local and systemic inflammatory markers for some of these patients were run to fulfill the present investigation (see flowchart, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085066-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Eight of the participants had siblings within the cohort, who happen to be part of the random pool of participants on which microbiological analysis had been completed. All subjects and parents were informed about the study protocol and signed an informed consent previously approved by the University of Florida Institutional Review Board. Inclusion criteria: subjects aged 5-21 years old, African-American, diagnosed with localized aggressive periodontitis, defined by presence of at least 2 sites, on first molar and/or incisor, with pocket depth &gt;4mm with bleeding on probing, presence of at least 2mm clinical attachment loss and radiographic bone loss [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Exclusion criteria: subjects diagnosed with any systemic diseases or conditions that could influence the progression and/or clinical characteristics of periodontal disease (e.g., diabetes or blood disorders); taken antibiotics within the last 3 months or any medications that could influence the characteristics of the disease (e.g., phenytoin, cyclosporine); have received periodontal treatment within the previous 6 months; smokers; and pregnant/lactating women. </p><fig id="pone-0085066-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0085066.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Schematic flowchart of study design.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0085066.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2.3"><title>Clinical measurements</title><p>The following periodontal clinical parameters were taken by one calibrated examiner at the baseline visit (prior to treatment): Pocket Depth (PD), Bleeding on probing (BoP); Gingival margin position (GM), Clinical attachment level (CAL); Plaque Index (PI).

A collection strip (PerioPaper GCF collection strips, Oraflow Inc, Plainview, NY) was inserted in the sites 1-2 mm into the sulcus for ~10 sec, as described previously [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].

After purification, DNA concentration and quality was determined using the Nanodrop (ND-1000 Spectrophotometer, Nanodrop Technologies INC, Wilmington, DE, USA). Samples were analyzed at the Forsyth Institute using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarrays (HOMIM) as previously described [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Briefly, 16S rRNA genes were PCR amplified from DNA extracts using 16S rRNA universal forward and reverse primers and labeled via incorporation of Cy3-dCTP in a second nested PCR. HOMIM uses16S rRNA-based, reverse-capture oligonucleotide probes (typically 18 to 20 bases), which are printed on aldehyde-coated glass slides and probed with labeled PCR products described above which are hybridized in duplicate. The microarray slides are scanned using an Axon 4000B scanner and crude data is extracted using GenePix Pro software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Microbial profiles were generated from image files of scanned arrays using a HOMIM online analysis tool (http://bioinformatics.forsyth.org/homim/). Detection of a particular taxon was determined by presence of a fluorescent spot for that unique probe. A mean intensity for each taxon was calculated from hybridization spots of the same probe and signals were normalized by comparing individual signal intensities to the average of signals from universal probes and calculated as described previously [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Any original signal that was less than two times the background value was reset to 1 and was assigned to the signal level 0. Signals greater than 1 were categorized into scores from 1 to 5, corresponding to ranked signal levels. Presence of <italic>Aa</italic> was determined if a site showed value of 1 or above.

SigmaPlot version 11.0 software (Systat Software Inc, Chicago, IL) was used for statistical analysis, considering a 5% significance level.

In addition, GM-CSF was more highly induced by Pg LPS-stimulation in individuals with <italic>Aa-non-detected</italic> sites, compared to those with <italic>Aa-detected</italic> sites, although the difference did not reach significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085066-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0085066-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0085066.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Systemic LPS-induced cyto/chemokine values in both groups.</title><p>Values are reported as normalized log pg/mL.

This change in community structure can also have an effect on local immune responses and thus the course of periodontal disease progression. Among periodontal pathogens, <italic>Aa</italic> has received particular attention and has been regarded as a key factor in the etiology of LAP. This view was based primarily on classic association studies linking <italic>Aa</italic> to disease and correlating treatment outcomes to its levels after therapy [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, in a systematic review [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], it was shown that the presence or absence of <italic>Aa</italic> could not discriminate between subjects with aggressive periodontal disease from those with chronic periodontitis. </p><p>The present study focused on the presence of <italic>Aa</italic> as a determinant factor in some aspects of disease presentation. We observed a lack of association between <italic>Aa</italic> detection, as measured by HOMIM, and severity of clinical signs of the disease (i.e. pocket depth, clinical attachment levels at time of sampling). This is not unexpected, considering that the criteria for diagnosis of LAP used in this study are very strict for clinical signs of disease, although it is impossible to determine the disease state of the sampled sites, even before treatment is rendered. However, if we were to include healthy individuals or even healthy sites (i.e. PD&#8804;3mm and no bop), the presence of <italic>Aa</italic> could indeed be more correlated with the diseased clinical parameters [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It should be noted that the HOMIM assay has a sensitivity of about 0.1% and an overall limit of detection about 10<sup>4</sup> cells (Colombo, 2009). Consequently, it is possible that <italic>Aa</italic> at levels below the level of detection could still be present. Nevertheless, <italic>Aa-detected</italic> sites presented very high signal levels for (mean relative signal intensity was 3.81), which makes the two populations very distinct for <italic>Aa</italic> detection using HOMIM. Interestingly, at this detection level, the presence or absence of <italic>Aa</italic> was associated with a difference in the composition of the microbial community as a whole. </p><p>We also evaluated the correlation between the detection of <italic>Aa</italic> and local inflammatory mediators as a measure of active disease. Interestingly, a higher expression of IL-8 in GCF was detected in <italic>Aa-non-detected</italic> sites as compared to <italic>Aa-detected</italic> sites. IL-8 is involved in the recruitment of PMNs and is highly expressed in the junctional epithelium adjacent under the conditions of health whereby disease has been shown to modulate these levels both positively and negatively. Many organisms, including <italic>P.gingivalis</italic>, have virulence factors which affect IL8 stability within the GCF. Our data indicate that the non-detection of <italic>Aa</italic> results in a different microbial community than when it is detected at levels above 10<sup>4</sup>, thus it is possible that the absence/minimal presence of Aa, i.e. <italic>Aa</italic>-<italic>non-detected</italic> sites promotes an environment for an organism that possess these virulence factors. As demonstrated in our results, <italic>P.gingivalis</italic> may be frequently detected when <italic>Aa</italic> is not, where IL-8 levels were lower. Although <italic>P.gingivalis</italic> have been associated with periodontal inflammatory response, its potential to induce this response may shift according to the environment, specific virulent factors, and association with other species of the biofilm[<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For instance, specific structures on <italic>P.gingivalis</italic> LPS may up-regulate or down-regulate levels of pro-inflammatory markers, including IL-8[<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In addition, the presence of other bacterial species [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], as well as different peptides [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] may also reduce this organism&#8217;s pro-inflammatory abilities. On the other hand, it is possible that <italic>Aa</italic> has a direct effect on the suppression of IL8 from the junctional epithelium. However, the differences in IL8 expression in the GCF did not correlate with differences in clinical parameters. Both <italic>Aa-detected</italic> and <italic>Aa-non-detected</italic> cohorts had already advanced clinical signs of LAP, thus IL8 levels may be more indicative of active vs. inactive disease than severity of disease, which would also suggest that the presence and/or absence of <italic>Aa</italic> may also be a correlate of disease activity, although data presented here are insufficient to support this hypothesis. Longitudinal studies of the disease need to be conducted to asses this hypothesis.</p><p>Elevated local inflammation can sometimes result in the dissemination of bacteria and their products systemically. Interestingly, no differences in the levels of plasma LPS was observed between <italic>Aa-detected</italic> and <italic>Aa-non-detected</italic> cohorts. This was not unexpected considering that other than IL8, which does not directly contribute to epithelial ulceration, there were no significant differences in the levels of cyto/chemokines within the GCF of the <italic>Aa-detected</italic> and <italic>Aa-non-detected</italic> cohorts.</p><p>We have previously published that LAP individuals present with a hyper-inflammatory phenotype whereby they respond in a more robust manner to stimuli [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Here we demonstrate that overall whether an individual is colonized with <italic>Aa</italic> or not does not correlate with their level of LPS-induced responsive potential, with one exception. As a group, individuals with diseased sites that have <italic>Aa detected</italic>, respond more robustly to Ec LPS-stimulation as measured by IL1&#946; and TNF&#945;. <italic>E.coli</italic> LPS is mainly a TLR4 agonist, as is <italic>Aa</italic> LPS [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and this is why it was chosen for evaluation in the present study. Thus, one could hypothesize that in <italic>Aa</italic> carriers the potential for hyper-secretion of TNF&#945; and IL1&#946; could result in more robust tissue damage and disease progression. However, we did not observe elevated levels of TNF&#945; nor IL1&#946; in the GCF of <italic>Aa detected</italic> sites, nor was the snapshot of disease severity different in those individuals with <italic>Aa-detected</italic> or <italic>Aa-non-detected</italic> sites. The direct relationship between <italic>Aa</italic> presence, GCF markers and host inflammatory response to LPS cannot be resolved in this cross-sectional study but could be determined in future studies that test the likelihood that these cytokine elevations could be found prior to disease or during disease progression at the local site. </p><p>In summary, the present study demonstrates that, in this population, similar clinical parameters of disease were observed regardless of whether <italic>Aa</italic> was detected or remained undetected by HOMIM in diseased sites. This study is cross-sectional and thus, it only represents a snapshot of the disease state at one point in time. However, our findings indicate potential differences in the microbial community profile associated (<italic>G.elegans</italic> and <italic>P.loeschii</italic>) or not associated (<italic>P.gingivalis</italic> and <italic>P.micra</italic>) with this species as well as effects on the local inflammation (IL8 in GCF). Interestingly, individuals with detectable levels of <italic>Aa</italic> also present with a TLR4 (<italic>Ec</italic> LPS) induced TNF&#945; and IL1&#946; hyper-responsiveness. Further longitudinal studies are necessary to evaluate whether these differences could impact disease progression and treatment responses.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Drs.
