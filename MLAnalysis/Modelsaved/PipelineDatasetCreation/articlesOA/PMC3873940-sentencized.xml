<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Here, we report on the occurrence of malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) on Swiss farms, where “exotic” water buffaloes were kept together with “native” animals, i.e. cattle, sheep, and goats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the first farm with 56 water buffaloes, eight cases of MCF due to ovine herpesvirus-2 (OvHV-2) were noted, whereas additional ten water buffaloes were subclinically infected with either OvHV-2 or caprine herpesvirus-2 (CpHV-2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the second farm, 13 water buffaloes were infected with CpHV-2 and two of those succumbed to MCF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In neither farm, any of the two viruses were detected in cattle, but the Macaviruses were present at high prevalence among their original host species, sheep and goats, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>On the third farm, sheep were kept well separated from water buffaloes and OvHV-2 was not transmitted to the buffaloes, despite of high prevalence of the virus among the sheep. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Macavirus DNA was frequently detected in the nasal secretions of virus-positive animals and in one instance OvHV-2 was transmitted vertically to an unborn water buffalo calf. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Thus, water buffaloes seem to be more susceptible than cattle to infection with either Macavirus; however, MCF did not develop as frequently. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Therefore, water buffaloes seem to represent an interesting intermediate-type host for Macaviruses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Consequently, water buffaloes in their native, tropic environments may be vulnerable and endangered to viruses that originate from seemingly healthy, imported sheep and goats. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The water buffalo was introduced into Switzerland in 1996, as 5 farmers from a western-central region imported 14 pregnant water buffalo cows and one water buffalo bull from Romania. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>For many years, artificial insemination with semen imported from Italy was performed, in order to maintain a broad genetic basis among the water buffalo population [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, water buffaloes are held in 75 farms all over Switzerland (personal communication, Tierverkehrsdatenbank, 12-23-2011) and further breeding is possible without importing new animals. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The Mediterranean River Buffalo, antecessor of the Romanian and Italian buffalo breeds, originates from the Domestic Asian Water Buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) [2], [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Although water buffaloes seem to be susceptible to most diseases that affect cattle, showing some variety in sensitivity or resistance, they are generally known to be in good health and well adapted to the hot and humid climates of tropical countries with the corresponding pathogens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>However, reactions to some diseases may vary depending on the region, environment and genetic basis of the buffalo breed [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Foot-and-mouth disease, Rinderpest, Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis, Bluetongue, Bovine Viral Diarrhea, Buffalo pox, Rabies, Ephemeral Fever and Malignant Catarrhal fever are some of the viral infections described in water buffaloes in Asia and Europe [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) is an often-fatal lymphoproliferative disease of mainly ruminant species including domestic cattle, water buffalo, American bison, various species of cervids and other wild living ruminants, caused by closely related Gammaherpesvirinae of the genus Macavirus [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Two viruses are primarily responsible for the disease; the ovine herpesvirus-2 (OvHV-2) as seen worldwide in sheep-associated-MCF (SA-MCF), with sheep as the main reservoir host [7]–[9], and the alcelaphine herpesvirus-1 (AlHV-1), endemic in wildebeest, inducing wildebeest-associated MCF (WA-MCF) in Africa and zoological gardens [8]–[10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In recent years, further MCF agents have been recognized; the MCF-causing virus in white-tailed deer [11], [12], cattle [13] and red brocket deer [14] with unknown reservoir host, although a potential connection with goats has been suggested [14], [15]; the ibex MCF virus with outbreaks of MCF in bongo antelopes [16], [17]; the AlHV-2-like virus introducing MCF in Barbary red deer [18]; and the caprine herpesvirus-2 (CpHV-2) identified in healthy domestic goats [19]–[21], leading to clinical cases in different kinds of cervids [22]–[27] and probably in domestic cattle, banteng [13], [27] as well as in water buffaloes [28]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Clinical signs of MCF in water buffaloes are characterized by depression, anorexia, high fever, lymphadenopathy, conjunctivitis and corneal opacity, inflammation, ulceration and exudation of the upper digestive- and respiratory tract, diarrhea and neurological deficiencies leading to death [29]–[33]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In Switzerland, SA-MCF sporadically occurs in domestic cattle [34]; one case in a farmed sika deer has been mentioned [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>OvHV-2 has been detected in pigs [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In water buffaloes, only one case of probable CpHV-2-associated MCF-like disease has been described [28]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Over the last few years the popularity of housing water buffaloes for milk and meat production has risen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Up to now approximately 1202 water buffaloes are kept in Switzerland, in smaller herds and herds of up to more than 50 animals (personal communication, Tierverkehrsdatenbank, 12-23-2011), distributed over all geographical regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The economic loss in case of death is quite high. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Preceding our survey, a Swiss farm reported increased fatalities following MCF-like symptoms in water buffaloes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>For the current case report we therefore decided to investigate 2 Swiss water buffalo farms with history of disease and one farm with no known MCF-like case, by means of real-time PCR analysis, in order to detect OvHV-2 and/or CpHV-2 as probable triggers of disease and gain more insights concerning epidemiological issues. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Considering the ongoing global spread of “exotic” farm animals from their native to novel environments, it is imperative to keep in mind that they all carry their own sets of viruses, which may be well adapted to their original hosts, but may bear unknown risks for the animals, into whose ecological niches they are introduced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>In contrast, “exotic” farm animals may be especially sensitive for viruses circulating in foreign countries and various MCF-causing agents seem to be an interesting topic in this context. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>For the present communication, we started off with clinical cases of malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) in water buffaloes (considered “exotic”) from two Swiss farms and, consecutively, analyzed the genoprevalence of two different MCF agents, OvHV-2 and CpHV-2, in various susceptible ruminants on the same farms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>A third farm, from which no cases of MCF had been reported, served as comparison. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>The following insights were gained: </plain></SENT>
</text></p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p><text><SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Our report confirms earlier work mentioning that water buffaloes were more susceptible to OvHV-2 infection than cattle [8], [31], [33], [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>As expected, sheep and goats, the reservoir hosts of OvHV-2 and CpHV-2, respectively, were shown to be Macavirus-carriers in both, farm 1 and farm 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Yet, despite similar exposure, cases of MCF as well as subclinical genoprevalence of the MCF agents were noted only in the water buffaloes but not in cattle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>It is well known that susceptibility to infection by Macaviruses may depend on animal species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Certain species of deer (i.e. Père David's deer [43]), Bali cattle [42], [44] as well as American bison [45]-[49] are considered highly susceptible to OvHV-2. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></list-item><list-item><p><text><SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Despite this increased susceptibility, the mere presence of Macavirus-carriers on the farms did not appear to be sufficient for the transmission of the two MCF agents from the reservoir hosts to the water buffaloes as indicator hosts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>For example, transmission of CpHV-2 from the infected goats to water buffaloes was only observed in one case on farm 1, whereas the genoprevalence of CpHV-2 amounted to 65% among the water buffaloes on farm 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>The true reason for this difference could not be determined under the present conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>However, possible explanations for the high CpHV-2 transmission rate in farm 2 may be the joint keeping of goats and water buffaloes on pastures and in the stable throughout the entire year. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the water buffaloes were occasionally fed with remaining feed and milk of the goats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, one may consider independent circulation of CpHV-2 among water buffaloes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>However, the virus was detected only in one out of 11 nasal swabs taken from CpHV-2-positive water buffaloes of farm 2, which did not heavily support this possibility. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>OvHV-2 was highly prevalent in sheep on farm 1 as well as on farm 3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Whereas, on farm 3, the virus was not transmitted to the water buffaloes, it caused subclinical infection and mild to severe MCF outbreaks among the water buffaloes on farm 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>The obvious explanation for this may be attributed to the different types of management on the two farms: whereas the water buffaloes and the sheep had been co-stabled at winter time in farm 1, they were housed and grazed separately in farm 3, which may be considered a successful preventive measure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Although long distance spread of OvHV-2 from sheep to susceptible animals, such as bisons, has been reported by others [49], close contact among sheep and other susceptible species, especially keeping them under the same roof, is considered as a more efficient means to transmit OvHV-2 [50], [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Also, the temporary free ranging of hand-raised lambs in the water buffalo stable of farm 1 seems to favor OvHV-2 transmission. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>The role of the OvHV-2 infected goats of farm 1 is not clear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>OvHV-2 DNA in blood samples and nasal swabs of goats housed together with sheep has been detected previously [15], [19], [21], [27], [44], [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>In cattle and bison without clinical signs of MCF, DNA of OvHV-2 has been extracted from blood, milk, nasal secretions and conjunctiva [13], [46]–[48], [50], [51], [53], [54] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>It is unclear whether the OvHV-2 and CpHV-2-positive results from healthy water buffaloes in farms 1 and 2 were merely due to ongoing prolonged incubation periods prior to an MCF outbreak or else were attributable to water buffaloes as potential reservoir hosts. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Although the detection of OvHV-2 DNA in nasal secretions does not provide direct proof for virus excretion, the relatively high frequency of detection of OvHV-2 DNA in nasal swabs of infected water buffaloes on farm 1, might support the notion that OvHV-2 may circulate by horizontal transmission among water buffaloes in a sheep-independent manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>However, re-testing of blood samples of originally virus-free water buffaloes in farm 1, at eight to 13 months after removal of the sheep from the premises, did not reveal any newly infected carriers of OvHV-2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Similarly, two water buffalo calves, born after the removal of the sheep, were monitored at monthly intervals for OvHV-2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Neither calf turned OvHV-2-positive until the monitoring was ceased seven months later. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>The source of infection for water buffalo No. 8 from farm 1 remains unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Since the water buffalo spent the summer months of 2011 on an external farm, which also housed sheep, an infection on those premises must be considered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>However, the summering farm housed various water buffaloes and to our knowledge no further case of MCF had been registered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Indirect transmission, as well as direct horizontal transmission from a subclinically infected water buffalo as reservoir host, cannot be ruled out. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>A further possible explanation is that the virus load of the sample taken in December 2011 was under the detection limit of real-time PCR analysis; temporary variation of OvHV-2 DNA detection in peripheral blood lymphocytes of susceptible hosts has previously been demonstrated in cattle [51], [53]–[55] and bison [56], [57]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, OvHV-2-DNA was detected in the spleen of a fetus from a deceased, OvHV-2-positive dam of farm 1, which confirms potential trans-placental transmission of OvHV-2 among water buffaloes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this might represent the first report on vertical Macavirus transfer among MCF indicator hosts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Yet, as no spleen samples were available in the cases of the other two examined fetuses of a further OvHV-2 and of a CpHV-2 positive dam, no definitive conclusion can been drawn concerning the frequency of such a transmission. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Vertical transmission seems to play an important role in wildebeest, the reservoir host of AlHV-1 [10], [58], [59]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in sheep, vertical transmission of OvHV-2 may occur only rarely [60], whereas trans-placental transmission from CpHV-2 positive goats to their kids seems not to play a major role [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>It will be important to address these issues more deeply, especially with regard to water buffaloes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></list-item><list-item><p><text><SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Despite the considerations mentioned above, the water buffaloes seemed to be generally more susceptible to CpHV-2 (two-thirds of exposed animals positive) than to OvHV-2 (one-third positive). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>However, with 50% of infected water buffaloes of farm 1 succumbing to MCF due to OvHV-2, compared to only 15% of the CpHV-2-positive animals developing MCF on farm 2, the penetration rate of MCF appeared to be higher with OvHV-2 than with CpHV-2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Compared to cattle, the best studied indicator host, water buffaloes seem to be more susceptible to Macavirus infections but less prone to succumb to MCF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>However, in comparison to typical reservoir hosts, water buffaloes seem to be less susceptible to Macavirus infections but more prone to subsequently succumb to MCF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Thus, they may represent an interesting intermediate-type host for the Macaviruses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></list-item></list><p><text><SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it may be important to extend the research on MCF not only to relatively poorly characterized viruses, such as CpHV-2, but also to thus far neglected indicator host species, such as water buffaloes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Indeed, MCF is of great concern among different species of buffaloes, particularly in Asia, but also in Brazil and Italy [29], [30], [42]; clinical MCF in free-ranging African buffaloes is considered an emerging disease [61]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>In association with shared housing of water buffaloes and sheep and the frequency of MCF, OvHV-2 seems to be of high relevance [29]–[31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>However, our investigation confirms that water buffaloes can also succumb to MCF due to CpHV-2 [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Hence, shared housing of water buffaloes and goats has to be considered as a risk factor for MCF as well. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>In the present case report, the question whether or not Macaviruses actively circulate among water buffaloes could not be unanimously solved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>The notion that Macavirus DNAs were detected in nasal secretions of virus-positive animals and in the spleen of one fetus seems to argue in favor of active virus transmission among water buffaloes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>However, after the removal of the original reservoir hosts from one farm, newly infected individuals, with just one exception (case No. 8, Table 1), could not be identified, which rather speaks against efficient intra-species transmission. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, two different Macaviruses, OvHV-2 and CpHV-2, behaved differently in the “exotic” host, the water buffalo, than in “native” host species, such as cattle, sheep, and goats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>On the one hand, the water buffaloes seemed to be more susceptible than cattle to infection with either virus; on the other hand, the case fatality rate among water buffaloes was lower than the perceived lethality among cattle [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>However, recent reports from countries with a high concentration of farms, where OvHV-2 reservoir species are kept together with MCF-indicator species, suggested an increasing incidence of non-lethal outcomes of MCF, which also involved either subclinical cases among cattle, and more chronic, cutaneous forms of the disease [50], [62]–[64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>These observations may signify that either OvHV-2 has a capacity to adapt to new hosts upon serial passaging or else that the cattle in those countries are selected to become resistant to MCF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Both possibilities would be worthwhile to consider further. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Finally, it may be valuable to also look into the water buffalo's immune responses against the different types of Macaviruses in order to better understand the reasons for the relatively high number of subclinical cases. </plain></SENT>
