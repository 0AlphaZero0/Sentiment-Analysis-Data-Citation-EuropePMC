To optimize energy usage, bacteria have developed an integrated control system to preferentially uptake carbohydrates that support rapid growth. The availability of a preferred carbon source such as glucose represses the synthesis and activities of proteins necessary for the transport and metabolism of secondary carbon sources. This regulatory phenomenon is defined as carbon catabolite repression (CCR)<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. In enteric bacteria, the key player of CCR is a component of the glucose-specific phosphotransferase system, enzyme IIA (EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>)<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. It is known that unphosphorylated EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> binds and inhibits a variety of transporters when glucose is available<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. However, understanding the underlying molecular mechanism has been hindered by the complete absence of structures for any EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>-transporter complexes. Here, we present the 3.9 &#197; crystal structure of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> in complex with the maltose transporter, an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. The structure shows that two EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> molecules bind to the cytoplasmic ATPase subunits, stabilizing the transporter in an inward-facing conformation and preventing the structural rearrangements necessary for ATP hydrolysis. We also show that the half maximal inhibitory concentrations of the full-length EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> and an N-terminal truncation mutant differ by 60 fold, consistent with the hypothesis that the N-terminal region, disordered in the crystal structure, functions as a membrane-anchor to increase the effective EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> concentration at the membrane<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Together these data suggest a model of how the central regulatory protein EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> allosterically inhibits maltose uptake in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Carbon catabolite repression (CCR) is common in bacteria and higher organisms; up to 5-10% of all bacterial genes are subject to CCR regulation<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Different organisms use different pathways to achieve CCR. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, CCR is mediated by the modulation of the phosphorylation state of the glucose-specific enzyme IIA (EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>)<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> is a member of the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP): carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) that transports and concomitantly phosphorylates several preferred carbohydrates<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. The influx of PTS substrates and other readily metabolizable carbon sources increases the level of unphosphorylated EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> by affecting the intracellular [PEP]-[pyruvate] ratio<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Phosphorylated EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> stimulates cAMP synthesis<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, which leads to transcriptional activation of many catabolic genes. Unphosphorylated EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> directly inhibits several non-PTS sugar transport systems, including the maltose transporter (MalFGK<sub>2</sub>), lactose permease (LacY), melibiose permease (MelB), and raffinose permease (RafB)<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. It also prevents glycerol uptake by binding to the glycerol kinase, an enzyme key to glycerol metabolism<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. These carbohydrates or their derivatives function as inducers to control the synthesis of the corresponding transporters and metabolic enzymes. Thus, interaction of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> with the transporter not only directly prevents secondary carbon source uptake, but also down regulates the expression of the corresponding catabolic systems by reducing the intracellular level of the inducer<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. The regulation of the <italic>lac</italic> operon is the best known example of this feedback mechanism called inducer exclusion<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. The mechanisms of how EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> regulates target transporters have been studied for decades. Mutants of the lactose, maltose, raffinose, and melibiose permeases that abolish inducer exclusion have been isolated<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. The interfaces between EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> and the target transporters have been probed biochemically<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. While those studies have identified some of the residues involved in the interaction, no structure of any transporter in complex with EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> is yet available.</p><p id="P3">The maltose transporter MalFGK<sub>2</sub> belongs to the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. It consists of two transmembrane (TM) subunits, MalF and MalG, and two copies of the ATPase subunits, MalK. The structure of MalK can be further divided into an N-terminal nucleotide binding domain (NBD) and a C-terminal regulatory domain (RD). Crystal structures of the maltose transporter have been determined in three distinct functional states. The inward-facing conformation, also known as the resting state in which the transporter has very low basal ATPase activity, was obtained in the absence of maltose and nucleotides<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. The outward-facing conformation, corresponding to a hydrolysis competent intermediate, was stabilized by the periplasmic maltose-binding protein (MBP) and ATP<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Finally, a pre-translocation complex, which shows how substrate initiates the transport cycle, was captured in the presence of the MBP but in the absence of ATP<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. These structures illustrate the coordinated motions of the transporter that couple ATP hydrolysis to maltose translocation<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. On this foundation, the maltose transporter would be a productive system to study how sugar transport is regulated under conditions subject to inducer exclusion.</p><p id="P4">To obtain crystals of the maltose transporter bound with EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>, we tested many constructs including full-length and truncated proteins devoid of flexible regions. It was unclear whether EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> binds to the transporter in the resting state or an intermediate conformation induced by MBP and/or ATP. Therefore, we carried out crystallization experiments with different combinations of cofactors. Crystals were obtained with full-length MalFGK<sub>2</sub> and EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> in the absence of MBP and ATP. Initially, the crystals obtained in detergent diffracted X-rays poorly (about 15 &#8211; 20 &#197;). Crystals grown in lipid/detergent bicelles diffracted to 7 &#197; resolution. Dehydration caused the unit cell to shrink by 20 &#197; in one dimension and improved the resolution to 3.9 &#197;. The structure was determined by molecular replacement and refined with deformable elastic network (DEN) constraints (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>).</p><p id="P5">The asymmetric unit of the crystal contains two copies of the complex, each consisting of one transporter MalFGK<sub>2</sub> and two EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> molecules (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The maltose transporter shows a conformation similar to that of the resting state<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. The root mean square deviation (rmsd) of the transporter (1,168 C&#945; positions, excluding flexible regions) between the resting state and the EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> complex structure is 2.2 &#197; (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1</xref>). In this conformation, the transmembrane maltose-binding site is exposed to the intracellular side of the membrane (inward-facing). In contrast to the resting state in which the periplasmic P2 loop is disordered, the structure of the P2 loop is well resolved (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2</xref>). The relative orientation of the P2 loop is different between the two structures in the asymmetric unit, likely influenced by crystal packing (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3 and Fig. S4</xref>). The two EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> molecules are bound at structurally equivalent positions, interacting exclusively with the intracellular MalK subunits. The EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>-binding sites are distant from the Walker A motifs that bind ATP (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>), the maltose-binding site in MalF, and the periplasmic loops to which maltose-MBP docks. Thus, EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> is a classical Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) allosteric inhibitor of the maltose transporter<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">The MalK subunits form an open dimer, interacting with each other through their C-terminal RD domains (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Each EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> is wedged between the NBD of one MalK and the RD of the opposite MalK, linking these two domains together (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Of the 1,500 &#197;<sup>2</sup> buried surface area on EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>, approximately 55% is buried at the NBD interface and the other 45% at the RD interface. From this structure, it becomes apparent why binding of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> would inhibit the maltose transporter. In contrast to the open dimer stabilized by EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>, in the outward-facing state the two NBDs of MalK make contact with each other and two ATPs lie buried along the NBD interface (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Superposition of the resting state and outward-facing structures shows that the conformational changes of MalK observed in the transport cycle are achieved principally by interdomain rotations of the NBDs relative to the RDs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). In effect, the MalK subunits resemble a pair of tweezers, with the RDs acting as the fulcrum point allowing the two NBDs to open and close like the pincers<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Here we observe that by linking the NBD of one MalK with the opposite RD, the two EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> molecules fasten the tweezers in the open configuration. The two TM subunits MalF and MalG are docked onto the MalK NBDs, and conformational changes in the NBDs are tightly coupled to those of the TM domains<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Thus, by preventing closure of the NBDs, EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> prevents the formation of the outward-facing conformation, a key step for ATP hydrolysis and maltose translocation. In excellent agreement with the crystal structure, all mutations that render resistance to EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> inhibition reside in the MalK subunit<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Among the eight mutations isolated, five make direct interactions with EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> in the crystal structure (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). The others, G278P, G302D, and S322F, are located in close proximity to the interface and likely produce local conformational changes that prevent EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> from binding (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p><p id="P7">The structure of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> observed in the complex (residues 19-168) is very similar to that of the free form<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, with an overall rmsd of 0.5 &#197;. This reinforces the observation that neither phosphorylation nor binding to target proteins induces substantial conformational changes of EIIA<sup>Glc 14-17</sup>. As a central signaling molecule, EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> interacts with many proteins that share little sequence or structural similarity<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. The NBD of MalK binds to a canonical surface of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> that normally interacts with other partners (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>, left). Of the 17 residues making contacts with the NBD, 11 are also involved in interacting with glycerol kinase, EIIB<sup>Glc</sup>, and HPr<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>, left). The majority of the interface residues are hydrophobic, consistent with the promiscuous interactions this surface makes with different proteins. The crystal structure also shows why phosphorylation prevents the binding of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> to the maltose transporter. The phosphorylation site His 90<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, located at the EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>-MalK interface, is in its unphosphorylated form and Hydrogen bonded with Gln 122 of MalK (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). Adding a negatively charged phosphate group to the side chain of His 90 would disrupt the interface, thus relieving the maltose transporter from inducer exclusion. As previously suggested by antibody and peptide mapping experiments<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, residues contacting the RD are located away from the active site, forming an interface unique to the maltose transporter complex (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>, right).</p><p id="P8">Although the N-terminal 18 residues of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> are disordered in the crystal structure, data from other studies suggested that this region might still play an important role in stabilizing the EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>-MalFGK<sub>2</sub> complex. Studies of synthetic peptides showed that residues 3-10 of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> form an amphipathic helix in the presence of either detergent micelles or lipid vesicles (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>), suggesting that it may function as a membrane anchor<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Furthermore, removing the N-terminal region of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> hinders its interaction with membrane transporters, but not soluble partners<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. In the EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>-MalFGK<sub>2</sub> structure, EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> is oriented such that the N-terminus is pointed towards the membrane. The first ordered residue Thr 19 is approximately 20 &#197; outside the lipid bilayer (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). To test the function of the N-terminal region, we compared the inhibition of maltose-MBP stimulated ATPase activity by full-length EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> and a truncation mutant consisting of residues 19-168 (&#916;1-18). The maltose transporter was reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs to allow access of MBP and EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> to both sides of the membrane. Both constructs of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> inhibit with positive cooperativity (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>), consistent with the 2:1 stoichiometry of the complex and an earlier observation that inhibition of maltose uptake was sigmoidally related to EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> concentration<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. However, the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of the &#916;1-18 construct is 60 times higher than that of the full-length protein (91 &#956;M versus 1.6 &#956;M). This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that the full-length protein is concentrated near the membrane through the N-terminal region. Given that the intracellular concentration of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> is around 50 &#956;M<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, the membrane-anchoring function of the N-terminal region would be very important to ensure efficient inhibition of the transporter. The high IC<sub>50</sub> value of the &#916;1-18 construct also explains the lack of inhibition observed with a similar construct from a previous study, where the concentration used in the assay was approximately 24 &#956;M<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">On the basis of the structural and functional data, we propose a model for inducer exclusion of the maltose transporter (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The uptake and concomitant phosphorylation of glucose lead to dephosphorylation of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> through a cascade of enzymes. Unphosphorylated EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> binds to the resting state maltose transporter and locks the MalK dimer in the open configuration. Ordinarily, binding of the maltose-loaded MBP and ATP are sufficient to promote the transition from the inward-facing, resting state to the outward-facing, ATPase active state &#8211; the very conformational change that allows maltose entry from the periplasm and also enables ATP hydrolysis at the same time. Under inducer exclusion, EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> stabilizes the resting state such that MBP and ATP binding can no longer initiate the transport cycle. The maltose transporter is the only ABC transporter known to be inhibited by EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>; however, similar allosteric regulation mechanisms by the transported substrate itself have been described for the methionine transporter and the molybdate transporter<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. In both cases, at high intracellular concentrations, methionine or molybdate binds to allosteric sites in the ATPase subunits to stabilize the transporter in the inward-facing state, thus preventing further substrate uptake<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">Previously it was shown that binding of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> to two other transporters, LacY and MelB, were enhanced by their corresponding sugar substrates<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. However, for the maltose transporter no cooperativity between substrate and EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> binding was observed<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Consistent with the functional data, the crystal structure offers no evidence that the EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>-MalFGK<sub>2</sub> interaction would be affected by the presence of maltose. LacY and MelB are homologous proteins belonging to the major facilitator superfamily, unrelated to ABC transporters. Thus, it is likely that the mechanism underlying LacY and MelB regulation is different from that of the maltose transporter.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S2" specific-use="web-only"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Expression and purification of MalFGK<sub>2</sub></title><p id="P12">Expression and purification of the maltose transporter MalFGK<sub>2</sub> with a 6&#215;-His tag at the C-terminus of MalK were carried out as described previously<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>.

Dissolved lipids were purged with Argon and then sonicated to clarity. The membrane scaffold protein (MSP) was expressed and purified as described<sup>39</sup>. To prepare the nanodiscs, a mixture of <italic>E. coli</italic> lipids, sodium cholate, purified MalFGK<sub>2</sub> and MSP at 120 &#956;g/ml, 25 mM, 10 &#956;M and 50 &#956;M concentrations, respectively, was incubated at room temperature for 1 hour with gentle rocking. Nanodiscs were assembled using a 5:1 molar ratio of MSP:MalFGK<sub>2</sub> to minimize the incorporation of more than one MalFGK<sub>2</sub> complex per nanodisc. Nanodisc self-assembly was then initiated by adding hydrated Bio-Beads to remove the detergent. Bio-Beads were then removed after 3 hours of incubation at 22 &#176;C. The mixture was loaded onto cobalt affinity resin pre-equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 100 mM NaCl. The resin was washed extensively to remove MalFGK<sub>2</sub>-free nanodiscs. Nanodiscs containing MalFGK<sub>2</sub> were eluted and loaded on a desalting column to remove imidazole.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Kinetic characterization of inhibition of the maltose transporter ATPase by EIIA<sup>Glc</sup></title><p id="P19">The ATPase activity was determined using an ATP-regeneration/NADH-consumption coupled system<sup>40,41</sup> and reconstituted MalFGK<sub>2</sub> in nanodiscs. Different amounts of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> were added into 100 &#956;l reaction mixture containing 50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 94 nM MalFGK<sub>2</sub>, 15 &#956;M MBP, 1 mM maltose, 60 &#956;g/ml pyruvate kinase, 32 &#956;g/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 4 mM phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), 0.3 mM NADH and 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. After incubation for 2 hours at 25 &#176;C, 1 mM ATP was added to initiate the reaction. The absorbance at 340 nm was recorded using the 8453 UV-Vis Diode Array System (Agilent Technologies) at 25 &#176;C for 5 minutes. All measurements were performed three times from the same protein preparations. Data were fit to either the Hill or the Michaelis-Menten equation using SigmaPlot.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Figure preparation</title><p id="P20">All structure figures were prepared with the program PyMOL (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pymol.org">www.pymol.org</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S11"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS473928-supplement-1.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e882" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>2</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS473928-supplement-2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e886" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S12"><p>We thank the staff at the Advance Photon Source GM/CA-CAT, NE-CAT and SBC for assistance with data collection.

In the resting state, the open MalK dimer coincides with the inward-facing TM domains. Upon association of MBP, the transporter undergoes a conformational change (the pre-translocation state) that permits ATP to promote a concerted motion of MalK closure, reorientation of the TM domains, and opening of MBP. Formation of the outward-facing conformation transfers maltose from MBP to the TM binding site, and at the same time positions ATP at the catalytic site for hydrolysis. ATP hydrolysis releases maltose into the cytoplasm and resets the transporter to the resting state. Under conditions subject to inducer exclusion, unphosphorylated EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> binds and stabilizes the resting state transporter, thus inhibiting maltose transport.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms473928f4"/></fig></floats-group></article>
