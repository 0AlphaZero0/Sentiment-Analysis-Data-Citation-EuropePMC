<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To optimize energy usage, bacteria have developed an integrated control system to preferentially uptake carbohydrates that support rapid growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The availability of a preferred carbon source such as glucose represses the synthesis and activities of proteins necessary for the transport and metabolism of secondary carbon sources. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This regulatory phenomenon is defined as carbon catabolite repression (CCR)1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In enteric bacteria, the key player of CCR is a component of the glucose-specific phosphotransferase system, enzyme IIA (EIIAGlc)1,2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is known that unphosphorylated EIIAGlc binds and inhibits a variety of transporters when glucose is available1,2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, understanding the underlying molecular mechanism has been hindered by the complete absence of structures for any EIIAGlc-transporter complexes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Here, we present the 3.9 Ã… crystal structure of EIIAGlc in complex with the maltose transporter, an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The structure shows that two EIIAGlc molecules bind to the cytoplasmic ATPase subunits, stabilizing the transporter in an inward-facing conformation and preventing the structural rearrangements necessary for ATP hydrolysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We also show that the half maximal inhibitory concentrations of the full-length EIIAGlc and an N-terminal truncation mutant differ by 60 fold, consistent with the hypothesis that the N-terminal region, disordered in the crystal structure, functions as a membrane-anchor to increase the effective EIIAGlc concentration at the membrane3,4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Together these data suggest a model of how the central regulatory protein EIIAGlc allosterically inhibits maltose uptake in E. coli. </plain></SENT>
</text></SecTag></p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2"><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Carbon catabolite repression (CCR) is common in bacteria and higher organisms; up to 5-10% of all bacterial genes are subject to CCR regulation1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Different organisms use different pathways to achieve CCR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In E. coli, CCR is mediated by the modulation of the phosphorylation state of the glucose-specific enzyme IIA (EIIAGlc)1,2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>EIIAGlc is a member of the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP): carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) that transports and concomitantly phosphorylates several preferred carbohydrates1,2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The influx of PTS substrates and other readily metabolizable carbon sources increases the level of unphosphorylated EIIAGlc by affecting the intracellular [PEP]-[pyruvate] ratio5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylated EIIAGlc stimulates cAMP synthesis2, which leads to transcriptional activation of many catabolic genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Unphosphorylated EIIAGlc directly inhibits several non-PTS sugar transport systems, including the maltose transporter (MalFGK2), lactose permease (LacY), melibiose permease (MelB), and raffinose permease (RafB)2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>It also prevents glycerol uptake by binding to the glycerol kinase, an enzyme key to glycerol metabolism2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>These carbohydrates or their derivatives function as inducers to control the synthesis of the corresponding transporters and metabolic enzymes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Thus, interaction of EIIAGlc with the transporter not only directly prevents secondary carbon source uptake, but also down regulates the expression of the corresponding catabolic systems by reducing the intracellular level of the inducer1,2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The regulation of the lac operon is the best known example of this feedback mechanism called inducer exclusion1,2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of how EIIAGlc regulates target transporters have been studied for decades. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Mutants of the lactose, maltose, raffinose, and melibiose permeases that abolish inducer exclusion have been isolated2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The interfaces between EIIAGlc and the target transporters have been probed biochemically2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>While those studies have identified some of the residues involved in the interaction, no structure of any transporter in complex with EIIAGlc is yet available. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P3"><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The maltose transporter MalFGK2 belongs to the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>It consists of two transmembrane (TM) subunits, MalF and MalG, and two copies of the ATPase subunits, MalK. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The structure of MalK can be further divided into an N-terminal nucleotide binding domain (NBD) and a C-terminal regulatory domain (RD). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Crystal structures of the maltose transporter have been determined in three distinct functional states. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The inward-facing conformation, also known as the resting state in which the transporter has very low basal ATPase activity, was obtained in the absence of maltose and nucleotides6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The outward-facing conformation, corresponding to a hydrolysis competent intermediate, was stabilized by the periplasmic maltose-binding protein (MBP) and ATP7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Finally, a pre-translocation complex, which shows how substrate initiates the transport cycle, was captured in the presence of the MBP but in the absence of ATP8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>These structures illustrate the coordinated motions of the transporter that couple ATP hydrolysis to maltose translocation6-8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>On this foundation, the maltose transporter would be a productive system to study how sugar transport is regulated under conditions subject to inducer exclusion. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P4"><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>To obtain crystals of the maltose transporter bound with EIIAGlc, we tested many constructs including full-length and truncated proteins devoid of flexible regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>It was unclear whether EIIAGlc binds to the transporter in the resting state or an intermediate conformation induced by MBP and/or ATP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we carried out crystallization experiments with different combinations of cofactors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Crystals were obtained with full-length MalFGK2 and EIIAGlc in the absence of MBP and ATP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Initially, the crystals obtained in detergent diffracted X-rays poorly (about 15 â€“ 20 Ã…). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Crystals grown in lipid/detergent bicelles diffracted to 7 Ã… resolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Dehydration caused the unit cell to shrink by 20 Ã… in one dimension and improved the resolution to 3.9 Ã…. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The structure was determined by molecular replacement and refined with deformable elastic network (DEN) constraints (Table S1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P5"><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The asymmetric unit of the crystal contains two copies of the complex, each consisting of one transporter MalFGK2 and two EIIAGlc molecules (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The maltose transporter shows a conformation similar to that of the resting state6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The root mean square deviation (rmsd) of the transporter (1,168 CÎ± positions, excluding flexible regions) between the resting state and the EIIAGlc complex structure is 2.2 Ã… (Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>In this conformation, the transmembrane maltose-binding site is exposed to the intracellular side of the membrane (inward-facing). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the resting state in which the periplasmic P2 loop is disordered, the structure of the P2 loop is well resolved (Fig. 1 and Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>The relative orientation of the P2 loop is different between the two structures in the asymmetric unit, likely influenced by crystal packing (Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>S3 and Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>S4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>The two EIIAGlc molecules are bound at structurally equivalent positions, interacting exclusively with the intracellular MalK subunits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The EIIAGlc-binding sites are distant from the Walker A motifs that bind ATP (Fig. 2a), the maltose-binding site in MalF, and the periplasmic loops to which maltose-MBP docks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Thus, EIIAGlc is a classical Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) allosteric inhibitor of the maltose transporter9. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P6"><text><SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The MalK subunits form an open dimer, interacting with each other through their C-terminal RD domains (Fig. 2a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Each EIIAGlc is wedged between the NBD of one MalK and the RD of the opposite MalK, linking these two domains together (Fig. 2a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Of the 1,500 Ã…2 buried surface area on EIIAGlc, approximately 55% is buried at the NBD interface and the other 45% at the RD interface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>From this structure, it becomes apparent why binding of EIIAGlc would inhibit the maltose transporter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the open dimer stabilized by EIIAGlc, in the outward-facing state the two NBDs of MalK make contact with each other and two ATPs lie buried along the NBD interface (Fig. 2b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Superposition of the resting state and outward-facing structures shows that the conformational changes of MalK observed in the transport cycle are achieved principally by interdomain rotations of the NBDs relative to the RDs (Fig. 2b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>In effect, the MalK subunits resemble a pair of tweezers, with the RDs acting as the fulcrum point allowing the two NBDs to open and close like the pincers10. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Here we observe that by linking the NBD of one MalK with the opposite RD, the two EIIAGlc molecules fasten the tweezers in the open configuration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The two TM subunits MalF and MalG are docked onto the MalK NBDs, and conformational changes in the NBDs are tightly coupled to those of the TM domains7 (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Thus, by preventing closure of the NBDs, EIIAGlc prevents the formation of the outward-facing conformation, a key step for ATP hydrolysis and maltose translocation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>In excellent agreement with the crystal structure, all mutations that render resistance to EIIAGlc inhibition reside in the MalK subunit11,12. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Among the eight mutations isolated, five make direct interactions with EIIAGlc in the crystal structure (Fig. 2c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>The others, G278P, G302D, and S322F, are located in close proximity to the interface and likely produce local conformational changes that prevent EIIAGlc from binding (Fig. 2c). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P7"><text><SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>The structure of EIIAGlc observed in the complex (residues 19-168) is very similar to that of the free form13, with an overall rmsd of 0.5 Ã…. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>This reinforces the observation that neither phosphorylation nor binding to target proteins induces substantial conformational changes of EIIAGlc 14-17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>As a central signaling molecule, EIIAGlc interacts with many proteins that share little sequence or structural similarity2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>The NBD of MalK binds to a canonical surface of EIIAGlc that normally interacts with other partners (Fig. 2d, left). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Of the 17 residues making contacts with the NBD, 11 are also involved in interacting with glycerol kinase, EIIBGlc, and HPr14-16 (Fig. 2d, left). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>The majority of the interface residues are hydrophobic, consistent with the promiscuous interactions this surface makes with different proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>The crystal structure also shows why phosphorylation prevents the binding of EIIAGlc to the maltose transporter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>The phosphorylation site His 9018, located at the EIIAGlc-MalK interface, is in its unphosphorylated form and Hydrogen bonded with Gln 122 of MalK (Fig. 2c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Adding a negatively charged phosphate group to the side chain of His 90 would disrupt the interface, thus relieving the maltose transporter from inducer exclusion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>As previously suggested by antibody and peptide mapping experiments19,20, residues contacting the RD are located away from the active site, forming an interface unique to the maltose transporter complex (Fig. 2d, right). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P8"><text><SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Although the N-terminal 18 residues of EIIAGlc are disordered in the crystal structure, data from other studies suggested that this region might still play an important role in stabilizing the EIIAGlc-MalFGK2 complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Studies of synthetic peptides showed that residues 3-10 of EIIAGlc form an amphipathic helix in the presence of either detergent micelles or lipid vesicles (Fig. 3a), suggesting that it may function as a membrane anchor3,4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, removing the N-terminal region of EIIAGlc hinders its interaction with membrane transporters, but not soluble partners19,21-23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>In the EIIAGlc-MalFGK2 structure, EIIAGlc is oriented such that the N-terminus is pointed towards the membrane. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>The first ordered residue Thr 19 is approximately 20 Ã… outside the lipid bilayer (Fig. 3b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>To test the function of the N-terminal region, we compared the inhibition of maltose-MBP stimulated ATPase activity by full-length EIIAGlc and a truncation mutant consisting of residues 19-168 (Î”1-18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>The maltose transporter was reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs to allow access of MBP and EIIAGlc to both sides of the membrane. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Both constructs of EIIAGlc inhibit with positive cooperativity (Fig. 3c), consistent with the 2:1 stoichiometry of the complex and an earlier observation that inhibition of maltose uptake was sigmoidally related to EIIAGlc concentration24. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>However, the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of the Î”1-18 construct is 60 times higher than that of the full-length protein (91 Î¼M versus 1.6 Î¼M). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that the full-length protein is concentrated near the membrane through the N-terminal region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Given that the intracellular concentration of EIIAGlc is around 50 Î¼M25, the membrane-anchoring function of the N-terminal region would be very important to ensure efficient inhibition of the transporter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>The high IC50 value of the Î”1-18 construct also explains the lack of inhibition observed with a similar construct from a previous study, where the concentration used in the assay was approximately 24 Î¼M19. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P9"><text><SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the structural and functional data, we propose a model for inducer exclusion of the maltose transporter (Fig. 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>The uptake and concomitant phosphorylation of glucose lead to dephosphorylation of EIIAGlc through a cascade of enzymes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Unphosphorylated EIIAGlc binds to the resting state maltose transporter and locks the MalK dimer in the open configuration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Ordinarily, binding of the maltose-loaded MBP and ATP are sufficient to promote the transition from the inward-facing, resting state to the outward-facing, ATPase active state â€“ the very conformational change that allows maltose entry from the periplasm and also enables ATP hydrolysis at the same time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Under inducer exclusion, EIIAGlc stabilizes the resting state such that MBP and ATP binding can no longer initiate the transport cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>The maltose transporter is the only ABC transporter known to be inhibited by EIIAGlc; however, similar allosteric regulation mechanisms by the transported substrate itself have been described for the methionine transporter and the molybdate transporter26,27. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>In both cases, at high intracellular concentrations, methionine or molybdate binds to allosteric sites in the ATPase subunits to stabilize the transporter in the inward-facing state, thus preventing further substrate uptake26,27. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P10"><text><SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>Previously it was shown that binding of EIIAGlc to two other transporters, LacY and MelB, were enhanced by their corresponding sugar substrates28,29. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>However, for the maltose transporter no cooperativity between substrate and EIIAGlc binding was observed30. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the functional data, the crystal structure offers no evidence that the EIIAGlc-MalFGK2 interaction would be affected by the presence of maltose. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>LacY and MelB are homologous proteins belonging to the major facilitator superfamily, unrelated to ABC transporters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is likely that the mechanism underlying LacY and MelB regulation is different from that of the maltose transporter. </plain></SENT>
