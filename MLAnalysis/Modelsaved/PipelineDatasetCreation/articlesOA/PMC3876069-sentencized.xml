</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the three most common malignancies worldwide, including breast and lung cancers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Late diagnosis, often accompanied by metastases, is a general problem for the treatment of this condition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Besides surgical intervention, the modern approach to CRC treatment strongly relies on the use of chemotherapeutics [1] and monoclonal antibodies [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although combination and targeted therapy improved the therapy outcomes for CRC patients, high recurrence rates still pose a major lethality problem [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is now accepted that a subpopulation(s) of malignant cells with stem cell properties may give rise to a hierarchy of proliferative and progressively differentiating cells and might account for invasiveness of tumors and decreased survival rates [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Current drugs do not target this particular subset of cells and novel therapeutic approaches, including novel drug entities, are thus interesting for advancements in CRC treatment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Hydroxyurea (HU) is a common antimetabolic cytostatic compound used to treat some types of cancer (Figure 1A) and a number of its derivatives exerting stronger antitumor potency and lower general cytotoxicity have been synthesized [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Similarly, Perkovic et al. [6] synthesized a series of novel l- and d-amino acid amide HU derivatives and evaluated their antiviral and cytostatic activity against malignant tumor cell lines, including leukemia and normal human fibroblasts [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we report the biological mechanisms of action in vitro, in silico and in vivo of two compounds showing favorable, specific and concentration-dependent antiproliferative effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The selected compounds, N′-benzyloxycarbamoyl-d-phenylglycine benzhydrylamide (BOU) and N′-methyl-N′-hydroxycarbamoyl-l-phenylalanine benzhydrylamide (MHCU), shown in Figure 1A, acted selectively on the colon tumor cell line SW620 in comparison with other tested tumor cell lines and normal human fibroblasts. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that BOU and MHCU exerted the strongest antiproliferative effect upon a panel of tested cell lines, including the metastatic colon cancer cell line SW620 [6,7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Tested compounds are both amino acid derivatives of HU, with the same amide moiety and a different amino acid part: BOU is a d-phenylglycine and MHCU is a l-phenylalanine derivative. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In addition, they differ in the HU section: MHCU has a free hydroxy group, while the hydroxy group in BOU is protected by the benzyl residue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The presented study focused only on BOU and MHCU mechanistic analysis of metastatic SW620 cells, since metastases represent a major problem in cancer therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The antiproliferative assay results confirmed the previously observed concentration-dependent antiproliferative effects of these compounds on the growth of the SW620 cell line where BOU exerted a stronger cytotoxic effect while MHCU acted only as an antiproliferative agent (Figure 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The obtained IC50 values were 17.0 μM for BOU and 67.1 μM for MHCU. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Tested compounds exerted weak cell cycle perturbations, but a strong cell death response, which was evidenced by a significant increase of the subG1 SW620 cell population (Table 1), indicative of apoptosis [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>BOU caused a 31.2% increase in the subG1 phase after 24 h and a 7.8% increase after 72 h at higher concentration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>MHCU induced only a 2.1% increase in the subG1 phase after 24 h and a 4.3% increase after 72 h at higher concentration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, only BOU induced S phase arrest after 72 h at higher concentration. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Both compounds caused cell death evidenced by an increase of treated cells in the subG1 phase and by increased fraction of apoptotic cells (Table S1 in Supplementary Information). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>This effect was also stronger for BOU, probably partially attributable to its cytotoxicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>BOU caused a 6.8% increase of cells in the early stage of apoptosis after 24 h and a 9.2% increase of cells in the late stage of apoptosis/necrosis after 24 h in comparison with untreated cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>However, a lower rate of apoptosis induction was visible upon 72 h, which might be attributable to some other cell death mechanism, i.e., senescence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>MHCU increased the number of cells in the late stage of apoptosis at both tested concentrations after 24 and 72 h. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Major apoptosis effectors, caspases 3 and 9, were expected to be activated by tested compounds since they are usually triggered in response to anticancer chemotherapy either through the extrinsic death receptor pathway [9] or the intrinsic mitochondria pathway [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Caspases 3 and 9, however, were not activated upon treatment of SW620 cells with BOU and MHCU (Figure 1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Small amounts of cleaved/activated caspase 9 were detected in all treatments but were not significantly different in comparison with controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Only caspase 7, tested due to a high degree of redundancy with caspase 3 and often activated instead of it [11], was cleaved/activated upon treatment with both compounds after 72 h. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The proportion of apoptotic cells assessed by the Annexin V assay was lower than the subG1 fraction measured by a flow cytometer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>This might be explained by other cell death mechanisms occurring upon the treatment with tested compounds [12,13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Indeed, only activation of caspase 7 was detected upon the treatment of cells with BOU and MHCU (Figure 1C), which may activate downstream targets in the absence of caspase 3 or act as a downstream effector for caspase-1-dependent pro-inflammatory effects or in the endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced death [11,14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) might trigger oxidative stress [15] but reactive oxygen species (ROS) seem to be induced as an early post-treatment event rather than act as a persistent mechanism of action [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Even though a similar concentration-dependent antiproliferative pattern and caspase 7 activation (Figure 1B) were observed for both compounds, the cell cycle dynamics (Table 1) and percentage of apoptotic cell distribution (Table S1 in Supplementary Information) were somewhat different. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The possibility of tested derivatives acting differently in the same cell line was thus studied in detail by global proteomic profiling, which proved successful in elucidating the molecular mechanisms triggered by novel antitumor compounds [17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><label>2.3.</label><title><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Protein Alterations in SW620 Cells Treated with BOU and MHCU </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Global protein profiling of SW620 cells treated with BOU and MHCU showed significant alterations in qualitative and quantitative total proteome profiles after 24 and 72 h (Tables S2 and S3 in Supplementary Information). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Identified differentially expressed proteins among control and treated cells are known to be involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, regulation of the cell cycle, anti-inflammatory response, translation, transcription, structure of the cytoskeleton, oxidative stress, DNA repair, protein structure, tumor adhesion, invasion and metastasis as well as in cell metabolism. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Upon treatment of SW620 cells with BOU, a number of differentially expressed proteins were identified (Table S2 in Supplementary Information). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The majority of identified proteins were down-regulated in BOU-treated cells, in particular, proteins driving metabolic processes, i.e., hnRNP proteins that were previously identified as overexpressed in colorectal carcinoma [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Moreover, proliferation-driving proteins were down-regulated as well, i.e., FUBP1, a known substrate of caspase 7 [19] that is probably degraded by caspase 7 in SW620 treated with BOU. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Several other proteins that promote proliferation and/or block apoptosis were identified only in untreated SW620, i.e., the main marker for proliferation PCNA [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>It seems therefore that an immediate cell cycle arrest occurs upon treatment with BOU that ends up with cell death. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>These processes are connected to down-regulation of colorectal cancer malignancy biomarkers TAGLN2 and Gal-3 [21,22] as well as the metastatic phenotype marker PAI-RBP1 [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, down-regulation of specific CRC proteins involved in tumor progression and invasion might explain the selective activity of BOU on the metastatic SW620 cell line in comparison with other tested tumor cell lines derived from solid tumors [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it seems that cell death mechanisms might be triggered by metabolic changes and oxidative stress through activation of caspase 7 and down-regulation of two crucial oxidative stress-protecting proteins, DJ-1 and PRDX3, in treated SW620 cells (Table S2 in Supplementary Information). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>A distinct protein pattern involving a number of inflammatory proteins was observed in SW620 cells upon MHCU treatment (Table S3 in Supplementary Information). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>For example, ANX1, which was up-regulated by MCHU treatment, has been already found to be an inducible endogenous inhibitor of NF-κB in human cancer cells and to provide a basis for novel molecular mechanisms of action for anti-inflammatory agents [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The possible MHCU anti-inflammatory mechanism was also evidenced by down-regulation of several proteins that drive inflammation, including HMG-1, PRDX2 and CRT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>This result is interesting in the light of previous data showing anti-inflammatory effects on the systemic level of several HU derivatives [25]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Proteomic results showed that BOU increased oxidative stress while MHCU altered expression of proteins involved in the inflammatory response. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><label>2.4.</label><title><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Docking of BOU and MHCU within HDAC Enzymes and the HDAC Inhibition Assay </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>A dozen substances similar to the studied compounds (Figure 1A) were found by PubChem search (similarity score ≥ 0.95). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>However, their biological effects were not described in scientific literature, with the exception of our previous report on cell growth inhibition activities [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Class I HDAC isoforms are highly expressed in colorectal carcinomas, particularly in the proliferating, de-differentiated tumors [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Hence, we tried to dock BOU and MHCU within deacetylase binding sites with solved X-ray structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>HU possesses metal-chelating and reducing properties, allowing compounds of this group to interact with a variety of metallo- and redox-active proteins [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>The zinc-chelating enzymes that take part in cell proliferation are histone deacetylases (HDAC) of classes I and II [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Their most common competitive inhibitors are hydroxamate compounds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>The common template of hydroxamate inhibitors of HDAC enzymes [29] contains a zinc-binding group (ZBG) and a CAP group interacting with surface residues of these proteins (Figure 2A) [30,31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>ZBG and CAP groups are usually connected by an extended linker containing hydrophobic fragments such as a phenyl ring. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>The hydroxamate group chelates Zn2+ in a bidentate fashion through its C=O and OH groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>According to the reported quantum-mechanical modeling, the potential isosteric ZBG for hydroxamate may be the HU group [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>HU can be a satisfactory hydroxamate replacement if the rest of the molecule can compensate for the unfavorable desolvation effect on the binding affinity of hydrophilic HU [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>This might be the case of lipophilic BOU (XlogP = 5.1) and MHCU (XlogP = 3.4) [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Higher lipophilic character of BOU may also account for its increased cellular uptake and thus more pronounced in vitro effects compared to MHCU. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Herein, the binding site of the 3MAX structure of HDAC2 complexed with the inhibitor N-(4-aminobiphenyl-3-yl) benzamide (LLX) was used for BOU and MHCU docking (Figure 2B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>This benzamide is more similar to the studied compounds than hydroxymates, most of which have unbranched alkyl linkers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>While the Zn2+ ion, in the catalytic site of HDAC2, is coordinated by His141, His142, Asp177 and Asp265 [31], in the 3MAX complex it is coordinated by the ligand LXX and the residues Asp177, His179 and Asp265 demonstrating some kind of metal-binding flexibility (Figure 2B) [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Analogously, in the binding of BOU [6], the N′-hydroxyurea moiety should be oriented in such a way as to interact with the Zn2+ ion (Figure 2B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>In that case, the benzyl substituent enters the lipophilic “foot” pocket adjacent to the catalytic place, while the freely rotating phenyl and biphenyl CAP groups can interact with the conserved lipophilic residues at the protein surface such as Tyr205 and Phe206 of HDAC2 (UniprotKB Q92769). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Most amino acid residues around the binding site, particularly those at the protein surface, are positioned at the loops (Figure 2B), indicating that some degree of structural flexibility can be tolerated upon ligand binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>The other studied derivative, MHCU with an unsubstituted OH group (Figure 1A), has not shown significant inhibition of HDAC enzymes (Figure 2D), which indicates the importance of occupying the “foot” pocket and of hydrophobic interactions similarly to the case of LXX [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>The previous observation that O-benzylhydroxyurea derivatives were generally more cytotoxic than their hydroxy pairs [6] is in accord with the HDAC inhibition activity of the studied derivatives. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Stereochemistry has not been found to have a substantial impact on the cytostatic activity [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Similarly, it may be expected to be of minor significance for the inhibition of HDAC enzymes due to the flexible binding site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>This assumption must be further confirmed by automated molecular docking and co-crystallization experiments. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Similarly as in HDAC 2, in HDAC 1 and 3 enzymes (based on protein sequence alignment since there are no crystal structures for these isoforms), there is also a “foot” pocket. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>However, in the HDAC4 and HDAC8 isoforms there are Pro (PDB 2VQJ) and Trp residues, respectively, at that place, preventing the use of ligands (Figure 2C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Thus, like benzamides, O-benzylhydroxyurea derivates can be inhibitors specific for HDACs 1–3 of class I [31]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>In silico results pointed to HDACs of class I as potential molecular targets for compound BOU. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>The significant decrease of activity of HDAC of classes I and/or II, in the entire SW620 cell lysate treated with BOU at 50 μM concentration (Figure 2D), supported this finding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>The HDAC enzymes of class I are overexpressed in CRC [26] and it has been reported that HDAC inhibitors might induce cell cycle arrest in SW620 cells in dependence on the inhibitor concentration [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>We found that BOU induced cell cycle arrest in SW620 cells as well, suggesting that its inhibition of cancer cell growth might be mediated, at least in part, by arrest of the cell cycle progression caused by inhibition of HDAC of class I and/or II. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>According to the in silico docking analysis, BOU probably inhibits class I HDACs 1–3 due to favorable occupancy of an available “foot” pocket near the zinc binding place by its O-benzyl substituent (Figure 2B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) are used clinically to treat malignancies because of their effects on apoptosis or cell death activation through anti-inflammatory effects caused by acetylation of non-histone proteins [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>The effects of HDACi on inflammatory gene expression, however, may vary according to the cell type and the stimulus and might involve anti-inflammatory mechanisms such as down-regulation of IL-12, IL-1 and IL-6 [36] or induce a systemic pro-inflammatory effect [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Altered histone acetylation patterns have been reported in many cancers and HDACi may readily induce cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis although the exact cell death mechanism varies among different cells [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of BOU action might thus involve early oxidative stress, probably through induction of ROS, modulation of histone and non-histone acetylation pattern through inhibition of HDACs and cell death. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the in silico docking analysis showed that interaction with the “foot” pocket near the zinc binding place of HDACs was not possible for MHCU. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>This result was substantiated by the HDAC colorimetric assay kit results as well (Figure 2D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>HDAC assay demonstrated a stimulating activity of MHCU on the activity of HDAC enzymes. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, two amino acid HU derivatives, BOU and MHCU (Figure 1A), have similar phenotypic antiproliferative profiles [6] but elicit different biological response at the molecular level, as shown here by in vitro, in silico and in vivo analyses. In vitro, O-protected hydroxyurea derivative BOU showed somewhat stronger antiproliferative activity in comparison with N′-methyl-N′-hydroxy derivative MHCU on SW620 cells (Figure 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>The cell-death mechanism observed for both tested compounds involves induction of apoptosis and probably oxidative stress that causes DNA damage for BOU (Table S2) and anti-inflammatory mechanisms for MHCU (Table S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>The benzyl substituted and free hydroxyl group of HU of BOU and MHCU, respectively, may account for their different biological response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>This is illustrated by their inhibition of HDAC enzymes of classes I and II, as suggested by the in silico study and confirmed by in vitro testing (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>The observed HDAC inhibition activity of BOU points to the importance of occupying the “foot” pocket of class I HDAC enzymes and of hydrophobic interactions similarly to the case of benzamide inhibitors [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>BOU exerted a significant short-term antitumor effect in vivo on the colon cancer mouse model (Figure 3A), which was attributed to alteration of inflammatory proteins and early oxidative stress mechanisms (Table S2) combined with HDAC inhibition. </plain></SENT>
