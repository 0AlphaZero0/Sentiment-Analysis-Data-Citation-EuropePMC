</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Disc degenerative disease (DDD) is a common and frequently occurring orthopedic disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The main clinical manifestations are disc herniation, vertebral instability and spinal stenosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The intervertebral disc (IVD) is an immune-free organ that is completely closed, without vessels and nerves. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Its immune privilege provides a potential environment for treatment with gene therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, the etiology and pathophysiological mechanisms of DDD require further investigation (1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Gene therapy is a novel therapeutic strategy that is capable of consistently changing and affecting the physiological function of cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>It has received considerable attention in the field of biological therapy, and promising developments have been made in this area (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>With regard to gene therapy for DDDs, depending on use of the appropriate dose and on the treatment area in the body, gene therapy is capable of producing positive therapeutic effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, devastating side effects are likely to arise if the therapeutic gene is not correct, if leakage occurs when the therapeutic genes are injected or if the dose is inappropriate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Therefore, an important aspect of gene therapy is determining the correct target gene (3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Genes work in synergy with other genes to perform biological functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>They simultaneously interact with multiple genes and trigger a variety of changes that lead to diverse reactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The functional annotation of regulated genes, using Gene Ontology, has enabled the identification of severely affected groups of genes that correlate with the disease phenotypes (4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Genes involved in mutation of the IVD are enriched in the Gene Ontology terms ‘multicellular organism development’ and ‘pattern specification’ (5). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>A phenotype is the result of a series of complex molecular reactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>A protein interaction network embodies the complex interactions between genes (6–7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>An abundant and organized network of elastic fibers has been previously observed in the non-degenerated human disc using immunohistochemical staining (8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In addition, Yu et al(9) revealed that an abundant and organized network of elastic fibers was present in adolescent (12- and 17-year-olds) human IVDs, and suggested that the elastic fiber network had a significant biomechanical function (9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Trp2 and Trp3 allelic products have been incorporated into the cross-linked fibrillar network to study the process of developing human cartilage (10). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Once the disease-related genes have been identified, the active binding site may provide another perspective for the treatment of the DDD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>It has been demonstrated that the deletion of transforming growth factor β receptor 2 (Tgfβr2) in Col2a-expressing mouse tissue results in alterations in the development of the IVD annulus fibrosus (5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Based on the genes associated with the disease phenotype, drugs to repress these genes are screened. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The Connectivity Map (CMAP) database is a collection of genome-wide transcriptional expression data that have been obtained from cultured human cells treated with bioactive small molecules and simple pattern-matching algorithms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>These data enable the discovery of functional connections between drugs, genes and diseases through the transitory feature of common changes in gene expression (11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Yeh et al (12) screened drugs that targeted cancer stem cells (CSCs) to improve current treatment and overcome drug resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Gene signatures between embryonic and CSCs were used to identify potential drugs that were capable of reversing the gene expression profile of CSCs, based on CMAP. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>The Osprey platform (20) facilitates the study of protein-protein interaction networks and protein complexes by integrating the interaction information from the Biomolecular Interaction Network Database (21) and the General Repository for Interaction Datasets (22), which includes &gt;50,000 of the interactions. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>The proposed method provides basis for the identification of candidate targets for the clinical treatment of DDD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>It also facilitates clinical medication. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>The results revealed that the DEGs were associated with TGF-β and the extracellular matrix, which was the fourth most enriched term. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Degeneration of the IVD is predominantly a chronic process, involving the excessive destruction of the extracellular matrix (30). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>IVD degeneration has been demonstrated to be a progressive disease, mainly characterized by the alteration of the extracellular matrix composition (31). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Factors involved in these processes have been suggested to be important for the identification of target genes in degenerative discs (32). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>In the interaction network of the DEGs, MMP2 was shown to have the highest degree. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>The MMPs are a class of proteolytic enzymes containing zinc and calcium, which are predominantly involved in the metabolism of the extracellular matrix. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Roberts et al(33) suggested that MMPs were one of the primary factors leading to the disorder of the matrix structure and the degradation of the matrix in IVDs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>The expression of MMPs has been shown to be significantly increased in the degenerative IVD, disrupting the balance between the MMPs and their endogenous inhibitor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>In addition, it has been observed that MMPs are produced by IVD autologous cells and cells involved in invasive neovascularization in the IVDs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Therefore, Roberts et al(33) suggested that inhibiting the activity of MMPs may be an effective method of treating disc degeneration (33). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Based on the downregulated and upregulated genes, six small molecules, which were most relevant to the degenerative IVD, were screened out. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>Hexabrix (ioxaglate), the most significant negatively-associated small molecule, has been introduced as a novel low-osmolality contrast agent for lumbar epidural double-catheter venography (34). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>Cortisone, which has been predicted to cure DDD, has been shown to result in satisfactory remission of articular facets syndrome, leaving the patient free from pain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Epidural cortisone injections are able to efficiently and safely release anterior and anteroposterior fusion for lumbar disc pain (34). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Further studies on activity sites may aid the inhibition and promotion of the normal expression of DEGs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Zinc metalloproteinases exert particularly important effects, directly and indirectly through the promotion of neovascularization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>The zinc metalloproteinases closely interact with other metabolic factors to produce disc disorders (35). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Calcium has been used as an indicator of calcification potential in human IVD degeneration and scoliosis (36). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>At present, biological treatment must focus on the biological changes occurring in IVD degeneration, promote the synthesis of extracellular matrix and inhibit the reduction in levels of the extracellular matrix. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>In this manner, the metabolism of the extracellular matrix in the IVD is likely to return to normal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>The mechanism underlying IVD degeneration is complex and has been suggested to correlate with changes at the molecular level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>With an enhanced understanding of the disease from a molecular biology perspective, novel strategies are likely to emerge to prevent and treat degenerative IVDs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Although significant efforts have been committed to further elucidate the degenerative mechanism at the molecular and genetic levels, studies must be performed to evaluate the pathological roles of a number of factors and their interactions in the process of disc degeneration. </plain></SENT>
