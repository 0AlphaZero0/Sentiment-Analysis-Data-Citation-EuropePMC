The degradation of G392E neuroserpin results from SREBP-dependent activation of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway in cells that express polymers of neuroserpin (G392E). Inhibition of HMGCoA reductase, the limiting enzyme of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, reduced the ubiquitination of G392E neuroserpin in our cell lines and increased the retention of neuroserpin polymers in both HeLa cells and primary neurones. Our data reveal a reciprocal relationship between cholesterol biosynthesis and the clearance of mutant neuroserpin.

It is mainly synthesized and secreted from neurones of the central and peripheral nervous systems (<xref rid="DDT310C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="DDT310C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), but it has also been detected in the heart, kidney, spinal cord and testis (<xref rid="DDT310C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Neuroserpin is believed to inhibit tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) (<xref rid="DDT310C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) and plays an important role in physiological processes such as synaptic plasticity (<xref rid="DDT310C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="DDT310C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and memory (<xref rid="DDT310C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="DDT310C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders mediated by excitotoxicity, such as stroke (<xref rid="DDT310C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="DDT310C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="DDT310C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Through interaction with the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, neuroserpin may also mediate internalization of tPA complexes to regulate its proteolytic activity (<xref rid="DDT310C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Although mice engineered to lack expression of neuroserpin do not display altered tPA activity in the brain, they do exhibit altered emotional responses (<xref rid="DDT310C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>Mutations in neuroserpin underlie the autosomal dominant dementia familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies (FENIB) (<xref rid="DDT310C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="DDT310C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). This dementia is characterized by eosinophilic neuronal inclusions of neuroserpin (Collins bodies) within the deeper layers of the cerebral cortex and <italic>substantia nigra</italic>. Six mutations of neuroserpin have been identified in FENIB resulting in a spectrum of symptoms from dementia in middle age to severe epilepsy under the age of 10 years (<xref rid="DDT310C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The mutations (Ser49Pro, Leu47Pro, Ser52Arg, His338Arg, Gly392Arg and Gly392Glu) cluster in the shutter domain of neuroserpin and result in the formation of ordered polymers within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref rid="DDT310C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). They demonstrate a clear genotype&#8211;phenotype correlation, with mutations that cause more rapid polymerization of the protein causing earlier onset disease (<xref rid="DDT310C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). These inclusions cause disease both by gain-of-function toxicity and loss of function of an important protease inhibitor (<xref rid="DDT310C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). One of the striking features of FENIB is that the ER inclusions of mutant neuroserpin do not activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) (<xref rid="DDT310C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="DDT310C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="DDT310C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Instead, they appear to trigger NF-&#954;B signalling through release of calcium from the ER, which has been termed the &#8216;ER overload response&#8217; (EOR) (<xref rid="DDT310C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). However, before it can form polymers, the majority of mutant neuroserpin appears to be degraded predominantly by the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, although autophagy may also contribute to this (<xref rid="DDT310C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Many ERAD components are regulated as part of the UPR; however, how ERAD can be regulated in a disorder that does not cause ER stress is unknown.</p><p>We report here a critical role for HMGCoA reductase, the limiting enzyme of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, in the clearance of mutant neuroserpin from the ER. This pathway is upregulated in cells expressing polymers of neuroserpin. While the interrelationship between the UPR and sterol metabolism is well recognized, this represents the first description of a link between sterol metabolism and modulation of the proteotoxicity mediated by the EOR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Generation of a human cell model of FENIB</title><p>A human cell model of FENIB was developed by expressing neuroserpin under the control of the Tet-On promotor in HeLa cells. Clonal cell lines were generated that conditionally express either wild-type neuroserpin (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT310F1">1</xref>A), the naturally occurring G392E mutant that forms ordered polymers in association with FENIB (G392E cells) (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT310F1">1</xref>B) or a synthetic truncation, &#916; neuroserpin, lacking the C-terminal 132 amino acids (&#916; cells) that we have previously used as a positive control for ER stress (<xref rid="DDT310C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="DDT310C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT310F1">1</xref>C). In each cell line, doxycycline induced the expression of neuroserpin in a concentration-dependent manner as assessed by western blot analyses and ELISA (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT310F1">1</xref>). Treatment with doxycycline at 2 &#181;g/ml for 48 h was considered optimal, providing a useful dynamic range of neuroserpin expression. &#916; neuroserpin could be detected only by western blot analysis as the monoclonal antibodies used in the ELISA give little signal for the truncated protein. The ELISA detected either &#8216;total neuroserpin&#8217; with a pool of monoclonal antibodies [1A10, 10B8, 10G12 (<xref rid="DDT310C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>)] or polymers of G392E neuroserpin with the 7C6 antibody (<xref rid="DDT310C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Cells expressing wild-type neuroserpin stained positively for neuroserpin within the ER and Golgi apparatus, as is typical of a secretory protein, whereas G392E neuroserpin formed inclusion bodies of polymers within the ER that recapitulate the features of FENIB (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT310F2">2</xref>).

We decided to investigate the specific role of these ligases in the degradation of neuroserpin. By using a <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> model of FENIB, we confirmed the crucial role of these two E3 ligases in ERAD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddt310/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</ext-link>). Then, we tested the depletion of Hrd1 and gp78 in our cells. Silencing of <italic>Hrd1</italic> expression was achieved by transfection with siRNA. While this did not affect the level of wild-type neuroserpin as detected by western blot analysis (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT310F3">3</xref>A), there was a small but significant increase detected by ELISA (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT310F3">3</xref>C). In contrast, a control siRNA to <italic>neuroserpin</italic> abolished its expression in all cell lines (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT310F3">3</xref>A, B, E, G). The double band of immunoreactive neuroserpin observed intermittently in cells expressing wild-type protein (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT310F3">3</xref>A) is probably a degradation product as wild-type neuroserpin can be cleaved by proteases such as tPA. In cells expressing G392E neuroserpin, depletion of <italic>Hrd1</italic> resulted in a striking increase in the level of mutant neuroserpin within the cell, as seen by western blot analysis (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT310F3">3</xref>B) and ELISA against total neuroserpin (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT310F3">3</xref>D). This reflected an increase in polymerized neuroserpin as shown both by non-denaturing PAGE (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT310F3">3</xref>E) and polymer-specific ELISA (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT310F3">3</xref>F). A similar, albeit less pronounced, increase in neuroserpin was also observed in cells expressing &#916; neuroserpin (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT310F3">3</xref>G).

HeLa inducible cell lines were treated with 2 &#181;g/ml doxycycline and transfected or not with neuroserpin siRNA as a control of transfection, Hrd1 siRNA or a mock transfection for 2 days. The silencing of Hrd1 in wild-type cells does not affect the level of neuroserpin as seen by western blot analysis and densitometry (hatched histogram) (<bold>A</bold>) and has only a small effect when assessed by ELISA against total neuroserpin (<bold>C</bold>).

Western blot analysis of non-denaturing PAGE (<bold>E</bold>) and ELISA against polymers of neuroserpin (<bold>F</bold>) demonstrate that the increase in G392E neuroserpin is associated with an increase in polymers.

In contrast, the depletion of <italic>UBE2j1</italic> resulted in an increase in neuroserpin polymers in cells expressing G392E neuroserpin as observed by western blot analysis and by ELISA (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT310F5">5</xref>B and D). Silencing of <italic>UBE2g2</italic> resulted in an increase in neuroserpin levels (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT310F5">5</xref>D). Surprisingly, silencing of <italic>UBE2j2</italic> decreased the levels of neuroserpin polymers as determined either by western blot analysis or ELISA (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT310F5">5</xref>B and D).

None of the siRNA treatments affected cell viability or the level of ER chaperones (data not shown). To summarize, we observed the UBE2J1 ligase couple to be involved in the degradation of well-ordered polymers of neuroserpin, while the UBE2g2/gp78 ligase complex appears to be responsible for the degradation of misfolded &#916; neuroserpin.

This dementia is unusual as the ordered structure of neuroserpin polymers prevents an UPR (<xref rid="DDT310C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Instead, the accumulation of neuroserpin leads to an activation of the EOR (<xref rid="DDT310C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). This provides a model to evaluate the cellular consequences of the retention of ordered protein within cells.</p><p>After creating a cellular model to investigate FENIB, we identified the E3 and E2 ligases involved in neuroserpin degradation. This was performed with the use of a Drosophila model of FENIB that shown accumulation of G392E neuroserpin when E3 and E2 orthologues were knocked down. It is interesting to note that the CG5623 depletion (UBE2j1 and j2) did not show any accumulation while in HeLa cells UBE2j1 shows a clear effect. These discrepancies between insects and mammals are well characterized in the literature, for example p53 is only implicated in cell death in flies while in mammals it has a role in the control of both cell death and cell cycle regulation (<xref rid="DDT310C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). While a previous study has found the E3 ligases gp78 and hrd1 to be involved in neuroserpin degradation (<xref rid="DDT310C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), we identified differences in the specificity of these proteins. Gp78, and its partner E2 ligase UBE2g2, target unfolded, truncated forms of neuroserpin, while hrd1 and UBE2j1 target ordered polymers of neuroserpin for degradation by ERAD. Hrd1 (<xref rid="DDT310C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="DDT310C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) and gp78 (<xref rid="DDT310C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) have also been well-characterized in the degradation process of mutant alpha-1-antitrypsin and many other misfolded proteins (<xref rid="DDT310C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="DDT310C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p><p>Microarray analysis, and subsequent quantitative PCR, revealed that the expression of ordered polymers was associated with an activation of the sterol biosynthesis pathway. Previous studies have shown an interaction between ERAD and cholesterol biosynthetic pathway (<xref rid="DDT310C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="DDT310C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). HMGCoA reductase, the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, can interact with the E3 ligase gp78 (<xref rid="DDT310C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) to mediate its sterol-accelerated degradation. Moreover, <italic>in vitro</italic> work has demonstrated that Hrd1 is involved in the dislocation and the degradation of HMGCoA reductase (<xref rid="DDT310C41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). From our experiments, we believe that accumulation of mutant neuroserpin leads to the activation of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. However, only inhibition of HMGCoA reductase and not other enzymes on this pathway increases the retention of mutant neuroserpin; HMGCoA reductase is the rate limiting enzyme of the pathway and so it is likely that accumulation of mutant neuroserpin increases HMGCoA reductase, and hence upregulates the whole pathway.</p><p>An interaction between the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway and ERAD has previously been observed in another neurological disease. In patients with Gaucher's disease, the level of intracellular cholesterol appears to modify the degradation of glucocerebrosidase by influencing ERAD (<xref rid="DDT310C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>); a reduced level of cholesterol biosynthesis leading to less glucocerebrosidase entering the ERAD pathway. Similarly, in the case of neuroserpin, we found that inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis also reduced degradation of the pathogenic target protein. Importantly, however, whereas the activation of ERAD by misfolding glucocerebrosidase may involve ER stress (<xref rid="DDT310C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), this is absent during the accumulation of neuroserpin polymers indicating that a sterol-independent mechanism can mediate this response.</p><p>Taken together, these experiments reveal a reciprocal relationship between cholesterol biosynthesis and the clearance of mutant neuroserpin. The accumulation of intracellular polymers of neuroserpin leads to the induction of genes involved in cholesterol synthesis, while inhibition of sterol biosynthesis impairs the ubiquitination of mutant neuroserpin and thus causes its accumulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Reagents</title><p>Unless stated otherwise, reagents, buffers, culture media and serum for cell cultures were from Sigma-Aldrich Co (Dorset, UK).

Gene Set Enrichment analysis uses <italic>a priori</italic> defined gene sets to determine pathway differences between two phenotypic states. Gene expression data are therefore evaluated at the pathway level rather than the single gene. Gene Set Enrichment analysis first ranks the genes according to their relative difference in gene expression. The ranked list is then compared with gene sets (pathways) and an enrichment score (ES) is calculated for each gene. When a gene is present in the gene set of interest, the running ES is increased. If the gene is absent the running ES is decreased. The enrichment statistic is the maximum deviation of the running ES from zero. Statistical significance is assessed by performing a permutation test procedure. To account for the differences in gene set size, a normalized ES is calculated. Estimated significance levels are also adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing. FDR is the estimated probability that a gene set with a given enrichment statistic represents a false-positive finding.
