</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neuroserpin is a member of the SERPIN super family of serine protease inhibitors (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is mainly synthesized and secreted from neurones of the central and peripheral nervous systems (2,3), but it has also been detected in the heart, kidney, spinal cord and testis (3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Neuroserpin is believed to inhibit tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) (4) and plays an important role in physiological processes such as synaptic plasticity (2,5) and memory (6,7) and in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders mediated by excitotoxicity, such as stroke (2,8–11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Through interaction with the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, neuroserpin may also mediate internalization of tPA complexes to regulate its proteolytic activity (12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Although mice engineered to lack expression of neuroserpin do not display altered tPA activity in the brain, they do exhibit altered emotional responses (13). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Mutations in neuroserpin underlie the autosomal dominant dementia familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies (FENIB) (14–16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This dementia is characterized by eosinophilic neuronal inclusions of neuroserpin (Collins bodies) within the deeper layers of the cerebral cortex and substantia nigra. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Six mutations of neuroserpin have been identified in FENIB resulting in a spectrum of symptoms from dementia in middle age to severe epilepsy under the age of 10 years (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The mutations (Ser49Pro, Leu47Pro, Ser52Arg, His338Arg, Gly392Arg and Gly392Glu) cluster in the shutter domain of neuroserpin and result in the formation of ordered polymers within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>They demonstrate a clear genotype–phenotype correlation, with mutations that cause more rapid polymerization of the protein causing earlier onset disease (18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>These inclusions cause disease both by gain-of-function toxicity and loss of function of an important protease inhibitor (18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>One of the striking features of FENIB is that the ER inclusions of mutant neuroserpin do not activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) (8,19,20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Instead, they appear to trigger NF-κB signalling through release of calcium from the ER, which has been termed the ‘ER overload response’ (EOR) (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>However, before it can form polymers, the majority of mutant neuroserpin appears to be degraded predominantly by the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, although autophagy may also contribute to this (20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Many ERAD components are regulated as part of the UPR; however, how ERAD can be regulated in a disorder that does not cause ER stress is unknown. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>We report here a critical role for HMGCoA reductase, the limiting enzyme of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, in the clearance of mutant neuroserpin from the ER. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>This pathway is upregulated in cells expressing polymers of neuroserpin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>While the interrelationship between the UPR and sterol metabolism is well recognized, this represents the first description of a link between sterol metabolism and modulation of the proteotoxicity mediated by the EOR. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>A human cell model of FENIB was developed by expressing neuroserpin under the control of the Tet-On promotor in HeLa cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Clonal cell lines were generated that conditionally express either wild-type neuroserpin (Fig. 1A), the naturally occurring G392E mutant that forms ordered polymers in association with FENIB (G392E cells) (Fig. 1B) or a synthetic truncation, Δ neuroserpin, lacking the C-terminal 132 amino acids (Δ cells) that we have previously used as a positive control for ER stress (19,20) (Fig. 1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In each cell line, doxycycline induced the expression of neuroserpin in a concentration-dependent manner as assessed by western blot analyses and ELISA (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Treatment with doxycycline at 2 µg/ml for 48 h was considered optimal, providing a useful dynamic range of neuroserpin expression. Δ neuroserpin could be detected only by western blot analysis as the monoclonal antibodies used in the ELISA give little signal for the truncated protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The ELISA detected either ‘total neuroserpin’ with a pool of monoclonal antibodies [1A10, 10B8, 10G12 (18)] or polymers of G392E neuroserpin with the 7C6 antibody (18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Cells expressing wild-type neuroserpin stained positively for neuroserpin within the ER and Golgi apparatus, as is typical of a secretory protein, whereas G392E neuroserpin formed inclusion bodies of polymers within the ER that recapitulate the features of FENIB (Fig. 2).

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The E3 ligases Hrd1 and gp78 have been implicated in the degradation of various serpins including Alpha-1-antitrypsin (21) and neuroserpin (22). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>We decided to investigate the specific role of these ligases in the degradation of neuroserpin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>By using a Drosophila melanogaster model of FENIB, we confirmed the crucial role of these two E3 ligases in ERAD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddt310/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Then, we tested the depletion of Hrd1 and gp78 in our cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Silencing of Hrd1 expression was achieved by transfection with siRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>While this did not affect the level of wild-type neuroserpin as detected by western blot analysis (Fig. 3A), there was a small but significant increase detected by ELISA (Fig. 3C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a control siRNA to neuroserpin abolished its expression in all cell lines (Fig. 3A, B, E, G). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The double band of immunoreactive neuroserpin observed intermittently in cells expressing wild-type protein (Fig. 3A) is probably a degradation product as wild-type neuroserpin can be cleaved by proteases such as tPA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>In cells expressing G392E neuroserpin, depletion of Hrd1 resulted in a striking increase in the level of mutant neuroserpin within the cell, as seen by western blot analysis (Fig. 3B) and ELISA against total neuroserpin (Fig. 3D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>This reflected an increase in polymerized neuroserpin as shown both by non-denaturing PAGE (Fig. 3E) and polymer-specific ELISA (Fig. 3F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>A similar, albeit less pronounced, increase in neuroserpin was also observed in cells expressing Δ neuroserpin (Fig. 3G). Figure 3.Effect of the knockdown of ubiquitin-E3 ligase Hrd1 on neuroserpin levels in HeLa cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>HeLa inducible cell lines were treated with 2 µg/ml doxycycline and transfected or not with neuroserpin siRNA as a control of transfection, Hrd1 siRNA or a mock transfection for 2 days. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>The silencing of Hrd1 in wild-type cells does not affect the level of neuroserpin as seen by western blot analysis and densitometry (hatched histogram) (A) and has only a small effect when assessed by ELISA against total neuroserpin (C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Mock transfection does not affect the level of neuroserpin, while siRNA targeting neuroserpin abolishes its expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The level of neuroserpin increases when Hrd1 is silenced in cells expressing G392E neuroserpin, as shown by western blot analysis and associated densitometries (hatched histogram) (B) or by ELISA against total neuroserpin (D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis of non-denaturing PAGE (E) and ELISA against polymers of neuroserpin (F) demonstrate that the increase in G392E neuroserpin is associated with an increase in polymers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>The truncated protein Δ neuroserpin also accumulates in cells when Hrd1 is silenced, but at a lower level when compared with G392E neuroserpin (G). n = 4 independent repeats for each cell line. *P &lt; 0.05; **P &lt; 0.005. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Knock down of gp78 had no effect on the expression of wild-type neuroserpin when assessed either by western blot analysis (Fig. 4A) or ELISA for total neuroserpin (Fig. 4C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>In contrast, depletion of gp78 increased the level of polymers in cells expressing G392E neuroserpin when assessed by ELISA without affecting the total level of neuroserpin (Fig. 4B and D–F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Finally, knock down of gp78 markedly increased the level of truncated Δ neuroserpin (Fig. 4G). Figure 4.Effect of the knockdown of the ubiquitin-E3 ligase gp78 on neuroserpin in HeLa cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>HeLa inducible cell lines were treated with 2 µg/ml doxycycline and transfected or not with gp78 siRNA for 2 days. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>There was no change in the amount of wild-type neuroserpin when assessed by western blot analysis and associated densitometry (hatched histogram) (A) or by ELISA against total neuroserpin (C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>A small increase in G392E neuroserpin was seen when gp78 was silenced as assessed by western blot analysis and associated densitometry (hatched histogram) (B), but this increase was not statically different when assessed by ELISA against total neuroserpin (D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>However, there was a statistically significant increase in G392E neuroserpin polymers when measured by ELISA (E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis of non-denaturing PAGE also shows a small increase in polymers when gp78 is silenced (F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Silencing of gp78 in cells expressing Δ neuroserpin resulted in a dramatic increase in protein accumulation as shown by western blot analysis and associated densitometry (G). n = 4 independent repeats for each cell line. *P &lt; 0.05 ; **P &lt; 0.005. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Hrd1 and gp78 knock down were processed on the same ELISA plates, allowing a direct comparison. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>From our data (western blot analysis and ELISA), we concluded that Hrd1 plays an important role in the degradation of G392E polymeric neuroserpin, while gp78 is preferentially involved in the degradation of misfolded Δ neuroserpin despite a role for both of them in the degradation of polymerogenic and truncated neuroserpin. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>The Drosophila melanogaster model also suggested the involvement of the E2 ligase UBE2j1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddt310/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>To test this in a mammalian system, we depleted our cells of UBE2j1, the E2 ubiquitin ligase of Hrd1, and UBE2g2, the E2 ligase of gp78 (23–25). UBE2j2, an E2 ligase that interacts with the E3 ligase mK3 (26), served as a control. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Depletion of UBE2j1, UBE2j2 or UBE2g2 did not affect the level of wild-type neuroserpin as assessed by western blot analysis or ELISA for total neuroserpin (Fig. 5A and C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the depletion of UBE2j1 resulted in an increase in neuroserpin polymers in cells expressing G392E neuroserpin as observed by western blot analysis and by ELISA (Fig. 5B and D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Silencing of UBE2g2 resulted in an increase in neuroserpin levels (Fig. 5D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, silencing of UBE2j2 decreased the levels of neuroserpin polymers as determined either by western blot analysis or ELISA (Fig. 5B and D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Silencing of either UBE2j1 or UBE2j2 increased levels of Δ neuroserpin, whereas the depletion of UBE2j2 had no effect (Fig. 5E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>None of the siRNA treatments affected cell viability or the level of ER chaperones (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>To summarize, we observed the UBE2J1 ligase couple to be involved in the degradation of well-ordered polymers of neuroserpin, while the UBE2g2/gp78 ligase complex appears to be responsible for the degradation of misfolded Δ neuroserpin.

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Mutants of neuroserpin are retained within the ER of neurones to cause the inclusion body dementia FENIB. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>This dementia is unusual as the ordered structure of neuroserpin polymers prevents an UPR (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Instead, the accumulation of neuroserpin leads to an activation of the EOR (20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>This provides a model to evaluate the cellular consequences of the retention of ordered protein within cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>After creating a cellular model to investigate FENIB, we identified the E3 and E2 ligases involved in neuroserpin degradation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>This was performed with the use of a Drosophila model of FENIB that shown accumulation of G392E neuroserpin when E3 and E2 orthologues were knocked down. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>It is interesting to note that the CG5623 depletion (UBE2j1 and j2) did not show any accumulation while in HeLa cells UBE2j1 shows a clear effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>These discrepancies between insects and mammals are well characterized in the literature, for example p53 is only implicated in cell death in flies while in mammals it has a role in the control of both cell death and cell cycle regulation (33). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>While a previous study has found the E3 ligases gp78 and hrd1 to be involved in neuroserpin degradation (22), we identified differences in the specificity of these proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Gp78, and its partner E2 ligase UBE2g2, target unfolded, truncated forms of neuroserpin, while hrd1 and UBE2j1 target ordered polymers of neuroserpin for degradation by ERAD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Hrd1 (21,34) and gp78 (35) have also been well-characterized in the degradation process of mutant alpha-1-antitrypsin and many other misfolded proteins (36,37). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Microarray analysis, and subsequent quantitative PCR, revealed that the expression of ordered polymers was associated with an activation of the sterol biosynthesis pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown an interaction between ERAD and cholesterol biosynthetic pathway (38–40). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>HMGCoA reductase, the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, can interact with the E3 ligase gp78 (28) to mediate its sterol-accelerated degradation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in vitro work has demonstrated that Hrd1 is involved in the dislocation and the degradation of HMGCoA reductase (41). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>From our experiments, we believe that accumulation of mutant neuroserpin leads to the activation of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>However, only inhibition of HMGCoA reductase and not other enzymes on this pathway increases the retention of mutant neuroserpin; HMGCoA reductase is the rate limiting enzyme of the pathway and so it is likely that accumulation of mutant neuroserpin increases HMGCoA reductase, and hence upregulates the whole pathway. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>An interaction between the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway and ERAD has previously been observed in another neurological disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>In patients with Gaucher's disease, the level of intracellular cholesterol appears to modify the degradation of glucocerebrosidase by influencing ERAD (29); a reduced level of cholesterol biosynthesis leading to less glucocerebrosidase entering the ERAD pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in the case of neuroserpin, we found that inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis also reduced degradation of the pathogenic target protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Importantly, however, whereas the activation of ERAD by misfolding glucocerebrosidase may involve ER stress (19), this is absent during the accumulation of neuroserpin polymers indicating that a sterol-independent mechanism can mediate this response. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these experiments reveal a reciprocal relationship between cholesterol biosynthesis and the clearance of mutant neuroserpin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>The accumulation of intracellular polymers of neuroserpin leads to the induction of genes involved in cholesterol synthesis, while inhibition of sterol biosynthesis impairs the ubiquitination of mutant neuroserpin and thus causes its accumulation. </plain></SENT>
