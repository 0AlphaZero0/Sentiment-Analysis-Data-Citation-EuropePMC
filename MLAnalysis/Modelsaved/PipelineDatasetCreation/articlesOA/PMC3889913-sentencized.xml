</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Aging is a complex physiological process that poses many problems and conundrums for rapidly aging societies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>For example, the risk of dying from cardiovascular diseases and/or cancer steadily declines for people after their 60s, and in seniors older than 80 years of age, other causes of death are predominant (de los Campos et al. 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Thus, diagnoses and research in which heart disease and cancer are the focus are ineffectual for half of the patients older than 80 years, and physiological aging raises many unanswered questions, particularly with regard to changing metabolic patterns. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Urine proteomics has become a non-invasive, reproducible, and easy-to-frequent repetition diagnostic method. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In this study, we show that there are urine proteome changes with age in healthy humans and that this may be useful for understanding certain pathogenic processes in aging. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This investigation was based on the following considerations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="Sec2"><title><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Fluid biopsy </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Urine proteome analysis is a rapidly developing analytical tool that is aimed at establishing new, non-invasive “fluid biopsy” diagnostic methods for renal and urinary tract diseases (Tyan et al. 2006; Varghese et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Although this methodology is still in its infancy, knowledge on urine proteomes in health and disease is growing rapidly due to advancements in instrumentation, data analysis techniques, and the relative ease of acquiring clinically relevant samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Thus, urinary proteome analysis is the subject of a rapidly growing number of studies, and this topic is often reviewed (Pisitkun et al. 2006). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Numerous potential markers for different pathologies, not only for the kidney, but also for the urinary tract, vascular system, and other organs, have been found (van Eyk and Dunn 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>For example, the urine proteomes of small cohorts of patients studied by capillary electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry have established potential markers for ADPKD (Pavik et al. 2012; Kistler et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The first urine proteomic study was done in 1979 using 2-D PAGE electrophoresis (Anderson et al. 1979). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Later, numerous hybrid techniques were used for different diseases (including uronephrological cases), such as MALDI-TOF, SELDI-TOF, CE–MS/MS, and LC–ESI-TOF-MS/M (M'Koma et al. 2007; Mosley et al. 2006; Tyan et al. 2006; Julian et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Depending on the methodology used, the number of detected proteins can vary greatly from 200 to 2,500 (Pisitkun et al. 2006; Weissinger et al. 2004; Barratt and Topham 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Thus, urine proteomics may provide a more “global view” of underlying physiological processes that are not necessarily disease specific. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Consequences of aging in general </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Aging influences many biological processes (vB Hjelmborg et al. 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Changes in these processes are directed by several guiding physiologic principles: diminished flexibility (Lipsitz and Goldberger 1992), as manifested for example by less variable heart rate responses; changes in circadian patterns (Veldhuis 1997); and a loss of physiologic reserves required to cope with challenges to homeostasis (Cowdry 1942). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>While the progression of certain biological changes is linear over time, such as graying of hair, reduced skin elasticity, and vascular aging, other biological variables, such as lung capacity and sensory and cognitive functions, do not always correlate with chronological age (Bulpitt et al. 1994). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Aging changes progress in a non-uniform manner, and organs age at different rates and are influenced by many factors, including genetics, lifestyle, environmental factors, and a general loss of functional reserves (vB Hjelmborg et al. 2006). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In the elderly, these progressive changes result in increased susceptibility to numerous diseases (Martin and Sheaff 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>For example, with age, the renal mass tends to become smaller and function declines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The older kidney is more prone to nephrotoxicity related to medications (Michel and Kelly 1998) or application of intravenous contrast dye (Rich and Crecelius 1990). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>However, much of the research on age-related changes in humans has focused on particular disease processes, in which processes are often quite complex (e.g., cardiovascular disease, immunological disorders) and are affected by numerous factors wholly unrelated to human aging. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Thus, more investigations are needed on “normal aging” in humans to determine which physiological processes are most affected by this natural chronological phenomenon. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Currently, more and more studies are using urinary proteome analysis applied to clinical research. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The results have often been distant from what was expected, probably due to the presence of proteins/peptides whose levels change significantly with aging. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>More basic research on the effects of factors unrelated to disease, such as aging, on urine proteomes may aid in selecting control groups for clinical trials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>More importantly, a more global view of urine proteome changes with human aging may highlight previously unexpected physiological changes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Thus, we investigated if urine proteomes changed significantly in healthy elderly people and if these would highlight metabolic processes that weakened or strengthened in aging humans. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>LC–MS proteomic analyses of urine samples used a LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) coupled with a nanoACQUITY (Waters Corporation) LC system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Spectrometer parameters were as follows: polarity mode, positive; and capillary voltage, 1.5 kV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>A sample was first applied to the nanoACQUITY UPLC Trapping Column (Waters) using water containing 0.1 % formic acid as the mobile phase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Next, the peptide mixture was transferred to the nanoACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 Column (Waters, 75-μm inner diameter; 250-mm long) using an acetonitrile gradient (5–35 % acetonitrile over 160 min) in the presence of 0.1 % formic acid with a flow rate of 250 nl/min and eluted directly to the ion source of the mass spectrometer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Each LC run was preceded by a blank run to ensure that there was no carry-over of material from the previous analysis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Qualitative analyses (i.e., peptide and protein identification) used pooled urine samples in data-dependent MS-to-MS/MS acquisition mode. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Collision-induced dissociation was used, and up to five MS/MS processes were allowed for each MS scan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>To increase the numbers of peptide identifications, three LC–MS/MS runs were performed per pooled sample, with each covering one of three m/z value ranges: 300–600, 500–900, and 800–2,000. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>The acquired MS/MS raw data files were processed to produce peak lists with Mascot Distiller software (version 2.2.1, Matrix Science). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>The resulting ion lists were searched using the Mascot search engine (version 2.2.03, Matrix Science) against a database comprising all human protein entries from the SwissProt database (20,273 sequences) and their reversed versions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>The search parameters were as follows: enzyme specificity, semitrypsin; fixed modification, carbamidomethylation (C); variable modifications, oxidation (M) and carbamidomethylation (K); and protein mass, unrestricted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>The peptide and fragment ion mass tolerances (6 ppm and 0.4 Da, respectively) were established separately for individual LC–MS/MS runs using a procedure involving two database searches separated by a mass measurement error recalibration step, as previously described in Mikula et al.

<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>The statistical significance of peptide identifications was assessed using a joined target/decoy database search approach and a procedure that provided q-value estimates for each peptide spectrum match (PSMs) in the data set (Mikula et al. 2010; Käll et al. 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Only PSMs with q-values of ≤0.01 and proteins represented by at least two peptides were regarded as confidently identified. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Peptide identifications from all LC–MS/MS runs were merged into a common list, which was next overlaid onto 2-D maps generated from the LC–MS profile data of individual samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>A more detailed description of the feature extraction procedure was previously reported (Bakun et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Briefly, the list of identified peptides was used to tag the corresponding peptide-related ion spectra based on m/z differences, deviations from the predicted elution times, and the match between the theoretical and observed isotopic envelopes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>The maximum deviation accepted in m/z and retention time were established separately for each of the processed LC–MS spectra, in order to take into account possible variations in mass measurement accuracy and chromatographic separation between runs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>First, an initial search with wide tolerances (±25 ppm and ±10 min, respectively, for m/z and RT) and restrictive parameters of isotopic envelope fits (at least four peaks detected, coefficient of determination ≥ 0.95) was performed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Next, non-linear mass and time calibration function were calculated using locally weighted regression smoother (LOESS), and the search was repeated with narrowed tolerances and relaxed fit requirements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>The mean values of the estimated tolerances in this study were equal to ±17 ppm and ±6 min. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Finally, the relative abundances of peptide ions were determined as the heights of 2-D fits to the most prominent peaks of the tagged isotopic envelopes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>After the quantitative feature extraction step, a filter was applied to the data set to remove peptide ions with missing values in &gt;20 % of the samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>To avoid removing strictly differential peptides (i.e., detected or missing only in one of the studied groups of samples), a χ2 statistic was used to assess significant inequalities in the distribution of missing values in the groups of samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Next, a modified k-nearest neighbors procedure was used to impute the remaining missing values. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>The applied modifications included the use of variable-size neighborhoods and correlation-based metrics rather than Euclidean distances. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>To minimize the effects of non-biological sources of variation, log-transformed peptide abundances were normalized by fitting a robust LOESS between individual samples and a median pseudo-sample. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>The parameters for the fit were established using a set of features that exhibited low variance in the non-normalized data and then applied to the whole data set. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Finally, the normalized peptide-level data were rolled up to relative protein abundances. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Of them, 22 proteins were differentially expressed in the urine proteome of the youngest group compared with that of the oldest group, and 9 proteins were differentially expressed in the intermediate age group compared with the oldest group. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>The profiles of the proteins that differed in the elderly included those involved in tissue remodeling processes, increased likelihood of coagulation and fibrinolysis, low-grade inflammation, and immune and metabolic dysregulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>These changes are in keeping with the observed increases in incidence with age of cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, and metabolic disorders. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>They are also in line with current understanding of the pathophysiology of tissue remodeling, prothrombotic status, and the occurrence of low-grade inflammation in the elderly (Meyer et al. 1998) and age-associated dysregulation of immune system function (Yao et al. 2011) and autoimmune disease. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Our major findings come under the following broad categories. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="Sec17"><title><text><SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Tissue remodeling </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>We found increased expression of peptidase inhibitor 16 (PI16) in the urine proteome in our group of clinically healthy elderly people who were free of chronic diseases, current infections, inflammatory disorders, and malignancies as compared to the youngest and intermediate age groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>These elderly people also had reduced expressions of EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 2 and secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>These changes are consistent with current understanding of the mechanisms of aging tissues, particularly in the context of cardiovascular tissue aging (Chen and Frangogiannis 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Physiologically, about one third of the cells in the myocardium comprise contractile tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>The remaining tissue comprises connective tissue components, including fibroblasts and extracellular matrix proteins, such as collagen types I and III, elastin, and fibronectin (Lindsey et al. 2005). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>It is thought that the disproportionate increase in the volume of non-contractile cells (predominantly fibroblasts) and an increased accumulation of collagen that is modified both in the intercellular and perivascular spaces may be responsible for ventricular dysfunction and disturbances in coronary hemodynamics (Weber 1989). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>These are characterized by an increase in extracellular matrix proteins in the components of connective tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Under physiological conditions, the metabolism of extracellular matrix proteins and collagen contents is stable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>However, with arterial hypertension and the aging process, an imbalance occurs between collagen synthesis and degradation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>With high blood pressure, there is an increase in both the synthesis and degradation of extracellular matrix components, with an emphasis on synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>In contrast, during the course of aging, these two activities are reduced, particularly with regard to protein degradation, which also leads to a reduced susceptibility of cardiovascular structures to injury and myocardial fibrosis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>These processes depend on the metabolic levels of cytokines and growth factors, including PDGF and VEGF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>These are important for proper wound healing and regulate tissue regeneration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>SPARC is a PDGF and VEGF antagonist that reduces their mitogenic activities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>A SPARC deficiency may be the cause of the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins, inadequate regulation of healing along with subsequent fibrosis, and reduced tissue susceptibility (Jørgensen et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Also, reduced amounts of EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 2, which is necessary for the proper incorporation of elastin into extracellular matrix, may be a factor in old age for weakening blood vessels and skin connective tissues (cutis laxa) and result in greater tissue elasticity, which includes more collagen converted to elastin (Dasouki et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>These processes may also be dependent on protease inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>One of these is protease inhibitor 16 (PI16); the expression of which increased in our oldest group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>In animal studies, increased PI 16 expression was associated with cardiac hypertrophy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>PI16 is rapidly secreted following stimulation by serum in primary cardiomyocytes in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>In vivo, transgenic mice that overexpress PI16 in cardiomyocytes show normal heart function but have smaller hearts with hypotrophic cardiomyocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>PI16 expression is enhanced in the hypertrophic and failing heart and suppresses cardiomyocyte growth (Frost and Engelhardt 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>PI16 is a putative serine protease inhibitor that may also be used as a marker following prostatectomy for prostate cancer (Reeves et al. 2006). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Our finding of reduced plasminogen expression in the urine of elderly people is in line with the reported decreases in the concentrations of plasminogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor in the blood of elderly people (Tait et al. 1992). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon can be explained by both a decrease in plasminogen activator inhibitor concentrations and an increased prothrombotic tendency in old age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Plasminogen is a major protein of the fibrinolytic system and has a high molecular weight. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Its relatively high concentrations in serum and its long half-life would not support its role as regulating factor of fibrinolysis (Kołodziejczyk and Wachowicz 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>These characteristics may qualify plasminogen as an aging marker as opposed to a plasminogen activator inhibitor, whose concentrations and half-life are low. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Proteins that could distinguish older people also have roles in inflammatory processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Features of low-grade inflammation are found as a trait of aging in lung tissue (Meyer et al. 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>The urine proteome of older people significantly differed from that of younger people for proteins that included alpha 1 acidic glycoprotein 1 and alpha 1 acidic glycoprotein 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>These belong to acute phase proteins, and their expression was increased. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 5 is probably an important anti-inflammatory agent that protects mucous membranes and defends against the invasion of microorganisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>It also maintains the structure and function of the skin by regulating the activity of proteases that are responsible for the actions of defense and desquamation-involved proteases (Jayakumar et al. 2005; Deraison et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Its reduced levels may be indicative of subclinical inflammation in old age, as described for lung tissue (Meyer et al. 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>This is in line with lower SPARC expression accompanied by a pro-fibrotic cytokine profile (Jørgensen et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Changes in the urinary proteome of the elderly may also reflect immune system disturbances. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>We found increased expression of IgA-1 chain C region in the proteome of older people compared to younger people and reduced IgG-3 chain C region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>IgA is the major immunoglobulin class that is secreted into body fluids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>IgA has a dual role of combating local infections and preventing foreign antigens' access to the general immune system (Corthésy 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>IgG antibodies are the primary humoral defense mechanism in the context of acquired immunity (Senatorski and Hryniewiecka 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>IgG binds antigens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>This could be of importance, for example, in the direct neutralization of bacterial toxins or preventing virus penetration into cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>IgG3 activates the complement cascade, which supports the humoral arm of innate immunity (Quintana et al. 2008). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Another protein with reduced expression in the elderly belonged to the immunoglobulin superfamily leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 1, also known as CD305 or LAIR1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>This is found on peripheral mononuclear cells, such as T cells, NK cells, and B cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>As an inhibitor, it can regulate immune responses and prevent against the lysis of cells identified as self (Meyaard 2008). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Abnormal cell activation underlies autoimmune diseases (Tsukumo and Yasutomo 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>One reason for systemic lupus is the presence of antinuclear autoantibodies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Their production may result from overexposure to nucleosomal antigens (dsDNA, native DNA). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>One hypothesis involves the reduced clearance of nucleosomal antigens and their accumulation in old age concomitant with a reduced activity of deoxyribonuclease-1 in the blood, which is consistent with our research that demonstrated reduced expression of DNase-1 in the urine proteome of the elderly (Lachmann 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>This also correlates with an increased incidence of systemic lupus erythematosus after 55 years of age. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title><text><SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Proteins with multidirectional effects </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Another protein with reduced expression in the elderly is osteopontin (OPN), also known as bone sialoprotein I (Wang and Denhardt 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>OPN plays an important role in bone remodeling as it anchors osteoclasts to the bone mineral matrix, which promotes the development of osteoclasts' corrugated surfaces that generate a low pH environment and locally initiate bone resorption. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>OPN in urine prevents the formation of urinary tract deposits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>OPN also has immunological functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>By binding to receptors on lymphocytes, α4β1, α9β1, and α9β4, it affects the adhesion, migration, and survival of cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>A diverse range of these receptors' expression is found on macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and T and B cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>As an immunomodulating agent, OPN has chemotactic properties for enhancing the recruitment of inflammatory cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>In animal experiments, inflammation is observed with prolonged persistence of macrophage clusters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>OPN acts as an adhesion protein, which promotes cell adhesion and healing processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>In addition, OPN mediates cell activation and cytokine production and is a regulator of cellular apoptosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>It has effects similar to IL-10, a Th2 cytokine that exacerbates Th1 cell responses, and indirectly leads to increased production of antibodies by B lymphocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Thus, OPN plays a role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, AIH), cancer (lung, breast, colorectal cancers), and inflammatory diseases (glomerulonephritides, interstitial renal diseases, plaque formation) (Tachibana et al. 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Reduced OPN expression in older people could intensify allergy and atopic phenomena, as well as mitigate the course of autoimmune diseases, which is consistent with clinical observations (Jamroz-Wiśniewska et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Attractin (dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DP-IV)/CD26-like molecule) is a serine protease that has four copies of an EGF-like repeat motif and a C-type lectin domain and is involved in multiple intercellular communications and apoptosis, and regulates the effects of other cytokines and signaling molecules, including RANTES (Oravecz et al. 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>It also inhibits TGF-β, thus contributing to extracellular matrix turnover, fibrosis, wound healing and tissue repair (Waller and Nicholson 2001), cell growth and proliferation, and anti-inflammatory properties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>TGF-β also plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of fibrotic diseases of the kidney, liver, and lung, as well as atherosclerosis, artery remodeling in hypertension and diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer (Harris et al. 2007; Zegarska et al. 2006; Jain et al. 2000; Reinhold et al. 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Decreased DP-IV expression in the urinary proteome may explain the lack of TGF-β inhibition and indicate a role for DP-IV and TGF-β in the pathogenesis of aging and may explain its reduced ability to regulate the immune system as well as increased susceptibility to type 2 diabetes seen in the elderly (Laudes et al. 2010). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Secretogranin-1 (chromogranin B, secretoneurin) is a neuroendocrine protein involved in the formation of secretory granules in the pituitary, adrenal medulla, and hypothalamus (Natori et al. 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>It also has chemotactic properties for monocytes, eosinophils (strength comparable to IL8), and endothelial cells. </plain></SENT>
