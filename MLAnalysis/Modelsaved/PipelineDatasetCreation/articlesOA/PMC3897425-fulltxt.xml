The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies provides an opportunity to revolutionize the discovery of CNVs and to explore their relationship with diseases.

In this study, using low coverage whole-genome sequencing (LCS) we have developed an effective population-scale CNV calling (PSCC) method.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>In our novel method, two-step correction was used to remove biases caused by local GC content and complex genomic characteristics. We chose a binary segmentation method to locate CNV segments and designed combined statistics tests to ensure the stable performance of the false positive control. The simulation data showed that our PSCC method could achieve 99.7%/100% and 98.6%/100% sensitivity and specificity for over 300 kb CNV calling in the condition of LCS (&#8764;2&#215;) and ultra LCS (&#8764;0.2&#215;), respectively. Finally, we applied this novel method to analyze 34 clinical samples with an average of 2&#215; LCS. In the final results, all the 31 pathogenic CNVs identified by aCGH were successfully detected. In addition, the performance comparison revealed that our method had significant advantages over existing methods using ultra LCS.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Our study showed that PSCC can sensitively and reliably detect CNVs using low coverage or even ultra-low coverage data through population-scale sequencing.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by Key Laboratory Project in Shenzhen (CXB200903110066A and CXB201108250096A).

CNVs contain duplication, deletion and multiallelic variation events of genetic material 1 kb or larger in size, and might have functional impact through gene expression and dosage <xref rid="pone.0085096-Stranger1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0085096-Conrad1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. It has been reported that CNVs confer high risk for inherited diseases, complex diseases and cancer, such as autism spectrum disorders <xref rid="pone.0085096-Kusenda1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, systemic lupus erythematous <xref rid="pone.0085096-Ptacek1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and neuroblastoma <xref rid="pone.0085096-Jakobsson1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Common CNVs represented in more than 1% of the population are defined as copy number polymorphisms (CNP). These polymorphisms may contribute to phenotypic variations and differences in disease susceptibility across different ethnic groups <xref rid="pone.0085096-Jakobsson1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0085096-Takahashi1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Therefore the detection and population-scale association analysis of CNVs is necessary for the study of migration and evolution, as well as for clinical diagnosis.</p><p>For the last 10 years, the Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) and Multiplex Ligation Probe Amplification (MLPA) methods have provided ample literature on the detection of CNVs <xref rid="pone.0085096-deSmith1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0085096-Shen1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0085096-Boone1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Recently, massive parallel sequencing has begun to offer genome-scale detection of CNVs through high throughput, high-resolution methods. The Paired-End Read Mapping (PEM) strategy was the first sequencing-based strategy to detect CNVs, and is able to identify both insertions and deletions with a resolution at kilobase level by comparing the differences between the mapped read distance and the average library insert size, though it is unable to detect insertions larger than the average library insert size and the exact borders of the CNVs <xref rid="pone.0085096-Medvedev1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0085096-Dalca1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Later, a split-read (SR) method was created to detect deletions and small insertions, but this method is restricted in the unique regions of the genome and cannot detect duplications with exact breakpoint resolution. Then the read counts (RC) method was developed to detect CNVs by comparing the reads aligned to a particular region and the expected value calculated according to the region's proportion in the whole genome; this method was first used in tumor samples <xref rid="pone.0085096-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0085096-Chiang1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The read counts method can achieve a high resolution in a relatively low coverage sequencing, and some recently popular algorithms are based on it, including SegSeq <xref rid="pone.0085096-Chiang1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, CNV-seq <xref rid="pone.0085096-Xie1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, CNAseg <xref rid="pone.0085096-Ivakhno1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, ReadDepth <xref rid="pone.0085096-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and rSW-seq <xref rid="pone.0085096-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. However, most of these algorithms need one real or theoretical comparative genome, which induce an additional cost or unexpected fluctuations that prevent further large-scale association research and clinical applications.</p><p>Ideally, the number of reads located in a certain region is proportional to its copy number, which makes it possible to detect the copy number by counting directly counting the number of reads. However, the uniformity of read distribution is influenced by two main sources of bias: local GC bias and other multiplex-related bias. The GC bias has been well reported in previous papers <xref rid="pone.0085096-Chiang1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0085096-Hormansdorfer1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0085096-Yoon1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>; moreover, there are multiplex reasons excepting GC content that could cause sequence bias, such as chromosomal structure <xref rid="pone.0085096-Ballantyne1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In the case of multiplex-related bias, which is hard to observe and correct by individual/limited samples, it is necessary to recruit population-scale sequencing instead of using theoretical expectations or single comparative controls. With population-scale low-coverage whole genome sequencing (LCS), the sequence bias could be corrected to an acceptable level, which would be highly beneficial when creating new methods for CNV detection. Also, comprehensive approaches can be recruited to control the false positive rate in low coverage analysis with the use of population-scale data.</p><p>To achieve these goals, we have developed a population-scale CNV calling (PSCC) method, a new bioinformatics method to detect CNVs using population-scale LCS. PSCC consists of three modules, including a two-step correction procedure to remove the local GC content bias and multiplex-related bias, a binary segmentation method to locate the candidate CNV regions, and a combined statistics test to estimate the signal reliability and determine the CNV genotypes. To evaluate the performance of the PSCC method, we tested its sensitivity and specificity using &#8764;2&#215; and &#8764;0.2&#215; LCS data <italic>in silico</italic>, and then conducted detection of CNVs in 34 clinical samples.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Overview of PSCC algorithm</title><p>The aim of PSCC is to detect CNVs through population-scale sequencing using LCS data. For better CNV detection, we first recruited a two-step correction procedure to remove the local GC content bias and multiplex-related bias, then used a binary segmentation method to localize the CNV breakpoint, and finally utilized a combined statistics test to combat false positive controls. The implementation of PSCC mainly consists of the following steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085096-g001">Figure 1</xref>):</p><fig id="pone-0085096-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0085096.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Bioinformatics pipeline of our copy number variation analysis strategy.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0085096.g001"/></fig><list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>Observation window selection</p></list-item><list-item><p>Two-step correction procedure</p></list-item><list-item><p>Binary segmentation algorithm</p></list-item><list-item><p>CNV genotype determination and combined statistics test</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Observation window selection</title><p>To take into account the various mapping reads and the sequencing reads of different regions of the human genome, we used adjustable sliding windows in the genome to calculate the statistic of RCs. The human reference genome was smashed into sliding simulated reads in the same paired-end/single-end type and read length as the case samples, and then remapped to the reference. Then the window sizes were adjusted to have the same expected RC, which is more comparable among windows in the correction process. Previous papers have reported that the optimal window size is inversely linked with the coverage, resulting in &#8764;30 bp bins for 100&#215; coverage, &#8764;100 bp bins for 20&#8211;30&#215; coverage, and &#8764;500 bp bins for 4&#8211;6&#215; coverage <xref rid="pone.0085096-Abyzov1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Since the sequencing length was single-end 36 bp, it meant that an expected RC would range from 55 to 84 in each window. We estimated our optimum bin size with the actual sequencing depth according to this principle:<disp-formula id="pone.0085096.e001"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0085096.e001.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>

So the RC becomes uniform in the single sample after the GC correction, but can still show significant bias in population-scale statistics. These biases should be similar in the same multisampling window due to the chromosome inherent attributes. Based on this assumption, we developed a population-based normalization procedure to eliminate these multiplex-related biases. The mean of each window in a control set is calculated to replace the expected value of single sample, while the standard deviation will be used to evaluate the polymorphism and to enact a false positive control in the subsequent procedures.

The CS samples were sequenced &#8764;5&#215; and the DS samples were sequenced &#8764;1&#215; in paired-end reads. (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0085096-t001">Table 1</xref>) Before further data analysis, we selected appropriate windows for this study. In order to keep the expected RCs, we defined the adjusted window using the simulated methods (described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0085096.s001">Materials and Methods S1</xref>). Based on formula 1, we got a series of window sizes that had expected RCs of 25, 50, 100, 150, 250 and 500 in DS samples. To set up the appropriate expected RCs, RC distribution under different copy numbers (1, 2, 3) were presented (Figure S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0085096.s001">Materials and Methods S1</xref>). Generally, the shared proportions of these three distributions decrease with more expected RCs in each window. In theory, with more expected RCs, our method will show an increased sensitivity and specificity but a decreased resolution. To obtain a balanced performance, we empirically used 150 as the expected RC in the following analysis.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0085096-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0085096.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Date production of sample using in this study.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0085096-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0085096.t001"/></alternatives></table-wrap><p>Under the RC strategy's assumption that the reads in any location of the genome are random, the RCs of each window should follow Poisson distribution.

Also, the coefficient of variation (CV) indicated significant sequence instability in these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085096-g002">Figure 2d</xref>). The existence of this GC bias may lead to an unsatisfied performance. To eliminate this GC bias, we applied the GC correction procedure to the RC, following formula 2 (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref>). After this process, most windows were centralized to a genome-wide level (RCR&#8202;=&#8202;1), showing less bias between RCR and GC content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085096-g002">Figure 2b</xref>). In the case of CV, the amount had decreased to some degree; however, the CV of GC-poor and GC-rich regions was still at a considerably high level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085096-g002">Figure 2e</xref>). This instability will still influence the performance of CNV detection. Moreover, in terms of special structures, such as repeat regions, GC correction showed less effectiveness in stability improvement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085096-g002">Figure 2g, 2h</xref>).

The simulation indicated that it was able to detect large segment CNVs at ultra-low sequence depth. For instance, the sensitivity of deletion and duplication were 97% and 94% respectively when the sequence depth was 0.2&#215; and the CNV size was larger than 300 kb. In the case of specificity, most of the false positive signals occurred at small sizes, and the results of deletion were more accurately detected than results of duplication.

In 24 of these 34 clinical samples at least one pathogenic CNV had been identified in each sample, and in the other 10 samples, no obvious pathogenic CNV had been identified by aCGH analysis. Finally, a total of 31 pathogenic CNVs were certified, including 19 deletions (from 0.4 Mb to 18.3 Mb) and 12 duplications (from 0.4 Mb to 59 Mb) (details in Table S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0085096.s001">Materials and Methods S1</xref>).</p><p>DNA was extracted directly from 34 peripheral blood samples and subsequent sequencing generated about 58 million paired-end 50-bp reads (i.e. about 2&#215; coverage).

In methodology, SegSeq and ReadDepth are significantly different from our method. SegSeq uses a comparative genomic strategy to decrease the experimental variance, while ReadDepth recruits a theoretical distribution to detect CNVs. Another important difference is that SegSeq and ReadDepth use relatively fixed thresholds to determine the CNV genotypes.

All aCGH CNVs were successfully detected in PSCC, whereas SegSeq dropped one deletion and one duplication smaller than 1 Mb. In ReadDepth, one deletion and one whole chromosome Y duplication were still missed. It indicated the good sensitivity of our method in regard to CNV detection of clinical samples, successfully detecting all 31 pathogenic CNVs. Both the result of &#8764;2&#215; and &#8764;0.5&#215; sequence depth reveal the advantages of this method when compared to the existing methods.</p><p>To compare the specificity of these three methods, we calculated the overlap (cumulated across 34 samples) among these methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085096-g004">Figure 4 c, d</xref>). In this study, aCGH totally detected 261.37 Mbp pathogenic CNVs. For PSCC, 253.04 of 265.19 Mbp (95.42%) CNVs overlapped with the aCGH, whereas only 0.25 of 3.33 Gbp (7.62%) for SegSeq and 0.23 of 5.94 Gbp (3.83%) for ReadDepth. In addition, PSCC, SegSeq and ReadDepth detected 3.53 Mbp, 2.70 Gbp, and 5.33 Gbp method specific CNVs. These numbers indicated the false prediction rate of these three methods would be 1.33% (3.53 Mbp/265.19 Mbp), 81.08% (2.70 Gbp/3.33 Gbp) and 89.73% (5.33 Gbp/5.94 Gbp), implying our correction and statistics strategy can effectively improve the specificity. In the &#8764;0.5&#215; subsampled set, the situation was almost the same, our method had the lowest false prediction rate of 7.16% (20.07 Mbp/280.39 Mbp), while the SegSeq's increased to 88.22% (4.87 Gbp/5.52 Gbp) and ReadDepth's decreased to 86.08% (3.87 Gbp/4.50 Gbp).

Large-scale simulation data indicates that our method achieved 99.7% sensitivity and 100% specificity for 300 kb CNVs in a low coverage sequencing condition (i.e. about 2&#215; coverage). For clinical samples, our method effectively detected the CNVs in 34 DC samples (24 Microdeletion/Microduplication syndrome and 10 samples with no obvious pathogenic CNV) using 2&#215; sequence data and 0.5&#215; simulated data, showing great potential for clinical application.</p><p>Since only a low sequencing depth is needed, the cost of our method can be controlled at an appropriate level, which is one of the key aspects of large-scale practical applications. Currently, it costs approximately $41 to generate 1 GB of sequence reads <xref rid="pone.0085096-Quail1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. For example, it costs $246 to perform a &#8764;2&#215; sequencing, which is comparable to the costs of high-resolution aCGH. Moreover, the development of sequencing platforms with lower costs and shorter turnaround times will significantly broaden the application of sequence-based approaches for CNV detection. Our new PSCC method has significant advantages when compared to other bioinformatics methods. We identified all the pathogenic CNVs in the clinical samples, and had much lower false prediction rate compared to other methods. Considering the sensitivity and specificity of our method, it may be a promising solution for basic research and clinical application, both in newborn screening and CNV detection.</p><p>There are still some issues that could be improved in the primary stage. Duo to a limitation of the normal control set used in this study, some low frequency polymorphism regions were also retained in the final result. The accumulation of a larger polymorphism database is necessary. Moreover, exogenous gene insertion, small deletions and balanced translocations cannot be detected using this method. The PSCC method should therefore be combined with other methods, such as PEM and <italic>de novo</italic> assembly methods, to make up for these disadvantages. Alongside the progress of the sequencing technologies, especially the advent of the third generation sequencing, we should also consider how the long sequencing read length assisted local assembly can be compositely applied to our method. This strategy not only solves those special structural mutations, but also improves the resolution in the breakpoint boundaries.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, we have developed a bioinformatics strategy for accurate CNV detection. It broadens the perspective of bias correction and filter strategy of population polymorphisms noise signals in candidate pathogenic CNV detection, and this new PSCC strategy could be a promising new research tool and could assist in the detection of CNVs in a clinical setting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0085096.s001"><label>Materials and Methods S1</label><caption><p>
