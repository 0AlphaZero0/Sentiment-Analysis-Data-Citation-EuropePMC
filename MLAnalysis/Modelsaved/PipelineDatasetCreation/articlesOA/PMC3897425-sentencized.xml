</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Copy number variations (CNV) are known to be an important component of structural variation in the human genome, resulting from a mixture of meiotic recombination, homology-directed and non homologous repair of double-strand breaks, and errors in replication [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>CNVs contain duplication, deletion and multiallelic variation events of genetic material 1 kb or larger in size, and might have functional impact through gene expression and dosage [2], [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that CNVs confer high risk for inherited diseases, complex diseases and cancer, such as autism spectrum disorders [4], systemic lupus erythematous [5] and neuroblastoma [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Common CNVs represented in more than 1% of the population are defined as copy number polymorphisms (CNP). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>These polymorphisms may contribute to phenotypic variations and differences in disease susceptibility across different ethnic groups [6], [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Therefore the detection and population-scale association analysis of CNVs is necessary for the study of migration and evolution, as well as for clinical diagnosis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>For the last 10 years, the Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) and Multiplex Ligation Probe Amplification (MLPA) methods have provided ample literature on the detection of CNVs [8], [9], [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Recently, massive parallel sequencing has begun to offer genome-scale detection of CNVs through high throughput, high-resolution methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The Paired-End Read Mapping (PEM) strategy was the first sequencing-based strategy to detect CNVs, and is able to identify both insertions and deletions with a resolution at kilobase level by comparing the differences between the mapped read distance and the average library insert size, though it is unable to detect insertions larger than the average library insert size and the exact borders of the CNVs [11], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Later, a split-read (SR) method was created to detect deletions and small insertions, but this method is restricted in the unique regions of the genome and cannot detect duplications with exact breakpoint resolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Then the read counts (RC) method was developed to detect CNVs by comparing the reads aligned to a particular region and the expected value calculated according to the region's proportion in the whole genome; this method was first used in tumor samples [13], [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The read counts method can achieve a high resolution in a relatively low coverage sequencing, and some recently popular algorithms are based on it, including SegSeq [14], CNV-seq [15], CNAseg [16], ReadDepth [17] and rSW-seq [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>However, most of these algorithms need one real or theoretical comparative genome, which induce an additional cost or unexpected fluctuations that prevent further large-scale association research and clinical applications. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Ideally, the number of reads located in a certain region is proportional to its copy number, which makes it possible to detect the copy number by counting directly counting the number of reads. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>However, the uniformity of read distribution is influenced by two main sources of bias: local GC bias and other multiplex-related bias. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The GC bias has been well reported in previous papers [14], [19], [20]; moreover, there are multiplex reasons excepting GC content that could cause sequence bias, such as chromosomal structure [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In the case of multiplex-related bias, which is hard to observe and correct by individual/limited samples, it is necessary to recruit population-scale sequencing instead of using theoretical expectations or single comparative controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>With population-scale low-coverage whole genome sequencing (LCS), the sequence bias could be corrected to an acceptable level, which would be highly beneficial when creating new methods for CNV detection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Also, comprehensive approaches can be recruited to control the false positive rate in low coverage analysis with the use of population-scale data. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>To achieve these goals, we have developed a population-scale CNV calling (PSCC) method, a new bioinformatics method to detect CNVs using population-scale LCS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>PSCC consists of three modules, including a two-step correction procedure to remove the local GC content bias and multiplex-related bias, a binary segmentation method to locate the candidate CNV regions, and a combined statistics test to estimate the signal reliability and determine the CNV genotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the performance of the PSCC method, we tested its sensitivity and specificity using â¼2Ã and â¼0.2Ã LCS data in silico, and then conducted detection of CNVs in 34 clinical samples. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>To take into account the various mapping reads and the sequencing reads of different regions of the human genome, we used adjustable sliding windows in the genome to calculate the statistic of RCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The human reference genome was smashed into sliding simulated reads in the same paired-end/single-end type and read length as the case samples, and then remapped to the reference. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Then the window sizes were adjusted to have the same expected RC, which is more comparable among windows in the correction process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Previous papers have reported that the optimal window size is inversely linked with the coverage, resulting in â¼30 bp bins for 100Ã coverage, â¼100 bp bins for 20â30Ã coverage, and â¼500 bp bins for 4â6Ã coverage [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Since the sequencing length was single-end 36 bp, it meant that an expected RC would range from 55 to 84 in each window. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>We estimated our optimum bin size with the actual sequencing depth according to this principle:(1) </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Where  is the number of simulated reads that should be located in each window,  is the expected  of the actual sample in each window,  is the number of unique mapped reads in the simulated data, and  is the total sequencing reads. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>In each window, the local GC content of each window is calculated as the average GC content of mapped reads. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Strong correlation between RC and GC content has been reported in several studies [23], [24], [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The bias is suspected to be introduced during PCR in library preparation and cluster generation in the Illumina sequencing workflow [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>In this study, our data indicates that the RC will be underrepresented in GC-poor and GC-rich regions, implying a significant GC bias. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Here, we propose to adjust the RC by using the observed deviation in coverage for a given GC percentage [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>In practice, for all the GC percentages we determine the deviation of coverage from the genome average and then correct each RC according to the following formula:(2) </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Where  are read counts of the -th window in sample ,  is the median  of windows that have the same GC content with -th window, and  is the overall median of all the windows in sample . </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Irrespective of the GC content, there are other factors that influence the library preparation and cluster generation process such as complex genomic characteristics, and in the follow-up alignment the sequence homology and repeat structure seriously affect the mappability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>So the RC becomes uniform in the single sample after the GC correction, but can still show significant bias in population-scale statistics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>These biases should be similar in the same multisampling window due to the chromosome inherent attributes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Based on this assumption, we developed a population-based normalization procedure to eliminate these multiplex-related biases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>The mean of each window in a control set is calculated to replace the expected value of single sample, while the standard deviation will be used to evaluate the polymorphism and to enact a false positive control in the subsequent procedures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>This process is executed by means of the following formula:(3) (4) (5) </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Where  and  are the mean and standard deviation of corrected read counts of the -th window in all the  control samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>The  is the relative ratio of corrected read counts of the -th window in sample . </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Through this two-step correction, we can obtain an unbiased relative copy ratio (RCR) for each window. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>We also simultaneously obtain the deviation level in the population-based normalization process, which can be used to estimate the reliability of these regions that may not lead to a false positive. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Based on the corrected RCR data, CNVs can be identified as a decrease or increase of the RCR across multiple consecutive windows. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Before CNV genotype determination, we need to localize the segment breakpoints to identify the candidate CNV regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>The data that we obtain are mathematically very similar to the signal obtained from aCGH experiments, and the events in RCR data can be detected using the same algorithmic approaches that have been used for aCGH data [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>At present, few statistical methods have been developed and tested for the detection of CNVs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Those methods in existence include circular binary segmentation algorithm (CBS) [28], shifting level model (SLM) [29], mean-shift algorithm (MSB) [22] and events significance testing (EWT) [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Here, we merge the adjacent windows with similar RCR into segments using a binary segmentation algorithm. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>First, a set of candidate breakpoints is selected by calculating the significance of differences (p-value) of each window within the neighboring windows by a non-parameter test. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>The Wald-Wolfowitz runs test [30], which has a better performance in polymorphic conditions, is recruited here. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>A group of windows with minimal p-values were selected as ordered initialized candidate breakpoints. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Then an iterative algorithm is used to obtain the optimized candidate breakpoints set. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>In each loop, the lowest significant breakpoint (with maximum p-value) will be deleted and the p-values of neighboring windows will be refreshed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>This procedure will be performed until all of the p-values are less than the genome-wide significance threshold. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Thus, a set of candidate CNV regions are divided by these optimized breakpoints. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>With consideration regarding the data stability and sequence parallelism, we recruited two statistical tests to estimate the signal reliability and determine the CNV genotypes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>First, we evaluated the significance of each segment as a CNV using the U-test (alphaâ=â0.001); we will refer to this test as self-test (ST). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>After this evaluation, we utilized the Parallelism-test (PT) to estimate the reliability of each signal under the consideration of multiplex-related bias. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>The test statistics can be obtained from these formulas:(6) (7) </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Where is the mean of the test region that contains windows ranging from  to ,  and  are the mean and standard deviation of sample , and  is the standard deviation of the -th window in control samples. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>In PT, the CNVs in stable regions will show a significant p-value. </plain></SENT>
