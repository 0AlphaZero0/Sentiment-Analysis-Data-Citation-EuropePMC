To minimize overheating and desiccation, physiological and biochemical adaptations are of high importance for these animals. In the present study, seven populations of the Mediterranean land snail species <italic>Xeropicta derbentina</italic> were sampled from their natural habitat in order to investigate the intraspecific variation of cellular and biochemical mechanisms, which are assigned to contribute to heat resistance. Furthermore, we tested whether genetic parameters are correlated with these physiological heat stress response patterns. Specimens of each population were individually exposed to elevated temperatures (25 to 52&#176;C) for 8 h in the laboratory. After exposure, the health condition of the snails' hepatopancreas was examined by means of qualitative description and semi-quantitative assessment of histopathological effects. In addition, the heat-shock protein 70 level (Hsp70) was determined. Generally, calcium cells of the hepatopancreas were more heat resistant than digestive cells - this phenomenon was associated with elevated Hsp70 levels at 40&#176;C.We observed considerable variation in the snails' heat response strategy: Individuals from three populations invested much energy in producing a highly elevated Hsp70 level, whereas three other populations invested energy in moderate stress protein levels - both strategies were in association with cellular functionality. Furthermore, one population kept cellular condition stable despite a low Hsp70 level until 40&#176;C exposure, whereas prominent cellular reactions were observed above this thermal limit. Genetic diversity (mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene) within populations was low. Nevertheless, when using genetic indices as explanatory variables in a multivariate regression tree (MRT) analysis, population structure explained mean differences in cellular and biochemical heat stress responses, especially in the group exposed to 40&#176;C. Our study showed that, even in similar habitats within a close range, populations of the same species use different stress response strategies that all rendered survival possible.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The study was financed by the German Research Council (DFG) under KO 1978/5-3 and WI 1902/10-3.

The hepatopancreas is strongly involved in metabolic processes even under normal conditions <xref rid="pone.0086613-Sumner1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086613-Taieb1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086613-Walker1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Besides other factors, the metabolic rate can increase due to high temperatures <xref rid="pone.0086613-Gillooly1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> and, thereby, increases the need of nutrient supply by the hepatopancreas. As found in the qualitative assessment of the hepatopancreatic tubule structure, the lumina of the tubules were dilated after exposure to higher temperatures, which could have been the result of an increased metabolic rate associated to a demand in nutrient supply.</p><p>An increased amount of ruptured cell apices primarily of the digestive cells occurred preferentially after exposure to higher temperatures, which could be explained by an activated release of lysosomal enzymes. Lysosomal membranes are known to disintegrate under elevated temperatures <xref rid="pone.0086613-Moeller1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, which cause lysosomal enzymes to be released. Poste et al. <xref rid="pone.0086613-Poste1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> showed that an extracellular release of these enzymes from damaged lysosomes can destroy cell membranes and generally alter cell structures. The combination of high temperature and low pH (also as a result of high temperature) enhance the disruption of lysosomal membranes and also the activity of released enzymes <xref rid="pone.0086613-Moeller1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>.</p><p>Predominantly after exposure to high temperature, the calcium cells showed dark nuclei which are indicative of a low pH <xref rid="pone.0086613-Avwioro1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, disturbed compartmentation, and reduced density of the cytoplasm. Calcium cells play an important role in osmoregulation <xref rid="pone.0086613-Taieb1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and the acid-base balance <xref rid="pone.0086613-Burton1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. It is known that heat can negatively affect the acid-base balance <xref rid="pone.0086613-Heisler1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref> and the ion-balance as a result of water-loss by increased evaporation which leads to osmotic stress and acidosis. High temperatures can also lower the pH <xref rid="pone.0086613-Barnhart1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, which leads to an accumulation of acidic metabolic products in snail tissue, causing metabolic acidosis <xref rid="pone.0086613-Ryan1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. Related to these facts, we assume that the observed heat effects in the calcium cells are associated with osmotic stress and a disturbed acid-base balance. Occasionally, we observed calcium cells exhibiting some heat stress symptoms in the control group (population 3). This might be due to the fact that these snails had already encountered high temperatures in the field and did not fully recover during acclimatization time in the lab prior to the experiments. Scheil et al. <xref rid="pone.0086613-Scheil1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> also observed cellular reactions in the control group of a <italic>X. derbentina</italic> population after acclimation and concluded that this might have been caused by pre-exposure in the field.</p><p>Our results showed digestive cells to be more heat sensitive than calcium cells. In almost all populations, the condition of the digestive cells stayed &#8216;below&#8217; the status of reaction at temperatures of up to 33&#176;C, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086613-g005">Fig. 5</xref>. With rising temperature, they showed irregular vacuolization and fused vacuoles, both being indicative for an active cellular response, and ruptured cell apices which are likely due to the release of lysosomal enzymes as mentioned above. A main function of the digestive cells is resorption of nutrients and intracellular digestion. Because the two lowest temperatures correspond to natural environmental conditions allowing these snails to be active and feed, it becomes reasonable that their metabolism ensures a stable function of this cell type at these temperatures. When temperatures rise, e.g. in the morning of hot summer days <xref rid="pone.0086613-Dieterich1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, the snails remain attached inactive on vegetation. During this period, they are fully exposed to the sun, heat up, and need to cope with heat stress. The above-mentioned functions of the calcium cells become more important under these conditions, so we can assume that under these circumstances, a functional status of these cells is of higher importance than that of the digestive cells.</p><p>In several studies, an increase in the percentage of the extension of calcium cells in the digestive gland, caused by hyperplasia, hypertrophy, or loss of digestive cells as an adaptation to heat stress, was observed <xref rid="pone.0086613-Dittbrenner1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086613-Zaldibar1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. In this study, the ratio of calcium cells did not differ among the treatment groups in any of the investigated populations. Only in few cases, hypertrophy of calcium cells could be detected, and also no decrease in the number of digestive cells was observed. However, the populations investigated in this study already revealed a rather high percentage of calcium cells (about 40&#8211;50%) in the control group, so we assume that snails were not able to raise this level remarkably in response to heat. Also in a study by Scheil et al. <xref rid="pone.0086613-Scheil1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, a high percentage of calcium cells in controls and only a minor increase in their surface ratio were observed when <italic>X. derbentina</italic> was exposed to 45&#176;C.</p><p>In order to better understand these histological findings, it is necessary to compare the histopathological results to those obtained for stress proteins.</p><p>In response to increasing temperatures, all populations showed an up-regulation of Hsp70 up to a distinct level. This maximum was followed by a decrease in stress protein level as a result of exposure to higher temperatures. These findings are in accordance with the kinetics of stress protein induction described by Eckwert et al. <xref rid="pone.0086613-Eckwert1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. The induction of Hsp70 is known to be due to proteotoxic effects of stressors in cells and the subsequent initiation of stress gene transcription (compensation phase). After reaching the maximum level of stress protein induction, the stress response decreases, presumably caused in most cases by a pathological impairment of the stress protein machinery (destruction phase). In our study, the histopathological data confirm this interpretation, particularly for temperatures &gt;40&#176;C.</p><p>It is known that land snails living under extreme environmental conditions and suffering from heat overload and desiccation use Hsp induction as important survival strategy <xref rid="pone.0086613-Mizrahi1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086613-Mizrahi2" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. Furthermore, the expression of Hsp70 proteins is thought to be very energy costly <xref rid="pone.0086613-Sanchez1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0086613-Khler2" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. Differences among species and populations in the intensity in which stress proteins are induced could be associated with differences among them in how temperature has affected their energy budgets <xref rid="pone.0086613-Tomanek1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. With respect to the relative Hsp70 levels (in association with the cellular mean assessment values) in our study which predominantly differed at 40&#176;C among the populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086613-g007">Fig. 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086613-g008">8</xref>), the investigated populations follow different strategies to arrange with thermal stress:</p><p>Strategy 1: investment in medium Hsp70 levels and keeping cellular condition on the level of moderate response (populations 1, 2, and 5), strategy 2: spending energy in high Hsp70 levels associated with cellular condition on a moderate level (populations 3, 6, and 7), and strategy 3: no investment in significantly elevated Hsp70 levels, but nevertheless insurance of cellular functionality until a certain temperature, at the risk of a rapid cellular decay at extreme temperature (population 4). These strategies are reflected in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086613-g009">Fig. 9</xref>, which illustrates the association of Hsp70 level and histopathological condition for each population. The distribution of Hsp70 maxima and statistical analyses displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086613-g007">Fig. 7</xref> support our grouping of the snail populations in these strategies.</p><fig id="pone-0086613-g009" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0086613.g009</object-id><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>Correlation of relative Hsp70 levels vs. mean histopathological assessment values for each population.</title><p>Shaded squares reflect the respective population's strategy of Hsp70 induction at the histological &#8216;status of reaction&#8217; of the hepatopancreas.

Due to the energy consumption associated with the synthesis of Hsps and the expense related to the synthesis of other types of proteins at elevated temperature levels <xref rid="pone.0086613-Tomanek1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, over-expression of Hsps can reduce fitness <xref rid="pone.0086613-Feder2" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0086613-Krebs2" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. Consequently, lower levels of Hsp70 might save fitness costs. Another aspect is that in evolution thermal resistance or tolerance to chemical stressors often is achieved in other ways presumably due to the costs of the production of high Hsp70 levels <xref rid="pone.0086613-Khler2" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086613-Feder3" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086613-Arts1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. Mizrahi et al. <xref rid="pone.0086613-Mizrahi1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> demonstrated that a Mediterranean snail species (<italic>Sphincterochila cariosa</italic>), which is rather sensitive to desiccation, showed a higher level of Hsp72 compared to a related, desert-inhabiting snail species (<italic>Sphincterochila zonata</italic>) that is more desiccation resistant. They also suggested that these results are in line with other studies demonstrating higher levels of Hsp70 in heat sensitive species compared to heat tolerant ones <xref rid="pone.0086613-Srensen1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086613-Zatsepina1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. Assuming that low Hsp70 levels are indicative of phenotypes that have been selected for thermotolerance, one could conclude that populations 6 and 7 of our study did not exhibit this tolerance as they showed cellular decay despite high Hsp70 levels.</p><p>Because each population has its own demographic history (e.g., bottlenecks, immigration, emigration), it is not surprising, that Hsp70 expression levels are specimen and population specific. In fact, previous population- or line-specific analyses of Hsp70 expression levels in other invertebrates clearly demonstrated within and among population differences in Hsp70 levels <xref rid="pone.0086613-Bahrndorff1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0086613-Srensen1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. However, the specific demographic parameters responsible for the correlation of population structure and Hsp70 levels are still poorly understood. We therefore tested several candidate explanatory genetic parameters in this study in order to infer their effects on physiological heat stress response data. Note, however, that the mitochondrial COI gene used in this study can only reflect the phylogeographical and demographic history of our populations studied; it is very likely not directly involved in Hsp70 expression.</p><p>Interestingly, our MRT analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0086613-t005">Table 5</xref>) showed that physiological data are well explained by genetic population characteristics in general and by divergence parameters in particular. This is especially evident in the 40&#176;C exposure group (R<sup>2</sup>&#8202;=&#8202;78%), the condition with the maximal stress protein induction. Here, little genetic differentiation between populations is associated with high Hsp70 levels and improved histopathological conditions. In other words, specimens that share haplotypes with specimens from neighboring populations show, on average, higher Hsp70 values and fewer adverse histopathological effects. The overall pattern inferred could possibly be explained by regional population processes that are particularly acting at 40&#176;C, that is, an ecologically realistic, yet the highest non-lethal temperature. In contrast, under the other temperature regimes tested (i.e., 25, 33, and 48&#176;C), local processes appear to be more important.</p><p>Why do some populations not show cellular deterioration even though their Hsp70 level remained low after 8 h exposure to thermal stress? Scheil et al. <xref rid="pone.0086613-Scheil1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> showed that Hsp70 was up-regulated already after 0.5 h of exposure time, reaching a significant peak after 4 h and then decreased, reaching the base level again after 8 h. In addition, they observed no significant impact on the integrity in cellular condition during exposure time. Thus, it cannot be excluded that short-time induction of stress proteins, which may have occurred within the first hours of exposure (but remain undetected after 8 h), protected cells from pathology.</p><p>It is particularly striking that digestive cells and calcium cells showed different modes of reaction in response to the tested gradient of elevated temperature in the investigated populations. This variation in reaction patterns of digestive and calcium cells was found to be associated with the Hsp70 level: with increasing stress protein content, the condition of calcium cells improved or, at least, did not decline in all populations. We conclude that Hsp70 has a protective effect especially on the calcium cells and that our studied populations invested energy to ensure the function of this cell type, above all because of its important role in osmoregulation <xref rid="pone.0086613-Taieb1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and acid-base balance <xref rid="pone.0086613-Burton1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. This observation can also be linked to the function of calcium cells in protein synthesis <xref rid="pone.0086613-Sumner1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086613-Taieb1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Up to now, there are no studies about the intensity of Hsp70 synthesis in calcium cells of the hepatopancreas in snails. It is, however, reasonable to assume that Hsp70 synthesis took place in the calcium cells, and that an increase in stress protein synthesis could lead to an instant protection effect in this cell type. This topic might be addressed by further studies in the future.</p><p>Our study showed that there is considerable variation in the survival strategies in populations of <italic>X. derbentina</italic>. Results indicate that populations invest either more or less energy in elevated Hsp70 synthesis, according to the presumed trade-off with fitness costs. We observed populations that at least invested energy in moderately elevated (population 1, 2, and 5) or high stress protein levels (population 3, 6, and 7) to keep cellular condition stable. Furthermore, one population (population 4), was able to keep cellular functionality despite a low, at most slightly elevated, Hsp70 level until 40&#176;C exposure, whereas prominent cellular reactions were observed beyond this thermal limit in this population only. Generally, we observed that, with an elevation in Hsp70 levels, especially after exposure to high temperature, calcium cells seemed to be more heat tolerant than digestive cells.</p><p>Genetic analyses showed that physiological data are well explained by genetic variables, especially for the 40&#176;C exposure group. This possibly indicates strong selective pressures acting at this high, but environmentally relevant temperature. Despite the presumable uniformity in the requirements for the survival of different <italic>X. derbentina</italic> populations at high temperature, our study nevertheless showed the cellular components of survival strategies of snail populations to be very variable. In concert with one another, these components are apparently equally efficient in different <italic>X. derbentina</italic> populations and enable survival of them in their natural habitats.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0086613.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Results of the Tukey Kramer HSD post-hoc test for the comparison of Hsp70 levels after 40&#176;C exposure among populations (p-values are shown).</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0086613.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Thanks go to Andreas Dieterich, T&#252;bingen University, for discussion and to Simon Schwarz, T&#252;bingen University, for help with the statistics.
