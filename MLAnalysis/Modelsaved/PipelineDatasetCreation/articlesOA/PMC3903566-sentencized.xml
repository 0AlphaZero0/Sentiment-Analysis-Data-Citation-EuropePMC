<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the present study, seven populations of the Mediterranean land snail species Xeropicta derbentina were sampled from their natural habitat in order to investigate the intraspecific variation of cellular and biochemical mechanisms, which are assigned to contribute to heat resistance. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Generally, calcium cells of the hepatopancreas were more heat resistant than digestive cells - this phenomenon was associated with elevated Hsp70 levels at 40°C.We observed considerable variation in the snails' heat response strategy: Individuals from three populations invested much energy in producing a highly elevated Hsp70 level, whereas three other populations invested energy in moderate stress protein levels - both strategies were in association with cellular functionality. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Animals which live in dry and hot habitats have to cope with desiccation and overheating. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Land snails are particularly affected by these adverse conditions due to their water-permeable skin [1] and, therefore, developed a range of behavioral, physiological, and morphological adaptations to ensure survival in arid habitats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Climbing on vegetation to escape from hot ground temperature and restriction of activity phases to favorable time periods can be regarded as behavioral adaptations [2], [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>As a physiological mechanism of adaptation, aestivation accompanied by a decrease of the metabolic rate [4], [5] during dry and hot seasons allows land snails even to survive in extreme arid climates of deserts [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Morphological adaptations are reflected in variations in shell structure, shell aperture, and size, as well as in body and shell color, or the thickness of the epiphragm [3], [7], [8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The hepatopancreas plays a major role in the metabolism of mollusks [9], [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Alterations and cellular damage caused by different stressors, including heat stress, rapidly occur in the hepatopancreas, which makes this organ suitable to monitor and study cellular responses [11], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>It is also known that calcium cells, representing one cell type of the hepatopancreas, play an important role in osmoregulation [10] and acid-base balance [13], both of which can be affected by high temperature. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Stress or heat shock proteins (Hsp) can be induced by heat and many other proteotoxic stressors in several organisms [14], [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The 70 kD stress protein family, Hsp70, is a main component of the cellular heat stress response system and protects the cell against the proteotoxic action of elevated temperature and numerous other stressors [16]–[18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Though isoforms of this protein class are constitutively present already under homeostatic conditions in the cell - e.g. acting as chaperones during protein folding processes, stabilizing proteins in intracellular trafficking, and playing an essential role in assembly, degradation and intracellular localization of proteins [19]–[21] - the expression of some isoforms of Hsp70 is up-regulated under the influence of a proteotoxic stressor and, therefore, can be used as a marker for proteotoxic stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Moreover, several studies indicate that genetic differences among populations may be associated with Hsp70 expression levels [22]–[24], though the effect of population structure on heat response differences in invertebrates is, in general, not well understood. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>A land snail species that seems to be particularly well adapted to heat stress is the pulmonate Xeropicta derbentina (Krynicki, 1836). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>These snails are highly abundant in the Mediterranean region and can build up large populations with hundreds of thousands of individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>During daytime, they remain inactive on vegetation, fully exposed to sunlight. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Although several studies exist on thermotolerance and adaptations to heat stress in land snails in general [3], [25], [26] and in Mediterranean species in particular [27]–[31], as well as on the genetic structure in the Helicidae [32]–[34], comprehensive investigations combining cellular and biochemical reactions to heat stress with population structure information are lacking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>We here used X. derbentina as a model organism and investigated variations in heat response mechanisms after exposure to elevated temperatures in seven populations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Specifically, we studied whether different populations of the same species collected within a range of a few kilometers in similar habitats utilize different biochemical and cellular strategies to deal with heat stress, and tested whether physiological heat stress response data can be explained with population structure information. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, genetically characterized specimens were individually exposed to elevated temperatures (25 to 52°C) under laboratory conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Then, effects of heat stress were assessed by histopathological (cellular) and stress protein level (biochemical) biomarkers, and the correlation between genetic structure and heat stress response data tested using multivariate statistics. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>It is known that heat can negatively affect the acid-base balance [56] and the ion-balance as a result of water-loss by increased evaporation which leads to osmotic stress and acidosis. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>With rising temperature, they showed irregular vacuolization and fused vacuoles, both being indicative for an active cellular response, and ruptured cell apices which are likely due to the release of lysosomal enzymes as mentioned above. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>A main function of the digestive cells is resorption of nutrients and intracellular digestion. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>The above-mentioned functions of the calcium cells become more important under these conditions, so we can assume that under these circumstances, a functional status of these cells is of higher importance than that of the digestive cells. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>Due to the energy consumption associated with the synthesis of Hsps and the expense related to the synthesis of other types of proteins at elevated temperature levels [65], over-expression of Hsps can reduce fitness [66]–[68]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>Consequently, lower levels of Hsp70 might save fitness costs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>Another aspect is that in evolution thermal resistance or tolerance to chemical stressors often is achieved in other ways presumably due to the costs of the production of high Hsp70 levels [64], [69], [70]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>Mizrahi et al. [26] demonstrated that a Mediterranean snail species (Sphincterochila cariosa), which is rather sensitive to desiccation, showed a higher level of Hsp72 compared to a related, desert-inhabiting snail species (Sphincterochila zonata) that is more desiccation resistant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>They also suggested that these results are in line with other studies demonstrating higher levels of Hsp70 in heat sensitive species compared to heat tolerant ones [24], [71]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>Assuming that low Hsp70 levels are indicative of phenotypes that have been selected for thermotolerance, one could conclude that populations 6 and 7 of our study did not exhibit this tolerance as they showed cellular decay despite high Hsp70 levels. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>Because each population has its own demographic history (e.g., bottlenecks, immigration, emigration), it is not surprising, that Hsp70 expression levels are specimen and population specific. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="343" pm="."><plain>In fact, previous population- or line-specific analyses of Hsp70 expression levels in other invertebrates clearly demonstrated within and among population differences in Hsp70 levels [22]–[24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>However, the specific demographic parameters responsible for the correlation of population structure and Hsp70 levels are still poorly understood. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>Note, however, that the mitochondrial COI gene used in this study can only reflect the phylogeographical and demographic history of our populations studied; it is very likely not directly involved in Hsp70 expression. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, our MRT analyses (Table 5) showed that physiological data are well explained by genetic population characteristics in general and by divergence parameters in particular. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>This is especially evident in the 40°C exposure group (R2 = 78%), the condition with the maximal stress protein induction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>Here, little genetic differentiation between populations is associated with high Hsp70 levels and improved histopathological conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>In other words, specimens that share haplotypes with specimens from neighboring populations show, on average, higher Hsp70 values and fewer adverse histopathological effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>The overall pattern inferred could possibly be explained by regional population processes that are particularly acting at 40°C, that is, an ecologically realistic, yet the highest non-lethal temperature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="352" pm="."><plain>In contrast, under the other temperature regimes tested (i.e., 25, 33, and 48°C), local processes appear to be more important. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="353" pm="?"><plain>Why do some populations not show cellular deterioration even though their Hsp70 level remained low after 8 h exposure to thermal stress? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="354" pm="."><plain>Scheil et al. [29] showed that Hsp70 was up-regulated already after 0.5 h of exposure time, reaching a significant peak after 4 h and then decreased, reaching the base level again after 8 h. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="355" pm="."><plain>In addition, they observed no significant impact on the integrity in cellular condition during exposure time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="356" pm="."><plain>Thus, it cannot be excluded that short-time induction of stress proteins, which may have occurred within the first hours of exposure (but remain undetected after 8 h), protected cells from pathology. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="357" pm="."><plain>It is particularly striking that digestive cells and calcium cells showed different modes of reaction in response to the tested gradient of elevated temperature in the investigated populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="358" pm="."><plain>This variation in reaction patterns of digestive and calcium cells was found to be associated with the Hsp70 level: with increasing stress protein content, the condition of calcium cells improved or, at least, did not decline in all populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="359" pm="."><plain>We conclude that Hsp70 has a protective effect especially on the calcium cells and that our studied populations invested energy to ensure the function of this cell type, above all because of its important role in osmoregulation [10] and acid-base balance [13]. </plain></SENT>
