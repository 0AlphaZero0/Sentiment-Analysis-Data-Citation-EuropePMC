</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During their development, and in response to biotic and abiotic stresses, plants produce thousands of metabolites, which play a wide range of roles in environmental adaptation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The synthesis and accumulation of such products result from the activity of a plethora of enzymes under the control of complex transcriptional networks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For example, the fine regulation of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis is achieved by a combination of transcription factors (TFs) from diverse families such as WRKY, bZIP, MADS-box, bHLH, WD40, and R2R3-MYBs (Zhao and Dixon, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Recent studies of transcriptional regulation of specific aspects of primary and secondary metabolism have begun to define transcriptional networks underlying metabolic responses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p content-type="indent"><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The R2R3-MYBs represent one of the largest families of plant TFs (Kranz et al., 1998; Stracke et al., 2001) and are important regulators of secondary metabolism (Dubos et al., 2010, Feller et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Their DNA-binding domain (DBD) is highly conserved among angiosperm and gymnosperm plants (Bedon et al., 2007) but their C-terminus, which typically contains activation and repression domains, is highly variable (Dubos et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The R2R3-MYBs have been divided into 22 different subgroups (SGs) based on their DBD and C-termini sequence features, although some of them remain unclassified (Kranz et al., 1998; Stracke et al., 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence from model plant systems indicates that different MYBs within a subgroup may be functionally redundant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>For example, several Arabidopsis SG7 MYBs were shown to regulate the production of flavonol glycosides by acting on similar target genes (Stracke et al., 2007), and the maize ZmMYB31 and ZmMYB42 both regulate CINNAMATE 4-HYDROXYLASE (C4H) (Fornalé et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Functional characterizations have also shown that MYBs from different subgroups may act upon overlapping sets of target genes in pathways of flavonoid, monolignol, xylan, or cellulose metabolism (reviewed in Dubos et al., 2010; Zhong et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p content-type="indent"><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Many R2R3-MYBs have been described as transcriptional activators of genes from phenylpropanoid, flavonoid, and glucosinolate biosynthetic pathways in plants (Dubos et al., 2010; Zhong et al., 2010; Zhao and Dixon, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, a few of them, including members of the SG4 subgroup, have been identified as negative regulators of monolignol and flavonoid biosynthetic pathways (Tamagnone et al., 1998; Jin et al., 2000; Preston et al., 2004; Legay et al., 2007; Fornalé et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In Eucalyptus grandiis, two R2R3- MYBs, namely EgMYB1 (Legay et al., 2010) and EgMYB2 (Goicoechea et al., 2005), were shown to act as a repressor and activator of lignin biosynthesis, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The putative interplay of activators and repressors including MYBs acting on common target genes has been proposed as the basis for fine transcriptional regulation of phenylpropanoid metabolism (Vom Endt et al., 2002) and lignin biosynthesis (Zhao and Dixon, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Activation and repression have also been attributed to the action of a single MYB gene (Bhargava et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>For example, Arabidopsis MYB75, also known as PRODUCTION OF ANTHOCYANIN PIGMENT1 (PAP1), was shown to regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis positively in seedlings (Borevitz et al., 2000) and, more recently, to regulate negatively the expression of monolignol biosynthesis genes and the accumulation of lignin in the inflorescence stems of older plants (Bhargava et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Together, these results also suggest that a dual effect may exist when considering different tissues. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p content-type="indent"><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Our understanding of functional redundancy and antagonistic effects among R2R3-MYBs has essentially been derived from the studies of flowering plants (i.e. angiosperms) and remains to be extended to other seed-bearing plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The conifer MYBs Pinus taeda PtMYB1 and PtMYB8 were previously identified as positive regulators of monolignol biosynthesis (Bomal et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>It was also shown that PtMYB14 and PtMYB15 ectopic overexpression could up-regulate isoprenoid metabolism (Bedon et al., 2010), but these latter two MYBs were suspected to be potential repressors since they harbour the ERF-associated amphilic repression (EAR) motif (Ohta et al., 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Here, evidence is presented for antagonistic action among these four MYBs on a set of common target genes in shikimate and monolignol biosynthetic pathways in Picea glauca. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Comparative transcript profiling in PtMYB overexpression lines, diurnal variation of gene expression in secondary vascular tissues, transactivation assays, and DNA binding assays were used to identify the putative targets of P. glauca (Pg) R2R3-MYBs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>As such, the findings show that several R2R3-MYBs in P. glauca may act upon common targets through activation and repression of expression in two distinct but interconnecting pathways. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>This report presents comparative analyses of two pairs of functionally redundant conifer R2R3-MYBs from pine (Pt) and spruce (Pg), namely Pt/PgMYB1 and Pt/PgMYB8 of subgroups SG8 and SG13 (Bedon et al., 2007), and Pt/PgMYB14 and Pt/PgMYB15 of subgroup SG4 (Bedon et al., 2010), which were shown to impact different aspects of primary and secondary metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>On the one hand, Pt/PgMYB1 and Pt/PgMYB8 were linked to positive control of shikimate and monolignol biosynthetic genes and were proposed to be members of a transcriptional network similar to the SND1 cascade in spruce and pine (Bomal et al., 2008), which regulates secondary cell wall formation in Arabidopsis (Zhong et al., 2007, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, Pt/PgMYB14 and Pt/PgMYB15 were identified as putative positive regulators of isoprenoid and flavonoid metabolism, and linked to the regulation of defence responses in spruce and pine (Bedon et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p content-type="indent"><text><SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>In the present study, a comparative analysis of transcript profiles from constitutive overexpression of PtMYB1, PtMYB8, and PtMYB14 in spruce indicated that MYBs from different subgroups (SG8, SG13, and SG4) may impact a common set of genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>The transcript profiling results also pointed to activation or repression (i.e. up-/down-regulation) depending on the MYB that is overexpressed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Specifically, genes that were co-expressed in PtMYB1- and PtMYB8-overexpressing lines (e.g. up-regulation of shikimate and monolignol genes and down-regulation of flavonoid genes) had opposite expression in PtMYB14-overexpressing lines (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>The fact that 95% of the common sequences displayed an opposite expression profile between PtMYB1/PtMYB8 and PtMYB14 (Fig. 1) is unlikely to appear by chance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>In addition, pair-wise comparisons between PtMYB1 and PtMYB14, or PtMYB8 and PtMYB14 gave opposite expression profiles for 95% and 89% of the genes, respectively (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/ert398/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link> at JXB online). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p content-type="indent"><text><SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that constitutive overexpression of TFs may cause pleiotropic effects (Zhang, 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>In this context, the constitutive accumulation of PtMYBs in transgenic spruce may have sequestrated components of the transcriptional machinery away from cis-regulatory DNA elements by competing with cognate TFs (Gill and Ptashne, 1988). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>It was observed that the spatio-temporal transcript profiles of PgMYB genes and some of the candidate target genes were poorly correlated during a diurnal cycle, whatever the tissues tested (Table 1), indicating that pleiotropic effects may have affected some genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the RNA transcript profiling results were consistent with the proposed opposition effect, in a time-related and tissue-preferential manner, for several sequences in non-transgenic spruce plantlets (Table 1; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/ert398/-/DC1">Supplementary Tables S4</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/ert398/-/DC1">S5</ext-link> at JXB online). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Together, the expression profiles from the transgenics and the diurnal profile suggested that different conifer MYBs (from SG8, SG13, and SG4 subgroups) could directly target genes coding for key enzymes from interconnected pathways of amino acid (DHS2 and SHM4) and phenylpropanoid (4CL and COMT1) metabolism, specifically in differentiating secondary xylem. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Another explanation for the identification of a set of common misregulated genes could be linked to indirect effects of PtMYB overexpression, such as non-specific binding to cis-elements by highly conserved DBDs, as observed among conifer MYBs (Bedon et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>As suggested in Arabidopsis (Jin et al., 2000), structural genes with similar cis-regulatory motifs may be strongly influenced by such a dosage-linked effect and may become coordinately regulated due to high levels of specific regulators. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>This is likely to appear in gain-of-function experiments where abnormally high levels of MYBs are induced by overexpression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>In the transgenic spruce used here, PtMYB1, PtMYB8, and PtMYB14 transcript levels represented 33-, 40-, and 300-fold increases compared with their spruce endogenous counterparts PgMYB1, PgMYB8, and PgMYB14, respectively (Bomal et al., 2008; Bedon et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>However, these latter PgMYB transcripts showed a 3- to 5-fold variation in non-transgenic plants during the diurnal cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Under such circumstances, unspecific binding due to high levels of MYBs would be unexpected. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>It has been shown here that conifer R2R3-MYBs from different subgroups could have direct and opposite effects on the regulation of two pivotal genes encoding enzymes of the shikimate and monolignol biosynthetic pathways: DHS2 (3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase), which provides precursors for phenylpropanoid and flavonoid metabolism (Amthor, 2003), and 4CL (4-coumarate:CoA ligase), which converts 4-coumaric acid and other substituted cinnamic acids for use in the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds and the production of flavonoids and monolignols (Ehlting et al., 1999; Amthor, 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Transactivation assays and EMSAs provided two lines of evidence, in addition to expression data that support this conclusion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>First, transactivation assays revealed strong activation of the Pg4CL and PgDHS2 promoters for the spruce gene PgMYB8 of SG13 and a repression effect of PgMYB15 (SG4) on both promoters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>The closest pine homologues (PtMYB1, PtMYB8, and PtMYB14) showed similar activation and repression effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Secondly, PgMYB8 (SG13) as well as PgMYB14 and PgMYB15 (SG4) recombinant proteins are able to bind the same cis-element (AC-I) in the promoter region of these two genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>In Arabidopsis, typical AC cis-elements, also called MYB recognition elements (MREs) (Feldbrügge et al., 1997), were found in the promoters of the majority of shikimate, flavonoid, and monolignol biosynthetic genes (Raes et al., 2003; Hartmann et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2006; Prouse and Campbell, 2012). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p content-type="indent"><text><SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Two types of AC elements, AC-I (ACCTACC) and AC-II (ACCAACC/T), were identified in the promoter region of both the PgDHS2 and Pg4CL genes in spruce. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>EMSA analyses revealed that PgMYB8 (SG13), PgMYB14 (SG4), and PgMYB15 (SG4) recombinant proteins are able to bind the AC-I element in both of the promoter environments tested, suggesting a lack of MYB subgroup specificity for this element. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the PgMYB8 recombinant protein showed a strong affinity for the AC-II element while PgMYB14 and PgMYB15 showed no or weak affinity, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>The position of AC-II elements varied between the two genes (either 5′ upstream flanking or in the putative 5′ UTR) but only had a small impact on the binding results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>The extended affinity of conifer MYB for different AC elements (AC-I, AC-II, and AC-III) has been previously reported for PtMYB1 (Patzlaff et al., 2003a , b) and PtMYB4 (Gómez-Maldonado et al., 2004; Morse et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, recent work in Pinus pinaster (Pp) has also shown that PpMYB8 could bind an AC-II element in the promoter region of the Prephenate AminoTransferase (PAT) gene from the arogenate pathway (Craven-Bartle et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Thus, the affinity of spruce PgMYB8, PgMYB14, and PgMYB15 for AC elements in promoters of other genes of shikimate, arogenate, and phenylalanine metabolism should be further explored and extended to PgMYB from different subgroups. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p content-type="indent"><text><SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>The idea that a single target gene may be under the control of functionally redundant MYBs from the same subgroup is supported by increasing evidence (see Dubos et al., 2010; Zhong et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>In Arabidopsis, AtMYB58 and AtMYB63 (both of the SG3 subgroup) directly activated phenylpropanoid biosynthetic genes from PAL to CAD (Zhou et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Similarly, AtMYB11, AtMYB12, and AtMYB111 (all of the SG7 subgroup) activated the transcription of target genes from CHALCONE SYNTHASE (CHS) to FLAVONOL SYNTHASE (FLS) genes from flavonoid biosynthetic pathways (Stracke et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Redundancy in repression has also been observed for Antirrhinum AmMYB308 and AmMYB330 for the genes between C4H and CAD from the phenylpropanoid and monolignol biosynthetic pathways (Tamagnone et al., 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>In the conifers spruce and pine, PgMYB1, PgMYB8, and PgMYB14/PgMYB15 are phylogenetically distinct but share conserved DBDs (Bedon et al., 2007, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Therefore, their ability to compete for cis-elements via conserved DBDs is not unexpected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>The affinity for AC-I cis-elements observed for PgMYB8 and PgMYB14/PgMYB15 is congruent with this explanation and might be the basis of competition among MYBs on the same target. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>However, DNA binding site competition analysis revealed a strong propensity of PgMYB8 recombinant protein to bind the AC-I element when competing with PgMYB15 (Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Although other methods (such as quantitative assay in yeast or surface plasmon resonance) should be used to ascertain this latter result fully, it suggests that particular tissular and/or environmental (nutrition, stress) conditions may be needed for PgMYB15 to compete more strongly with PgMYB8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>A signature motif similar to the basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) interaction site has been identified in PgMYB14 and PgMYB15 peptide sequences (Bedon et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>The bHLH motif may entail interactions with other proteins, such as bHLH and WD40, which have been identified as important MYB partners in flavonoid pathways in different plant species (Vom Endt et al., 2002; Ramsay and Glover, 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>In addition, the conifer MYBs from the present study vary in their C-termini, which typically harbour the activation and repression domains (Dubos et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>According to Bedon et al. (2010), PgMYB14 and PgMYB15 harbour the C2 repressor motif containing the core EAR motif defined by Kranz et al. (1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the E. grandiis EgMYB1 sequence was shown to be very close to Pt/Pg MYB14/15 (Bedon et al., 2007, 2010) and was shown to act as a repressor of lignin biosynthesis (Legay et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>The differential regulatory effect of these PgMYBs on the same target is likely to be due to the presence of activation or repression domains, but complementary functional studies are needed to demonstrate whether PgMYB14 and PgMYB15 may act as active or passive repressors. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Several R2R3-MYBs have been described as regulators of specific aspects of primary or secondary plant metabolism, such as flavonoid, anthocyanin, monolignol, benzenoid, isoprenoid, shikimate, or glucosinolate biosynthesis (see Dubos et al., 2010; Feller et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>Their role has generally been associated with one single pathway, with an activation or repression function within the transcriptional network. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>However, studies in maize and Arabidopsis pointed out the dual activation/repression effect of R2R3-MYBs on genes from different pathways that compete for carbon flux. Zea mays ZmMYB31 was overexpressed in Arabidopsis and shown to down-regulate several genes involved in monolignol biosynthesis but also to up-regulate some flavonoid biosynthesis genes (Fornalé et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>The authors proposed that ZmMYB31 might play an important role in carbon partitioning between these pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Similarly, Arabidopsis AtMYB75 was shown to regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis positively in early development and to regulate the accumulation of lignin negatively in older plants (Bhargava et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>A similar dual effect on monolignol and anthocyanin biosynthetic pathways was revealed in the atmyb32 mutant that had an increased level of COMT1 transcripts and decreased amounts of DFR and ANS transcripts compared with the wild type (Preston et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>These MYBs belong to different subgroups and have opposite effects on two pivotal genes in the shikimate and monolignol biosynthetic pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>As proposed in Fig. 4, PgMYB15 could thus impact carbon flux dedicated to monolignol synthesis by competing negatively for promoter binding sites with PgMYB8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>This repression could simultanously affect gene expression of SHM4 (carbohydrate metabolism level), DHS2 (shikimate level), as well as 4CL and COMT (monolignol level). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Due to its repressive action, PgMYB15 could indirectly stimulate flavonoid and/or anthocyanin metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>In addition, the co-expression patterns of several other MYBs tested in the system used here indicate that regulation in these pathways may be extended to include other MYBs as well (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/ert398/-/DC1">Supplementary Tables S5</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/ert398/-/DC1">S6</ext-link> at JXB online). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>A genome-wide phylogenetic investigation of plants indicated that most families of TFs have expanded very significantly in flowering plants compared with Bryophyta/Lycopodiophyta, typically doubling in size around the time of their radiation (Lang et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Gymnosperms were not included in the study of Lang et al. (2010) but, as a representative of the gymnosperm lineage, P. glauca was estimated to have fewer MYBs than angiosperms: a total of 120 R2R3-MYBs, representing 0.43% of the catalogue of 27 720 unique expressed sequences (Rigault et al., 2011), compared with 0.96% of the annotated genes for both Arabidopsis and poplar. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>However, at least one subfamily of R2R3-MYBs (e.g. the SG4 subgroup) was shown to be larger in conifers than in most angiosperms (Bedon et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
