</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) poses a substantial public health problem worldwide [1–4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The exudative form is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss in subjects over 65 years of age living in economically developed countries and accounts for &gt;80% of cases of legal blindness associated with the disease [5–7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Risk estimation is crucial in order to provide adequate patient monitoring. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Fellow eyes of individuals with unilateral exudative AMD should receive the utmost attention since they are known to have an increased risk of developing choroidal neovascularization (CNV) [4, 5, 8, 9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The role of retinal imaging in AMD has long been recognized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Several studies have concluded that digital imaging is reliable for the purpose of grading AMD, both in clinical practice and in clinical trials [10, 11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The International Classification and Grading System [12] was created to provide a uniform and internationally accepted nomenclature and grading system for the disease, based on color fundus photography's morphological findings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Implementation of this system in large cohort epidemiological studies helped establishing significant determinants for the development of wet AMD [4, 13–15] and led to the creation of a fundus photography-based severity scale by the AREDS group [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>This simplified scale uses a point scoring system and estimates the 5-year risk of developing advanced AMD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The three variables included are the presence/absence of (1) large drusen (≥125 μm), (2) pigmentary changes (hypo- or hyperpigmentation) and (3) neovascular AMD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The major goals of risk estimation are to provide baseline risk categories, to allow tracking of progression, and to define surrogate outcomes for progression to the advanced forms of the disease [17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The importance of drusen characteristics (such as the area and number of drusen) in the development of wet AMD has been highlighted by several studies [13–15, 18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>When grading is performed with conventional reading center techniques, the depiction of these variables is categorical in nature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Taking the number of drusen as an example, a simplified categorical assessment, as provided by the International Classification and Grading System for AMD [12], would grade one image having 0, 1–9, 10–19, or ≥20 drusen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis models using continuous variables (such as the real number of drusen or the real area of drusen) are generally more robust, hence providing far more reliable results [19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The advent of computer-assisted grading systems represents a significant advance in retinal imaging. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Not only do they make the grading process more efficient, but they also deliver faster data analysis when compared to the more labor-intensive conventional reading center methods [18, 20–22]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Using a novel semiautomated grading software capable of categorical and continuous variable grouping (RetmarkerAMD), this study aims to evaluate the contribution of the ocular risk factors in the development of CNV in the fellow eyes of patients with unilateral exudative AMD. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Grading took place at the Coimbra Ophthalmology Reading Center (CORC) by graders certified by this institution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>For the certification process, an agreement between graders was developed as generalized kappa-type statistics, with a kappa value &gt;0.61 required for approval [23]. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The fundus signs allowed to be graded by this tool include (a) number of drusen (total, &lt;63 μm, ≥63 and &lt;125 μm, and ≥125 μm); (b) drusen type (hard, soft distinct, soft indistinct, semisolid, serogranular, or crystalline); (c) total area occupied by drusen (&lt;1%, &lt;10%, &lt;25%, &lt;50%, ≥50%, for central, inner, and outer circles separately); (d) cumulative real area occupied by drusen and area of each subfield; (e) confluence of drusen (absent, &lt;10%, &lt;50%, ≥50%); (f) hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation (absent, &lt;125 μm, &lt;175 μm, ≥175 μm) of the retinal pigment epithelium; (g) atrophic AMD; and (h) neovascular AMD. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>The patients were aged between 55 and 92 years (mean ± SD: 74.2 ± 6.86 years), with a slight female predominance—58.4% (n = 52). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>The average age at conversion of the study eye was 77.5 ± 6.16, years and the time to conversion ranged between 12 and 113 months (median 28.5; IQR 24–43). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period was 60.9 ± 31.3 months (median 37; IQR 36–74). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>The progression of the cumulative risk of conversion is shown in Figure 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>The incidence of CNV, calculated for the follow-up period, was 12.0%/year (95% CI = 0.088–0.162). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Even though drusen were universally identified (n = 89), pigmentary changes were only found in a small group of patients (n = 22). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>The variables initially tested to determine the predictive value of conversion in exudative AMD are shown in Table 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>In this first approach, we built the univariate analysis system using categorical variables, exported as such from the RetmarkerAMD software: number of drusen (0, 1–9, 0–19, ≥20), area occupied by drusen (&lt;1% &lt;10%, &lt;25%, &lt;50%, ≥50%), hypo- and hyperpigmentation (absent, &lt;63 μm, ≥63 μm), and confluence of drusen (&lt;10%, &lt;50%, ≥50%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Drusen area within the inner circle was the only variable demonstrating a statistically significant different distribution across the conversion group (P &lt; 0.05). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>In order to increase the robustness of the analysis, we used continuous variables: the real (absolute) number and area occupied by drusen (Table 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>We tested these variables for the totality of drusen and for large drusen (≥125 μm) only and separately for the central 1000 μm, 3000 μm, and 6000 μm in order to appraise the role of the location in the development of neovascular events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Results are shown in Table 4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>The real number of drusen in the central 1000 μm was the only variable with a statistically significant result (P &lt; 0.05). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regressions were then conducted, calculating the odds ratio (OR) for each covariate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>The parameters considered were real number of drusen, real area of drusen, presence of pigmentary changes, and age at diagnosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>We defined two models: (1) considering large drusen (≥125 μm) only and (2) considering the totality of drusen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>The results obtained for the two models tested are shown in Tables 5 and 6, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>In the first model, the increase in number of drusen ≥ 125 μm showed a positive effect on the risk of conversion in the central 3000 and 6000 μm regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>The increase in the area occupied by drusen ≥ 125 μm and the presence of hyperpigmentation resulted in a decreased risk of developing CNV. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Discussion </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Prior studies (MPS [14, 15], AREDS [16]) comprising grading and risk estimation based on morphological assessments of baseline color fundus photography used manual grading and had their grading data grouped according to the guidelines of the International Classification and Grading System for AMD [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>As such, depiction of variables such as the number (0, 1–9, 0–19, ≥20) and area occupied by drusen (&lt;1% &lt;10%, &lt;25%, &lt;50%, ≥50%) was categorical in nature, which inevitably produces some estimates that can be a source of bias. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Although still not widely used in clinical or research settings, the development of semi-automated image analysis systems can significantly reduce the time and expense involved in manual grading. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>The use of innovative software in digital color fundus photography grading is changing the way reading centers work around the world, as it represents a convenient and versatile way of imaging and grading fundus changes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Friberg et al. [19] used a computer-based algorithm to detect and characterize drusen on digitized images and showed that quantitative detection of drusen can be performed reproducibly and efficiently using this method [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>When compared to more labor intensive reading center techniques, the results were similar but the algorithm showed higher precision and accuracy [19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>RetmarkerAMD is a revolutionary platform with a user-friendly interface built upon the International Classification and Grading System for AMD's guidelines [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>The software has already been validated for quantification of AMD features [Simão, S. et al., poster presentation, ARVO 2011] and is currently being used in an ongoing epidemiologic study of AMD in the Portuguese population with an estimated number of 4000 participants (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=NCT01298674">NCT01298674</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>When compared to manual grading, the software was more effective and less time consuming (nearly 35% faster), allowing identification of 32% more lesions and reducing human error [Silva R., oral presentation, EURETINA 2010]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>One must not forget, however, that, even though the advantages of using computer-assisted grading systems are many, it may also be a source of bias. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>One example would be image calibration with the generation of the overlaying grid based on a reference optic disc with a diameter of 1.5 mm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Although this estimation of the optic disc diameter has been used in several studies, it does not account for the few cases where anatomic variants of the optic disc are present and may thus constitute a weakness of the software. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>RetmarkerAMD produces standardized and detailed records in Excel that allows easy data mining and statistical analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Variables can be grouped both in a categorical and in a continuous manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Since statistical models operating with quantitative variables provide more reliable results [19], we took advantage of this unique ability to explore the effect of drusen characteristics in the conversion of the fellow eye. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Our study combines the advantages of this innovative and validated semi-automated software with a long-term followup of a cohort consisting purely of fellow eyes of patients with unilateral AMD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>With this approach we meant to eliminate the most consistent risk factor for CNV [17, 18], consequently enabling better understanding of the role of drusen characteristics in the development of wet AMD. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>When testing the variables in a categorical manner, the total area occupied by drusen within the inner circle (central 3000 μm) was the only variable associated with the development of CNV (P &lt; 0.05). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>This finding is consistent with the results of the AREDS group [16], where variables were tested categorically, and drusen area appeared to be a stronger and more consistent risk factor than the number of drusen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, however, when we used continuous variables, namely, the real (absolute) number and area of drusen, the influence of drusen area in the conversion lost its statistical significance, and the real number of drusen in the central 1000 μm became the only variable correlated with the development of exudative AMD in the fellow eye (P &lt; 0.05). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>In order to clarify the role of each determinant independently, we conducted multivariate logistic regressions and calculated the odds ratio (OR) for each covariate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>We found that both the real number of (total) drusen (in the central 1000 and 3000 μm) and the real number of (large) drusen ≥ 125 μm (in the central 3000 and 6000 μm) were significant risk factors for the occurrence of neovascular events (P &lt; 0.05). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>However, the real area occupied by drusen ≥ 125 μm proved to be inversely correlated with the development of CNV (P &lt; 0.05). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>The AREDS group [16] stated that the number of large drusen (≥125 μm) is closely related to the total area of drusen and that the latter is a significant risk factor for wet AMD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>In a study conducted by Friberg et al. [21], aiming to determine the relationship between the number of drusen and drusen area, the authors found that the number of large drusen does not correlate better with total drusen area than drusen of other sizes, meaning that the number of large drusen is not necessarily a good surrogate for total drusen area. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>The same authors went further in another study [18] where digital images of 949 eyes of patients included in AREDS [16] and PTAMD [28] studies were retrospectively evaluated by computerized methods, and the variables were analyzed in a continuous manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>The author concluded that total drusen area was not a consistent risk factor for the development of CNV, and although the probability of a neovascular event would increase with increasing drusen area initially, the risk would then invert as a total drusen area of ~0.75 mm2 was reached (~60 large drusen) [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>This finding might justify our results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>One possible explanation would be that the eyes with higher drusen area develop geographic atrophy (GA) instead of CNV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>In CAPT [29], even though there was no association between any of the drusen measurements and the development of CNV, a correlation was found between drusen area and the development of GA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Like drusen size and area, pigmentary changes have also been recognized previously as a risk factor for progression to wet AMD, both in individuals free of advanced AMD bilaterally and in the fellow eye of subjects with unilateral exudative AMD [15, 16, 29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>The presence of hyperpigmentation is one of the risk factors associated with CNV determined by the MPS group [15] and is also part of the AREDS simplified severity scale [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>In our study, the presence of hyperpigmentation was inversely correlated with the development of exudative AMD in both models of multivariate analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>This finding was unexpected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Friberg et al. [18] found that this determinant was not a consistent risk factor for an eye's development of CNV, as the location of the hyperpigmentation would influence its effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>In CAPT [29], hyperpigmentation was associated both with CNV and GA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>As it represents degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and a relatively advanced stage of drusen evolution, it is possible that either CNV or GA can follow its appearance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Since we have not looked for the development of GA in our cohort, we cannot correlate both. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>The difficulties detecting hyperpigmentation and the relatively few patients where we found it (n = 22) may have influenced our results. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>The incidence of CNV in the fellow eyes of subjects with unilateral exudative AMD is known to be high. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>In our study there was a conversion rate of 12%/year (95% CI 0.088 to 0.162), a result consistent with other studies where it ranges from 6 to 12%/year [15, 25, 30–32]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>From the 89 patients enrolled, 42 (47.2%) developed CNV during the follow-up period (an average of 5.1 years). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>This number is higher than the ones reported by the extrafoveal trial of the MPS group [14] (25.7% in a cohort of 128 eyes with a 5-year followup) or the SST group [25] (26.9% in a cohort of 364 eyes with a 4-year followup). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>The long-term followup of our study (ranging from 36 to 148 months) may justify some of this discrepancy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>When comparing our results with the AREDS subgroup with unilateral exudative AMD, where the mean followup was 6.3 years, the disparity is less prominent (38.9% in a cohort of 714 eyes). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>The effect of systemic (smoking history, hypertension, body mass index, and dietary habits) or genetic factors in the conversion of the fellow eye was not accounted for in our study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Although these might have had some impact, apart from the smoking history, the influence of these determinants in the development of exudative AMD is substantially less important than the contribution of the ocular risk factors [13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of CNV was 7.9% at the 1st year, 23.6% at 2 years, 33.7% at 3 years, 39.3% at 5 years, and 47.2% at 10 years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>These results are identical to those identified in other large cohort studies [14, 15, 24–27], summarized in Table 7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Opposing to the studies of Caucasian populations, it is noteworthy to sign that, among Asians [27], the cumulative incidence of CNV in the fellow eye is considerably lower. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, RetmarkerAMD allowed the use of quantitative variables in the determination of the OR of developing CNV, thus establishing the real (absolute) number of drusen (in the central 1000 and 3000 μm) and the real number of drusen ≥ 125 μm (in the central 3000 and 6000 μm) as significant risk factors for the conversion of the fellow eye. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>The long follow-up period and the use of an innovative and validated semi-automated grading software reinforce the value of our results and support the influence of the ocular risk factors in the progression of the fellow eye to exudative AMD. </plain></SENT>
