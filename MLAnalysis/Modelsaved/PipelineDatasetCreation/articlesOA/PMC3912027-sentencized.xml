</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The type II transmembrane serine proteases are divided into four phylogenetically distinct subfamilies: the human airway trypsin-like (HAT)/differentially expressed in squamous cell carcinoma gene (DESC) subfamily, hepsin/transmembrane protease serine (hepsin/TMPRSS) subfamily, matriptase subfamily, and the corin subfamily. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>HATL5 belongs to the HAT/DESC subfamily together with HAT, DESC1, TMPRSS11A, and HAT-like 4 [1]–. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>HATL5 (HATL-5, HAT-like 5) is encoded by the TMPRSS11b gene located within a single gene cluster encompassing all the HAT/DESC genes in both mice and humans [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>All members of the HAT/DESC subfamily are comprised of a stem region with a single sea urchin sperm protein, enteropeptidase, agrin (SEA) domain, and a C-terminal serine protease domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>There is an extensive body of literature documenting critical roles of members of the hepsin/TMPRSS, matriptase, and corin subfamilies in physiological and pathological processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Critical roles for these TTSPs have been described in diverse areas and include epithelial development and homeostasis, iron metabolism, hearing, digestion, blood pressure regulation, as well as viral infection, inflammation, and oncogenesis [3] [5] [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Comparatively few studies characterizing the biochemical properties of the HAT/DESC subfamily and/or exploring their physiological functions have been published. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>HAT has been reported to have fibrinogenolytic activity, to modulate the urokinase receptor, and to activate protease activated receptor (PAR) 2 [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In addition, HAT can uncoat reovirus virions to promote infection in cell culture and cleaves the surface glycoprotein, hemagglutinin (HA), of the influenza virus [12] [13] [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Recently, a study employing genetic ablation of TMPRSS11A and HAT in mice demonstrated that the two proteases are dispensable for development, general health, and long-term survival in the absence of external challenges or additional genetic deficits [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In this study, we performed a biochemical characterization and expression analysis of HATL5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The full-length HATL5 cDNA directs the expression of a 60 kDa N-glycosylated protein that localizes to the cell surface of mammalian cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The purified activated HATL5 serine protease domain hydrolyzes synthetic peptide substrates, and is inhibited by members of two different serine protease inhibitor families: the Kunitz-type; HAI-1, HAI-2 and aprotinin, and the serpin family member; serpinA1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>HATL5 protein localization is remarkably similar in the three different tissues analyzed: cervix, esophagus, and oral mucosa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Thus, HATL5 is mainly detected on the surface of epithelial cells in these stratified squamous epithelia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>During carcinogenesis, expression of the cell-surface protease is largely diminished, and in many cases, undetectable in the squamous carcinoma cells. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>The expression of HATL5 cDNA in mammalian cells led to the production of a recombinant glycoprotein with one or more of the predicted five N-glycosylation sites in the serine protease domain being utilized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>The recombinant soluble pro-form of the HATL5 serine protease domain had no detectable catalytic activity and did not appear to undergo auto-activation under the various different conditions applied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>A previously described analysis of another HAT/DESC1 subfamily member, DESC1, rendered similar results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Expression of the recombinant DESC1 protease domain led to the generation of a zymogen that required cleavage by an exogenously added activating protease for conversion into a functionally active protease [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>It cannot be ruled out that lack of membrane anchorage in the recombinant truncated forms of HATL5 or DESC1 may hinder auto-activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>However, similar secreted forms of proteases belonging to the matriptase subfamily, matriptase, matriptase-2 and matriptase-3, are all capable of auto-activation [18] [29] [30] [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is plausible that the ability of zymogens to auto-activate may vary between subclasses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>The activities of most TTSPs are regulated by endogenous protease inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Members of several classes of inhibitors have been shown to inhibit various TTSPs, including serpins and Kunitz-type inhibitors, in vitro [32] [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Using genetic approaches it has been demonstrated that both HAI-1 and HAI-2 are critical physiological inhibitors of matriptase [25] [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>HATL5 is most effectively inhibited by the Kunitz-type inhibitor aprotinin/bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>Partial inhibition was observed with HAI-1, HAI-2, and serpinA1/α1-antitrypsin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>It remains to be elucidated whether regulation of HATL5 by one or more of these inhibitors occurs in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>Consistent with its structural characteristics, confocal immunofluorescence analysis of cultured mammalian cells confirmed that HATL5 protein is expressed on the cell surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>This cell surface expression was further confirmed in tissues (see below). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>The restricted expression profile of HATL5 mRNA in cervix, esophagus, tongue, and testes is in accordance with findings described by Sales and colleagues [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>In addition to these four tissues, they detected HATL5 message in the trachea of both mice and humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, HAT/DESC proteases are coordinately expressed on the message level in both humans and mice, suggesting a level of functional redundancy [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>It is unknown, however, whether HAT/DESC proteases are coordinately expressed on the protein level as well, and whether they are present in the same tissue compartments and cell types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Expression analysis of human tissues revealed a similar localization of HATL5 protein in the squamous stratified epithelia of the cervix, esophagus, and oral cavity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>HATL5 was consistently expressed in the upper apical layers harboring the most differentiated epithelial cells and was clearly confined to the cell surface in healthy epithelia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in squamous cell carcinoma of the same tissues, a significant decrease and, in many cases, a complete loss of HATL5 was observed in advanced cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>The localization of HATL5 protein in normal stratified squamous epithelia and the loss of the protease in cancer provide valuable information that may give clues to the function(s) of this protease in normal epithelial biology and carcinogenesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>In stratified squamous epithelia, a critical balance between cell proliferation, differentiation, and death must be maintained in order for these tissues to fulfill their function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>The stratified squamous epithelium acts as an effective barrier against the influx of luminal contents, including pathogens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>The multiple layers also make these specialized epithelia capable of withstanding abrasive stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>The proliferating epithelial cells reside in the basal layer and cells continuously move through a complex differentiation program to generate basolateral and apical cells that are finally sloughed off. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Tight junctions (TJs) separate the apical and basolateral cell surfaces to establish cell polarity and barrier function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Extracelluar proteases are known to be involved in differentiation and proper function of stratified squamous epithelia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>The TTSP, matriptase, is critical for terminal differentiation, function, and TJ formation in the epidermis and oral epithelium [34] [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Given the expression of HATL5 in the non-proliferating suprabasal/apical layers coupled with the observation that HATL5 is lost during the dedifferentiation of epithelial cells, a hallmark of squamous cell carcinogenesis, it will be important to explore whether the observed link between loss of HATL5 and squamous cell carcinoma progression is correlational or causal. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Currently, proteolytic substrates have not been identified for DESC1, TMPRSS11A, and HAT-like-4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>A screening of proteins that have previously been identified as in vivo and/or in vitro substrates for other TTSPs including pro-uPA, pro-HGF, and pro-prostasin, were not activated by HATL5 in cell-free or cell-containing experimental set-ups (unpublished data). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>An important task ahead is to identify substrates for HATL5 in stratified squamous epithelia cells and other cells/tissues expressing the protease. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>In summary, our current study constitutes a biochemical and protein expression characterization of HATL5 in healthy and cancerous tissues, and is a first step towards deciphering the functions of this HAT/DESC subfamily member. </plain></SENT>
