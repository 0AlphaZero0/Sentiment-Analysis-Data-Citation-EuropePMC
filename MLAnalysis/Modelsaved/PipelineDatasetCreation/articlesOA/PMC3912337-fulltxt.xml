First-pass metabolism is associated with many side effects, as the metabolites of these compounds affect human physiology (<xref rid="b3-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Conventional hormone therapy delivered by the oral route is used to relieve menopausal symptoms. Transdermal estrogens have not been used extensively in Brazilian women with menopausal symptoms; however, a recent long-term study indicated that there is no increased risk of breast cancer or vasomotor disorders in menopausal women using transdermal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) (<xref rid="b3-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>The technology of controlled-released drugs represents a innovative field and this kind of strategy may provide important contribution for human health (<xref rid="b4-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Recent studies on this methodology have used confocal Raman spectroscopy to describe in real time the drug concentration in each layer of the skin (<xref rid="b3-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Nanotechnology is a potent and effective tool that brings new perspectives to the health sciences, such as transdermal absorption. Recently, new and strong evidence has suggested that these types of drugs have interesting and unique properties (<xref rid="b5-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>The menopausal period is characterized by a significant decrease in estrogen and progesterone production and by an increasing follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels (<xref rid="b7-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with exogenous hormones relieves climacteric symptoms, but there are few long-term studies focused on transdermal hormone replacement therapy (THRT) as a strategy for treating climacteric symptoms (<xref rid="b8-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>HRT may have protective effects on osteoporosis (<xref rid="b9-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and heart disease (<xref rid="b10-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In recent studies, this hypothesis has been questioned because long-term use has fewer benefits than short-term use [11-14]. A recent long-term study on THRT yielded interesting findings regarding the safety and efficacy of an enhancer capable of delivering nanoparticles containing estriol and estradiol through the skin in menopausal women (<xref rid="b3-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>The present study was designed to determine the long-term effects of transdermal HRT using a nanostructured formulation of estriol (0.1%) combined with estradiol (0.25%) and progesterone (10%) to treat menopausal symptoms. The therapeutic effects were evaluated by clinical, laboratory, and radiographic parameters after a 5-year follow-up.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>Initially, written informed consent was provided by individuals willing to participate in a protocol approved by the ethics committee of University Paulista, UNIP, S&#227;o Paulo, Brazil. Written informed consent was obtained from every subject (UNIP #533/2009). The study was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02033512.</p></sec><sec><title>Study protocol</title><p>This prospective long-term clinical trial included female patients aged 51-70 years who were treated for menopause-related hormone imbalances. Other results from this study are published elsewhere. Volunteers were recruited from the Gynecological Medical Center in Fortaleza, Cear&#225;, Brazil, where patient charts are maintained.</p></sec><sec><title>Study population</title><p>This prospective long-term clinical trial assessed the effects of transdermal HRT on climacteric symptoms and hormone serum levels in early postmenopausal women. Preliminary results from the first 42 women enrolled have been previously published (<xref rid="b3-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>The 91 women enrolled in this trial fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: 1) last menstrual period between 6 months and 3 years before the beginning of the study and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels higher than 35 IU/L; 2) age between 51 and 70 years; and 3) no use of any medication known to interfere with hormonal levels in the past 6 months. Patients presenting with diabetes, previous hysterectomy, endometrial thickness greater than 5 mm, history of cancer, thromboembolism, or established cardiovascular disease were excluded.</p><p>Approximately 30% of the initial population was excluded from the study. The most common reason for exclusion was lack of the minimal number of consultations required. During the study, 25 participants were non-compliant with the treatment protocol and were excluded. The final studied population consisted of 66 postmenopausal women who were included in the transdermal hormone therapy protocol and the final data analysis.</p><p>In the present study, the subjects received a transdermal nanostructured formulation of estriol (0.1%) + estradiol (0.25%) and progesterone (10%) (Biolipid B2&#174;, Evidence, SP, Brazil) in the right and left forearms, respectively, daily for 60 months. The effects of transdermal hormone treatments were analyzed.</p><p>Clinical evaluations were performed before the treatment. Anthropometric measurements included body weight and blood pressure, and bilateral mammographies were performed before and during treatment. Blood pressure was measured using a digital sphygmomanometer (Omron HEM 742, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). All radiographic exams were performed by experienced, board-certified radiologists.</p></sec><sec><title>Nanostructured emulsion preparation</title><p>The nanoemulsion was developed at the Laboratory of Nanotechnology at University Potiguar in association with the Laboratory of Advanced Materials at Federal University of Cear&#225;. Two hormone + BIOLIPID/B2<sup>&#174;</sup> formulations were prepared, and the following mass ratios were obtained: nanoformulation 1: estriol (0.1%) + estradiol (0.25%) + Biolipid-B2<sup>&#174;</sup>; and nanoformulation 2: progesterone (10%) + Biolipid-B2<sup>&#174;</sup>.</p><p>Progesterone, estriol, and estradiol were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO, USA). The main components of the emulsion were the nanoparticulated hormones and a transdermal penetration enhancer vehicle (Biolipid<sup>&#174;</sup> B2, Evidence Pharmaceuticals, S&#227;o Paulo, SP, Brazil) containing oleic acid, phospholipids, and nutrients compatible with the dermal structure, which enhances transdermal drug delivery (<xref rid="b3-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>The hormone nanoparticles were prepared using a water-oil emulsion method with slight modifications (PCT Patent #WO 2012/009778 A2). The hormone nanoparticles were emulsified using a homogenizer (Art Labortechnik, M&#252;llheim, Germany) at 20,000 rpm for 180 s. The resultant emulsions were stored for 3 h at room temperature (<xref rid="b3-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Size and zeta-potential measurements</title><p>The size and zeta-potential of the progesterone particles were measured by a Zetasizer Nanoseries-ZS90 (Malvern, UK). The size measurements were performed in disposable sizing cuvettes at a laser wavelength of 633 nm and a scattering angle of 90&#176;, while the zeta-potential measurements were performed in disposable zeta-potential cells. Before the measurements, the progesterone particles were diluted 1:360 in Milli-Q water. Each measurement was repeated for 3 runs per sample at 25&#176;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Particle size measurements</title><p>Particle size analysis was performed by dynamic light scattering (DLS), also known as photon correlation spectroscopy, using a particle size analyzer (Zetasizer Nanoseries-ZS90, Malvern, UK). Prior to the measurements, all samples were diluted (1:360) using Milli-Q water to yield a suitable scattering intensity. DLS data were analyzed at 25&#176;C and with a fixed light incidence angle of 90&#176;. The mean hydrodynamic diameter (Z-average) and the polydispersity index (PDI) were determined as a measure of the width of the particle size distribution. The Z-average and PDI of the analyzed samples were obtained by calculating the average of 13 runs. The measurements were performed in triplicate.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical evaluation</title><p>The THRT consultation consisted of a brief lecture about the risks and benefits of transdermal HRT. During the entire treatment period, patients were asked to respond to questions about adverse effects using a standardized form to monitor symptom resolution. The patients were questioned regarding climacteric symptoms according to the Kupperman index. During this evaluation, a standardized form was used to monitor symptom resolution and adverse effects.</p><p>Blood samples were collected from the subjects early in the morning after an overnight fast. After serum testing, hormone deficiencies were identified, and if necessary, additional transdermal progesterone was prescribed. The patients were evaluated 3 months after completion of the THRT protocol.</p><p>To guarantee standardization and correct use of the THRT, all patients were instructed on how to use the progesterone pump for transdermal application by an experienced physician. Compliance was defined as completing 70% or more of the transdermal applications.</p><p>Compliance and satisfaction with the treatment were also evaluated by personal interviews. Furthermore, serum concentrations of blood lipids and biochemical inflammatory markers were measured, and the results are published elsewhere.</p><p>During the 60-month trial, patients were instructed to complete evaluation forms every 3 months after the first consultation to monitor symptoms and side effects. In addition, demographic data, including age and level of education, were assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Transdermal hormone replacement therapy (THRT) assay</title><p>On the right forearm, patients received a transdermal dose (1 pump of 0.8 g) of progesterone (10%) + Biolipid<sup>&#174;</sup>B2, and on the left forearm, they received another pump (0.8 g) of estriol (0.1%) + estradiol (0.25%) + Biolipid<sup>&#174;</sup>B2. This nanoformulation was administered daily for 60 months.</p><p>The severity of postmenopausal symptoms was evaluated by the form submitted after each 6 months of the study. Satisfaction with the transdermal hormone therapy was also evaluated at those times. Compliance with the regimen was checked by personal interviews. Furthermore, blood pressure and serum concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol were measured. During the 5-year trial, patients were instructed to complete evaluation forms every 6 months after the first consultation to monitor postmenopausal symptoms and side effects. A clinical examination with the same parameters was repeated after 3 months and every 6 months thereafter during the 5-year period. </p></sec><sec><title>Serum level assays</title><p>The patients underwent a baseline blood test before initiating the THRT. Samples were analyzed at the same clinical analysis laboratory, where the personnel were blinded to treatment status.</p><p>Serum levels of FSH were obtained by radio-immunoassay (Amerlite FSH). The FSH results were expressed as units per liter (IU/L). Blood was collected from each participant at the baseline visit, 3 months after treatment initiation, and every 6 months for 60 months. Serum levels of estradiol were obtained by radio-immunoassay. The estradiol results were expressed as picograms per milliliter (pg/mL).</p></sec><sec><title>Raman spectrometer assay</title><p>Raman confocal spectroscopy measurements were performed using the model 3510 Skin Composition Analyzer (River Diagnostics, Rotterdam, Netherlands). The test area (4&#215;4 cm) was marked on the forearm of each volunteer. The area was treated with 70 &#956;L of the estriol (0.1%), estradiol (0.25%), and progesterone (10%) formulation and evaluated. The formulation was applied to the skin and gently spread, without rubbing, using the tip of the micropipette. After 10 minutes, the measurements were initiated.</p><p>The forearm of the volunteer was placed on a fused silica window adapted to the measurement stage. Laser light was focused on the skin with a microscope objective located under the window. An internal video camera enabled inspection of the skin surface and selection of the measurement spot. To confirm the results, the experiments were performed twice on the volar forearms of the volunteers (<xref rid="b3-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Detailed Raman depth profiles were acquired through the stratum cornum, viable epidermis, and dermis. All Raman spectra were calibrated and corrected for instrument response using built-in instrument control software (River Diagnostics).</p><p>Depth profiles were collected 1, 3, 6, 21, and 24 hours after transdermal progesterone application. Six depth profiles were collected at each time point.</p></sec><sec><title>BI-RADS evaluation</title><p>The criteria adopted for BI-RADS exam classification were based on the American College of Radiology (ACR) guidelines. A negative screening examination is defined as one that is negative or yields benign findings (BI-RADS categories 1 and 2), and a positive screening examination is one that leads to a referral (BI-RADS categories 0, 4, or 5). The mammograms were evaluated independently by 2 certified radiologists who decided whether referral for further diagnostic assessment was necessary.</p></sec><sec><title>Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images</title><p>The electron microscopy analysis of the nanoparticles was conducted with a TESCAN SEM (Model VEGA/XMU, Brno, Czech Republic) using an accelerating voltage of 30 kV. All samples that were analyzed by SEM were previously sputtered with an approximately 20-nm gold layer.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical package for Windows version 10.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The data are presented as the means &#177; SEMs or as the medians. Differences between baseline and post-treatment mean values were evaluated by Student's t-test. The Friedman and sign tests were used for analysis of the Kupperman score. Categorical variables were compared using the chi-square and Fisher's exact tests. Normally distributed variables were reported as means (standard deviations). Paired data were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. All tests were two-sided. Significant differences were defined as <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Almost 25% of the initial population did not meet the inclusion criteria. Twenty-three patients were excluded from the study due to lack of consultation, viral infection, or urinary tract infection during the study.</p><p>Clinical evaluation was performed before the initial treatment and every 6 months during the trial. The anthropometric measurement included in this study was the body weight. The Kupperman score was assessed before and during treatment, and blood pressure was checked twice during each visit.</p><p>The effects of transdermal emulsions were beneficial during 60 months of follow-up. <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-cln_69p75">Table&#160;1</xref> presents the age, weight, blood pressure, and Kupperman score for 66 menopausal patients before and after 60 months of treatment.

The zeta potential is an important factor for evaluating the stability of a nanoemulsion. It is a function of the particle surface charge, which modulates the magnitude of the electrostatic repulsion between particles. In general, particles are considered stably dispersed when the zeta potential is below -30 mV or above 30 mV due to the electric repulsion between the nanoparticles.</p></sec><sec><title>Hormone particle size measurements</title><p>The mean particle sizes of the progesterone nanoparticles were measured by DLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-cln_69p75">Figure&#160;4B</xref>).

The skin depth and concentration of progesterone was measured in the stratum cornum (SC), viable epidermis (EPI), and dermis (D) at 1, 3, 6, 21, and 24 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-cln_69p75">Figure&#160;4D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Confocal Raman spectroscopy analysis was able to show a stable permeation of the hormones through the skin layers during the 24 hours period. This transdermal protocol was the basis for the development of an innovative proposal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-cln_69p75">Figures&#160;1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-cln_69p75">4D</xref>) using the nanostructured formulation used previously by our research group (<xref rid="b3-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). This study represents the first use of confocal Raman spectroscopy to validate the transdermal absorption of estrogens and progesterone administered through the skin in postmenopausal women. This methodology explains the effect of the Biolipid-B2&#174; enhancer used to continuously deliver estrogen and progesterone nanoparticles over a 24-hour period. Through this technique, it was possible to measure <italic>in vivo</italic> the depth and concentration of hormone nanoparticles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-cln_69p75">Figure&#160;1</xref>).</p><p>Transdermal HRT did not alter systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the treated subjects (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-cln_69p75">Table&#160;1</xref>). During the study, no antihypertensive medications were prescribed. These results are consistent with other studies showing that transdermal HRT did not have any impact on blood pressure (<xref rid="b4-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b9-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>This paper shows for the first time the changes in circulating estradiol and FSH after 60 months of transdermal HRT. In addition, no vaginal bleeding was reported and there was no patients with increased endometrial thickness.</p><p>Previous studies reported that HRT increases the risk of breast cancer (<xref rid="b11-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="b12-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). However, none of the 66 postmenopausal women treated with this protocol had a BI-RADS classification of 4 or 5 after 60 months of treatment. Another important outcome that was assessed was weight gain, which was not observed in the 60-month follow-up period (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-cln_69p75">Table&#160;1</xref>).</p><p>First-pass metabolism is often associated with poor bioavailability and other adverse effects (<xref rid="b1-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="b4-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Recent studies have shown that the transdermal route is the best way to treat menopausal symptoms (<xref rid="b3-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). When HRT is administered by other routes in postmenopausal women, the incidence of heart disease increases (<xref rid="b10-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>The cardiovascular risks associated with hormone replacement therapies (HRTs) differ according to the route used. There is strong evidence that transdermal estradiol has a cardioprotective effect. This effect may be due to its lack of effect on the coagulation cascade and resistance to activated protein C, which reduces the number of cardiovascular events compared with that in non-users (<xref rid="b11-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we demonstrated the safety and efficacy of a transdermal nanoparticulated hormone used as a stable and controlled release system to treat menopausal symptoms. One limitation of our study is that we were not able to evaluate additional advantages of this therapy.</p><p>A previous study showed that transdermal estrogen has a beneficial effect on blood pressure. We showed that the transdermal HRT protocol did not negatively impact blood pressure. These outcomes are consistent with previous studies that used the transdermal route for administration of HRT (<xref rid="b3-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b13-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>The protocol used in this study was an effective strategy for relieving postmenopausal symptoms, especially for women in whom the adverse effects of orally administered drugs are an inhibitory factor. We demonstrated that 60 months of treatment with this transdermal formulation significantly reduced postmenopausal symptoms compared with the baseline symptoms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-cln_69p75">Table&#160;1</xref>). The findings also suggested the efficacy of this protocol in restoring FSH levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-cln_69p75">Figure&#160;3</xref>).</p><p>The transdermal hormone enhancer Biolipid-B2<sup>&#174;</sup> is a vehicle used for delivering nanoparticle hormones into the 3 skin layers (<xref rid="b3-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-cln_69p75" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In Brazil, this enhancer has been used in more than 20 states and has been approved by the Brazilian Drug Regulatory Agency (ANVISA).</p><p>The zeta potential value of -54.2 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-cln_69p75">Figure&#160;4A</xref>) suggests that the hormone nanoparticles are physically stable. Their stability is due to the electrostatic repulsion conferred by the chemical nature of the lipid matrix and possibly the adsorption of negatively charged ions onto the nanoparticle surfaces.</p><p>This trial demonstrated that nanoemulsion hormone treatment effectively reduced symptoms and significantly restored the serum levels of estradiol and FSH. These outcomes support the continued investigation of transdermal nanoparticulated hormones as a potential therapeutic agent in postmenopausal therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We gratefully acknowledge the financial support of Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#237;fico e Tecnol&#243;gico - CNPq Brazilian Agency for Scientific and Technological Development (Post-Doctoral Scholarship Proc #151080/2010-0 and 202316/2011-4 and Research Scholarship #310483/2012-3).
