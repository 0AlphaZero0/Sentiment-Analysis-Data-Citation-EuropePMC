</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>There is an ongoing debate about the side effects of drugs administered orally (1-2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>First-pass metabolism is associated with many side effects, as the metabolites of these compounds affect human physiology (3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Conventional hormone therapy delivered by the oral route is used to relieve menopausal symptoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Transdermal estrogens have not been used extensively in Brazilian women with menopausal symptoms; however, a recent long-term study indicated that there is no increased risk of breast cancer or vasomotor disorders in menopausal women using transdermal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) (3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The technology of controlled-released drugs represents a innovative field and this kind of strategy may provide important contribution for human health (4,5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Recent studies on this methodology have used confocal Raman spectroscopy to describe in real time the drug concentration in each layer of the skin (3,4). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Nanotechnology is a potent and effective tool that brings new perspectives to the health sciences, such as transdermal absorption. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Recently, new and strong evidence has suggested that these types of drugs have interesting and unique properties (5,6). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The menopausal period is characterized by a significant decrease in estrogen and progesterone production and by an increasing follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels (7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with exogenous hormones relieves climacteric symptoms, but there are few long-term studies focused on transdermal hormone replacement therapy (THRT) as a strategy for treating climacteric symptoms (8). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>HRT may have protective effects on osteoporosis (9) and heart disease (10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In recent studies, this hypothesis has been questioned because long-term use has fewer benefits than short-term use [11-14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>A recent long-term study on THRT yielded interesting findings regarding the safety and efficacy of an enhancer capable of delivering nanoparticles containing estriol and estradiol through the skin in menopausal women (3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to determine the long-term effects of transdermal HRT using a nanostructured formulation of estriol (0.1%) combined with estradiol (0.25%) and progesterone (10%) to treat menopausal symptoms. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Confocal Raman spectroscopy analysis was able to show a stable permeation of the hormones through the skin layers during the 24 hours period. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>This transdermal protocol was the basis for the development of an innovative proposal (Figures 1 and 4D) using the nanostructured formulation used previously by our research group (3,4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>This study represents the first use of confocal Raman spectroscopy to validate the transdermal absorption of estrogens and progesterone administered through the skin in postmenopausal women. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>This methodology explains the effect of the Biolipid-B2® enhancer used to continuously deliver estrogen and progesterone nanoparticles over a 24-hour period. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Through this technique, it was possible to measure in vivo the depth and concentration of hormone nanoparticles (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Transdermal HRT did not alter systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the treated subjects (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>During the study, no antihypertensive medications were prescribed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with other studies showing that transdermal HRT did not have any impact on blood pressure (4,9). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>This paper shows for the first time the changes in circulating estradiol and FSH after 60 months of transdermal HRT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>In addition, no vaginal bleeding was reported and there was no patients with increased endometrial thickness. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Previous studies reported that HRT increases the risk of breast cancer (11-12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>However, none of the 66 postmenopausal women treated with this protocol had a BI-RADS classification of 4 or 5 after 60 months of treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Another important outcome that was assessed was weight gain, which was not observed in the 60-month follow-up period (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>First-pass metabolism is often associated with poor bioavailability and other adverse effects (1-4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown that the transdermal route is the best way to treat menopausal symptoms (3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>When HRT is administered by other routes in postmenopausal women, the incidence of heart disease increases (10). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>The cardiovascular risks associated with hormone replacement therapies (HRTs) differ according to the route used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>There is strong evidence that transdermal estradiol has a cardioprotective effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>This effect may be due to its lack of effect on the coagulation cascade and resistance to activated protein C, which reduces the number of cardiovascular events compared with that in non-users (11). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we demonstrated the safety and efficacy of a transdermal nanoparticulated hormone used as a stable and controlled release system to treat menopausal symptoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>One limitation of our study is that we were not able to evaluate additional advantages of this therapy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>A previous study showed that transdermal estrogen has a beneficial effect on blood pressure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>We showed that the transdermal HRT protocol did not negatively impact blood pressure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>These outcomes are consistent with previous studies that used the transdermal route for administration of HRT (3,13). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>The protocol used in this study was an effective strategy for relieving postmenopausal symptoms, especially for women in whom the adverse effects of orally administered drugs are an inhibitory factor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that 60 months of treatment with this transdermal formulation significantly reduced postmenopausal symptoms compared with the baseline symptoms (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>The findings also suggested the efficacy of this protocol in restoring FSH levels (Figure 3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>The transdermal hormone enhancer Biolipid-B2® is a vehicle used for delivering nanoparticle hormones into the 3 skin layers (3,4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>In Brazil, this enhancer has been used in more than 20 states and has been approved by the Brazilian Drug Regulatory Agency (ANVISA). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>The zeta potential value of -54.2 mV (Figure 4A) suggests that the hormone nanoparticles are physically stable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Their stability is due to the electrostatic repulsion conferred by the chemical nature of the lipid matrix and possibly the adsorption of negatively charged ions onto the nanoparticle surfaces. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>This trial demonstrated that nanoemulsion hormone treatment effectively reduced symptoms and significantly restored the serum levels of estradiol and FSH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>These outcomes support the continued investigation of transdermal nanoparticulated hormones as a potential therapeutic agent in postmenopausal therapy. </plain></SENT>
