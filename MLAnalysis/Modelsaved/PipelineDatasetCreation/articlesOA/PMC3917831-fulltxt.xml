However, the pursuit of further surrogate factors able to optimize therapeutic regimes remains challenging.</p><p>Beside the above mentioned parameters many studies suggested vitamin D (VitD) as an additional predictor of SVR, whereas low pretreatment levels of 25-OH-Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>) (&lt;20 ng/ml) associated significantly with low responsiveness to antiviral therapy<xref rid="pone.0087974-Bitetto1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0087974-Petta2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. However, recent findings also indicate that the pretreatment concentration of VitD is not always capable of predicting treatment outcome in chronic HCV infection <xref rid="pone.0087974-Lange2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> as well as in HCV/HIV-coinfected patients <xref rid="pone.0087974-Milazzo1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087974-Terrier1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.

Impressively in 39% of patients even more pronounced variations of VitD-levels (&gt;10 ng/ml) have been observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087974-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). However, no significant association between VitD-concentrations and SVR-rates was observed in uni- and multivariate analysis for both time points (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0087974-t002">Table 2</xref>). Furthermore, no significant association of baseline VitD levels to HCV-RNA kinetics was observed.

Also &#916;VitD-values were despite the observed variability unable to predict SVR rates (<italic>P</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;0.058).

Furthermore, baseline VitD concentrations failed to prognosticate outcome of antiviral therapy in HCV/HIV-coinfected patients as well <xref rid="pone.0087974-Milazzo1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087974-Terrier1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, thus further subsidizing the already observed controversy. However, assessment of VitD concentrations solely prior to treatment initiation as well as incomplete consideration of environmental and genetic factors affecting VitD levels constitute possible sources of bias in hitherto existing analyses. In the present study we intended to overcome some of these limitations by measuring VitD concentrations also at TW24 and by considering the seasonal variability of VitD levels and the effect of SNP&#8217;s within major regulatory enzymes. Since HCV infection has been suggested by previous studies to co-associate with VitD-deficiency <xref rid="pone.0087974-Lange3" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087974-Arteh1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087974-Fisher1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, we further intended to examine additionally whether the eradication of HCV had a reciprocal effect on VitD levels. Moreover, it remains unclear so far whether the additional evaluation of VitD levels during antiviral therapy plays a role in predicting SVR rates. Thereby we evaluated VitD concentrations at TW24 and beside significant variations within VitD concentrations neither associations to therapy outcome nor normalization of VitD levels in patients with SVR were identified at TW24.</p><p>Our results reveal substantial fluctuations of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> levels during antiviral therapy, which are affected by the month of blood collection, yet no association to treatment outcome was identifiable. While patients achieving a SVR feature a slight elevation of VitD levels between baseline and TW24 (from 15,8 ng/ml to 16,7 ng/ml) with nonSVR-patients featuring a slight reduction respectively (from 17,6 ng/ml to 16,3 ng/ml), no statistical significance has been observed between both groups. Also the analysis of an already identified SNP (rs10741657) <xref rid="pone.0087974-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> within the <italic>CYP2R1</italic> enzyme, with the latter being expressed in the liver and therefore among others being responsible for the generation of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>, showed no significant association to treatment outcome. In contrast, the also already proposed SNP within the <italic>CYP27B1</italic> enzyme (rs10877012), responsible for the generation of the active 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>, showed a non-significant trend to SVR- (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0087974-t002">Table 2</xref>) in univariate analysis. We assume, that we were unable to confirm the observed significant association <xref rid="pone.0087974-Lange3" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> due to the fact that the amount of patients being homozygote for the AA-allele was very limited (39 out of 366) in our patient cohort. Despite the fact that according to a recent study a prediction of SVR was possible depending on identification of the wild type allele of the VitD binding protein (<italic>DBP</italic>-rs4588 and -rs7041) <xref rid="pone.0087974-Falleti1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, no significant associations have been identified within our patient cohort. However, we identified a significant association between SVR rates and the rs12785878 SNP within the 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (<italic>DHCR7</italic>). <italic>DHCR7</italic> converts 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol thus removing the substrate from the synthetic pathway of VitD and finally regulating VitD levels <xref rid="pone.0087974-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, which is in accordance with our current observations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0087974-t003">Table 3</xref>). Furthermore, two recent studies identified the rs12785878 SNP within <italic>DHCR7</italic> to associate significantly with liver fibrosis progression in genotype 1 HCV infected patients <xref rid="pone.0087974-Petta3" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and with HCV-associated hepatocarcinogenesis respectively <xref rid="pone.0087974-Lange4" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Thus, we further examined whether the rs12785878 SNP within DHCR7 associated with fibrosis progression in our patient cohort as well. Thereby, we observed a significant association of the TT-genotype to fibrosis stage F3&#8211;F4 (<italic>P</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;0.013) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087974-g004">Figure 4</xref>), which is in accordance with previous published results <xref rid="pone.0087974-Petta3" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Since patients with low fibrosis show higher responsiveness to antiviral therapy compared to patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, the significant association of the <italic>DHCR7</italic> genetic polymorphism to SVR rates observed in our study appears logically consistent and adds further valuable information regarding the role of <italic>DHCR7</italic> and VitD metabolism in chronic HCV infection.</p><fig id="pone-0087974-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0087974.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>The <italic>DHCR7-TT-</italic>genotype of the <italic>rs12785878</italic> SNP shows a significant association to stage of fibrosis.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0087974.g004"/></fig><p>While clinical guidelines define VitD levels of &#8805;30 ng/ml as normal <xref rid="pone.0087974-Holick1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, we observed an overall VitD deficiency within the entire patient cohort which persisted even during antiviral therapy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0087974-t001">Table 1</xref>). The already mentioned previous studies suggesting VitD values being predictive of treatment response included patients with overall higher mean levels of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> concentrations <xref rid="pone.0087974-Bitetto1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087974-Falleti1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087974-Petta1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Thus, our results imply that the predictive ability of baseline 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> values observed in previous studies disappears in deficient concentration ranges. A possible explanation of this observed phenomenon is that the proposed synergistic effect of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> and IFN&#945; on the IFN-gene-expression and HCV replication <xref rid="pone.0087974-Lange2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> may be so substantially diminished at deficient concentration ranges that the predictive potential of VitD concentrations disappears. Furthermore, it is well known that 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> serum concentrations correlate poorly with serum and tissue levels of the bioactive vitamin D metabolite calcitriol <xref rid="pone.0087974-Rosen1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In a sub-analysis including only patients with normal VitD-concentrations (&#8805;30 ng/ml) still no significant association was observed between baseline VitD-levels and SVR rates (<italic>P</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;0.1). However, this sub-analysis could be confounded by the small amount of patients having normal VitD-levels at baseline (n&#8202;=&#8202;48) within our patient cohort. Moreover, as above mentioned, primary studies observing a positive correlation of VitD levels to SVR rates were conducted in countries with higher sun exposure and thus higher baseline VitD levels <xref rid="pone.0087974-AbuMouch1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0087974-Petta2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. However, further studies with HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, which were conducted in countries with high sun exposure as well, failed to show a positive correlation of VitD levels and SVR rates <xref rid="pone.0087974-Milazzo1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087974-Terrier1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, with a recent swiss cohort <xref rid="pone.0087974-Lange2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> even showing a positive trend between lower VitD levels and higher SVR rates, which is in line with our current findings. Since all trials, both in the Mediterranean area as well as in Northern Europe, showed similar SVR rates, we may conclude that variations within VitD levels are unable to predict SVR rates especially in regions with higher rates of VitD-deficiency as this is the case for Northern Europe.</p><p>Regarding the role of IP10, previous studies showed a significant decline during antiviral therapy which remains consistent in responders after HCV eradication and resolves with persistence of chronic HCV infection in non-responders <xref rid="pone.0087974-Romero1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087974-Casrouge1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. We observed a slight increase of IP10 levels at week 1 and a consecutive decrease of IP10-levels at week 4, with IP10 levels remaining predicting of SVR at each time point assessed, thus underlying the importance of IP10 in predicting treatment outcome. Therefore, we propose that especially the comprehensive evaluation of IP10 levels during antiviral therapy, as for instance at week 4, may increase the predictive potential of viral kinetics assessed at this time point of antiviral therapy. Moreover, low baseline gGT- and elevated cholesterol-levels appear as the strongest predictors of SVR after the <italic>IL28B</italic>-CC-genotype in our analysis. Since both parameters are routinely assessed in clinical biochemical screenings the specific consideration of both factors in clinical decisions might offer valuable comprehensive information regarding treatment prediction according to our analysis. A subanalysis within our patient cohort including patients with IL28B-CC-genotype, low IP10-levels (&lt;600ng/ml) <xref rid="pone.0087974-Darling1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, high cholesterol-levels (cut-off value of 174 mg/ml, calculated by ROC-analysis) and non-elevated gGT-values (n&#8202;=&#8202;41), showed an SVR-rate of 78,1% for these patients, which is similar to SVR-rates achieved by the currently standard-of-care triple therapy in genotype 1 patients with PEG-IFN/RBV in combination with telaprevir or boceprevir, both direct ketoamide inhibitors of the HCV-NS3-protease. Thus, we may conclude, that the PEG-IFN/RBV combination therapy could still display an option for carefully preselected patients according to the above mentioned treatment predictors especially in areas with limited health care budget.</p><p>Although offering promising results, our study had some limitations. Beside the fact that it is retrospective, VitD concentrations and SNP&#8217;s were available only in a subgroup of the entire patient cohort with possible selection bias not being excludable. With an overall VitD-insufficiency observed in the patient cohort, our study provides information regarding responsiveness to antiviral treatment in VitD-insufficient genotype 1 HCV patients. Despite our effort to minimize confounding factors such as consideration of seasonal and on-treatment variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087974-g001">Figure 1</xref>), data on prevalence of osteoporosis and parathyroid dysfunction were lacking in our analysis, thus potentially affecting the results of our studies. Furthermore, our study was conducted prior to the approval of direct acting NS3 protease inhibitors and therefore it does not resemble the current standard of care for genotype 1 HCV infected patients. However, in many countries worldwide no direct antiviral agents are yet available with PEG-IFN/RBV being still the standard of care.</p><p>In conclusion, our study implies that VitD concentrations are not a reliable prediction parameter in genotype 1 HCV patients undergoing PEG-IFN/RBV antiviral therapy. Fluctuations in VitD levels during antiviral therapy may be due to environmental factors rather than to virus- or antiviral therapy-related effects whereas the evaluation of SNP&#8217;s within VitD regulating enzymes constitutes an important component in further deciphering the role of VitD metabolism in chronic HCV infection.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Vitamin D levels assessed at baseline and at therapy week 24 show substantial variations during antiviral therapy but are unable to predict treatment outcome.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The rs12785878 SNP within <italic>DHCR7</italic> is significantly associated with sustained viral response rates, whereas further SNP&#8217;s within the Vitamin D binding protein and Vitamin D regulating enzymes showed no significant associations.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Baseline and under therapy IP10-levels are independently predicting therapy outcome especially in IL28B-nonCC-patients while low baseline gGT- and elevated cholesterol-levels appear as the strongest predictors of therapy outcome after the IL28B-CC-genotype.</p></list-item></list></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Catharina Fueller, Dany Perner and Doris K&#228;rger for excellent technical assistance, as well as Santosh Dias for valuable feedback on data analysis.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0087974-Neal1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
