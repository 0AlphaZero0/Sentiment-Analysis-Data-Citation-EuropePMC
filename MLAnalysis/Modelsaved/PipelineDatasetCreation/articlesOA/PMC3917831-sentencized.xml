</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Almost 3% of the world population is chronically infected with hepatitis c virus (HCV) and thus potentially confronted with life-threatening complications such as liver cirrhosis and liver cancer [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>During permanent attempts to improve therapeutic strategies, beside the recent approval of two novel direct acting antiviral compounds [2], several predictors of treatment response have been identified [3] with recent studies including gamma-glutamyl-transferase (gGT) [4], cholesterol [5], early viral kinetics [6], interferon-γ-inducible-protein-10 (IP10) [7], ferritin [8] and the interleukin-28B (IL28B) polymorphism [9] as further important predictors of sustained viral response (SVR) as well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>However, the pursuit of further surrogate factors able to optimize therapeutic regimes remains challenging. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Beside the above mentioned parameters many studies suggested vitamin D (VitD) as an additional predictor of SVR, whereas low pretreatment levels of 25-OH-Vitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) (&lt;20 ng/ml) associated significantly with low responsiveness to antiviral therapy[10]–[14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>However, recent findings also indicate that the pretreatment concentration of VitD is not always capable of predicting treatment outcome in chronic HCV infection [15] as well as in HCV/HIV-coinfected patients [16], [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Moreover, serum concentrations of 25(OH)D3 are getting affected by various factors such as nutrition, comorbidities and seasonal sunlight exposure [18] and since an additional hydroxylation step is needed, 25(OH)D3-levels just offer an indirect association to the active form of VitD, 1,25(OH)2D3. The latter has a half-life of only 4 hours and is detectable in much lower serum concentrations than 25(OH)D3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>1,25(OH)2D3 is additionally strongly affected by the serum levels of calcium, phosphate and parathyroid hormone with clinical guidelines still recommending the routine assessment of 25(OH)D3 as the appropriate parameter in order to monitor the VitD status of patients [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In this context genetic polymorphisms within key enzymes regulating the pathophysiology of VitD have been shown to affect substantially VitD signaling in clinical diseases [20], [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In chronic HCV infection genetic polymorphisms within VitD binding proteins [12], the CYP27B1-hydroxylase [22] and the VitD-receptor [23] have been shown to correlate significantly with the outcome of antiviral therapy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Purpose of the present study is therefore to evaluate the predictive potential of serum VitD levels both prior to as well as during antiviral therapy in a large (n = 398), well characterized cohort of genotype 1 HCV infected patients treated prospectively with pegylated interferon-α (PEG-IFNα) and ribavirin (RBV) for 24–72 weeks (INDIV-2 study) [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Since liver histology and genetic data were available in the majority of patients, we additionally evaluated genetic polymorphisms within major enzymes regulating 25(OH)D3- and 1,25(OH)2D3-concentrations, CYP2R1, CYP27B1, DHCR7, CYP24A1 and within VitD binding proteins (DBP). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Findings concerning the prediction of treatment outcome were further analyzed in association with several prognostic parameters being available prior to initiation, during and after completion of antiviral therapy in our patient cohort. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we included a comprehensive evaluation of genetic polymorphisms within VitD regulating enzymes that have been previously shown to affect VitD concentrations or to associate with outcome of antiviral therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Among all parameters screened we identified younger age, elevated baseline cholesterol levels, low baseline gGT and ferritin levels as well as the IL28B-CC-genotype as independent predictors of reaching a SVR whereas VitD levels, their under-therapy-fluctuations and most of the SNP’s within VitD regulating enzymes were not able to predict treatment outcome. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Recent findings from various studies investigating the role of VitD in chronic HCV infection offer conflicting evidence regarding the predictive potential of pretreatment VitD concentrations upon antiviral therapy regimes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>On the one hand low pretreatment VitD-concentrations are suggested to correlate with poor responsiveness to antiviral therapy [10]–[14] and on the other hand in 269 patients infected with various HCV genotypes [15] and in 317 patients infected with genotype 1 [22], all treated prospectively with PEG-IFN/RBV, VitD levels seem unable to predict treatment response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, baseline VitD concentrations failed to prognosticate outcome of antiviral therapy in HCV/HIV-coinfected patients as well [16], [17], thus further subsidizing the already observed controversy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>However, assessment of VitD concentrations solely prior to treatment initiation as well as incomplete consideration of environmental and genetic factors affecting VitD levels constitute possible sources of bias in hitherto existing analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>In the present study we intended to overcome some of these limitations by measuring VitD concentrations also at TW24 and by considering the seasonal variability of VitD levels and the effect of SNP’s within major regulatory enzymes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>Since HCV infection has been suggested by previous studies to co-associate with VitD-deficiency [22], [31], [32], we further intended to examine additionally whether the eradication of HCV had a reciprocal effect on VitD levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it remains unclear so far whether the additional evaluation of VitD levels during antiviral therapy plays a role in predicting SVR rates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Thereby we evaluated VitD concentrations at TW24 and beside significant variations within VitD concentrations neither associations to therapy outcome nor normalization of VitD levels in patients with SVR were identified at TW24. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Our results reveal substantial fluctuations of 25(OH)D3 levels during antiviral therapy, which are affected by the month of blood collection, yet no association to treatment outcome was identifiable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>While patients achieving a SVR feature a slight elevation of VitD levels between baseline and TW24 (from 15,8 ng/ml to 16,7 ng/ml) with nonSVR-patients featuring a slight reduction respectively (from 17,6 ng/ml to 16,3 ng/ml), no statistical significance has been observed between both groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Also the analysis of an already identified SNP (rs10741657) [33] within the CYP2R1 enzyme, with the latter being expressed in the liver and therefore among others being responsible for the generation of 25(OH)D3, showed no significant association to treatment outcome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the also already proposed SNP within the CYP27B1 enzyme (rs10877012), responsible for the generation of the active 1,25(OH)2D3, showed a non-significant trend to SVR- (Table 2) in univariate analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>We assume, that we were unable to confirm the observed significant association [22] due to the fact that the amount of patients being homozygote for the AA-allele was very limited (39 out of 366) in our patient cohort. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that according to a recent study a prediction of SVR was possible depending on identification of the wild type allele of the VitD binding protein (DBP-rs4588 and -rs7041) [12], no significant associations have been identified within our patient cohort. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>However, we identified a significant association between SVR rates and the rs12785878 SNP within the 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7). DHCR7 converts 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol thus removing the substrate from the synthetic pathway of VitD and finally regulating VitD levels [28], which is in accordance with our current observations (Table 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, two recent studies identified the rs12785878 SNP within DHCR7 to associate significantly with liver fibrosis progression in genotype 1 HCV infected patients [34] and with HCV-associated hepatocarcinogenesis respectively [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Thus, we further examined whether the rs12785878 SNP within DHCR7 associated with fibrosis progression in our patient cohort as well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Thereby, we observed a significant association of the TT-genotype to fibrosis stage F3–F4 (P = 0.013) (Figure 4), which is in accordance with previous published results [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Since patients with low fibrosis show higher responsiveness to antiviral therapy compared to patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, the significant association of the DHCR7 genetic polymorphism to SVR rates observed in our study appears logically consistent and adds further valuable information regarding the role of DHCR7 and VitD metabolism in chronic HCV infection. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>The already mentioned previous studies suggesting VitD values being predictive of treatment response included patients with overall higher mean levels of 25(OH)D3 concentrations [10], [12], [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Thus, our results imply that the predictive ability of baseline 25(OH)D3 values observed in previous studies disappears in deficient concentration ranges. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>A possible explanation of this observed phenomenon is that the proposed synergistic effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 and IFNα on the IFN-gene-expression and HCV replication [15] may be so substantially diminished at deficient concentration ranges that the predictive potential of VitD concentrations disappears. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it is well known that 25(OH)D3 serum concentrations correlate poorly with serum and tissue levels of the bioactive vitamin D metabolite calcitriol [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>In a sub-analysis including only patients with normal VitD-concentrations (≥30 ng/ml) still no significant association was observed between baseline VitD-levels and SVR rates (P = 0.1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>However, this sub-analysis could be confounded by the small amount of patients having normal VitD-levels at baseline (n = 48) within our patient cohort. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Moreover, as above mentioned, primary studies observing a positive correlation of VitD levels to SVR rates were conducted in countries with higher sun exposure and thus higher baseline VitD levels [11]–[14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>However, further studies with HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, which were conducted in countries with high sun exposure as well, failed to show a positive correlation of VitD levels and SVR rates [16], [17], with a recent swiss cohort [15] even showing a positive trend between lower VitD levels and higher SVR rates, which is in line with our current findings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Since all trials, both in the Mediterranean area as well as in Northern Europe, showed similar SVR rates, we may conclude that variations within VitD levels are unable to predict SVR rates especially in regions with higher rates of VitD-deficiency as this is the case for Northern Europe. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Regarding the role of IP10, previous studies showed a significant decline during antiviral therapy which remains consistent in responders after HCV eradication and resolves with persistence of chronic HCV infection in non-responders [36], [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>We observed a slight increase of IP10 levels at week 1 and a consecutive decrease of IP10-levels at week 4, with IP10 levels remaining predicting of SVR at each time point assessed, thus underlying the importance of IP10 in predicting treatment outcome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we propose that especially the comprehensive evaluation of IP10 levels during antiviral therapy, as for instance at week 4, may increase the predictive potential of viral kinetics assessed at this time point of antiviral therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Moreover, low baseline gGT- and elevated cholesterol-levels appear as the strongest predictors of SVR after the IL28B-CC-genotype in our analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Since both parameters are routinely assessed in clinical biochemical screenings the specific consideration of both factors in clinical decisions might offer valuable comprehensive information regarding treatment prediction according to our analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>A subanalysis within our patient cohort including patients with IL28B-CC-genotype, low IP10-levels (&lt;600ng/ml) [29], high cholesterol-levels (cut-off value of 174 mg/ml, calculated by ROC-analysis) and non-elevated gGT-values (n = 41), showed an SVR-rate of 78,1% for these patients, which is similar to SVR-rates achieved by the currently standard-of-care triple therapy in genotype 1 patients with PEG-IFN/RBV in combination with telaprevir or boceprevir, both direct ketoamide inhibitors of the HCV-NS3-protease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Thus, we may conclude, that the PEG-IFN/RBV combination therapy could still display an option for carefully preselected patients according to the above mentioned treatment predictors especially in areas with limited health care budget. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Although offering promising results, our study had some limitations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Beside the fact that it is retrospective, VitD concentrations and SNP’s were available only in a subgroup of the entire patient cohort with possible selection bias not being excludable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>With an overall VitD-insufficiency observed in the patient cohort, our study provides information regarding responsiveness to antiviral treatment in VitD-insufficient genotype 1 HCV patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Despite our effort to minimize confounding factors such as consideration of seasonal and on-treatment variability (Figure 1), data on prevalence of osteoporosis and parathyroid dysfunction were lacking in our analysis, thus potentially affecting the results of our studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our study was conducted prior to the approval of direct acting NS3 protease inhibitors and therefore it does not resemble the current standard of care for genotype 1 HCV infected patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>However, in many countries worldwide no direct antiviral agents are yet available with PEG-IFN/RBV being still the standard of care. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our study implies that VitD concentrations are not a reliable prediction parameter in genotype 1 HCV patients undergoing PEG-IFN/RBV antiviral therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Fluctuations in VitD levels during antiviral therapy may be due to environmental factors rather than to virus- or antiviral therapy-related effects whereas the evaluation of SNP’s within VitD regulating enzymes constitutes an important component in further deciphering the role of VitD metabolism in chronic HCV infection. </plain></SENT>
