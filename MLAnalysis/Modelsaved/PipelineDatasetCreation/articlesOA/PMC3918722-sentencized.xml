<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Pleurotus genera (Pleurotaceae, Agaricales, and Basidiomycetes) also known as oyster mushrooms are worldwide distributed macrofungi [1] that comprise various kinds of highly priced edible mushrooms [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Edible mushrooms are also a complete source of nutrition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>They are known for their high levels of fibers, carbohydrates, amino acids, proteins, vitamins, and many other minerals [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>To date, identification of edible mushrooms particularly Pleurotus genus has been constrained due to various factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Cultivated edible mushrooms that belong to the Pleurotus genus have been principally discriminated by their morphological features such as shape, colour and size of hymenophore, length, thickness and colour of stipe, yield, and duration for maturation [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>However, the notion of species differentiation based on environmental factors can be unreliable and lead to misidentification as well as erroneous taxonomic conclusions [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the number of fungal species that can be classified easily by morphological factors is not considerable [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Even in a country like Malaysia which has a vast diversity of mushrooms and where the medicinal and dietary properties of various edible fungi are widely known [7], not many studies have been conducted that concentrate on the phylogenetic relationships and discrimination of cultivated edible fungi, particularly by using molecular methods. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The advantages of identification are obvious. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>All cultivated varieties of fungi can face loss of genetic diversity and inbreeding effects [8] that force farmers to introduce new hybrids in their farms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The biggest concern would be of adaptation of new lines to the new environment and of tracking lines that remain stable in various environmental parameters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Classification of mushroom species and genus through the introduction of cultivated line transfers across farms and also between Asian countries could also be a challenge as the demand of this genus is rapidly expanding. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Moreover, classification of fungal species using DNA barcodes is a reliable and effective tool and it can be implemented at any period of hyphal development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>With the appearance of DNA based molecular methods, several molecular techniques, including SSR [9], RAPD [10], AFLP [8], and the sequences of mitochondrial SSU rRNA [11], cytochrome oxidase genes [12, 13], and partial EF1α and RPB2 gene [14] have been used to validate mushroom species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The existing investigations have no doubt assisted in fungal identification; however, some of the reports could not accurately categorize the fungi genera, particularly intraspecies of Pleurotus. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Up to the present, numerous studies demonstrated that internal transcribed spacer 1 and 2 regions [15] possessed a great potential to distinguish between species of fungi [16–18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>According to Schoch et al. [18], ITS region has the highest probability of successful identification for the broadest range of fungi, with the most clearly defined divergence level between inter- and intraspecific variation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>However, a number of previously reported studies demonstrated that ITS is not a powerful tool to distinguish many closely related fungal species [19, 20] as well as intragenus [5, 6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Although there are thoughts in inefficiency of this marker, Schoch and Seifert [21] still believe that ITS as a DNA barcode provides the best possible path to achieve this goal in fungi. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The intergenic spacer (IGS) regions are two noncoding and highly variable DNA units [22] that are located between conserved sequences of 25S, 5S, and 18S within the nuclear rRNA gene [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>IGS1 is normally shorter than IGS2 and can be easily used for discriminating strains of the uncultured species [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>However, only a limited number of studies have focused on IGS region as a systematic tool for species delimitation of the commonly cultivated edible mushrooms. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>According to Dupuis et al. [25], it has been shown that all marker groups have relatively equal success in delineating closely related species and that using more markers increases average delimitation success. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Hence, this study aimed (i) to develop new pairs of primer for amplification and sequencing of two highly variable regions of intergenic spacer (IGS) 1 and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 1 and 2, (ii) to investigate the molecular phylogeny and taxonomic relationships of common cultivated species of Pleurotus using variation at the IGS1 and ITS regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA, and (iii) to assess the ability of combined IGS1 and ITS regions as DNA barcode. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>At first, new pairs of primer for amplification and sequencing of two highly variable regions of intergenic spacer (IGS) 1 and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 1 and 2 were designed (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>The potential of integration of IGS1 and ITS regions as inter- and intraspecies marker was examined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>The efficiency of three conserved regions including IGS1, ITS, and a combination of IGS1 and ITS sequences was compared. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Several parameters were individually computed for each region (Table 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Three conserved regions were separately detected for each region (1: 126–227, 2: 355–400, and 3: 430–491 (IGS1) and 1: 1–111, 2: 363–466, and 3: 623–702 (ITS 1 and 2)). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Secondly, by use of the same samples, the IGS1 and ITS regions gave rise to 14 and 12 unique haplotypes, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>However with the integration of IGS1 and ITS, the number of haplotypes rose to 16, which demonstrated that the combination of IGS1 and ITS regions yielded higher intraspecies variation (Table 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Thus this integration would be a good benchmark for resolving the molecular phylogeny and taxonomic relationships of common cultivated species of Pleurotus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>The potential of these regions was further tested using various statistical tests. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) of IGS1 sequences revealed lower percentage of variation within the samples compared to among the samples (among: 88.98%; within: 11.02%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>However, AMOVA of ITS sequences showed lower variation within the species (7.27%) and high divergence among the species (92.73%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the combination of IGS1 and ITS regions fulfilled the prerequisite of being a potential marker by demonstrating 91.82% of variation among and 8.18% within the sequences (Table 4). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Thirdly, to recommend an efficient sequence-based DNA barcode for Pleurotus genus, the combined IGS1 and ITS regions were used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>The potential of this integrated sequence was then demonstrated by various statistical analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Population pairwise FST (spatial genetic differentiation) P values based on IGS1 sequences were calculated for eight groups of species including P. cystidiosus (1), P. eryngii (2), P. nebrodensis (3), P. ostreatus (4), P. pulmonarius (5), P. floridanus (6), P. sapidus (7), and P. citrinopileatus (8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference among P. floridanus, P. citrinopileatus and P. sapidus as well as P. nebrodensis, P. eryngii var. ferulae and P. eryngii. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these results were confirmed by the exact test of sample nondifferentiation based on haplotype frequencies (P ≤ 0.05). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the significant differences among the groups of P. floridanus, P. citrinopileatus, and P. sapidus were obtained by integration of IGS1 and ITS regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>In addition, higher FST and differentiation P values among P. nebrodensis, P. eryngii var. ferulae, and P. eryngii were observed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Homology search analysis by NCBI BLAST was performed for IGS1 sequences and eight published sequences which had great similarity with the experimental strains which were detected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>The most homologous sequences taken from the BLAST search were included in the current study as references, P. pulmonarius (AB234031-Japan); P. ostreatus (AB234030-Japan); P. eryngii (AB234047-Japan); P. nebrodensis (AY463034-China); P. eryngii (AB234045-Japan); P. eryngii (AB234042-Japan); P. eryngii (AB286142-Japan); P. eryngii var. ferulae (AB286124-Japan). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>However, through our BLAST search, the reference sequences were only found for the species of P. eryngii, P. pulmonarius, and P. ostreatus and there was no record for the sequences of P. sapidus, P. floridanus, P. cystidiosus, and P. citrinopileatus, meaning that the sequences obtained in this study had been deposited to NCBI GenBank for the first time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>The phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the sequences of IGS1 from our study (Table 1) in addition to the above-mentioned GenBank material (Table 3, Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>In addition to the IGS1 sequences, BLAST search analysis was performed for ITS sequences by NCBI BLAST. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Eight sequences which had great similarity were downloaded from NCBI GenBank (HM561973 (P. ostreatus), AB115050 (P. pulmonarius), AB286159 (P. eryngii var. ferulae), AB286173 and AB286174 (P. eryngii), EU424308 (P. nebrodensis), and AY315805 (P. cystidiosus)). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>The obtained sequences of IGS1 and ITS regions in addition to those previously deposited into GenBank were employed to construct a combined phylogenetic tree. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>The constructed UPGMA tree by solely IGS1 sequences separated the samples into two main groups of species which was not desirably able to classify the species (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>However, the construction of a phylogenetic tree based on integration of IGS1 and ITS sequences resulted in a confident taxonomic conclusion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>In total, the bootstrap values obtained in IGS1 tree were lower than the combination of two regions (Figures 2 and 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>At the first clade of both trees, P. pulmonarius members presented high homology with the previously deposited sequences of P. pulmonarius (AB234031 and AB115050 from Japan) [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>The phylogenetically different species of P. floridanus (FPFMK), P. citrinopileatus (FPCMC), and P. sapidus (FPSPT) that were wrongly categorized in a single clade by IGS1 sequences could clearly be distinguished by integration of IGS1 and ITS sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Another distinct achievement of combined IGS1 and ITS regions compared to solely IGS1 was the provision of more precise classification and discrimination of P. eryngii, P. eryngii var. ferulae, and P. nebrodensis (Figure 4). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>The relationships between combined IGS1 and ITS haplotypes were profoundly assessed by constructing the genealogical medianjoining network (Figure 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Results obtained showed that 16 haplotypes belonged to eight species and one variety could clearly be distinguished. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>According to the network tree, haplotype 1 (H_1 : P. cystidiosus) and H_13 (P. citrinopileatus) were segregated from the other species by a number of mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>H_1, H_13, and H_9 (P. pulmonarius) were connected together by 3 median vectors (13, 14, and 15). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>A distinct outcome that made MJ network analysis superior than phylogenetic tree emerged when a greater discrimination of P. pulmonarius members was demonstrated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>H_8 (P. pulmonarius, AB234031 + AB115050) was connected to H_10 (P. pulmonarius, Thai strain) by mv3, and H_10 consequently linked to H_9 (P. pulmonarius, local strains) by a mutation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Discussion </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>The identification of precise taxonomic position of species is essential when selection programs are being employed for any new strain developmental experiments as well as for any newly designed mushroom breeding programs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>As for domestication and hybridization breeding, the intra- and interspecies information is highly valuable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>ITS region will be a useful marker for interspecies information that allows farmers to recognize the species of interest for crossbreeding, hybrid vigour, and minimizing of inbreeding effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Farmers can then have records of movement of species within and between farms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>This will give farmers an opportunity not to arrive at an erroneous conclusion by recognizing the targeted species as an incorrect species [39, 40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>As noted earlier, a number of molecular based markers have been hitherto employed to investigate phylogenetic relationship and taxonomic hierarchy of the edible mushrooms, particularly Pleurotus genus [9, 41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>However, many such studies on fungal strain identification have been performed by common morphological characteristics [5, 11] which were unreliable and misleading [42, 43]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>The current study revealed that P. pulmonarius was placed in a distinct clade with the P. pulmonarius strains referenced from NCBI GenBank (AB234031 + AB115050 from Japan) [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Based on the study done by Fries [44], this species nominated as L. sajor-caju was later renamed as P. sajor-caju by Singer [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>However, based on morphological traits and microscopic comparisons done by Pegler and Yi-Jian [46], it was proposed that L. sajor-caju should not be categorized as P. sajor-caju. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Another study done by Li and Yao [47] based on molecular and morphological data led to the findings and agreement that the scientific name of this species is P. pulmonarius. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>However, the most recent report done by Shnyreva et al. [48] confirmed that P. sajor-caju and P. pulmonarius are two separate species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>The present study revealed that the available reference sequences identified as P. pulmonarius in the NCBI database, in accordance with taxonomic classification, suggested that the strains used in this study may relate to P. pulmonarius.  </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>The phylogenetic tree based on integration of IGS1 and ITS regions assisted towards the proper classification of species and strains (Figure 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>However, the solely implemented IGS1 sequences resulted in a tree which compiled three distinct species of P. floridanus, P. citrinopileatus, and P. sapidus in one clade (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the IGS1 tree was not able to distinguish species of P. nebrodensis and P. eryngii var. ferulae from P. eryngii. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>In addition to the ambiguities generated by using single IGS1, prior studies on other molecular markers have also pointed out various ambiguities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Great similarity was reported between P. pulmonarius and P. eryngii (96% bootstrap support) as well as between P. sapidus and P. colombinus (100% bootstrap support) by Gonzalez and Labarère [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>However, Zervakis et al. [49] and Iracabal et al. [50] disclosed a close relationship between P. ostreatus and P. colombinus and    P. eryngii and P. cystidiosus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>In total, the positions of P. pulmonarius, P. sapidus, P. sajor-caju, P. colombinus, P. eryngii, P. flabellatus, and P. cystidiosus have remained ambiguous and some of these species have been wrongly grouped together in the same branch [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>However, the acquired phylogenetic tree based on combined sequences of IGS1 and ITS regions provided such variation within and among species that could clearly delimit the examined species and strains. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>In the present study, desirable AMOVA results were achieved when IGS1 and ITS sequences of the examined samples were combined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>The combined regions gave better genetic differentiation among and within species with a high genetic variation of 91.82% and 8.18%, respectively (Table 4). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Though the parsimony network analysis can deliver a better understanding of the relationships within the genus, based on the precise literature, no record was found to show the use of this analysis for Pleurotus genus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>In spite of achieving a proper classification of species by integration of IGS1 and ITS sequences, the phylogenetic tree showed the misclassification of the species of P. nebrodensis and P. eryngii var. ferulae with other strains of P. eryngii. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the median joining network could differentiate between the above-mentioned species (Figure 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Moreover, P. pulmonarius (H_10) which was previously grouped together with P. pulmonarius (H_9) by phylogenetic tree proved to be distinguishable by MJ network analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Hence, by employment of the MJ network tree as well as combination of IGS1 and ITS regions, the experimental species and strains used in the present study were properly discriminated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>According to Meyer and Paulay [51], two principal elements are proposed in DNA barcoding: (1) the ability to assign an unknown sample to a known species and (2) the ability to detect previously unsampled species as distinct. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>This study proved that the combination of ITS and IGS regions with demonstrating simple amplification, location between conserved ribosomal genes, and adequate divergence levels (among and within populations) can be employed as a fungal DNA barcode. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Moreover, according to Gilmore et al. [52], Nguyen and Seifert [12], and Vialle et al. [53], DNA barcoding and sequence-based molecular identification are known to be a small and standardized DNA fragment which could be amplified simply. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>However, the amplification and combination of IGS1 and ITS regions in this study required extra work and also the obtained fragments were not small and standard (&gt;1.1 kb). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the prospect of assigning an unknown to a known is promising especially for well-known, comprehensively sampled groups [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Moreover, according to Dupuis et al. [25], it has been shown that all marker groups have relatively equal success in delineating closely related species and that using more markers increases average delimitation success. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Thus, in order to discover a consensus and powerful DNA barcodes for identification of fungal strains and species, this study suggests that more comprehensive sampled groups should be employed and/or new regions and molecular markers should be developed and consequently a comparison study should be conducted. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study demonstrated the potential of the integration of IGS1 and ITS sequences of common cultivated Pleurotus species as an efficient inter- and intraspecies DNA marker. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>This marker could be used as a sequence-based DNA barcode because it presented sufficient variation among and within species, distinct sequences, simple amplification, and location between ideal conserved ribosomal genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>However, this study suggests that new molecular markers should be developed which can easily be employed for identification of the Pleurotus genus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Moreover, due to nonavailability of comprehensive sampled groups, we suggest examination of this highly variable marker with a greater sample size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>The analyses used in the current study such as the medianjoining network, phylogenetic trees, AMOVA, haplotype data file, and sites information could provide a wide understanding of the species' relationships. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>To sum up, integration of IGS1 and ITS regions is recommended for identification of mushroom species in breeding programs including the domestication of native edible fungi, studies on structure mating types, and the production of high yield hybrids. </plain></SENT>
