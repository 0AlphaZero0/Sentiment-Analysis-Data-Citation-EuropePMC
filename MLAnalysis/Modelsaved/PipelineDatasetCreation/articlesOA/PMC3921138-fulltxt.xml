Understanding how wood components are synthesized will help us design strategies for better utilization of wood for biofuel production. One of the major wood components is xylan, in which about 10% of xylosyl residues are substituted with glucuronic acid (GlcA) side chains. All the GlcA side chains of xylan in wood of <italic>Populus trichocarpa</italic> are methylated, which is different from Arabidopsis xylan in which about 60% of GlcA side chains are methylated. Genes responsible for methylation of GlcA side chains in <italic>Populus</italic> xylan have not been identified. Here, we report genetic and biochemical analyses of four DUF579 domain-containing proteins, PtrGXM1, PtrGXM2, PtrGXM3 and PtrGXM4, from <italic>Populus trichocarpa</italic> and their roles in GlcA methylation in xylan. The <italic>PtrGXM</italic> genes were found to be highly expressed in wood-forming cells and their encoded proteins were shown to be localized in the Golgi. When overexpressed in the Arabidopsis <italic>gxm1/2/3</italic> triple mutant, PtrGXMs were able to partially complement the mutant phenotypes including defects in glucuronoxylan methyltransferase activity and GlcA methylation in xylan, indicating that PtrGXMs most likely function as glucuronoxylan methyltransferases. Direct evidence was provided by enzymatic analysis of recombinant PtrGXM proteins showing that they possessed a methyltransferase activity capable of transferring the methyl group onto GlcA-substituted xylooligomers. Kinetic analysis showed that PtrGXMs exhibited differential affinities toward the GlcA-substituted xylooligomer acceptor with PtrGXM3 and PtrGXM4 having 10 times higher <italic>K</italic>
<sub>m</sub> values than PtrGXM1 and PtrGXM2. Together, these findings indicate that PtrGXMs are methyltransferases mediating GlcA methylation in <italic>Populus</italic> xylan during wood formation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the Division of Chemical Sciences, Geosciences, and Biosciences, Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the U.S. Department of Energy through grant DE-FG02-03ER15415.

Therefore, wood is an important reservoir for fixed carbon and plays a significant role in the regulation of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> level. Furthermore, wood is a raw material vital for numerous applications, such as burning for energy, pulping and paper-making, construction, and furniture-making, and it is a renewable source for biofuel production <xref rid="pone.0087370-Carroll1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Because of the immense role wood plays in our daily life, tremendous efforts have been devoted into understanding how wood is synthesized in order to develop molecular and genetic tools for custom-designing wood composition tailored for diverse end uses <xref rid="pone.0087370-Mellerowicz1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Wood is mainly composed of three wall polymers, i.e., cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin, the proportion of which varies among different tree species. Cellulose, consisting of linear chains of &#946;-1,4-linked glucosyl residues, is the predominant constituent ranging from 41% to 51% in softwood and hardwood from gymnosperms and angiosperms, respectively <xref rid="pone.0087370-Timell1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Genes encoding cellulose synthase catalytic subunits involved in wood formation have been identified and functionally characterized in tree species <xref rid="pone.0087370-Joshi1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.

Genes encoding enzymes in the phenylpropanoid pathway leading to monolignol biosynthesis have been identified in tree species and transgenic trees with altered expression of lignin biosynthetic genes exhibit reduced lignin content and/or altered lignin composition <xref rid="pone.0087370-Vanholme1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>The third major wood component is hemicellulose, which consists mainly of xylan and glucomannan. In softwood, glucomannan is the predominant hemicellulose (about 20% of wood) and xylan is only half as abundant, whereas in hardwood, xylan is the predominant hemicellulose (ranging from 20 to 35% of wood) and glucomannan is a minor component (about 3% of wood) <xref rid="pone.0087370-Timell1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

<italic>Populus</italic> is one of the many plant species that have been considered for use as lignocellulosic biofuel feedstocks <xref rid="pone.0087370-Carroll1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The bulk of <italic>Populus</italic> feedstock is wood, which is mainly composed of cellulose (43&#8211;48%), xylan (18&#8211;28%) and lignin (19&#8211;21%) <xref rid="pone.0087370-Mellerowicz2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Therefore, a complete understanding of how these wood components are synthesized will be instrumental for a better utilization of this abundant feedstock for biofuel production. Previous studies have demonstrated that a number of genes, belonging to GT43, GT47, and GT8 families, are involved in the biosynthesis of the backbone and the reducing end sequence of xylan in <italic>Populus</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0087370-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087370-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0087370-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Our current finding that four <italic>Populus</italic> DUF579 domain-containing proteins, PtrGXM1, PtrGXM2, PtrGXM3 and PtrGXM4, are methyltransferases that mediate GlcA methylation in xylan further enriches our understanding of the biosynthesis of xylan, the second most abundant polysaccharide in dicot wood.</p><p>Several lines of genetic and biochemical evidence demonstrate that the four PtrGXMs are wood-associated glucuronoxylan methyltransferases. First, they are expressed in developing wood undergoing secondary wall thickening. Second, the expression of <italic>PtrGXMs</italic> except <italic>PtrGXM4</italic> is activated by PtrWND2B, a master transcriptional switch regulating the secondary wall biosynthetic program during wood formation. Since there are 11 other wood-associated PtrWND homologs in <italic>Populus</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0087370-Zhong2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, it is possible that <italic>PtrGXM4</italic> expression is regulated by other PtrWNDs. Third, PtrGXMs are able to partially restore the deficiency in GlcA methylation in xylan when expressed in Arabidopsis <italic>gxm1/2/3</italic> triple mutant. Fourth, their recombinant proteins exhibit a methyltransferase activity capable of transferring the methyl group from <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-L-methionine onto the GlcA-substituted xylooligomer acceptor. As PtrGXMs are unable to transfer the methyl group onto GlcA or UDP-GlcA, it is clear that the methylation of GlcA occurs after it is added onto the xylan backbone. Further biochemical analysis of PtrGXMs revealed that while PtrGXM1 and PtrGXM2 share similar biochemical properties in the temperature optimum, <italic>K</italic>
<sub>m</sub> and <italic>V</italic>
<sub>max</sub>, PtrGXM3 is more similar to PtrGXM4, which is consistent with the phylogenetic analysis showing that PtrGXM1 and PtrGXM2 are a pair of genes likely originated from genome duplication, and so are PtrGXM3 and PtrGXM4. It is interesting to note that PtrGXM3 and PtrGXM4 have much higher substrate affinities and reaction rates than PtrGXM1 and PtrGXM2, indicating that the GlcA methylation in <italic>Populus</italic> xylan might be mainly mediated by PtrGXM3 and PtrGXM4.</p><p>Although the structure of xylan, including the xylan backbone, the reducing end sequence, the degree of acetylation and the frequency of GlcA substitution, between <italic>Populus</italic> and Arabidopsis is similar <xref rid="pone.0087370-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087370-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, the degree of methylation of GlcA side chains differs significantly. The GlcA side chains in <italic>Populus</italic> xylan are all methylated, whereas only about 60% of the GlcA side chains in Arabidopsis xylan are methylated. It is currently unknown what factors account for the difference of the degree of GlcA methylation in xylan between <italic>Populus</italic> and Arabidopsis. Enzyme kinetic analysis of PtrGXMs revealed that although PtrGXM1 and PtrGXM2 showed <italic>K</italic>
<sub>m</sub> values (3.25 and 3.98 mM, respectively) similar to that of the Arabidopsis glucuronoxylan methyltransferase GXM3/GXMT1 (<italic>K</italic>

<sub>m</sub> values of PtrGXM3 and PtrGXM4 (0.30 and 0.29 mM, respectively) were about 8 times lower. This finding indicates that PtrGXM3 and PtrGXM4 have a much higher substrate affinity than the Arabidopsis glucuronoxylan methyltransferase, which may enable a complete methylation of the GlcA side chains in <italic>Populus</italic> xylan during wood formation. It is also possible that the amount of GXM enzymes for GlcA methylation is much higher in <italic>Populus</italic> wood than in Arabidopsis secondary wall-forming cells, and therefore sufficient glucuronoxylan methyltransferase activities are available for a complete methylation of GlcA side chains in xylan in <italic>Populus</italic> but not in Arabidopsis.</p><p>Although expression of PtrGXMs in the Arabidopsis <italic>gxm1/2/3</italic> triple mutant restored the level of glucuronoxylan methyltransferase activities close to that of the wild type, the PtrGXM-complemented transgenic plants only resulted in a partial restoration of GlcA methylation in xylan. This partial complementation could be due to several possible reasons. Since multiple GXMs are expressed in cells undergoing xylan biosynthesis in both <italic>Populus</italic> and Arabidopsis, it is possible that the expression of one PtrGXM in the <italic>gxm1/2/3</italic> mutant may not be sufficient to catch up with the overall rate of xylan biosynthesis so that only a fraction of GlcA side chains are methylated. It is also possible that GlcA methylation is carried out by a protein complex containing GXMs and other xylan biosynthetic enzymes. PtrGXM sequences may have diverged from Arabidopsis GXMs to such a degree that they may not be efficiently incorporated into the Arabidopsis xylan biosynthetic enzyme complex and hence there is not sufficient GXM activity available in the complex to restore GlcA methylation during xylan biosynthesis in planta. This possibility appears to be in agreement with the observation that although expression of PtrGXMs in the <italic>gxm1/2/3</italic> mutant only led to low levels of GlcA methylation in xylan, the glucuronoxylan methyltransferase activity as assayed in vitro, which does not require the xylan biosynthetic enzyme complex, was restored to a much higher level.</p><p>The potential use of <italic>Populus</italic> as a bioenergy feedstock for biofuel production largely depends on whether it is sufficiently economical to convert cell wall polysaccharides into fermentable sugars <xref rid="pone.0087370-Carroll1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. One of the major obstacles for efficient utilization of plant biomass for biofuel production is biomass recalcitrance, i.e., resistance of cell walls to enzymatic digestion into sugars.
