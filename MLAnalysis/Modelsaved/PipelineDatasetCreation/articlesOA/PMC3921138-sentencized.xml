</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Terrestrial plants fix about 56 billion metric tons of carbon annually, of which nearly half is stored in wood, the most abundant plant biomass [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Therefore, wood is an important reservoir for fixed carbon and plays a significant role in the regulation of atmospheric CO2 level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, wood is a raw material vital for numerous applications, such as burning for energy, pulping and paper-making, construction, and furniture-making, and it is a renewable source for biofuel production [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Because of the immense role wood plays in our daily life, tremendous efforts have been devoted into understanding how wood is synthesized in order to develop molecular and genetic tools for custom-designing wood composition tailored for diverse end uses [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Wood is mainly composed of three wall polymers, i.e., cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin, the proportion of which varies among different tree species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Cellulose, consisting of linear chains of Î²-1,4-linked glucosyl residues, is the predominant constituent ranging from 41% to 51% in softwood and hardwood from gymnosperms and angiosperms, respectively [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Genes encoding cellulose synthase catalytic subunits involved in wood formation have been identified and functionally characterized in tree species [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Lignin is a complex polyphenolic polymer, the content of which varies from 25 to 35% in softwood and 18 to 25% in hardwood [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Genes encoding enzymes in the phenylpropanoid pathway leading to monolignol biosynthesis have been identified in tree species and transgenic trees with altered expression of lignin biosynthetic genes exhibit reduced lignin content and/or altered lignin composition [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The third major wood component is hemicellulose, which consists mainly of xylan and glucomannan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In softwood, glucomannan is the predominant hemicellulose (about 20% of wood) and xylan is only half as abundant, whereas in hardwood, xylan is the predominant hemicellulose (ranging from 20 to 35% of wood) and glucomannan is a minor component (about 3% of wood) [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Glucomannan is composed of Î²-1,4-linked glucosyl and mannosyl residues, and genes encoding mannan synthases responsible for glucomannan biosynthesis have been identified and biochemically characterized in several tree species, such as Populus and pine [7], [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Xylan from hardwood consists of a linear chain of Î²-1,4-linked xylosyl residues, to which 4-O-methylglucuronic acid (MeGlcA) side chains are attached at O-2 [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Hardwood xylan is often heavily acetylated; 40 to 60% of xylosyl residues contain acetyl groups at O-2 and/or O-3, depending on the tree species [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In addition, the reducing end of hardwood xylan from birch and Populus contains a tetrasaccharide sequence, Î²-d-Xyl-(1â3)-Î±-l-Rha-(1â2)-Î±-d-GalA-(1â4)-d-Xyl, that is distinct from the xylosyl backbone [10], [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The biosynthesis of xylan requires a suite of enzymes that are responsible for the xylan backbone elongation, side chain addition and modification, and the synthesis of the tetrasaccharide reducing end sequence [12]â[18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Our understanding of genes involved in xylan biosynthesis during wood formation in tree species is still limited. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Early genomic studies of wood formation in poplar led to the first identification of a number of glycosyltransferase genes, belonging to families GT2, GT8, GT43 and GT47, that are potentially involved in the biosynthesis of wood components [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Further molecular and biochemical analyses of some of these wood-associated glycosyltransferase genes have demonstrated that family GT43 genes in Populus are functional orthologs of Arabidopsis GT43 genes and they form two functionally non-redundant groups responsible for the elongation of xylan backbone [13]â[15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Several other Populus wood-associated glycosyltransferase genes, PoGT8D, PoGT8E/PoGT8F and PoGT47C, have been shown to be functional orthologs of Arabidopsis IRX8, PARVUS and FRA8, respectively, that are involved in the biosynthesis of the xylan tetrasaccharide reducing end sequence but their exact biochemical functions have not been revealed [11], [14], [16]â[18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Genes responsible for glucuronic acid (GlcA) substitution, GlcA methylation, and acetylation of xylan in tree species have not been characterized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In Arabidopsis, three GUX genes encode glucuronyltransferases mediating GlcA substitution of xylan [19], [20] and three GXM genes encode methyltransferases catalyzing GlcA methylation of xylan [21], [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Acetylation of Arabidopsis xylan involves RWAs and ESK1 [23], [24], [25]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In this study, we performed functional analysis of four Populus genes encoding DUF579 domain-containing proteins that are induced by PtrWND2B, a wood-associated master transcriptional regulator controlling secondary wall biosynthesis [26], [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>These PtrWND2B-induced genes, namely PtrGXM1, PtrGXM2, PtrGXM3, and PtrGXM4, are highly expressed in developing wood in Populus stems and their encoded proteins are localized in the Golgi. PtrGXMs are close homologs of Arabidopsis GXMs that have recently been demonstrated to encode methyltransferases catalyzing GlcA methylation of xylan [21], [22] and they were able to partially restore the 4-O-methylation of GlcA in xylan when overexpressed in the Arabidopsis gxm1/2/3 triple mutant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Moreover, recombinant PtrGXMs exhibit a methyltransferase activity transferring the methyl group from the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine to GlcA-substituted xylooligomer acceptors. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>The bulk of Populus feedstock is wood, which is mainly composed of cellulose (43â48%), xylan (18â28%) and lignin (19â21%) [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a complete understanding of how these wood components are synthesized will be instrumental for a better utilization of this abundant feedstock for biofuel production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated that a number of genes, belonging to GT43, GT47, and GT8 families, are involved in the biosynthesis of the backbone and the reducing end sequence of xylan in Populus [11], [13]â[18]. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Several lines of genetic and biochemical evidence demonstrate that the four PtrGXMs are wood-associated glucuronoxylan methyltransferases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>First, they are expressed in developing wood undergoing secondary wall thickening. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Second, the expression of PtrGXMs except PtrGXM4 is activated by PtrWND2B, a master transcriptional switch regulating the secondary wall biosynthetic program during wood formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Since there are 11 other wood-associated PtrWND homologs in Populus [27], it is possible that PtrGXM4 expression is regulated by other PtrWNDs. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>As PtrGXMs are unable to transfer the methyl group onto GlcA or UDP-GlcA, it is clear that the methylation of GlcA occurs after it is added onto the xylan backbone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Further biochemical analysis of PtrGXMs revealed that while PtrGXM1 and PtrGXM2 share similar biochemical properties in the temperature optimum, K m and V max, PtrGXM3 is more similar to PtrGXM4, which is consistent with the phylogenetic analysis showing that PtrGXM1 and PtrGXM2 are a pair of genes likely originated from genome duplication, and so are PtrGXM3 and PtrGXM4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>It is interesting to note that PtrGXM3 and PtrGXM4 have much higher substrate affinities and reaction rates than PtrGXM1 and PtrGXM2, indicating that the GlcA methylation in Populus xylan might be mainly mediated by PtrGXM3 and PtrGXM4. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>The GlcA side chains in Populus xylan are all methylated, whereas only about 60% of the GlcA side chains in Arabidopsis xylan are methylated. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Enzyme kinetic analysis of PtrGXMs revealed that although PtrGXM1 and PtrGXM2 showed K m values (3.25 and 3.98 mM, respectively) similar to that of the Arabidopsis glucuronoxylan methyltransferase GXM3/GXMT1 (K mâ=â3.85 mM) that is responsible for the bulk of the GlcA methylation of xylan [22], the K m values of PtrGXM3 and PtrGXM4 (0.30 and 0.29 mM, respectively) were about 8 times lower. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>This finding indicates that PtrGXM3 and PtrGXM4 have a much higher substrate affinity than the Arabidopsis glucuronoxylan methyltransferase, which may enable a complete methylation of the GlcA side chains in Populus xylan during wood formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>It is also possible that the amount of GXM enzymes for GlcA methylation is much higher in Populus wood than in Arabidopsis secondary wall-forming cells, and therefore sufficient glucuronoxylan methyltransferase activities are available for a complete methylation of GlcA side chains in xylan in Populus but not in Arabidopsis. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>This partial complementation could be due to several possible reasons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Since multiple GXMs are expressed in cells undergoing xylan biosynthesis in both Populus and Arabidopsis, it is possible that the expression of one PtrGXM in the gxm1/2/3 mutant may not be sufficient to catch up with the overall rate of xylan biosynthesis so that only a fraction of GlcA side chains are methylated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>It is also possible that GlcA methylation is carried out by a protein complex containing GXMs and other xylan biosynthetic enzymes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>PtrGXM sequences may have diverged from Arabidopsis GXMs to such a degree that they may not be efficiently incorporated into the Arabidopsis xylan biosynthetic enzyme complex and hence there is not sufficient GXM activity available in the complex to restore GlcA methylation during xylan biosynthesis in planta. </plain></SENT>
