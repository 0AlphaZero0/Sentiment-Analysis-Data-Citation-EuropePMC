By interrogating allele frequencies in more than 100 diverse human populations and resequencing Neanderthal DNA, we confirmed the ancestral state of this locus and found a strong geographical gradient for the derived allele (Val372), with near fixation in West Africa. In extensive coalescent simulations, we show that the extreme differences in allele frequency, yet absence of a classical sweep signature, can be explained by the effect of a local recombination hotspot, together with directional selection favoring the Val372 allele in Sub-Saharan Africans. The possible functional effect of the Leu372Val substitution, together with two pathological mutations at the same codon (Leu372Pro and Leu372Arg) that cause acrodermatitis enteropathica (a disease phenotype characterized by extreme zinc deficiency), was investigated by transient overexpression of human ZIP4 protein in HeLa cells. Both acrodermatitis mutations cause absence of the ZIP4 transporter cell surface expression and nearly absent zinc uptake, while the Val372 variant displayed significantly reduced surface protein expression, reduced basal levels of intracellular zinc, and reduced zinc uptake in comparison with the Leu372 variant. We speculate that reduced zinc uptake by the ZIP4-derived Val372 isoform may act by starving certain pathogens of zinc, and hence may have been advantageous in Sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover, these functional results may indicate differences in zinc homeostasis among modern human populations with possible relevance for disease risk.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Zinc is an essential trace element with many biological functions in the body, whose concentrations are tightly regulated by different membrane transporters. Here we report an unusual case of positive natural selection for an amino acid replacement in the human intestinal zinc uptake transporter ZIP4. This substitution is recognized as one of the most strongly differentiated genome-wide polymorphisms among human populations. However, since the extreme population differentiation of this non-synonymous site was not accompanied by additional signatures of natural selection, it was unclear whether it was the result of genetic adaptation. Using computer simulations we demonstrate that such an unusual pattern can be explained by the effect of local recombination, together with positive selection in Sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover, we provide evidence to suggest functional differences between the two ZIP4 isoforms in terms of the transporter cell surface expression and zinc uptake. This result is the first genetic indication that zinc regulation may differ among modern human populations, a finding that may have implications for health research. Further, we speculate that reduced zinc uptake mediated by the derived variant may have been advantageous in Sub-Saharan Africa, possibly by reducing access of a geographically restricted pathogen to this micronutrient.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>JE was supported through a Postdoc scholarship from the Volkswagenstiftung (Az: I/85 198).

To date, whether this variant has evolved under positive selection or neutrality, and its potential functional significance, has not been examined.</p><p>In the work reported here, we had three main objectives: (i) to investigate evolutionary explanations for the extreme population differentiation of the ZIP4 Leu372Val polymorphism by use of coalescent simulations; (ii) to test for functional differences in cellular zinc transport between the alleles of the Leu372Val polymorphism using a heterologous expression system; and (iii) to discuss potential selective forces behind this possibly adaptive event and their implications for zinc homeostasis in modern humans. We have extensively characterized the extreme geographical differentiation of the Leu372Val substitution and provide evidence that it has been subject to a nearly complete but mild selective sweep in Sub-Saharan Africa. Our simulations show how the extreme pattern of population differentiation, yet absence of other classical signatures of positive selection, can be explained by directional selection accompanied by the effects of a recombination hotspot near the polymorphic adaptive site. Additionally, our data demonstrate <italic>in vitro</italic> functional differences between the two human polymorphic alleles at codon 372 of the human ZIP4 transporter in surface protein expression, basal intracellular levels of zinc and zinc uptake. We hypothesize that the reduction in intracellular zinc levels mediated by the Val372 allele may have been advantageous in Sub-Saharan Africa, possibly by restricting access of a geographically restricted pathogen to this micronutrient, and that other possible secondary consequences for disease risk and health may result from the differential activity of the ZIP4 alleles.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Worldwide allele frequencies</title><p>Five common non-synonymous SNPs are known in the human <italic>ZIP4</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004128-t001">Table 1</xref>): Glu10Ala (rs2280839), Ala58Thr (rs2280838), Ala114Thr (rs17855765), Thr357Ala (rs2272662) and Leu372Val (rs1871534). However, only the latter two SNPs show elevated levels of population differentiation in the 1000 Genomes Phase1 sequencing data when comparing the Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI) with either the Han Chinese from Beijing, China (CHB) or Utah residents of Northern and Western European origin (CEU). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004128-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>, their F<sub>ST</sub> values fall above the 99.999 th percentile of the genome-wide F<sub>ST</sub> distributions between CEU-YRI (with F<sub>ST</sub> values for rs2272662 and rs1871534 of 0.48 and 0.98, respectively) and between CHB-YRI (with F<sub>ST</sub> values of 0.51 and 0.98, respectively). We therefore verify that the Leu372Val substitution encoded by SNP rs1871534 is the non-synonymous polymorphism exhibiting the most extreme allele frequency differences in the human <italic>ZIP4</italic> gene. Next, we genotyped the 51 populations from the Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP) and compiled additional allele frequencies for this position in worldwide populations from the Alfred database <xref rid="pgen.1004128-OsierM1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004128-Rajeevan1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Additionally, we obtained new data from a Pygmy population from Gabon and North African populations of Western Sahara, Morocco, and Libya. These new data confirm that the Leu372 variant is the most common allele outside of Africa, and provide a more detailed picture of the geographical allele frequency distributions of this non-synonymous polymorphism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004128-g001">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004128.s010">Table S1</xref>). Overall, the Val372 variant showed the highest frequencies in Sub-Saharan Africa, with populations such as the Ibo or the Yoruban people exhibiting the most extreme derived allele frequencies worldwide (0.99 and 0.96, respectively). Interestingly, two presumably early-branching groups in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Pygmy and the San people, showed opposing trends in the derived allele frequency (0.94 and 0.0, respectively). Even though the small sample size from the San (only six individuals) means that a population frequency of up to 0.221 cannot be excluded (with p&#8202;=&#8202;0.05 based on assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and a binomial approach), such divergent tendencies in these two Sub-Saharan populations are maintained. Given the elevated levels of population differentiation of the SNP rs2272662, we also genotyped the HGDP panel for the Thr357Ala polymorphism. However, compared with the Leu372Val substitution, the derived allele at this non-synonymous SNP displayed intermediate frequencies worldwide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004128.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004128.s010">Table S1</xref>) and less extreme allele frequency differences between populations.</p><fig id="pgen-1004128-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1004128.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Extreme population differentiation of the Leu372Val polymorphism in <italic>ZIP4</italic> (<italic>SLC39A4</italic>).</title><p>(A) Distribution of F<sub>ST</sub> pairwise scores between CEU and YRI in SNPs from the 1000 Genomes data, plotted on a linear and logarithmic scale.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004128-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, the observed values for F<sub>ST</sub> and most of the different neutrality statistics cannot be explained by neutral evolution or positive selection with a constant recombination rate. Instead, this atypical pattern of extreme population differentiation, yet seemingly neutral Tajima's D and other neutrality statistics, showed a higher recovery in simulations with directional selection on the derived allele in Sub-Saharan African populations in the context of the observed recombination landscape, including the hotspot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004128-g003">Figure 3D and 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004128.s004">Figure S4</xref>). In a more formal evaluation of the results, we quantified the empirical probability for each scenario and neutrality test as well as for different combinations of tests by using composite scores encompassing at least three complementary signatures of positive selection: (i) site frequency spectrum, (ii) population differentiation, and (iii) haplotype structure. The scenario of &#8220;weak selection (s&#8202;=&#8202;0.005) + hotspot&#8221; is the most likely among the different ones tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004128.s011">Table S2</xref>). Moreover, all the empirical likelihoods calculated for the different composite scores indicate that the proposed scenario of &#8220;weak selection (s&#8202;=&#8202;0.005) + hotspot&#8221; is more likely than the neutral scenario (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004128-t002">Table 2</xref>). Therefore, our simulation results indicate that the atypical patterns of selection in the <italic>ZIP4</italic> gene can indeed be explained by positive selection having acted upon the Val372 allele in Sub-Saharan African populations and that recombination has erased further accompanying signatures of the selective sweep. Selection coefficients lower than the ones tested (3.0%, 1.0%, 0.5%) further dilute the signal of selection in the site frequency spectrum based neutrality tests (results not shown), but require such long duration times of the sweep that would substantially predate the population split between African and Eurasian populations.</p><fig id="pgen-1004128-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1004128.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Genomic context and patterns of selection in a 10<italic>ZIP4</italic> (<italic>SLC39A4</italic>).</title><p>(A) Structure of the human <italic>ZIP4</italic> (<italic>SLC39A4</italic>) gene.

On the contrary, all common ZIP4 variants (Ala357, Thr357, Leu372 and Val372) promoted increased intracellular zinc levels. However, and in agreement with their reduced surface expression, Val372 variants (in both Ala357 and Thr357 backgrounds) presented lower basal zinc content compared to Leu372 (P&lt;0.01 and P&lt;0.05, respectively; one way ANOVA versus the Ala357-Leu372 isoform; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004128-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).

By interrogating and compiling allele frequencies in more than 100 worldwide human populations, we further characterized the extreme population differentiation of the Leu372Val polymorphism and confirmed that this result was not an artifact of allele switching <xref rid="pgen.1004128-Xue1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Given the worldwide distribution of the human derived and ancestral alleles (confirmed by sequencing a Neanderthal and phylogenetic conservation), we conclude that this sweep must have taken place within Africa, probably in Sub-Saharan Africa, and not outside the African continent. Notably, the extreme population differentiation of the Leu372Val polymorphism represents the top fourth region within the global genome-wide F<sub>ST</sub> distribution between CEU-YRI obtained from the 1000 Genomes Project data. The only CEU-YRI F<sub>ST</sub> values that are more extreme all involve well-known examples of local geographical adaptation in humans: the <italic>SLC24A5</italic> and <italic>SLC45A2</italic> genes (with an F<sub>ST</sub> of 0.9826 and 0.9765, respectively), which have been associated with light skin pigmentation in Europeans; and the <italic>DUFFY</italic> gene (with an F<sub>ST</sub> of 0.9765), which provides resistance to the malaria pathogen <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic>. Moreover, with the notable exception of <italic>DUFFY</italic> FY*O allele <xref rid="pgen.1004128-Hamblin1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004128-Hamblin2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, most of the extreme F<sub>ST</sub> values obtained when comparing Africans with non-Africans are usually attributed to local adaptation outside of Africa. Our detection of such a rare signature of natural selection in the African continent is therefore quite remarkable. Interestingly, it is congruent with a recent study that has found only limited evidence for classical sweeps in African populations, which is likely due to a combination of limitations of the currently used methodology and specific characteristics of African population history <xref rid="pgen.1004128-Granka1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>Notably, we observed a nearly complete but mild selective sweep for the Val372 variant in Africa, which involves three SNPs with extremely high population differentiation, whereas most other commonly used tests for selection show values not even close to genome-wide significance. Our coalescent simulations indicate that this unusual pattern might be explained by local positive selection in combination with an observed recombination hotspot of moderate strength. At approximately 7 cM/Mb, the recombination rate is only around 7-fold higher than the genomic background, but the hotspot is extended over 3&#8211;4 kb. Therefore, a similar number of recombination events may accumulate over time corresponding to a more typically sized hotspot of 1 kb and a recombination rate of around 25 cM/Mb. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a nearly complete selective sweep that is obscured by the effect of a recombination hotspot. It is compatible with earlier theoretical observations that instances of weaker selection in the presence of recombination may not always have an influence on polymorphism statistics <xref rid="pgen.1004128-Tennessen1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and with the observed effect of recombination on the partial sweep around the malaria-related &#946;-globin gene <xref rid="pgen.1004128-Wood1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Because of the unclear effects of the recombination hotspot, it was not possible to estimate the age of the sweep using linkage disequilibrium decay related methods (e.g. <xref rid="pgen.1004128-Beleza1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>). It is likely that a mild selection pressure would have needed a long time to reach the extreme population differentiation values observed, indicating this may be an ancient event. The fact that the high frequency of the Val372 allele is restricted to Sub-Saharan African populations suggests that the selection process started after the Out of Africa expansion of modern humans (i.e. sixty thousand years ago). Alternatively, it is also possible that the bottleneck in the Out of Africa expansion did not sample the Val372 allele, which in turn could explain its absence in most non-African populations. This implies that the Out of Africa event is not a hard upper limit for the age of the selection process.</p><p>Other more complex evolutionary scenarios cannot be entirely ruled out, and could warrant a more detailed investigation. For example: (i) selection acting on standing genetic variation, in the sense that the Val372 variant was already segregating when it came under the influence of local selection; (ii) additional directional selection against the Val372 allele in non-African populations; (iii) selection favoring the Leu372 variant on multiple, geographically independent origins mostly in non-African populations, in addition to positive selection on the Val372 variant in Africa; and (iv) &#8216;gene surfing&#8217; of any of the two variants on the wave of a population range expansion <xref rid="pgen.1004128-Excoffier1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. However, we consider it is unnecessary to invoke such complex scenarios in preference to the simpler one we propose based on coalescent simulations. Moreover, back-and-forth migrations between Sub-Saharan African, Northern African and Middle Eastern populations after the first Out-of-Africa wave of migration <xref rid="pgen.1004128-Henn1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> could easily explain the observed low-intermediate allele frequencies in Middle Eastern populations without invoking additional selection events.</p><p>In the absence of additional linked functional variants in the region, we infer that directional selection has acted on the <italic>ZIP4</italic> gene. This conclusion is supported by: (i) the disease phenotype of acrodermatitis enteropathica, which involves extreme and potentially lethal zinc deficiency and is caused by, among others, diverse mutations at amino acid position 372 in ZIP4 <xref rid="pgen.1004128-Schmitt1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>; (ii) the absence of cellular zinc transport in Leu372Arg and Leu372Pro acrodermatitis mutants; (iii) the finding that the Val372 variant leads to reduced zinc transport at the cellular level; and finally (iv) the conservation of this amino acid position across diverse species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004128-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Furthermore, we infer that the Leu372Val substitution was the functional site targeted by selection due to its location in the predicted center of selection (highest F<sub>ST</sub>), and since it is the only putative functional polymorphism in the <italic>ZIP4</italic> gene. Of the other two polymorphic variants with somewhat high allele frequency differences between populations, the Thr357Ala substitution (rs2272662) does not show any functional effect and the intronic rs1871535 cannot be associated with any known regulatory function (according to information on DNAse I hypersensitivity clusters, CpG Islands and transcription factor binding sites available from the ENCODE data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE">http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE</ext-link>

That is, we observed differences in the maximal transport (T<sub>max</sub>) with no significant differences in the transport kinetics (T<sub>1/2</sub>) between Leu372 and Val372. The functional results observed in transfected HeLa cells are likely to be transferable to other epithelial cells, in accordance with independent experiments showing an effect of acrodermatitis variants at position 372 on surface expression (in CHO cells) and on zinc transport (in HEK293 cells) when using mouse cDNA <xref rid="pgen.1004128-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.

The consequences of this difference in zinc transport at the organ and organismal level are currently unclear, although there is a strong indication that this variant may indeed be phenotypically relevant. For example, a similar non-synonymous mutation in the porcine homologue of ZIP4 leads to non-pathogenic reduced tissue concentrations of zinc in piglets <xref rid="pgen.1004128-Siebert1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Nutritional immunity as a putative selective force</title><p>Could the concept of &#8220;nutritional immunity&#8221; <xref rid="pgen.1004128-Kochan1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004128-Hood1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> involving zinc explain a putative selective force in Sub-Saharan Africa? According to this hypothesis, the human host restricts access to certain micronutrients, so that pathogens become less virulent. This is a well-known mechanism of immune defense mediated by iron metabolism <xref rid="pgen.1004128-Weinberg1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, and there are indications that zinc metabolism could have a similar function <xref rid="pgen.1004128-Hood1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004128-KehlFie1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>.

We speculate that the selective force behind the extreme F<sub>ST</sub> pattern of the Leu372Val substitution may be related to pathogens or infectious diseases. It is known that decreased zinc uptake mediated by ZIP4 leads to decreased zinc concentrations in the major organs, as shown in a mouse knockout model <xref rid="pgen.1004128-Geiser1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. While the phenotypic effect of the Val372 allele in humans is currently unknown, we conjecture that the <italic>in vitro</italic> difference may indeed translate into physiological differences, possibly leading to a slightly decreased uptake of dietary zinc. Fittingly, there is suggestive evidence that African genetic ancestry may involve lower serum levels of zinc <xref rid="pgen.1004128-Cole1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, as African-American children have a fourfold risk of zinc deficiency compared to Hispanic children. This result would suggest that African ancestry may be associated with lower serum zinc levels, although these results may be biased due to differences in lifestyle, socio-economic status etc., and this observation would need to be confirmed by controlled studies. Alternatively, lower zinc concentrations mediated by the Leu372Val substitution in the enterocyte cells could facilitate early diarrheal episodes during a digestive infection in order to reduce the pathogen load on the luminal surface <xref rid="pgen.1004128-Hoque1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004128-Scrimgeour1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Similarly, the lower level of expression of the ZIP4 isoform carrying the Val372 variant could also be advantageous if any parasite uses the ZIP4 receptor to enter enterocytes. Furthermore, the selective force may be related to pre-historic differences in dietary zinc due to lifestyle or to local levels of zinc concentrations in soil and the food chain.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Potential implications &#8211; towards a phenotype</title><p>No large-scale ethnic comparisons related to serum or tissue zinc concentrations are available. To our knowledge, rs1871534 has not been tested in case-control studies in African populations related to one of the numerous existing infectious diseases like malaria, trypanosmias or Lhassa fever. It is therefore possible that important evidence for a possible selective force has been missed. In future research, the inclusion of additional cell lines, and genotype-phenotype association studies in diverse ethnic populations may help to clarify further phenotypic consequences of this non-synonymous polymorphism. Genotype-phenotype association studies should involve African-American or East African populations in which the Val372 allele is segregating at intermediate frequencies. Candidate phenotypes and traits to interrogate could be serum zinc concentrations, zinc content in hair and nails, serum zinc concentrations after controlled zinc supplementation, and a range of disease traits, especially diseases with an elevated risk in different populations, for example, diverse types of cancer in African Americans. As this SNP was not included in the commonly used Affymetrix and Illumina SNP arrays with up to one million variants (although it is included in several of the latest arrays), potential clinically relevant associations may have been missed.

This event did not leave the typical footprint of a selective sweep with long haplotypes or detectable neutral deviations in the allele frequency spectrum of the surrounding region, most likely because of the presence of a moderate recombination hotspot. Through functional experiments we have verified the Leu372Val substitution as the likely causal site. Given that two functionally different alleles of this key component of cellular zinc uptake are distributed so divergently across worldwide populations, our results may point to functional differences in zinc homeostasis among modern human populations with possible broader relevance for health and disease.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Samples and genotyping</title><p>The G and C alleles at rs1871534 (Leu372Val) have been swapped in various public sources such as HapMap (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hapmap.org">http://www.hapmap.org</ext-link>) or dbSNP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP</ext-link>) that report conflicting allele frequencies in populations with a similar geographical origin.

In particular, the migration frequencies were set to zero and the time points of the European and African population bottlenecks were moved back to 3,300 generations before present to accommodate the long sweep times resulting from the lowest selection coefficient we used (0.5%). The sweep was shifted back 350 generations to retain the final population expansions with the advantage of (i) a better approximation to the fitted model, and (ii) the generation of sufficient singletons when compared to the 1000 Genomes Phase1 data. Subsequent thinning of the simulated data was performed by removing 48% of singleton positions across all populations to account for the underestimation of singletons in 1000 Genomes data. This correction step yielded a much improved (although not perfect) unfolded site frequency spectrum as displayed by the derived allele frequencies (DAF) and a F<sub>ST</sub> distribution that closely matched the empirical data from 1000 genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004128.s009">Figure S9</xref>). Specifically, we compared the empirical F<sub>ST</sub> and DAF distributions from the 1000 genomes data against the original demographic &#8220;best-fit&#8221; model <xref rid="pgen.1004128-Schaffner1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> and two models adapted to allow for different selective sweeps (the one from <xref rid="pgen.1004128-Grossman2" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref> and that applied in the current study). As seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004128.s009">Figure S9</xref>, our modified model matched the empirical data as well as or better than the other demographic models.</p><p>For each subsequent simulation, we used either the recombination landscape including hotspots from the YRI population provided by the 1000 Genomes Consortium and based on HapMap 2 trio data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://1000genomes.org">http://1000genomes.org</ext-link>) or alternatively a constant recombination rate of 8.17&#215;10<sup>&#8722;9</sup>, which was calculated as the mean recombination rate in the 100 kb window surrounding <italic>ZIP4</italic>. Simulations had a length of 100 kb, were run in 500 replicates for each scenario and sample sizes were set to 176 chromosomes for Sub-Saharan Africans and 194 chromosomes for Europeans. Regions under positive selection were modeled using a single causal variant that rose to an allele frequency of 0.98 corresponding approximately to that observed today in YRI. We simulated three different selection coefficients (0.5%, 2% and 3%) that led to different durations of the sweep: 2,938 generations (&#8764;60,000&#8211;85,000 years for generation times of 20 and 29 years, respectively;<xref rid="pgen.1004128-Fenner1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>), 1,469 generations (&#8764;30,000&#8211;43,000 years), or 458 generations (&#8764;10,000&#8211;13,000 years).</p><p>Empirical probabilities and likelihoods for the different selection statistic values observed in <italic>ZIP4</italic> were estimated under each simulated selection scenario (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004128-t002">Table 2</xref>). Firstly, the empirical percentile in which each observation was found was estimated for each test (F<sub>ST</sub>, dDAF, Tajima's D, Fay and Wu's H, Fu Li's D and XP-EHH) and scenario (neutral + constant recombination, neutral + hotspot recombination, low selection + constant recombination, medium selection + constant recombination, high selection + constant recombination, low selection + hotspot recombination, medium selection + hotspot recombination, high selection + hotspot recombination). This percentile was then subtracted from one if it was higher than 0.5 and multiplied by two to mimic a two-tailed test. Thus, if the observed value was found at the median of the simulated distribution, it yielded a probability of one. By contrast, if it was found in a tail of the distribution, it yielded a probability close to zero. For each scenario, we computed the combined empirical probability for several set combinations of observed neutrality test values by multiplying each corresponding empirical probability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004128.s011">Table S2</xref>). Each combination contained at least one neutrality statistic capturing each of the three main signatures of selection explored (population differentiation, haplotype structure or the site frequency spectrum). Next, empirical likelihoods were estimated as the ratio of the combined empirical probability under each selection scenario over the same probability under neutrality only for the hotspot recombination landscape observed in <italic>ZIP4</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004128-t002">Table 2</xref>). Likelihoods for the different combinations of statistics containing dDAF in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004128.s011">Table S2</xref> were nearly identical to the equivalent combinations obtained with F<sub>ST</sub> (data not shown). As a conservative decision given the high correlation between F<sub>ST</sub> and dDAF, we do not present the likelihood of any combination including both statistics. It is important to point out that any of the currently available human demographies in combination with coalescent simulators have relatively severe limitations mainly (i) in terms of the number of included populations (e.g. African populations) (ii) the accuracy and timing of the demographic events and (iii) the option to include selective sweeps as well as a defined recombination landscape. Therefore it is clear that the complexities of possible evolutionary scenarios (as discussed in the main text) are beyond what can be modeled by current approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Neutrality tests on simulated and the 1000 Genomes data</title><p>Neutrality tests on simulated and the 1000 Genomes population data were performed as described by Pybus et al. <xref rid="pgen.1004128-Pybus1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref> and using the 1000 Genomes Selection Browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hsb.upf.edu">http://hsb.upf.edu</ext-link>).
