<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Similarly to iron, zinc has manifold functions in the body, such as in the immune system [1], aging [2], DNA repair [3], signaling [4] and in diseases such as diabetes [5] and cancer [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>On the molecular level, zinc acts as a co-factor in hundreds of metallo-enzymes as well as in hundreds of DNA-binding proteins (e.g. zinc finger proteins). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Zinc homeostasis is tightly regulated by 10 zinc efflux transporters and 14 zinc influx transporters (encoded by the SLC30A and SLC39A gene families, respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>ZIP4 (SLC39A4) is the most important intestinal zinc uptake transporter and is expressed at the apical membrane of enterocytes [7], [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Loss-of-function mutations in ZIP4 cause acrodermatitis enteropathica [9], [10] [MIM 201100], a congenital disease characterized by extreme zinc deficiency if left untreated without supplemental zinc [11], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Fittingly, it was recently reported that the loss of expression of this gene in a ZIP4 intestine-specific knockout mouse caused systemic zinc deficiency, leading to disruption of the intestine stem cell niche and loss of intestine integrity [13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) c.1114C&gt;G (rs1871534) in the ZIP4 gene (SLC39A4; NM_130849.2) results in the substitution of leucine for valine at amino acid 372 (Leu372Val) in the human ZIP4 transporter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>This non-synonymous SNP is one of the most markedly differentiated genetic variants in the genome in terms of allele frequency differences between populations [14]–[16], according to data from HapMap [17], the Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP) [18] and the 1000 Genomes Project [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Extreme population differentiation is a signature of local positive selection [15], [19]–[21], but genomic scans for targets of natural selection based on other criteria, such as extended long haplotypes [22]–[24] or selective signatures in the allele frequency spectrum [25], have failed to identify ZIP4 as a candidate gene for positive selection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>To date, whether this variant has evolved under positive selection or neutrality, and its potential functional significance, has not been examined. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In the work reported here, we had three main objectives: (i) to investigate evolutionary explanations for the extreme population differentiation of the ZIP4 Leu372Val polymorphism by use of coalescent simulations; (ii) to test for functional differences in cellular zinc transport between the alleles of the Leu372Val polymorphism using a heterologous expression system; and (iii) to discuss potential selective forces behind this possibly adaptive event and their implications for zinc homeostasis in modern humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>We have extensively characterized the extreme geographical differentiation of the Leu372Val substitution and provide evidence that it has been subject to a nearly complete but mild selective sweep in Sub-Saharan Africa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Our simulations show how the extreme pattern of population differentiation, yet absence of other classical signatures of positive selection, can be explained by directional selection accompanied by the effects of a recombination hotspot near the polymorphic adaptive site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Additionally, our data demonstrate in vitro functional differences between the two human polymorphic alleles at codon 372 of the human ZIP4 transporter in surface protein expression, basal intracellular levels of zinc and zinc uptake. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that the reduction in intracellular zinc levels mediated by the Val372 allele may have been advantageous in Sub-Saharan Africa, possibly by restricting access of a geographically restricted pathogen to this micronutrient, and that other possible secondary consequences for disease risk and health may result from the differential activity of the ZIP4 alleles. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Five common non-synonymous SNPs are known in the human ZIP4 gene (Table 1): Glu10Ala (rs2280839), Ala58Thr (rs2280838), Ala114Thr (rs17855765), Thr357Ala (rs2272662) and Leu372Val (rs1871534). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>However, only the latter two SNPs show elevated levels of population differentiation in the 1000 Genomes Phase1 sequencing data when comparing the Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI) with either the Han Chinese from Beijing, China (CHB) or Utah residents of Northern and Western European origin (CEU). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>As shown in Figure 1A and 1B, their FST values fall above the 99.999 th percentile of the genome-wide FST distributions between CEU-YRI (with FST values for rs2272662 and rs1871534 of 0.48 and 0.98, respectively) and between CHB-YRI (with FST values of 0.51 and 0.98, respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>We therefore verify that the Leu372Val substitution encoded by SNP rs1871534 is the non-synonymous polymorphism exhibiting the most extreme allele frequency differences in the human ZIP4 gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Next, we genotyped the 51 populations from the Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP) and compiled additional allele frequencies for this position in worldwide populations from the Alfred database [26], [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we obtained new data from a Pygmy population from Gabon and North African populations of Western Sahara, Morocco, and Libya. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>These new data confirm that the Leu372 variant is the most common allele outside of Africa, and provide a more detailed picture of the geographical allele frequency distributions of this non-synonymous polymorphism (Figure 1C and Table S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Overall, the Val372 variant showed the highest frequencies in Sub-Saharan Africa, with populations such as the Ibo or the Yoruban people exhibiting the most extreme derived allele frequencies worldwide (0.99 and 0.96, respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, two presumably early-branching groups in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Pygmy and the San people, showed opposing trends in the derived allele frequency (0.94 and 0.0, respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Even though the small sample size from the San (only six individuals) means that a population frequency of up to 0.221 cannot be excluded (with p = 0.05 based on assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and a binomial approach), such divergent tendencies in these two Sub-Saharan populations are maintained. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Given the elevated levels of population differentiation of the SNP rs2272662, we also genotyped the HGDP panel for the Thr357Ala polymorphism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>However, compared with the Leu372Val substitution, the derived allele at this non-synonymous SNP displayed intermediate frequencies worldwide (Figure S1 and Table S1) and less extreme allele frequency differences between populations. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Given the allele frequency differences observed in the Leu372Val polymorphism between the two early human branches in Africa and the uncertainty associated with the low coverage of the Neanderthal genome draft sequence [28], we resequenced the corresponding orthologous positions for rs1871534 and rs2272662 in an additional Neanderthal sample, labeled SD1253 and excavated at El Sidrón site in Spain [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>The two positions were amplified in a multiplexed reaction, along with a diagnostic Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) fragment, to monitor contamination in the PCR reaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>For the L16230-H16262 diagnostic mtDNA fragment, 64 clones were generated (Figure S2), all of which show the Neanderthal-specific 16234T-16244A-16256A-16258G haplotype [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>This again supports the very low level of contamination in this particular sample. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>For the orthologous positions of the human rs1871534 and rs2272662 SNPs, 19 and 14 sequences were successfully obtained, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>With the exception of one clone in the second position, all sequences showed the previously inferred ancestral alleles, in agreement with the reads present for the Vindija individuals 33.16 (one read for each position), 33.25 (two for rs1871534 and none for rs2272662) and 33.26 (two and one, respectively) (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>The successful resequencing of this Neanderthal individual, together with published reads from additional Neanderthals [28] and from the Denisovan individual [30], strongly suggests that the Leu372 variant (encoded by the C allele in rs1871534) is the ancestral human form, which is also in agreement with the chimpanzee state (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Together with the extreme population differentiation pattern, these results suggest that a selective sweep may have taken place in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the derived variant is nearly fixed. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Whereas we found a cluster of three strongly elevated FST scores between CEU and YRI in the neighboring SNPs rs1871535 (intronic), rs1871534 and rs2272662 (further suggesting directional selection in a specific geographical region), in both populations there was a clear absence of extreme values in neutrality statistics such as Tajima's D or Fay and Wu's H (Figure S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Notably, no other polymorphism in the flanking region of the human ZIP4 displays the high levels of population differentiation of the Leu372Val substitution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in both African and non-African populations there is a recombination hotspot in the ZIP4 gene, which could have reduced any signature of selection on the surrounding linked variation, thereby explaining the apparent lack of significant departures from neutrality. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>To further investigate this possibility, we carried out coalescence simulations under a variety of recombination and selection scenarios using a well-established demography [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>As shown in Figure 3D, the observed values for FST and most of the different neutrality statistics cannot be explained by neutral evolution or positive selection with a constant recombination rate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Instead, this atypical pattern of extreme population differentiation, yet seemingly neutral Tajima's D and other neutrality statistics, showed a higher recovery in simulations with directional selection on the derived allele in Sub-Saharan African populations in the context of the observed recombination landscape, including the hotspot (Figure 3D and 3E, Figure S4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>In a more formal evaluation of the results, we quantified the empirical probability for each scenario and neutrality test as well as for different combinations of tests by using composite scores encompassing at least three complementary signatures of positive selection: (i) site frequency spectrum, (ii) population differentiation, and (iii) haplotype structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>The scenario of “weak selection (s = 0.005) + hotspot” is the most likely among the different ones tested (Table S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Moreover, all the empirical likelihoods calculated for the different composite scores indicate that the proposed scenario of “weak selection (s = 0.005) + hotspot” is more likely than the neutral scenario (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our simulation results indicate that the atypical patterns of selection in the ZIP4 gene can indeed be explained by positive selection having acted upon the Val372 allele in Sub-Saharan African populations and that recombination has erased further accompanying signatures of the selective sweep. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Selection coefficients lower than the ones tested (3.0%, 1.0%, 0.5%) further dilute the signal of selection in the site frequency spectrum based neutrality tests (results not shown), but require such long duration times of the sweep that would substantially predate the population split between African and Eurasian populations. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Our study was triggered by the observation of extreme population differentiation between Sub-Saharan African and non-African populations involving the Leu372Val polymorphism in the ZIP4 gene, unaccompanied by any other signals of a classic hard sweep, such as long extended haplotype homozygosity, in either population (Figures S3, S7 and S8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>By interrogating and compiling allele frequencies in more than 100 worldwide human populations, we further characterized the extreme population differentiation of the Leu372Val polymorphism and confirmed that this result was not an artifact of allele switching [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Given the worldwide distribution of the human derived and ancestral alleles (confirmed by sequencing a Neanderthal and phylogenetic conservation), we conclude that this sweep must have taken place within Africa, probably in Sub-Saharan Africa, and not outside the African continent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Notably, the extreme population differentiation of the Leu372Val polymorphism represents the top fourth region within the global genome-wide FST distribution between CEU-YRI obtained from the 1000 Genomes Project data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>The only CEU-YRI FST values that are more extreme all involve well-known examples of local geographical adaptation in humans: the SLC24A5 and SLC45A2 genes (with an FST of 0.9826 and 0.9765, respectively), which have been associated with light skin pigmentation in Europeans; and the DUFFY gene (with an FST of 0.9765), which provides resistance to the malaria pathogen Plasmodium vivax. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Moreover, with the notable exception of DUFFY FY*O allele [35], [36], most of the extreme FST values obtained when comparing Africans with non-Africans are usually attributed to local adaptation outside of Africa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Our detection of such a rare signature of natural selection in the African continent is therefore quite remarkable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, it is congruent with a recent study that has found only limited evidence for classical sweeps in African populations, which is likely due to a combination of limitations of the currently used methodology and specific characteristics of African population history [37]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Notably, we observed a nearly complete but mild selective sweep for the Val372 variant in Africa, which involves three SNPs with extremely high population differentiation, whereas most other commonly used tests for selection show values not even close to genome-wide significance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Our coalescent simulations indicate that this unusual pattern might be explained by local positive selection in combination with an observed recombination hotspot of moderate strength. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>At approximately 7 cM/Mb, the recombination rate is only around 7-fold higher than the genomic background, but the hotspot is extended over 3–4 kb. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a similar number of recombination events may accumulate over time corresponding to a more typically sized hotspot of 1 kb and a recombination rate of around 25 cM/Mb. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first example of a nearly complete selective sweep that is obscured by the effect of a recombination hotspot. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>It is compatible with earlier theoretical observations that instances of weaker selection in the presence of recombination may not always have an influence on polymorphism statistics [38] and with the observed effect of recombination on the partial sweep around the malaria-related β-globin gene [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Because of the unclear effects of the recombination hotspot, it was not possible to estimate the age of the sweep using linkage disequilibrium decay related methods (e.g. [40]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>It is likely that a mild selection pressure would have needed a long time to reach the extreme population differentiation values observed, indicating this may be an ancient event. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>The fact that the high frequency of the Val372 allele is restricted to Sub-Saharan African populations suggests that the selection process started after the Out of Africa expansion of modern humans (i.e. sixty thousand years ago). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, it is also possible that the bottleneck in the Out of Africa expansion did not sample the Val372 allele, which in turn could explain its absence in most non-African populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>This implies that the Out of Africa event is not a hard upper limit for the age of the selection process. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Other more complex evolutionary scenarios cannot be entirely ruled out, and could warrant a more detailed investigation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>For example: (i) selection acting on standing genetic variation, in the sense that the Val372 variant was already segregating when it came under the influence of local selection; (ii) additional directional selection against the Val372 allele in non-African populations; (iii) selection favoring the Leu372 variant on multiple, geographically independent origins mostly in non-African populations, in addition to positive selection on the Val372 variant in Africa; and (iv) ‘gene surfing’ of any of the two variants on the wave of a population range expansion [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>However, we consider it is unnecessary to invoke such complex scenarios in preference to the simpler one we propose based on coalescent simulations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Moreover, back-and-forth migrations between Sub-Saharan African, Northern African and Middle Eastern populations after the first Out-of-Africa wave of migration [42] could easily explain the observed low-intermediate allele frequencies in Middle Eastern populations without invoking additional selection events. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>In the absence of additional linked functional variants in the region, we infer that directional selection has acted on the ZIP4 gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>This conclusion is supported by: (i) the disease phenotype of acrodermatitis enteropathica, which involves extreme and potentially lethal zinc deficiency and is caused by, among others, diverse mutations at amino acid position 372 in ZIP4 [43]; (ii) the absence of cellular zinc transport in Leu372Arg and Leu372Pro acrodermatitis mutants; (iii) the finding that the Val372 variant leads to reduced zinc transport at the cellular level; and finally (iv) the conservation of this amino acid position across diverse species (Figure 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we infer that the Leu372Val substitution was the functional site targeted by selection due to its location in the predicted center of selection (highest FST), and since it is the only putative functional polymorphism in the ZIP4 gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Of the other two polymorphic variants with somewhat high allele frequency differences between populations, the Thr357Ala substitution (rs2272662) does not show any functional effect and the intronic rs1871535 cannot be associated with any known regulatory function (according to information on DNAse I hypersensitivity clusters, CpG Islands and transcription factor binding sites available from the ENCODE data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE">http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE</ext-link> [44]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Therefore, both rs1871535 and rs2272662 are likely to be neutral. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Other non-synonymous polymorphisms with intermediate allele frequencies in the ZIP4 gene (Glu10Ala, Ala58Thr, and Ala114Thr) have very low FST scores and are therefore not considered candidate variants for selection. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>This result would suggest that African ancestry may be associated with lower serum zinc levels, although these results may be biased due to differences in lifestyle, socio-economic status etc., and this observation would need to be confirmed by controlled studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, lower zinc concentrations mediated by the Leu372Val substitution in the enterocyte cells could facilitate early diarrheal episodes during a digestive infection in order to reduce the pathogen load on the luminal surface [52], [53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the lower level of expression of the ZIP4 isoform carrying the Val372 variant could also be advantageous if any parasite uses the ZIP4 receptor to enter enterocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the selective force may be related to pre-historic differences in dietary zinc due to lifestyle or to local levels of zinc concentrations in soil and the food chain. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, rs1871534 has not been tested in case-control studies in African populations related to one of the numerous existing infectious diseases like malaria, trypanosmias or Lhassa fever. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>It is therefore possible that important evidence for a possible selective force has been missed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>In future research, the inclusion of additional cell lines, and genotype-phenotype association studies in diverse ethnic populations may help to clarify further phenotypic consequences of this non-synonymous polymorphism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Genotype-phenotype association studies should involve African-American or East African populations in which the Val372 allele is segregating at intermediate frequencies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Candidate phenotypes and traits to interrogate could be serum zinc concentrations, zinc content in hair and nails, serum zinc concentrations after controlled zinc supplementation, and a range of disease traits, especially diseases with an elevated risk in different populations, for example, diverse types of cancer in African Americans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>As this SNP was not included in the commonly used Affymetrix and Illumina SNP arrays with up to one million variants (although it is included in several of the latest arrays), potential clinically relevant associations may have been missed. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>The identification of a high-frequency derived allele polymorphism in the ZIP4 zinc transporter gene (SLC39A4), combined with a more complete picture of worldwide allele frequencies and in-depth coalescent simulations, is consistent with a long lasting selective event in Sub-Saharan Africa driven by a moderate selection coefficient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>This event did not leave the typical footprint of a selective sweep with long haplotypes or detectable neutral deviations in the allele frequency spectrum of the surrounding region, most likely because of the presence of a moderate recombination hotspot. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Through functional experiments we have verified the Leu372Val substitution as the likely causal site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Given that two functionally different alleles of this key component of cellular zinc uptake are distributed so divergently across worldwide populations, our results may point to functional differences in zinc homeostasis among modern human populations with possible broader relevance for health and disease. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>As the underlying neutral demography, we used the best-fit model of Shaffner et al. [31], [65] with slight modifications (Table S3), similar to a previously used approach [66]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>In particular, the migration frequencies were set to zero and the time points of the European and African population bottlenecks were moved back to 3,300 generations before present to accommodate the long sweep times resulting from the lowest selection coefficient we used (0.5%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>The sweep was shifted back 350 generations to retain the final population expansions with the advantage of (i) a better approximation to the fitted model, and (ii) the generation of sufficient singletons when compared to the 1000 Genomes Phase1 data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Subsequent thinning of the simulated data was performed by removing 48% of singleton positions across all populations to account for the underestimation of singletons in 1000 Genomes data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>This correction step yielded a much improved (although not perfect) unfolded site frequency spectrum as displayed by the derived allele frequencies (DAF) and a FST distribution that closely matched the empirical data from 1000 genomes (Figure S9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Specifically, we compared the empirical FST and DAF distributions from the 1000 genomes data against the original demographic “best-fit” model [31] and two models adapted to allow for different selective sweeps (the one from [66] and that applied in the current study). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>As seen in Figure S9, our modified model matched the empirical data as well as or better than the other demographic models. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>For each subsequent simulation, we used either the recombination landscape including hotspots from the YRI population provided by the 1000 Genomes Consortium and based on HapMap 2 trio data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://1000genomes.org">http://1000genomes.org</ext-link>) or alternatively a constant recombination rate of 8.17×10−9, which was calculated as the mean recombination rate in the 100 kb window surrounding ZIP4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Simulations had a length of 100 kb, were run in 500 replicates for each scenario and sample sizes were set to 176 chromosomes for Sub-Saharan Africans and 194 chromosomes for Europeans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>Regions under positive selection were modeled using a single causal variant that rose to an allele frequency of 0.98 corresponding approximately to that observed today in YRI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>We simulated three different selection coefficients (0.5%, 2% and 3%) that led to different durations of the sweep: 2,938 generations (∼60,000–85,000 years for generation times of 20 and 29 years, respectively;[67]), 1,469 generations (∼30,000–43,000 years), or 458 generations (∼10,000–13,000 years). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>Empirical probabilities and likelihoods for the different selection statistic values observed in ZIP4 were estimated under each simulated selection scenario (see Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Firstly, the empirical percentile in which each observation was found was estimated for each test (FST, dDAF, Tajima's D, Fay and Wu's H, Fu Li's D and XP-EHH) and scenario (neutral + constant recombination, neutral + hotspot recombination, low selection + constant recombination, medium selection + constant recombination, high selection + constant recombination, low selection + hotspot recombination, medium selection + hotspot recombination, high selection + hotspot recombination). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>This percentile was then subtracted from one if it was higher than 0.5 and multiplied by two to mimic a two-tailed test. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Thus, if the observed value was found at the median of the simulated distribution, it yielded a probability of one. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>By contrast, if it was found in a tail of the distribution, it yielded a probability close to zero. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>For each scenario, we computed the combined empirical probability for several set combinations of observed neutrality test values by multiplying each corresponding empirical probability (Table S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Each combination contained at least one neutrality statistic capturing each of the three main signatures of selection explored (population differentiation, haplotype structure or the site frequency spectrum). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Next, empirical likelihoods were estimated as the ratio of the combined empirical probability under each selection scenario over the same probability under neutrality only for the hotspot recombination landscape observed in ZIP4 (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Likelihoods for the different combinations of statistics containing dDAF in Table S2 were nearly identical to the equivalent combinations obtained with FST (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>As a conservative decision given the high correlation between FST and dDAF, we do not present the likelihood of any combination including both statistics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>It is important to point out that any of the currently available human demographies in combination with coalescent simulators have relatively severe limitations mainly (i) in terms of the number of included populations (e.g. African populations) (ii) the accuracy and timing of the demographic events and (iii) the option to include selective sweeps as well as a defined recombination landscape. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Therefore it is clear that the complexities of possible evolutionary scenarios (as discussed in the main text) are beyond what can be modeled by current approaches. </plain></SENT>
