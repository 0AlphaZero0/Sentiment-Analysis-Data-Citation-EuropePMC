It is widely accepted that autoimmunity is an important part of the pathological events leading to MS and the oligodendrocytes in the CNS seem to be the main target of the autoimmune response, causing the characteristic lesions in the white matter. Although its etiology is unknown, several genetic and environmental factors have been shown to be associated to the risk of developing the disease. Variants in more than 50 genes <xref rid="pone.0090482-Baranzini1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> and various environmental factors such as smoking, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and low sunlight exposure have been shown to contribute to the risk <xref rid="pone.0090482-vanderMei1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. For most of these factors the association is modest and, thus, the general view is that the interaction of many of these risk elements in an individual is what leads to the development of MS.</p><p>The most common clinical presentation of the disease (in 85&#8211;90% of the cases) is the so called Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS). In this form of the disease patients suffer from episodes of acute onset of neurological symptoms that typically last from 48 hours to several weeks called relapses followed by longer periods of clinical stability. This transient nature of neurological symptoms is explained by subsiding inflammation, remyelination of axons and the plasticity of the nervous system. Inflammation is associated with MS lesions and it has been postulated to be the cause of, or alternatively a reaction to, axon demyelination and damage <xref rid="pone.0090482-Bennett1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. After a relapse, a reduction of neurological disability happens but, sometimes, the recovery is not complete and thus, with every new relapse, neurological disability is accumulated. The recovery of neurological ability after a relapse happens mostly due to remyelination of the lesions caused by the immunological attack.</p><p>Most of the treatments currently used are immunological agents aimed to reduce the inflammatory response and the clinical and neurological activity in order to delay the progression of the disease. However, the use of these immunomodulatory and immunosupressor treatments has encountered several problems such as low efficacy and high-proportion of non-responders (interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b and glatiramer acetate) or severe secondary effects (natalizumab and mitoxantrone). Basically, the problem resides on the fact that these treatments modulate general non-MS-specific immunological processes, such as immune-cell infiltration to the CNS (natalizumab) or inflammation (interferon beta and glatiramer acetate). The lack of knowledge on the MS-specific molecular and cellular events behind the relapses and driving disease progression has hampered the design of efficient treatment strategies.</p><p>In general terms, the relapses are thought to be a consequence of T-cell driven inflammatory processes, with massive infiltration of leukocytes into the CNS through blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. Some evidence also points to a role of B cells in the progression of the disease <xref rid="pone.0090482-Disanto1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these pathogenic cellular inflammatory responses have not been properly described. Although some factors have been proposed to exacerbate the pathogenic inflammatory response, relapse episodes are still unpredictable. A deeper understanding of the MS-specific processes responsible for the relapsing-remitting behavior of the immune system and a description of the molecular events that trigger the inflammatory response in relapses would provide a molecular framework for the design of more effective and safer treatment strategies.</p><p>Currently, there is no molecular model for MS; there is even no consensus on the molecular events playing a central role in the pathogenesis of the disease. To tackle this problem, we perform here a hypothesis-free approach to investigate the possible molecular events responsible for the progression of RRMS. A whole genome gene expression analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes at the RNA level of patients in remission and relapse has been performed in order to draw as complete as possible a picture of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the progression of RRMS.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Differential Expression Analysis</title><p>For the differential expression analysis the samples were grouped based on their treatment state:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>All samples (68, &#8220;All&#8221; group)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Samples from patients with the same disease-modifying treatment in relapse and remission and the matched control samples (39; &#8220;Same treat&#8221; group)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Samples from patients with no treatment both in relapse and remission and the matched control samples (12, &#8220;No treat&#8221; group).</p></list-item></list><p>It must be taken into account that each sample set is a subgroup of the previous set, not an independent group.

There were 18 comparison pairs and, thus, 18 gene-lists were obtained with genes altered both in relapse and remission. Only two genes were obtained from the match-up of the lists produced by the t-tests; in contrast, 172 genes were found to be altered both in relapse and remission from the lists produced by the Rank Products, for a total of 174 genes.

Interestingly, the mirror pattern previously described is maintained in virtually all the genes (156/157 (99.37%)) keeping a homogeneous behavior inside each of the four main modules (the 1.1, 1.2 and 2.1 female modules; and the male module) as expected. In these modules, the 99.29% of the genes shows the mirror pattern and within each of them all the genes have the same behavior (up in relapse/down in remission; or down in relapse/up in remission) with the exception of 1 gene in the female module 2.1.

Alterations in the gene expression obtained from the &#8220;all&#8221; comparisons, could be explained, at least partially, by the different treatment that the patients were receiving during the relapse and remission phases. This could reflect the implication of these genes in the effect of treatment more than in the pathophysiological processes happening in the disease. The genes obtained from the other two comparison types (&#8220;same treatment&#8221; and &#8220;no treatment&#8221;), where the effect of a different treatment is eliminated, can be assumed to be more strongly related to endogenous mechanisms of the disease. We call these last two comparison types &#8220;treatment-independent&#8221; comparisons. The percentage of genes obtained from &#8220;treatment-independent&#8221; comparisons has been calculated for the 4 main modules of the coexpression network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090482-g004">

</xref>). A gradient can be observed in the capacity of reflecting the pathophysiology of the disease from the female module 1.1 (it reflects just the effect of treatment) to the male module (nearly completely linked to disease pathophysiology). The other two female modules show an intermediate capacity of reflecting the pathophysiological events occurring in peripheral blood leucocytes of patients with multiple sclerosis. It has to be noted that the fact that the male module reflects the underlying pathophysiology better than the female modules is probably a consequence of all but one untreated patients (untreated both in remission and relapse) being males.</p><fig id="pone-0090482-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0090482.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Percentage of genes obtained from &#8220;treatment-independent&#8221; comparisons for the main coexpression modules.</title><p>The percentage of the genes that appeared in the comparisons made with the samples from the patients with the same treatment in remission and relapse and from patients with no treatment at all is visualized and used as a measure for how truly a module reflects the underlying pathophysiology.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0090482.g004"/></fig><p>In order to describe the molecular/cellular mechanisms reflected by the coexpression modules, biological information on the genes of the four main modules has been collected and visualized (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090482.s002">Figure S2</xref></bold>).

Finally, all this information, along with the gene expression fold-changes for each condition and the percentage of the genes of each specificity (female/male/common), has been visualized.</p><p>As it can be seen in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090482.s002">Figure S2</xref></bold>, most of the genes (61%) of the female module 1.1 are virus/interferon response genes and show an &#8220;up in remission/down in relapse&#8221; pattern. This module, as has been shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090482-g004">
<bold>figure 4</bold>
</xref>, probably reflects more the effect of treatments than the pathophysiological processes underlying the disease. In the female module 1.2, the vast majority of the genes (88%) are genes expressed in neutrophils and eosinophils and show the same expression alteration pattern (up in remission and down in relapse) as the genes in the module 1.1. In this case, the 37.5% of the genes were obtained from treatment-independent comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090482-g004">
<bold>figure 4</bold>
</xref>) so, the mechanism represented by this module (eosinophil/neutrophil activation) may be linked to both the effect of treatments and the pathophysiological events happening in the disease. In the female module 2.1, the 94.7% of the genes are non-coding genes involved in post-transcriptional control of gene expression (49.1%) and ribosomal RNA modification (42.1%) and show the opposite pattern (down in remission/up in relapse) to that of the genes of the previous modules. In this case, half of the genes were obtained from treatment-independent comparisons, so as with the module 1.2, the mechanisms represented in this module (RNA modification and post-transcriptional control of gene expression) may be linked both to treatment effects and pathogenic processes. Finally, the only coexpression module classified as male-specific shows a composition of genes with apparently unrelated functions, with high proportions of protein-coding genes with unknown function (29.4%), genes belonging to the olfactory receptor family (29.4%) and regulatory non-coding genes (29.4%) as main features. As in the female module 2.1, the alteration pattern of the genes of this module is &#8220;down in remission/up in relapse&#8221;. This module is the one most faithfully reflecting the underlying pathogenic processes going on in the disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090482-g004">
<bold>figure 4</bold>
</xref>) and, thus, although it is the most functionally heterogeneous module and the one where deducing the reflected mechanism is most difficult, the genes involved in the module may have relevant roles in the pathophysiology of the disease in male patients.</p><p>With the aim of elucidating the effect of treatment and sex in each of the modules, data subsets have been created based on these two variables (<bold>treatment state</bold>: different treatment samples, same treatment samples and no treatment samples; <bold>sex</bold>: females/males/all) and two parameters have been calculated for each gene: <bold>1&#8211; mean p<sup>2</sup></bold> and the <bold>mean accumulated deviation.</bold> These have been plotted to detect in which of the data subsets each module presents the most marked and stable alteration of gene expression (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090482.s003">Figure S3</xref></bold>). Five data-points stand out the rest in terms of deviation and significance. The deregulation of module 1.1, as expected, has its source in the female samples with different treatment in remission and relapse and, thus, it is clear that it reflects the effect of treatments on the system. The alteration of the genes of the 1.2 and 2.1 modules, instead, mostly comes from the female samples with the same treatment in remission and relapse, indicating that they are reflecting female-specific mechanisms related to the pathophysiology of the disease. Finally, the genes of the male module seem to be altered more prominently in the male samples with no treatments than in the rest of sample subsets and, thus, the molecular processes represented by this module are male-specific and pathophysiology-related. Although no clear conclusion can be made for the 1.3 and 2.2 modules, these results confirm the previous assigned sex-specificities of the modules and their relations with treatments/pathophysiology.</p><p>In order to identify the most relevant genes from the point of view of the network structure we computed the betweenness-centrality of each node in the female component (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090482.s004">Figure S4</xref></bold>). The betweenness quantifies how central a node is among the paths of communication in the network. If a node has betweenness equal to one, it means that all communication paths pass through this node. A node with zero betweenness is irrelevant for the transmission of information within the network. Transcobalamin 1 (TCN1) is the gene with the highest betweenness-centrality, as 38.3% of the shortest paths between all node-pairs of the network go through this node. The removal of this gene causes a drop in the connectivity of the network and an increase in the mean shortest distance (from 3.187 to 3.420). These results indicate that the TCN1 gene, involved in the transport of cobalamin (vitamin B12) into cells, may have an important regulatory role in the molecular events reflected by the female component.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>The &#8220;Mirror Pattern&#8221;</title><p>As previously shown, a high proportion of the differentially expressed genes are altered in the opposite direction in remission and relapse, a behavior that gives rise to a pattern that we have designated as &#8220;mirror pattern&#8221;.

Are reference expression values provided by controls approached or surpassed? Does the intensity of this effect change between the modules of the coexpression network? In order to tackle these questions, fold-changes against control values of both remission and relapse have been box-plotted for the four largest modules of the network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090482-g005">

Tcn1 is a secreted protein implicated in the transport of vitamin B12 into cells and, in our network, it appears coexpressed with neutrophil-specific genes, suggesting that is produced and secreted by this cell type. Our data shows that TCN1 expression is deregulated in remission and relapse at the RNA level, but as, for this gene, it is the protein product the functional molecule we decided to test its concentration in the sera of MS patients and healthy controls. Tcn1 concentration has been measured in an initial set of 49 serum samples (17 healthy controls, 18 patients in remission, 10 patients in relapse and 4 subjects diagnosed as Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS)).

The coexpression analysis of these genes has detected several gene-groups organized in coexpression modules that reflect gender-specific molecular processes implicated in the disease. Virtually all these genes present the behavior we have called mirror pattern: if a gene is overexpressed in remission is underexpressed in relapse and vice versa.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Coexpression Modules</title><sec id="s3a1"><title>Module 1.1: virus and interferon response</title><p>As previously mentioned, 61% of the genes of this module are interferon and/or virus response genes and, thus, this module is clearly reflecting the effect of interferon-treatment on leukocyte gene-expression. Besides, all of the genes present the differential-expression pattern we called &#8220;mirror pattern&#8221;. However, in this case, the mirror pattern is the result of some relapse and remission samples having different treatment states and is not linked to the endogenous molecular dynamics implicated in the progression of the disease. From the 22 MS patients included in the analysis, five were receiving interferon treatment (Rebif or Betaferon) when the remission sample was collected, while either they had no treatment in relapse or were on natalizumab. The fact that in the five sample trios (relapse/remission/control), while the remission sample was under the effect of interferon-treatment, neither the relapse sample nor the control sample were under this effect explains both the differential expression of this genes and the mirror pattern they show.</p><p>On the other side, this module has been linked specifically to women. However, of the five patients that we have just mentioned, four are women and, thus, when performing the comparisons with males regardless of treatment-state, just one sample with the interferon in remission/no interferon in relapse pattern was included, making it impossible to observe the effect of interferon treatment on males. Therefore, it is clear that the treatment with interferon alters the expression of these genes in females, but it can&#8217;t be concluded that this effect is female-specific.</p></sec><sec id="s3a2"><title>Module 1.2: granulocyte activity</title><p>From the 16 genes grouped in this module, 14 are genes known to be expressed in granulocytes: 11 in neutrophils (BPI, CEACAM6, CEACAM8, DEFA4, ELANE, HP, MMP8, MPO, OLFM4, OLR1 and TCN1), two in eosinophils (RNASE2 and RNASE3) and one gene expressed in both cell-types (CRISP3). In addition, two of the seven genes in the neighboring 1.3 module are also expressed in neutrophils (ANXA3 and CD177). Several works have been published describing the role that neutrophils have both in multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica, an autoimmune and inflammatory disease with lesions in the optical nerve and spinal cord that resembles multiple sclerosis <xref rid="pone.0090482-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0090482-Saadoun1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.

They are mostly involved in ribosomal RNA biogenesis and post-transcriptional control of gene expression. Although the intronic snoRNAs, most of the U-RNAs and the cajal-body specific RNA 4 (SCARNA4) are transcribed by RNA polymerase II, many of the RNA species involved in the altered regulatory network are transcribed by RNA polymerase III (POL III) <xref rid="pone.0090482-Dieci1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>: 5S rRNA, an Y-RNA, VTRNA1-1, the snoRNAs of the <email>SNORD3@</email> cluster <xref rid="pone.0090482-Dieci2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and the spliceosomal U6 RNAs (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090482.s005">Figure S5</xref></bold>).

Interestingly, EBF1 is essential for lineage specification in early B cell development in humans. Moreover, EBF1 seems to play an important role in EBNA2 mediated regulation of transcription that is critical for the conversion of resting B cells to a lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL). EBNA2 is a protein expressed by the Epstein - Barr virus in the latency program III and acts as the main viral transactivator, being essential for EBV-mediated growth transformation. It has also been proposed that the EBF binding site of the EBV LMP1 promoter is critical for the EBNA2-mediated activation <xref rid="pone.0090482-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

The more cycles are used, more technical variability is introduced and getting good quality and stable results becomes more difficult. To address this problem, it will be necessary to perform further studies using RNA isolated from B cells with the aim of incrementing the presence of viral gene transcripts in the sample and lower the PCR cycles necessary to detect them.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Relapsing-remitting Molecular Dynamics in Females</title><sec id="s3d1"><title>Potential role of vitamin B12</title><p>From the 2058 coexpression relations shown by the coexpression network, only 13 are negative correlations and 12 of them link 2 genes of the module 1.2, TCN1 and MS4A3, with several genes of the module 2.1.

Thus, further studies with larger sample sizes are necessary in order to confirm or refute the validity of both our results and the hypotheses we pose regarding the total population of patients with MS. Besides, the cutoffs we have used in the statistical analyses are less stringent than the ones typical used in large-scale gene expression studies. However, the subsequent treatment of the data by matching the gene-lists obtained from different comparisons (if the probability of a gene appearing in list by chance is of p&lt;0.01, the probability of this very gene appearing in two independent lists is p&#8202;=&#8202;0.01&#215;0.01&#8202;=&#8202;0.0001) and by creating the coexpression network (the probability of two genes with 68 expression values each presenting a Pearson&#8217;s correlation above |0.6| bay chance is 6.10<sup>&#8722;8</sup>) makes us very confident about the robustness that our final result, the coexpression network of differentially expressed genes, has from a statistical point of view.</p><p>Finally, our differential gene expression results have not been validated with another technique such as qPCR or Luminex technology. However, we consider that the systems biology approach used in this study makes the technical validation non-essential. The fact that the differentially expressed genes cluster in very tightly coexpressed modules makes very unlikely that the deregulation we detect for these genes is a consequence of stochasticity or technical artefacts. We consider that, in this particular case, the validation of the hypotheses we pose from the interpretation of the results (such as the relevance of TCN1 or the reactivation of EBV) is a more logical next step.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The whole-genome gene expression analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes has allowed the observation that the genes that are differentially expressed in the two main phases of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, relapse and remission, show a behavior that gives rise to a pattern we have called &#8220;mirror pattern&#8221;: if a gene is upregulated in remission is downregulated in relapse and vice versa. Besides, we have seen that the modules obtained in the coexpression analysis of these genes reflect molecular processes that are sex-specific. However, the literature-based interpretation of the results led us to the hypothesis of EBV infection reactivation having a central role in the pathogenic events in both male and female patients. Nevertheless, the EBV viral gene expression analysis results support that idea just in female patients and, thus, the reactivation of the virus seems not to happen in relapses of male patients with MS. Finally, the regulatory relations observed in the coexpression analysis suggest that the primed phenotype exhibited by neutrophils in female patients is part of the endogenous mechanisms aimed to keep under control the reactivation of EBV infection in B lymphocytes. The constant inflammatory environment that characterizes the peripheral blood of multiple sclerosis patients, thus, would represent, at least in female patients, a response of the body to control the pathogenic processes that act in relapse. More research is needed in order to deepen the understanding of the functional details and temporal dynamics of the molecular framework offered by the present study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s5"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s5a"><title>Subjects and Sample Collection</title><p>25 MS patients and 25 healthy controls were included in this study.

From each MS patient two blood samples were collected and analyzed, one sample in relapse and another one in remission; one sample was collected for each control subject, giving a total of 75 samples. Relapse was defined as the development of new or recurrent neurological symptoms not associated with fever or infection lasting for at least 24 hours and accompanied by new neurological signs, following a period of symptomatic stability of 30 days <xref rid="pone.0090482-CastilloTrivino1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Peripheral blood of patients and healthy controls was obtained at the Neurology Department of Donostia University Hospital. Blood extraction was performed in the early morning for controls and remission samples and at arrival of the patient for relapse samples. In this last case, blood extraction always preceded the administration of steroids for relapses. RNA extraction was carried out no more than 2 hours after the blood was collected and during this time was kept at 4&#176;C.
