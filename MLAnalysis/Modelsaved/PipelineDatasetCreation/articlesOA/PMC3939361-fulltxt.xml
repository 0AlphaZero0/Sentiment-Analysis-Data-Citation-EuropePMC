Two-thirds belonged to the Beijing lineage, which was dominated by two homogeneous clades. MDR genotypes were found in 48% of isolates overall and 87% of the major clades. The most common rifampicin-resistance <italic>rpoB</italic> mutation was associated with fitness-compensatory mutations in <italic>rpoA</italic> or <italic>rpoC</italic>, and a novel intragenic compensatory substitution was identified. The proportion of MDR cases with XDR-tuberculosis was 16% overall with 65% of MDR isolates harboring <italic>eis</italic> mutations, selected by kanamycin therapy, which may drive the expansion of strains with enhanced virulence. The combination of drug resistance and compensatory mutations displayed by the major clades confer clinical resistance without compromising fitness and transmissibility, revealing a biological contribution to the tuberculosis program weaknesses driving the persistence and spread of M/XDR-tuberculosis in Russia and beyond.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Tuberculosis is the second leading cause of death from an infectious disease, after HIV. In 2011, there were an estimated 8.7 million new cases and 1.4 million deaths from the disease<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. The increasing prevalence of drug resistance is a major public health concern that threatens progress made in controlling drug-sensitive tuberculosis<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Globally, 4% of new cases and 20% of previously-treated cases are estimated to have multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis, defined as resistance to at least rifampicin and isoniazid with the highest proportions in Eastern Europe and Central Asia<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. MDR cases require prolonged costly treatment with toxic second-line drugs, and rates of treatment failure and mortality are high<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains, which are MDR with additional resistance to any fluoroquinolone and at least one of the second-line injectable agents (kanamycin, amikacin or capreomycin), have now been found in every region of the world<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Globally, the proportion of MDR-tuberculosis cases with XDR-tuberculosis has reached 9%. In the UK, 26 XDR cases were reported between 1995 and 2011; 45% (9/20) of the patients with known country of birth originated from Eastern Europe<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Recent years have seen an ominous accumulation of reports of &#8216;totally&#8217; drug-resistant strains, which are not susceptible to any tested drugs<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis is dependent on the rate of acquisition of resistance mutations (acquired resistance) and transmission of drug-resistant strains (primary resistance). In <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, drug resistance arises through chromosomal mutation, typically resulting in a fitness cost seen as a reduced growth rate <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Fitness cost generally inversely correlates with the mutation&#8217;s frequency in clinical isolates<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Compensatory mutations mitigating the deleterious effect of resistance mutations are also important in determining the transmissibility of specific genotypes<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Studies using molecular epidemiological clustering rates to assess the transmission cost of resistance genotypes report varying results<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> suggesting that fitness costs may be affected by epistasis, that is the phenotypic effect of a mutation depends on the presence or absence of other mutations in the same genome<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Whole genome sequencing (WGS) offers the power to track the evolutionary mechanisms that promote development and transmission of drug resistance within pathogen populations with unparalleled resolution.

In this prospective study, the largest of its kind yet reported, we used WGS to investigate the molecular mechanisms of resistance, fitness compensation and positive epistasis that together determine the transmissibility and prevalence of drug-resistant strains.

For comparison, we selected 28 sequences from a study of over 2,000 London-based tuberculosis patients, originating from 90 different countries, as representatives of the global population<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.

These variable sites were used to reconstruct a maximum-likelihood phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>).

Bayesian population genetic clustering<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> defined the two largest clades nested within the Beijing lineage: clade A and clade B, comprising 264 and 119 isolates, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). In addition to these clades, the majority of other Beijing isolates were members of smaller clusters; 60% (387/642) of all Beijing isolates differed from their last common ancestor by five or less SNPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). The Western part of Samara is geographically-isolated by the River Volga. Comparison of the isolate population in the West to the rest of the region revealed a significant reduction in the proportion of clade A (18% vs 28%, p=0.04; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>).</p><p id="P11">The EuroAmerican lineage showed a significantly higher nucleotide diversity (&#960;=0.0042, SD 0.00018, 95% CI 0.0038-0.0045) than the Beijing lineage (&#960;=0.0022, SD 0.00039, 95% CI 0.0015-0.0030). Fewer EuroAmerican isolates were members of closely-related clusters; 39% (137/355) differed from their last common ancestor by five or fewer SNPs (p&lt;0.001).

In addition to the household pair, 30 further pairs of isolates, three clusters of three isolates and one cluster of five isolates had zero SNP differences.

In support of this conjecture, the fifth XDR isolate, from a Chinese patient, was not a member of the East European sublineage. The Estonian isolate was also member of clade B.

Circulating strains belonged mainly to two lineages: Beijing and EuroAmerican. In concordance with other Russian-based studies, the Beijing lineage was dominant and accounted for two-thirds of isolates<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Relative to the Beijing lineage, EuroAmerican isolates were phylogenetically-diverse and the tree topology supports the division of this lineage into multiple sublineages<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Samaran Beijing isolates were essentially monophyletic with respect to isolates representing the global population, forming a group we term the East European sublineage, which was dominated by two clades of extremely limited diversity. Short genetic distance between tuberculosis isolates has been used to infer transmission links<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. In this population, we found large geographic distances within even identical clusters suggesting that they did not always reflect transmission events or that the importance of casual contact may be underestimated.</p><p id="P34">Genotypes conferring drug resistance were extremely common; 48% of isolates had an MDR genotype and 16% of these were XDR. In comparison to a small microbiologically-based study conducted in Samara in 2001<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>, the proportion of MDR isolates resistant to amikacin has remained relatively stable (7.2% vs 8.5%) whereas the frequency of fluoroquinolone resistance has risen substantially from 4.3% to 23.8%. However, fluoroquinolone resistance was significantly more likely to be acquired than other resistance genotypes indicating that <italic>gyrAB</italic> mutants may have impaired transmission fitness, impeding the spread of XDR clones. Current rates of resistance support the continued use of fluoroquinolones plus amikacin or capreomycin, rather than kanamycin, for MDR therapy. Whilst a fluoroquinolone plus prothionamide had high efficacy for MDR treatment in Lithuania, which has a comparable MDR-tuberculosis problem and similar historical treatment strategy<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, the frequency of <italic>ethA</italic> mutations in Russian isolates means thioamides may be ineffective in this population.</p><p id="P35">Drug resistance has previously been associated with the Beijing lineage<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Here we provide evidence that Beijing isolates were more likely to harbor the isoniazid-resistance genotype, <italic>katG</italic> S315T, that has a negligible fitness cost<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> and the rifampicin-resistance genotype, <italic>rpoB</italic> S450L, that we find strongly associated with putative compensatory mutations within the RNA polymerase genes. Other studies have shown that <italic>rpoC</italic> mutations restored fitness in competitive growth assays<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and were significantly more common in isolates belonging to a fingerprint-cluster than in non-clustered isolates<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. These observations explain, at least in part, the predominance of Beijing MDR isolates. The widespread use of kanamycin in MDR therapy may further exacerbate spread of MDR strains by selecting strains with <italic>eis</italic> mutations that both confer resistance<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> and increase bacterial multiplication in host macrophages<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> by disrupting the protective immune response<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. Interestingly, <italic>eis</italic> mutations were significantly associated with the dominant Beijing clades.</p><p id="P36">The epidemiological success of clade A was particularly striking and the &#8216;comb-like&#8217; structure of the tree, apparent in the distal portion of the clade, suggested a highly-infectious clone. The incomplete dispersion of clade A to Western Samara supports its recent and rapid spread. From this we deduced the presence of unidentified fitness-enhancing mutations, which led to the discovery of novel intra-<italic>rpoB</italic> compensatory mutations associated with rifampicin-resistance. In addition, we surmised that a novel SNP upstream of <italic>ethA</italic> likely confers low-level clinical ethionamide resistance, not detected <italic>in vitro</italic>, through promoter disruption or enhanced binding of the EthR repressor<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>.

The deduced frequency of acquired pyrazinamide resistance in the sequenced population, plus the small cluster size associated with primary resistance, suggests that mutants with non-functional PncA have impaired transmission efficiency. Given the prevalence of pyrazinamide resistance in the population, it is difficult to reconcile the epidemiological success of clade A with a pyrazinamide-sensitive phenotype. We speculate that the I6L substitution results in intermediate PncA activity that manifests as pyrazinamide sensitivity <italic>in vitro</italic> but clinical resistance <italic>in vivo</italic>, and retains sufficient nicotinamidase activity for efficient transmission.</p><p id="P38">We propose that the unusual combination of drug resistance and compensatory mutations acquired by clade A comprise a &#8216;perfect storm&#8217; providing clinical drug resistance without compromising fitness and transmissibility.</p><p id="P39">Preventing tuberculosis transmission relies on accurate and rapid diagnosis. Molecular methods that reduce the time taken to detect drug-resistant tuberculosis strains expedite the institution of effective therapy and efficient infection-control measures, thus minimizing the infectious period. WGS offers the potential for rapid unambiguous determination of all existing, clinically-significant drug resistance mutations and the reducing costs have neutralized a major argument over the value of targeted sequencing versus WGS. We have reported the existence of double mutations at some resistance loci, as well as the lineage- and clade-specific association of certain mutations which are suggestive of undiscovered epistatic interactions. These observations indicate that drug-resistance may be more multi-factorial than previously appreciated which, in some cases, may explain discordance between phenotypes and genotypes. As more resistance loci are identified, and the phenotypic effects of multiple mutations and strain background are elucidated, the public health value of routine WGS for diagnosis of drug resistance will increase, although it may vary depending on the prevalence and likely exposure to resistant strains.</p><p id="P40">We have reported, with others, the extensive prevalence of MDR Beijing isolates in Russia and former Soviet states of Eastern Europe<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, which shared a common treatment and BCG vaccination strategy.
