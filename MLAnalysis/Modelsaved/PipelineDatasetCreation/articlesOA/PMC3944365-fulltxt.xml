prostaglandin F2&#945; (PGF) production. However, the details of the regulatory mechanisms
controlling the cyclic changes in endometrial PGF production remain unclear. Here we
investigated the expression of the GC receptor (GC-R&#945;), the actions of cortisol throughout
the estrous cycle and the regulatory mechanism of GC-R&#945; in the bovine endometrium. The
levels of GC-R&#945; protein were greater at the mid-luteal stage (Days 8&#8211;12) than at the other
stages. Cr more strongly suppressed PGF production at the mid-luteal stage than at the
follicular stage. GC-R&#945; expression was increased by progesterone (P4) but decreased by
estradiol-17&#946; (E2) in cultured endometrial stromal cells. The overall results suggest that
ovarian steroid hormones control the cyclic changes in endometrial PGF production by
regulating GC-R&#945; expression in bovine endometrial stromal cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cattle</kwd><kwd>Endometrium</kwd><kwd>GC-R&#945;</kwd><kwd>Prostaglandins</kwd><kwd>Steroids</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The bovine endometrium synthesizes and secretes prostaglandin F2&#945; (PGF), which is the main
luteolysin responsible for regression of the corpus luteum (CL). In nonpregnant cows, the
uterus increases PGF production between days 17 and 19 postovulation [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The increase in uterine PGF production and its pulsatile release seem to
regulate the estrous cycle by inducing luteal regression in ruminants [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. We reported that the amount of PGF production by the bovine endometrium was low
at the mid-luteal stage, increased at the late-luteal stage and reached the highest levels at
estrus [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, PGF production and secretion by the
endometrium seem to be precisely regulated throughout the estrous cycle.</p><p>Glucocorticoids (GCs) derived from the adrenal cortex have been shown to regulate female
reproductive functions [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Recently, we suggested that an active GC, cortisol (Cr), affects
pregnancy rate and CL function in cattle [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In
addition, Cr suppresses basal and tumor necrosis factor-&#945;-stimulated PGF production in bovine
endometrial stromal cells but not in the epithelial cells [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, 11&#946;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSD11&#914;) play an important role in
regulating GC availability in target tissues. HSD11&#914; type 1 mainly converts cortisone to Cr in
the target organs [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A previous study demonstrated that the activity of HSD11&#914; in the bovine
endometrium was greater at the follicular stage and estrus than at the other stages of the
estrous cycle [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, PGF increased the
protein expression of HSD11&#914; in bovine endometrial stromal cells [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The above findings suggest that Cr plays some important roles in
regulating PGF production throughout the estrous cycle in the bovine endometrium.</p><p>The above findings raise the possibility that the intracellular availability of Cr increases
and that PGF production is thereby suppressed when HSD11&#914; expression and activity are high at
the follicular stage. However, PGF production by the bovine endometrium is highest at the
follicular stage [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of Cr on PGF production depends
on other factors. The biological action of Cr is mediated through the activation of specific
intracellular receptors, GC receptors (GC-R) [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Because Cr
actions depend on the expression of GC-R&#945; in the target organs, endometrial PGF production
appears to be regulated by not only changes in the levels of active GC (Cr) but also changes
in GC-R&#945; expression throughout the estrous cycle. However, the regulatory mechanisms
controlling the cyclic changes in endometrial PGF production remain unclear.</p><p>Progesterone (P4) and estradiol-17&#946; (E2) secreted by the ovary play crucial roles in
regulating functional and structural changes in the endometrium throughout the estrous cycle
[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Furthermore, in ruminants, the uterine
epithelium, stroma and myometrium all contain receptors for P4 and E2 [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesize that P4 and E2 regulate GC-R&#945; expression, which
plays an important role in controlling PGF production in the bovine endometrium.</p><p>In the present study, to determine the regulatory mechanisms of PGF production in the bovine
endometrium, we investigated 1) GC-R&#945; protein expression and the biological actions of Cr in
the bovine endometrium throughout the estrous cycle and 2) the roles of steroid hormones in
the regulation of GC-R&#945; expression in bovine endometrial stromal cells.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Collection of endometrial tissues</title><p>Apparently healthy uteri of Holstein cows without a visible conceptus were obtained at a
local slaughterhouse within 10&#8211;20 min of exsanguinations in accordance with protocols
approved by the local institutional animal care and use committee. The stages of the
estrous cycle were confirmed by macroscopic observation of the ovary and uterus as
described previously [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For protein determination, endometrial tissues (n=3/stage) were
collected from cows at six different stages of the estrous cycle (estrus, day 0;
early-luteal, days 2&#8211;3; developing, days 5&#8211;6; mid-luteal, days 8&#8211;12; late-luteal, days
15&#8211;17 and follicular stage, days 19&#8211;21). Intercaruncular endometrial tissues from the
uterine horn, ipsilateral to the CL, were used for experiments. The endometrial tissues
were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at &#8211;80 C until processed for
protein isolation. For experiments involving tissue culture and cell culture, the uteri
were submerged in ice-cold physiological saline and transported to the laboratory within
1&#8211;1.5 h on ice.</p></sec><sec><title>Culture of endometrial tissues</title><p>For tissue culture, endometrial tissues were obtained at the mid-luteal stage and at the
follicular stage. Endometrial tissue culture was conducted as described previously [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Briefly, endometrial strips were washed three times
in sterile saline solution containing penicillin (100 IU/ml) and streptomycin (100 &#956;g/ml).
The tissues were finally cut into small pieces (40 to 50 mg) with a scalpel and
subsequently washed another three times in Hank's balanced salt solution supplemented with
penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 &#956;g/ml) and 0.1% BSA. After hanging the tissues
with steel needles (TOP, Tokyo, Japan; 8N01B), the individual endometrial tissues were
placed into culture glass tubes (12 mm &#215; 75 mm; Kimble Chase Life Science and Research
Products, Vineland, NJ, USA; 73500-13100) containing 2 ml culture medium (DMEM/Ham's F-12;
1:1 (v/v) [Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA; 12400-024]) and supplemented with penicillin
(100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 &#956;g/ml) and 0.1% BSA under 5% CO2 in air. Endometrial
tissues were exposed to Cr (10&#8211;100 nM) at 37.5 C for 4 h. At the end of incubation, 1 ml
of the conditioned media were collected into 1.5 ml tubes containing 10 &#956;l of a stabilizer
solution (0.3 M EDTA, 1% (W/V) acetylsalicylic acid, pH 7.3) and frozen at &#8211;30 C. The
tissues were blotted on filter paper and weighed to normalize the PGF concentration. The
concentrations of PGF in the culture media after incubation were determined by enzyme
immunoassay (EIA). The PGF standard curve ranged from 0.016&#8211;4 ng/ml, and the ED 50 of the
assay was 0.25 ng/ml. The DNA content was used to standardize the PGF concentration in the
culture media.</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation of endometrial cells</title><p>Early-luteal stage uteri (days 2&#8211;5) were used for isolation of endometrial cells. The
epithelial and stromal cells from the bovine endometrium were enzymatically separated
(0.05% collagenase; Worthington Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ, USA; #CLS1) using procedures
described previously [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A polyvinyl catheter was
inserted into the side of the oviduct, and the ends of the horn were tied to retain
trypsin solution used to detach the epithelial cells as described herein. The uterine
lumen was washed three times with 30&#8211;50 ml of sterile Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free and
Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) supplemented with 100 IU/ml of
penicillin (Meiji Seika Pharma, Tokyo, Japan; 611400D3051), 100 &#181;g/ml of streptomycin
(Meiji Seika Pharma; 6161400D1034) and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Roche
Diagnostics, Manheim, Germany; 10735086001). Thirty to fifty milliliters of sterile HBSS
containing 0.3% (w/v) trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; T9201) was then infused
into the uterine lumen through the catheter.</p><p>After collection of the epithelial cells, the uterine lumen was washed with sterile HBSS
supplemented with antibiotics and 0.1% (w/v) BSA. The horn was then cut transversely with
scissors into several segments, which were slit to expose the endometrial surface.
Intercaruncular endometrial strips were dissected from the myometrial layer with a scalpel
and washed once in 50 ml of sterile HBSS containing antibiotics. The endometrial strips
were then minced into small pieces (1 mm<sup>3</sup>). The minced tissues (~ 5 g) were
digested by stirring for 60 min in 50 ml of sterile HBSS containing 0.05% (w/v)
collagenase, 0.005% (w/v) DNase I (BBI Enzymes, Cardiff, UK; DNP2), and 0.1% (w/v) BSA.
The dissociated cells were filtered through metal meshes (100 &#181;m and 80 &#181;m) to remove
undissociated tissue fragments. The filtrate was washed three times by centrifugation (10
min at 100 x<italic>g</italic>) with Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM)
(Sigma-Aldrich; D1152) supplemented with antibiotics and 0.1% (w/v) BSA. After the washes,
the cells were counted using a hemocytometer. The cell viability was greater than 85% as
assessed by 0.5% (w/v) trypan blue dye exclusion.</p></sec><sec><title>Culture of endometrial stromal cells</title><p>The final pellet of the isolated stromal cells was resuspended in culture medium

Two isoforms of GC-R
(GC-R&#945; and GC-R&#946;) originate from the same gene by alternative splicing of the GC-R primary
transcript [<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Since the ligand-dependent GC-R&#945;
stimulates gene transcription in Cr target tissues, GC-R&#945; is thought to be the active
receptor isoform [<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. GC-R&#945; protein was detected in
the nuclei of most cell types in the endometrium of cyclic and pregnant cows [<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In the present study, we examined whether changes in
GC-R&#945; expression during the estrous cycle are associated with PGF production in the bovine
endometrium. The protein expression of GC-R&#945; was significantly higher at the mid-luteal
stage than at the other stages. Since PGF production is significantly lower at the
mid-luteal stage than at the follicular stage [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], the
cyclic changes in GC-R&#945; seem to be associated with the regulation of PGF production in the
bovine endometrium. In fact, the suppressive effect of Cr on PGF production by the bovine
endometrial tissue was greater at the mid-luteal stage than at the follicular stage in the
present study. These findings suggest that changes in GC-R&#945; expression are relevant for the
suppressive effect of Cr on PGF production in the bovine endometrium.</p><p>Glucocorticoids and other steroid hormones downregulate the levels of their cognate
receptors in a number of target tissues and in many different cell lines [<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. GC-R&#945; was
downregulated by its own ligand in different cell types [<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This effect is thought to be a
feedback protector mechanism that would avoid deleterious effects of prolonged exposure to a
hormone [<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In the present study, Cr also inhibited GC-R&#945; mRNA and protein expression in
bovine endometrial stromal cells. The above findings suggest that Cr has a role in
regulating GC-R&#945; expression in bovine endometrial stromal cells. Although the plasma
concentration of Cr does not change throughout the estrous cycle [<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], the local concentration of Cr in the bovine endometrium has been
suggested to be regulated by the levels of HSD11B [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].
HSD11B protein expression and activity were greater at the follicular stage than at the
mid-luteal stage [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Thus, the reason why GC-R&#945;
expression was low at estrus and at the follicular stage in the present study may be
downregulation by a high level of local Cr.</p><p>Both P4 and E2 are sex steroid hormones that regulate several female reproductive functions
[<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The GC-R&#945; mRNA [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and protein expressions observed in our study were highest at the
mid-luteal stage in the bovine endometrium. The changes in GC-R&#945; expression throughout the
estrous cycle were similar to the cyclic changes in the plasma P4 concentration [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], suggesting that P4 is one of the regulators of GC-R&#945;
expression throughout the estrous cycle. In fact, P4 stimulated GC-R&#945; expression in cultured
stromal cells in the present study. In contrast to P4, the plasma E2 concentration increases
during the follicular stage and reaches a peak at estrus, when endometrial PGF production is
higher than at the other stages of the estrous cycle [<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. There is a great difference in the concentrations of P4 and E2 in bovine
peripheral blood. The concentrations of P4 and E2 (0.1&#8211;10 nM) used in the present study were
within the range of the concentrations used in previous studies [<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. E2 has been shown to
downregulate GC-R&#945; expression and influence the sensitivity to Cr in human breast cancer
cells [<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In agreement with these reports, E2
inhibited GC-R&#945; protein, but not <italic>GC-R&#945;</italic> mRNA expression in cultured bovine endometrial stromal cells in the present study, suggesting that E2 may influence the total
amount of GC-R&#945; protein by increasing protein catabolism or by reducing translational
efficiency in bovine endometrial stromal cells. Thus, P4 and E2 may regulate PGF production
by promoting or suppressing the expression of GC-R&#945;, at least in stromal cells.</p><p>In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest that the expression of GC-R&#945; is important
in regulation of PGF production in the bovine endometrium and that sex steroid hormones and
Cr control the cyclic changes in endometrial PGF production in the bovine endometrium at
least in part by regulating GC-R&#945; expression.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We are grateful to Dr S Ito (Kansai Medical University, Osaka, Japan) for antisera of PGF.
