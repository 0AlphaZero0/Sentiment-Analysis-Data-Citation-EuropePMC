<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In nonpregnant cows, the uterus increases PGF production between days 17 and 19 postovulation [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The increase in uterine PGF production and its pulsatile release seem to regulate the estrous cycle by inducing luteal regression in ruminants [2,3,4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We reported that the amount of PGF production by the bovine endometrium was low at the mid-luteal stage, increased at the late-luteal stage and reached the highest levels at estrus [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Thus, PGF production and secretion by the endometrium seem to be precisely regulated throughout the estrous cycle. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Glucocorticoids (GCs) derived from the adrenal cortex have been shown to regulate female reproductive functions [6, 7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Recently, we suggested that an active GC, cortisol (Cr), affects pregnancy rate and CL function in cattle [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In addition, Cr suppresses basal and tumor necrosis factor-α-stimulated PGF production in bovine endometrial stromal cells but not in the epithelial cells [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSD11Β) play an important role in regulating GC availability in target tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>HSD11Β type 1 mainly converts cortisone to Cr in the target organs [10, 11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>A previous study demonstrated that the activity of HSD11Β in the bovine endometrium was greater at the follicular stage and estrus than at the other stages of the estrous cycle [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In addition, PGF increased the protein expression of HSD11Β in bovine endometrial stromal cells [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The above findings suggest that Cr plays some important roles in regulating PGF production throughout the estrous cycle in the bovine endometrium. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The above findings raise the possibility that the intracellular availability of Cr increases and that PGF production is thereby suppressed when HSD11Β expression and activity are high at the follicular stage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>However, PGF production by the bovine endometrium is highest at the follicular stage [5, 9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of Cr on PGF production depends on other factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The biological action of Cr is mediated through the activation of specific intracellular receptors, GC receptors (GC-R) [12,13,14,15,16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Because Cr actions depend on the expression of GC-Rα in the target organs, endometrial PGF production appears to be regulated by not only changes in the levels of active GC (Cr) but also changes in GC-Rα expression throughout the estrous cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, the regulatory mechanisms controlling the cyclic changes in endometrial PGF production remain unclear. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Progesterone (P4) and estradiol-17β (E2) secreted by the ovary play crucial roles in regulating functional and structural changes in the endometrium throughout the estrous cycle [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in ruminants, the uterine epithelium, stroma and myometrium all contain receptors for P4 and E2 [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Thus, we hypothesize that P4 and E2 regulate GC-Rα expression, which plays an important role in controlling PGF production in the bovine endometrium. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In the present study, to determine the regulatory mechanisms of PGF production in the bovine endometrium, we investigated 1) GC-Rα protein expression and the biological actions of Cr in the bovine endometrium throughout the estrous cycle and 2) the roles of steroid hormones in the regulation of GC-Rα expression in bovine endometrial stromal cells. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>The biological action of Cr is mediated through intracellular GC-R. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Two isoforms of GC-R (GC-Rα and GC-Rβ) originate from the same gene by alternative splicing of the GC-R primary transcript [26,27,28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Since the ligand-dependent GC-Rα stimulates gene transcription in Cr target tissues, GC-Rα is thought to be the active receptor isoform [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>GC-Rα protein was detected in the nuclei of most cell types in the endometrium of cyclic and pregnant cows [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined whether changes in GC-Rα expression during the estrous cycle are associated with PGF production in the bovine endometrium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>The protein expression of GC-Rα was significantly higher at the mid-luteal stage than at the other stages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Since PGF production is significantly lower at the mid-luteal stage than at the follicular stage [5], the cyclic changes in GC-Rα seem to be associated with the regulation of PGF production in the bovine endometrium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>In fact, the suppressive effect of Cr on PGF production by the bovine endometrial tissue was greater at the mid-luteal stage than at the follicular stage in the present study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that changes in GC-Rα expression are relevant for the suppressive effect of Cr on PGF production in the bovine endometrium. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Glucocorticoids and other steroid hormones downregulate the levels of their cognate receptors in a number of target tissues and in many different cell lines [30, 31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>GC-Rα was downregulated by its own ligand in different cell types [32, 33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>This effect is thought to be a feedback protector mechanism that would avoid deleterious effects of prolonged exposure to a hormone [34, 35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>In the present study, Cr also inhibited GC-Rα mRNA and protein expression in bovine endometrial stromal cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>The above findings suggest that Cr has a role in regulating GC-Rα expression in bovine endometrial stromal cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Although the plasma concentration of Cr does not change throughout the estrous cycle [36], the local concentration of Cr in the bovine endometrium has been suggested to be regulated by the levels of HSD11B [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>HSD11B protein expression and activity were greater at the follicular stage than at the mid-luteal stage [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Thus, the reason why GC-Rα expression was low at estrus and at the follicular stage in the present study may be downregulation by a high level of local Cr. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Both P4 and E2 are sex steroid hormones that regulate several female reproductive functions [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>The GC-Rα mRNA [9] and protein expressions observed in our study were highest at the mid-luteal stage in the bovine endometrium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>The changes in GC-Rα expression throughout the estrous cycle were similar to the cyclic changes in the plasma P4 concentration [2], suggesting that P4 is one of the regulators of GC-Rα expression throughout the estrous cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>In fact, P4 stimulated GC-Rα expression in cultured stromal cells in the present study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>In contrast to P4, the plasma E2 concentration increases during the follicular stage and reaches a peak at estrus, when endometrial PGF production is higher than at the other stages of the estrous cycle [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>There is a great difference in the concentrations of P4 and E2 in bovine peripheral blood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of P4 and E2 (0.1–10 nM) used in the present study were within the range of the concentrations used in previous studies [38, 39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>E2 has been shown to downregulate GC-Rα expression and influence the sensitivity to Cr in human breast cancer cells [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>In agreement with these reports, E2 inhibited GC-Rα protein, but not GC-Rα mRNA expression in cultured bovine endometrial stromal cells in the present study, suggesting that E2 may influence the total amount of GC-Rα protein by increasing protein catabolism or by reducing translational efficiency in bovine endometrial stromal cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Thus, P4 and E2 may regulate PGF production by promoting or suppressing the expression of GC-Rα, at least in stromal cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest that the expression of GC-Rα is important in regulation of PGF production in the bovine endometrium and that sex steroid hormones and Cr control the cyclic changes in endometrial PGF production in the bovine endometrium at least in part by regulating GC-Rα expression. </plain></SENT>
