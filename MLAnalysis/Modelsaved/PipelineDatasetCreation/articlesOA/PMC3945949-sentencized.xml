</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>We describe a case of PL-IHS as suggested by the typical postural headache of the patient and the change of pattern of headache, which could have been the time of transition when cortical venous thrombosis developed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>The brain and spine features seen on MR imaging are also supportive of this diagnosis, showing classical features of intracranial hypotension and cortical venous thrombosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Our patient had multiple predisposing conditions, such as the early post-partum period, a history of previous intrauterine death and reduced activity of Protein C and Protein S. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>These predisposing conditions increased the likelihood of occurrence of thrombosis in our patient with PL-IHS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Similar findings have been also described by Wilder-Smith et al. 3; of their five PL-IHS patients, three had a predisposing prothrombotic condition. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of the PL-IHS-induced CVT can be explained by the Monro-Kellie-Abercrombie doctrine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the skull is a rigid structure, and the brain volume, venous blood and CSF are in state of equilibrium, so reduction or increase of either element leads alteration in the volume of the other two. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>In IHS, the CSF volume and pressure are reduced significantly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Two changes occur as a result of this: first in the venous compartment, there is increase in the intracranial venous volume, and second there is descent of the brain and brainstem structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>The venous volume expansion is due to the venous stasis and dilation of the sinuses, cortical and spinal veins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>This change occurs first in the meninges, both pachymeninges and leptomeninges. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>The pachymeninges do not have a blood-brain barrier; this leads to contrast extravasation and hence the post-contrast enhancement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Further, due to the descent of the brain there is distortion and stretching of the veins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>All the above changes are further aggravated in erect posture when there is acute dilation of the veins and further stretch on the venous walls, which leads to postural headache. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>This along with venous stasis may lead to CVT in some patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis has been further bolstered by the study by Canhao et al. 8 who showed reduction in the velocity of blood flow by approximately 50% in the straight sinus in patients after lumbar puncture. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>The concomitant use of IVCS has been proposed to be causative factor for the CVT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>This can partly be explained by the role of high dose steroids on CSF dynamics and vascular endothelium: steroid treatment has a paradoxical effect on CSF absorption and can either impair or facilitate its absorption. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Underlying prothrombotic conditions were Factor V Leiden mutation 3, Protein C deficiency 17 and lymphocytic lymphoma 5. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Since its initial description by Schou and Scherb in 1986 of PL-IHS and CVT 18, there has been the ongoing debate about whether they are both mere associations and whether their occurrence is only coincidence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>But over the last two decades there is formidable evidence suggesting causality 8, that is, of PL-IHS causing CVT, though the exact pathogenetic mechanism remains to be conclusively demonstrated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Further, the various settings in which the phenomenon has been observed suggest multiple risk factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Over the last 25 years of its description, the clinical characteristics have consistently demonstrated the headache pattern, starting as postural headache and then with a change in the headache character as it loses its orthostatic character; this should alert the treating clinician that the patient may have developed CVT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Though the phenomenon is very rare compared to the number of lumbar punctures being performed, the morbid outcome in one-quarter of patients reported should caution us. </plain></SENT>
