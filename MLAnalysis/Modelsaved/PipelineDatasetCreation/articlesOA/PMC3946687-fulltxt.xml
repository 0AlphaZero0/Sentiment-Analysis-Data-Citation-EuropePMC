Chemotherapeutic control of pathogens has classically focused either on insecticides that kill the vector itself or antimicrobials for infected patients. The limitation of the former is that it targets both infected and uninfected vectors and selects for resistant populations while the latter requires prompt and accurate diagnosis. An alternative strategy is to target vector molecules that permit the pathogen to establish itself, replicate, and/or develop within the vector. Using the rickettsial pathogen <italic>Anaplasma marginale</italic> and its tropical tick vector, <italic>Rhipicephalus microplus</italic>, as a model, we tested whether silencing specific gene targets would affect tick infection rates (the % of fed ticks that are infected with the pathogen) and pathogen levels within infected ticks. Silencing of three <italic>R. microplus</italic> genes, CK187220, CV437619 and TC18492, significantly decreased the <italic>A. marginale</italic> infection rate in salivary glands, whereas gene silencing of TC22382, TC17129 and TC16059 significantly increased the infection rate in salivary glands. However in all cases of significant difference in the infection rate, the pathogen levels in the ticks that did become infected, were not significantly different. These results are consistent with the targeted genes affecting the pathogen at early steps in infection of the vector rather than in replication efficiency. Identifying vector genes and subsequent determination of the encoded functions are initial steps in discovery of new targets for inhibiting pathogen development and subsequent transmission.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding was provided by United States Department of Agriculture Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service 35604-15440, National Institutes of Health AI044005, Wellcome Trust GR075800M, and United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Reseach Service 5348-32000-033-00D/-01S.

All three possible outcomes were observed with one or more of the gene-specific siRNA sets: an increase, decrease or no effect on the infection rate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0091062-t003">Table 3</xref>). Gene silencing of CK187220, CV437619, and TC18492 resulted in statistically significant decreases in the salivary gland infection rate, whereas gene silencing of TC17129 and TC16059 significantly increased the infection rate. Silencing of TC22382 in the salivary gland also resulted in a statistically significant increase in infection rate; however no increase was detectable in the midgut as the control ticks also had a 100% infection rate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0091062-t003">Table 3</xref>).

The first hypothesis, silencing of <italic>R. microplus</italic> genes significantly affects the <italic>A. marginale</italic> infection rate in the tick, was accepted based on the observation that gene silencing resulted in a decrease (CK187220, TC18492, CV437619) or an increase (TC22382, TC17129, TC16059) in the proportion of exposed ticks that acquired salivary gland infection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0091062-t003">Table 3</xref>). Molecules that inhibited CK187220, TC18492, CV437619 expression or function would be candidates for development of transmission blocking therapeutics. Although there are no significant homologs to CK187220 in the current data bases, the nucleotide sequence of TC18492 showed 85% identity with three <italic>Dermacentor variabilis</italic> contigs (GenBank accession no. EZ525453.1, EZ524522.1, EZ533121.1) identified in pooled RNA isolated from unfed, uninfected adult male <italic>D. variabilis</italic>, partially fed males naturally infected with <italic>A. marginale</italic>, and unfed adult females injected with bacteria and fungi <xref rid="pone.0091062-Jaworski1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The deduced amino acid sequence of TC18492 also revealed 56% identity (E value 2&#215;10<sup>&#8722;67</sup>) with an <italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic> putative secreted protein (GenBank accession no. XP_002435215.1). As TC18492 transcript and protein were, respectively, up-regulated in <italic>A. marginale</italic> and <italic>Babesia bovis</italic> infected <italic>R. microplus</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0091062-MercadoCuriel1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091062-Rachinsky1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, it raises the possibility that blocking TC18492 expression may be effective in blocking transmission of multiple pathogens.</p><p>The knockdown of CK187220, TC18492, and CV437619 gene expression following siRNA treatment was measured by normalization against actin. However, the level of salivary gland actin itself was decreased following injection with these siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091062-g002">Figure 2</xref>), thus the expression of these three genes was even more profoundly reduced than indicated by normalization against actin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091062-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This is especially relevant in the case of CV437619 where the silencing effect was not statistically significant when normalized against actin but there was a significant decrease in <italic>A. marginale</italic> infection rates. CV437619 shares 73% identity (E value, 8&#215;10<sup>&#8722;87</sup>) with an <italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic> Tat binding protein 1 (TBP-1)-interacting protein (GenBank accession no. XP_002409139.1). The TBP-1 superfamily has several members that are components of the 26S proteasome, a basic multi-protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins in an ATP-dependent fashion. That knockdown of all three genes, CK187220, TC18492, and CV437619, decreased overall actin levels suggests that the effects not only diminish pathogen infection but also affect normal cellular processes. Silencing of any one of the three genes did not completely abolish infection with <italic>A. marginale</italic>, however, suppression of gene combinations may have an additive or synergistic effect on blocking infection.</p><p>Silencing of TC22382, TC17129, and TC16059 resulted in increased <italic>A. marginale</italic> salivary gland infection rates. This suggests that the encoded proteins may normally function to inhibit infection, either directly or as members of cellular pathways. TC22382 has significant identity with NADH-ubiquinone reductases from ticks (<italic>Amblyomma variegatum</italic>, <italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic>), mosquitos (<italic>Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae</italic>) and flies (<italic>Drosophila pseudoobscura</italic>). NADH-ubiquinone reductase is a conserved metabolic enzyme located in the inner mitochondrial membrane that catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADH to coenzyme Q (CoQ). Interestingly, TC22382 is up regulated approximately three-fold in the midgut of adult male <italic>Dermacentor andersoni</italic> upon feeding <xref rid="pone.0091062-MercadoCuriel1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, consistent with increased energy needs upon uptake of blood meal components, diuresis, and water balance. In addition, innate immune responses also require increased energy, thus decreased expression may lower innate responses in the midgut epithelium. Unfortunately, the 100% infection rate in the midgut of controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0091062-t003">Table 3</xref>), which may reflect a combination of residual ingested blood and colonization in the midgut, prevented determination if knockdown of TC22382 expression resulted in an increased midgut infection rate, as was observed in the salivary glands.</p><p>TC17129 had identity to a highly conserved region of glutamine synthetase from a wide range of organisms including: the red flour beetle <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> (GenBank accession no. XP_967731.1, 72% identity, E value 3&#215;10<sup>&#8722;133</sup>), <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> (GenBank accession no. XP_312603.4, 71% identity, E value 1&#215;10<sup>&#8722;125</sup>), and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (GenBank accession no. ACV91641.1, NP_727525.1, NP_511123.2, 70% identity, E value 1&#215;10<sup>&#8722;122</sup>). Glutamine synthetase plays an essential role in the metabolism of nitrogen by catalyzing the condensation of glutamate and ammonia to form glutamine, protecting the cell against excitotoxicity, or other adaptations that alleviate high levels of glutamate and ammonia <xref rid="pone.0091062-Cemerikic1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In murine models of malaria and in <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> infection of its molluscan host <italic>Biomphalaria glabrata</italic>, infection was associated with increased glutamine synthetase expression, suggested to be a protective mechanism against infection-induced increases in glutamate levels <xref rid="pone.0091062-Rae1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091062-Penet1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The increased <italic>A. marginale</italic> infection rates upon TC17129 silencing in <italic>R. microplus</italic> ticks would be consistent with this role.</p><p>TC16059 has identity to aldehyde dehydrogenase from ticks including <italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic> and <italic>Ambylomma variegatum</italic>, as well several mosquito species, including <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>, <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>. NAD(P)<sup>+</sup>-dependent enzymes in the aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily are, in general, oxidoreductases that oxidize a wide range of endogenous and exogenous aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes, playing an important role in aldehyde detoxification. Additionally, they participate in 17 metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, fatty acid and pyruvate metabolism, and pentose and glucuronate interconversions, and serve as binding proteins and osmoregulants. Aldehyde dehydrogenase is stress-induced and glucose-repressed, and has been shown to play a role in insecticide resistance in <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0091062-Coleman1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. TC16059 and other aldehyde dehydrogenases share a number of highly conserved residues necessary for catalysis and cofactor binding. TC16059 may have an infection-derived stress protective function against <italic>A. marginale</italic> infection, which would explain the increased infection rate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0091062-t003">Table 3</xref>) associated with its silencing.</p><p>The second hypothesis, that silencing of the selected <italic>R. microplus</italic> genes affects the level of <italic>A. marginale</italic> within infected ticks, was rejected. This suggests that the targeted genes influence the pathogen at early steps in infection of the vector rather than in replication once infection is established. Importantly, the number of infected ticks has been shown to be a determinant of whether onward transmission to new mammalian hosts is successful, thus decreasing the infection rate, even if independent of the infection level, is likely to be successful in blocking transmission (Ueti et al., 2007, 2009; Agnes et al., 2010; Herndon et al, 2013).</p><p>Although there was variation in survival rates within and among treatment groups, these were not significantly different from the survival rate of the control group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0091062-t003">Table 3</xref>). This is consistent with tick death being a consequence of the injection procedures rather than a specific effect of the siRNA. This interpretation is also supported by differential survival rates between tick cohorts injected with two different siRNAs targeting the same gene as a gene specific effect on tick survival would be expected to be similar between the siRNA_A and _B treatments. Nonetheless, the possibility of gene specific effects on tick growth and survival cannot be definitively excluded and can be addressed by including data such as engorgement weight to better assess growth and development. Refinement of the siRNA injection protocol to markedly improve survival in the control groups would facilitate detection of effects on tick growth and development and allow these to be discriminated from effects limited to pathogen entry and survival.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Silencing of three <italic>Rhipicephalus microplus</italic> genes, CK187220, CV437619 and TC18492, significantly decreased the <italic>Anaplasma marginale</italic> infection rate in salivary glands, whereas gene silencing of TC22382, TC17129 and TC16059 significantly increased the infection rate in salivary glands. However in all cases of significant difference in the infection rate, the pathogen levels in the ticks that did become infected, were not significantly different. These results indicate that the targeted genes influence the pathogen at early steps in infection of the vector and provide specific targets for further testing that could lead to the development of small molecule inhibitors as transmission blocking chemotherapeutics.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank James Allison, Xiaoya Cheng, Melissa Flatt, Ralph Horn, Bev Hunter, and Kathy Mason for expert technical assistance.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0091062-Karim1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
