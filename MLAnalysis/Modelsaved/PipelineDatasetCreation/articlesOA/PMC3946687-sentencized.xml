<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>An alternative strategy is to target vector molecules that permit the pathogen to establish itself, replicate, and/or develop within the vector, thus specifically targeting only the small proportion of infected vectors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Vector competence, the ability to acquire and transmit pathogens, is a multifactorial process and involves multiple genes and gene networks in multiple organs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The vector midgut and salivary glands are attractive targets as these organs represent, respectively, sites of initial colonization and secretion into the saliva for transmission [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Using the rickettsial pathogen Anaplasma marginale and its tropical tick vector, Rhipicephalus microplus, as a model, we previously identified a set of tick midgut and salivary gland genes that are regulated in response to pathogen infection [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>We supplemented this set with R. microplus genes for which the expressed protein has been shown to vary in response to babesial infection [6], [7]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>In the present study we tested two linked hypotheses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>The first hypothesis, silencing of R. microplus genes significantly affects the A. marginale infection rate in the tick, was accepted based on the observation that gene silencing resulted in a decrease (CK187220, TC18492, CV437619) or an increase (TC22382, TC17129, TC16059) in the proportion of exposed ticks that acquired salivary gland infection (Table 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Molecules that inhibited CK187220, TC18492, CV437619 expression or function would be candidates for development of transmission blocking therapeutics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Although there are no significant homologs to CK187220 in the current data bases, the nucleotide sequence of TC18492 showed 85% identity with three Dermacentor variabilis contigs (GenBank accession no. EZ525453.1, EZ524522.1, EZ533121.1) identified in pooled RNA isolated from unfed, uninfected adult male D. variabilis, partially fed males naturally infected with A. marginale, and unfed adult females injected with bacteria and fungi [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>The deduced amino acid sequence of TC18492 also revealed 56% identity (E value 2×10−67) with an Ixodes scapularis putative secreted protein (GenBank accession no. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>XP_002435215.1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>As TC18492 transcript and protein were, respectively, up-regulated in A. marginale and Babesia bovis infected R. microplus [5], [6], it raises the possibility that blocking TC18492 expression may be effective in blocking transmission of multiple pathogens. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>The knockdown of CK187220, TC18492, and CV437619 gene expression following siRNA treatment was measured by normalization against actin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>However, the level of salivary gland actin itself was decreased following injection with these siRNAs (Figure 2), thus the expression of these three genes was even more profoundly reduced than indicated by normalization against actin levels (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>This is especially relevant in the case of CV437619 where the silencing effect was not statistically significant when normalized against actin but there was a significant decrease in A. marginale infection rates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>CV437619 shares 73% identity (E value, 8×10−87) with an Ixodes scapularis Tat binding protein 1 (TBP-1)-interacting protein (GenBank accession no. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>XP_002409139.1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>The TBP-1 superfamily has several members that are components of the 26S proteasome, a basic multi-protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins in an ATP-dependent fashion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>That knockdown of all three genes, CK187220, TC18492, and CV437619, decreased overall actin levels suggests that the effects not only diminish pathogen infection but also affect normal cellular processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Silencing of any one of the three genes did not completely abolish infection with A. marginale, however, suppression of gene combinations may have an additive or synergistic effect on blocking infection. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Silencing of TC22382, TC17129, and TC16059 resulted in increased A. marginale salivary gland infection rates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the encoded proteins may normally function to inhibit infection, either directly or as members of cellular pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>TC22382 has significant identity with NADH-ubiquinone reductases from ticks (Amblyomma variegatum, Ixodes scapularis), mosquitos (Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae) and flies (Drosophila pseudoobscura). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>NADH-ubiquinone reductase is a conserved metabolic enzyme located in the inner mitochondrial membrane that catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADH to coenzyme Q (CoQ). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, TC22382 is up regulated approximately three-fold in the midgut of adult male Dermacentor andersoni upon feeding [5], consistent with increased energy needs upon uptake of blood meal components, diuresis, and water balance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>In addition, innate immune responses also require increased energy, thus decreased expression may lower innate responses in the midgut epithelium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, the 100% infection rate in the midgut of controls (Table 3), which may reflect a combination of residual ingested blood and colonization in the midgut, prevented determination if knockdown of TC22382 expression resulted in an increased midgut infection rate, as was observed in the salivary glands. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>TC17129 had identity to a highly conserved region of glutamine synthetase from a wide range of organisms including: the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (GenBank accession no. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>XP_967731.1, 72% identity, E value 3×10−133), Anopheles gambiae (GenBank accession no. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Glutamine synthetase plays an essential role in the metabolism of nitrogen by catalyzing the condensation of glutamate and ammonia to form glutamine, protecting the cell against excitotoxicity, or other adaptations that alleviate high levels of glutamate and ammonia [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>In murine models of malaria and in Schistosoma mansoni infection of its molluscan host Biomphalaria glabrata, infection was associated with increased glutamine synthetase expression, suggested to be a protective mechanism against infection-induced increases in glutamate levels [20], [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>The increased A. marginale infection rates upon TC17129 silencing in R. microplus ticks would be consistent with this role. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>TC16059 has identity to aldehyde dehydrogenase from ticks including Ixodes scapularis and Ambylomma variegatum, as well several mosquito species, including Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>NAD(P)+-dependent enzymes in the aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily are, in general, oxidoreductases that oxidize a wide range of endogenous and exogenous aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes, playing an important role in aldehyde detoxification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Additionally, they participate in 17 metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, fatty acid and pyruvate metabolism, and pentose and glucuronate interconversions, and serve as binding proteins and osmoregulants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Aldehyde dehydrogenase is stress-induced and glucose-repressed, and has been shown to play a role in insecticide resistance in Culex quinquefasciatus [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>TC16059 and other aldehyde dehydrogenases share a number of highly conserved residues necessary for catalysis and cofactor binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>TC16059 may have an infection-derived stress protective function against A. marginale infection, which would explain the increased infection rate (Table 3) associated with its silencing. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>The second hypothesis, that silencing of the selected R. microplus genes affects the level of A. marginale within infected ticks, was rejected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the targeted genes influence the pathogen at early steps in infection of the vector rather than in replication once infection is established. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the number of infected ticks has been shown to be a determinant of whether onward transmission to new mammalian hosts is successful, thus decreasing the infection rate, even if independent of the infection level, is likely to be successful in blocking transmission (Ueti et al., 2007, 2009; Agnes et al., 2010; Herndon et al, 2013). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Although there was variation in survival rates within and among treatment groups, these were not significantly different from the survival rate of the control group (Table 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with tick death being a consequence of the injection procedures rather than a specific effect of the siRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>This interpretation is also supported by differential survival rates between tick cohorts injected with two different siRNAs targeting the same gene as a gene specific effect on tick survival would be expected to be similar between the siRNA_A and _B treatments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, the possibility of gene specific effects on tick growth and survival cannot be definitively excluded and can be addressed by including data such as engorgement weight to better assess growth and development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Refinement of the siRNA injection protocol to markedly improve survival in the control groups would facilitate detection of effects on tick growth and development and allow these to be discriminated from effects limited to pathogen entry and survival. </plain></SENT>
