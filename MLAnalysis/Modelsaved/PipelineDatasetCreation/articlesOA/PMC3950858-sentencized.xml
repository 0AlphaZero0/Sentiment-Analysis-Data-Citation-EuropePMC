<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Approximately 500 000 new cases are diagnosed each year, of which an estimated 274 000 will prove to be fatal (Haie-Meder et al, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In the last several decades, significant advances have been made in understanding the mechanism of cervical carcinogenesis (Castellsague et al, 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>However, the detailed mechanism of cervical carcinogenesis remains largely unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Therefore, identifying key factors in cervical cancer development may provide potential therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of cervical cancer. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signalling pathway appears to be a key regulator in cervical carcinogenesis, as it is activated in more than 90% of cervical carcinomas (Du and Wang, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Akt signalling is a downstream target of HPV E6/E7 oncoproteins, which have been identified as major mediators of cervical cancer development (Castellsague, 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The expression of HPV-type 16 E7 caused upregulation of Akt activity and inhibition of cell hyperproliferation via interaction with the Rb protein (Menges et al, 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Similarly, HPV-type 18 E6 protein upregulates the phospho-PI3K protein, which correlates with activated MAPKs and cell proliferation (Chakrabarti et al, 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Gene expression profiling also suggested that the PI3K/Akt pathway represents a therapeutic target in cervical cancer (Schwarz et al, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Therefore, targeting PI3K/Akt signalling pathway might be an attractive strategy for inhibiting tumour growth and invasion of cervical cancer. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding, single-stranded RNAs that control gene expression by inhibiting mRNA translation or by inducing mRNA degradation (Ambros, 2004; Kloosterman and Plasterk, 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs can regulate multiple steps of tumour growth and progression by modulating the expression of many genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In recent years, the role of miRNAs in regulating the expression of cell cycle-related genes at the post-transcriptional level has been investigated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>For example, miR-96 has been shown to promote human breast cancer cell proliferation by downregulating FOXO3a expression (Lin et al, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>miR-194 has been suggested to act as a tumour suppressor that inhibits metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer by targeting BMP1 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 (Wu et al, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>However, there have been few detailed studies on the role of miRNAs in cervical cancer. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we identified miR-196a, which was selected from a previously published microarray data set (NCBI/GEO/GSE6188), as a candidate oncogenic miRNA in cervical cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Our in vitro studies showed that expression of miR-196a was markedly elevated in cervical cancer cells and surgical cervical cancer specimens, and that miR-196a expression was correlated with tumour stage and clinical prognosis of cervical cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-196a promotes cervical cancer cell proliferation by binding to the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of FOXO1 and p27Kip1 mRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Thus, miR-196a may have a fundamental role in the development and progression of cervical cancer. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>miR-196a is located in the vertebrate homoeobox (HOX) gene cluster region, which encodes homoeodomain-containing transcription factors that regulate differential genetic programmes during embryonic development (Alonso, 2002; Woltering and Durston, 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>The expression of miR-196a is influenced by regulatory controls imposed on the HOX clusters (Mansfield et al, 2004). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Transfection of C33A and CaSki cells with FOXO1 (without 3′-UTR) significantly inhibited miR-196a-induced proliferation, whereas transfection with FOXO1-3′-UTR (with 3′-UTR) only partially suppressed the proliferation induced by miR-196a overexpression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Expression of FOXO1 and p27Kip1 proteins was also significantly downregulated in miR-196a-overexpressing C33A and CaSki cells. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>FOXO expression leads to G1/S arrest, resulting from increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21Cip1 and p27Kip1, and downregulation of cyclin D1 (Schmidt et al, 2002; Huang and Tindall, 2007; Zhang et al, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Of the FOXO family members, only FOXO1 has been shown to have a crucial role in female genital tract cancer development.

<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>As a tight modulator of CDK-dependent phenotypes, p27Kip1 correlates with tumour growth and aggressiveness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>When p27Kip1 is localised in the cytosol, it acts as a cytoskeleton-remodelling protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>In the nucleus, p27Kip1 functions as an anti-proliferative protein (Borriello et al, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>In the cancer research field, it is known that ectopic expression of p27Kip1 induces growth arrest of cancer cells and suppresses cancer xenograft growth (Park et al, 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Transactivation of p27Kip1 inhibits cancer cell growth (Wu and Zheng, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>It has also been reported that miR-196a could promote gastric cancer cell proliferation by downregulating p27Kip1 (Sun et al, 2012). </plain></SENT>
