<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While it is yet to be confirmed whether the anti-sense RNA technique can be applied to prokaryotes, site-directed mutagenesis remains the method of choice for knockout of target genes in prokaryotic organisms (Terada et al. 1991). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Tarlan and Mammedov (2005) reported that C. reinhardtii has two PEPC genes; pepc1 encodes a plant-type enzyme whereas pepc2 encodes a bacterial-type enzyme. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Our results raise three important points: (1) PEPC may play a key role as a metabolic pivot in controlling the directions of some metabolism pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>For example, up-regulation of pepc expression may lead to increased amino acid biosynthesis and protein accumulation, whereas down-regulation appears to result in increased lipid accumulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>(2) Use of only a small portion (1/7) of the C. reinhardtiipepc2 gene was effective at down-regulating the expression of the E. colipepc gene in the reverse mutant, as observed in previous RNAi experiments (Deng et al. 2011), despite a comparable growth rate to wild type cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>(3) Up- and down-regulation of E. coli was controlled by algal pepc2, suggesting a close structural homogeneity between the prokaryotic and eukaryotic enzymes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>These results suggest the reverse vector method could prove to be an effective reverse genetic method for functional studies and also for potential industrial applications such as engineering organisms for biodiesel production. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Gene knockout and knockdown are powerful and widely used methods for studying gene function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Often, gene function can be determined by routine transformation and heterologous expression in model organisms such as E. coli. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>However, progress in reverse genetic studies has been much slower in prokaryotes than in eukaryotic organisms, which limits E. coli as a model organism for functional genomics experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>About 15 years ago, we began investigating reverse genetics approaches in E. coli using the glnA glutamine synthetase gene (Qin et al. 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Although progress was made, our previous studies were restricted to prokaryotic genes (Hou et al. 2008; Jia et al. 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have demonstrated that eukaryotic algal pepc2 is capable of downregulating the expression of E. colipepc through reverse genetics. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>The sequences of most eukaryotic genes are relatively long, and the capacity of prokaryotic expression vectors is often limited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Choosing the functionally important gene fragment is essential for successful application of the reverse vector method. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>The 639 bp fragment of pepc2 used in this study was chosen with reference to the molecular evolution study performed by Gehrig et al. (1998). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>The maximal increase in total lipid content was 28 %, which was somewhat lower than that reported by Hou et al. (2008), who found that transformation of E.coli with Anabaena 7,120 pepc with a reverse expression vector increased total lipid content by 47 %. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>This difference may be associated with the degree of identity between the two gene sequences; C. reinhardtiipepc2 and E. colipepc are 65 % identical, whereas Anabaena 7,120 and E. colipepc gene are 72 % identical. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>The catalytic activity of PEPC is not directly involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Down-regulation of pepc decreases oxaloacetate (OAA), a precursor in amino acid biosynthesis, and increases pyruvate and acetyl-CoA, key precursors in fatty acid biosynthesis (Beck et al. 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results indicate that down-regulation of pepc expression may up-regulate pyruvate kinase and hence pyruvate levels, pyruvate dehydrogenases that catalyze the biosynthesis of acetyl-CoA, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase that directly synthesizes acetyl-CoA (Beck et al. 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>PEPC may therefore function as a metabolic pivot that regulates multiple pathways simultaneously. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>A better understanding of the role of PEPC in microalgal metabolic pathways may prove useful for industrial applications such as biodiesel production. </plain></SENT>
