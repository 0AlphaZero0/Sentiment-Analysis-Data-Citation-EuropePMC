</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Several types of unrelated proteins appear to exhibit intrinsic surfactant activity as their primary function, which, for the moment, appears to be the case for latherin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Latherin is one of the most abundant proteins in the sweat of horses, it is also found in horse saliva, and is a known allergen to some humans (McDonald et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Latherin’s function is believed to be to wet the hydrophobic hairs in order to enhance the rate of translocation of sweat water to the surface of the pelt for evaporative cooling (McDonald et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The hydrophobins, a family of surface active proteins produced by filamentous fungi, and RSN-2, a surfactant protein present in the foam nests of certain species of frogs, have been investigated at the protein structure level (Linder 2009; Cooper et al. 2005; Fleming et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Latherin exhibits no amino acid sequence similarities to either of these proteins, but is instead a member of the palate, lung, and nasal epithelium carcinoma-associated family of proteins (PLUNCs) found in mammals (McDonald et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Latherin and PLUNCs are, in turn, related to the larger, two-domain bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI), cholesteryl ester-transfer protein (CETP) and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Although the functions of individual PLUNCs have not been confirmed, they are postulated to have some role within the innate immune response (Bingle and Craven 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The structures of BPI and CETP are available, but no structure for any member of the PLUNC family has thus far been reported. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Latherin’s amino acid sequence is unusually rich in aliphatic residues, in particular leucine, which contributes almost 25 % of the residues present, compared to the SwissProt average for all proteins within that database of 9.67 % (McDonald et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This abundance of leucines is also a feature of one of the PLUNCs from humans that, like latherin, exhibits strong surfactant activity (Gakhar et al. 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Latherin, therefore, not only presents an opportunity to investigate the relationship between structure and function of a unique surfactant protein of mammals, but potentially also to understand the structure and function of the PLUNCs as a whole, for which there is currently little or no structural and direct functional information. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>A synthetic latherin (sLath) gene based upon the previously described, cDNA encoding latherin (GenBank AF491288; UniProt/Swiss-Prot P82615), excluding the presumptive secretory leader/signal peptide, optimised for expression in Escherichia coli, was purchased from GeneArt. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The sLath gene was then directionally inserted into the NcoI, BamHI sites of the pET32a expression vector (Novagen) allowing for the production of recombinant latherin extended by two extra amino acids, AM (single letter amino acid code) at the N-terminus of the wild-type sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The ‘sLath/pET32’ plasmid was transformed into Tuner (DE3) cells (Novagen). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Expression was carried out in Luria–Bertani broth for non-labeled samples or M9 minimal media (Sambrook et al. 1989) containing the relevant isotope(s) for the production of single (15N only) or double (15N, 13C) labeled samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The protein was purified to near homogeneity as estimated from SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, as described previously (McDonald et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>For the purpose of NMR, protein was concentrated to approximately 600 μM in 50 mM NaCl, 20 mM sodium phosphate, 1 mM sodium azide, pH 7.5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>D2O was added to a final concentration of 5 % (v/v). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>All experiments were performed at 310 °K using a Bruker AVANCE 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with 5 mm triple-resonance probes and pulsed-field gradients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The WATERGATE tailored selective excitation sequence was typically used for water suppression (Piotto et al. 1992). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Proton chemical shifts were referenced relative to the H2O offset frequency and heteronuclear chemical shifts calculated from the proton reference according to the method of Wishart et al. (1995). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>NMR spectra were processed using AZARA (Wayne Boucher, Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bio.cam.ac.uk/azara">http://www.bio.cam.ac.uk/azara</ext-link>) and assigned using CCPNmr analysis (Vranken et al. 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Maximum entropy reconstruction (Laue et al. 1986) was used to enhance resolution of the indirect dimensions of three-dimensional experiments. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Sequence-specific resonance assignment of the latherin backbone was accomplished with the aid of 2D 15N-HSQC (see Fig. 1), 3D HNCACB, 3D CBCA(CO)NH (Muhandiram and Kay 1994), 3D HNCO (Kay et al. 1994), 3D HNCACO, 3D HBHA(CBCA)NH (Wang et al. 1994) and HBHA(CBCACO)NH spectra. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The majority of aliphatic sidechain carbon and proton resonances were located by navigating from the backbone data using 2D 13C-HSQC, 3D (H)C(CO)NH-TOCSY, 3D and 3D H(C)(CO)NH-TOCSY spectra (Grzesiek and Bax 1992). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The high number of overlapping leucine sidechain resonances were assigned using 3D methyl-selective experiments (Uhrin et al. 2000) modified for the removal of CH2 resonances from the methyl proton-carbon planes (see Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Remaining aliphatic resonances were identified using 3D 13C-edited [1H, 1H]-NOESY spectra. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>A proportion of aromatic sidechain 13C/1H signals (histidine Hδ1, tryptophan Hδ1, tyrosine Hδ,ε and phenylalanine Hδ,ε) were assigned using 2D HBCBCGCDHD and 2D HBCBCGCDCEHE spectra (Yamazaki et al. 1993) and the remainder were identified from the 13C-edited [1H, 1H]-NOESY spectrum.Fig. 1The 15N HSQC spectrum of latherin at 310 K. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>All latherin polypeptide backbone resonances were assigned, with the exception of the N-terminal residues A(−2), M(−1), A(0); two isolated residues S59, K82; and a number of residues located on a dynamic loop region (G145, N146, S149, L150, N153, A154). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>A total of 93.51 % of backbone residues were identified, while assignment of non-labile amino acid sidechain protons is 94.23 % complete. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The majority of the missing assignments are those of the residues within the 145–154 residue dynamic loop region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Despite their high relative abundance within the protein, the experiments nevertheless allowed full assignment of all leucine residues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>A few resonances displayed chemical shifts outwith the known distribution of shifts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Sidechain protons in residues (85D, 113R and 180 N) all displayed the effects of ring current shift due to their close proximity to aromatic residues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>135L Cγ has an atypical chemical shift of 31.09 ppm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>This residue is buried within the hydrophobic core of the protein surrounded by other aliphatic residues, and analysis of its stereochemical properties in the calculated structure indicated φ, Ψ, χ1 and χ2 bond angles in favourable regions. </plain></SENT>
