Its production is almost exclusively based on natural recruitment, which is subject to high annual fluctuations. Increased knowledge of the natural reproductive cycle of <italic>R. decussatus</italic> and its molecular mechanisms would be particularly important in providing new highly valuable genomic information for better understanding the regulation of reproduction in this economically important aquaculture species. In this study, the transcriptomic bases of <italic>R. decussatus</italic> reproduction have been analysed using a custom oligonucleotide microarray representing 51,678 assembled contigs. Microarray analyses were performed in four gonadal maturation stages from two different Portuguese wild populations, characterized by different responses to spawning induction when used as progenitors in hatchery. A comparison between the two populations elucidated a specific pathway involved in the recognition signals and binding between the oocyte and components of the sperm plasma membrane. We suggest that this pathway can explain part of the differences in terms of spawning induction success between the two populations. In addition, sexes and reproductive stages were compared and a correlation between mRNA levels and gonadal area was investigated. The lists of differentially expressed genes revealed that sex explains most of the variance in gonadal gene expression.

The European clam, despite a relatively low European production (8200 tons/year) <xref rid="pone.0092202-FAO1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, is considered a high value seafood product and one of the most important bivalve species economically in Southern European countries like Italy, Spain and Portugal <xref rid="pone.0092202-Matias1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>The culture of <italic>R. decussatus</italic> is clearly limited by the availability of seed. Its production is almost exclusively based on natural recruitment, which is subject to high annual fluctuations due to pollution and other environmental factors. To address this situation, artificial spawning and larval rearing programs were developed to provide an alternative source of seed <xref rid="pone.0092202-Matias1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, but still need improvement to gain robustness of seed production.</p><p>
<italic>R. decussatus</italic> is a gonochoric molluscan species (possessing separate sexes) that reproduces annually <xref rid="pone.0092202-Vilela1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Generally, the gonad regresses at the end of the annual reproductive cycle, which is the end of summer in temperate regions, and regenerates at the beginning of the following one (the end of winter). During the initial stage of gametogenesis, period of sexual rest (I), gonadal follicles are absent and connective and muscular tissue occupies the entire zone from the digestive gland to the foot. There is no evidence of gonadal development and determination of sex is not possible. During the second stage of gametogenesis (II) follicles and gonadal acini begin to appear in females and males, respectively. They increase in size, and appear filled with oocytes in the growth phase in the females and with immature gametes (spermatogonia and spermatocytes) in the males. During advanced gametogenesis (III) the follicles occupy a large part of the visceral mass and it's possible to observe the first signs of partial emission of gametes when it occurs. The maturation period (IV) corresponds to the maturity of the majority of gametes. Throughout this period partial spawning may occur, and it concludes with the total emission of gametes <xref rid="pone.0092202-Delgado1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Currently, the knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of reproduction in marine bivalves is very limited, but is expected to increase rapidly, due to the advent of high throughput genomic approaches <xref rid="pone.0092202-Dheilly1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Here, a large and exhaustive approach is proposed for investigating the molecular bases of variability in reproductive success and, more generally, the reproductive mechanisms in <italic>R. decussatus</italic>. Some specific studies have recently explored this topic. The gonadal transcriptome was described and lists of genes of interest for reproductive stage and sex were established for the alternative and irregular protandrous hermaphrodite, the Pacific oyster, <italic>Crassostrea gigas</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0092202-Dheilly1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and for the functional hermaphrodite scallop <italic>Nodipecten subnodosus</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0092202-LleraHerrera1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Most importantly, cross-referencing these lists of genes allowed the identification of potential markers of early sex differentiation and new highly valuable information on genes specifically expressed by mature spermatozoids and mature oocytes. Additionally, dedicated studies have been made in <italic>Argopectyen purpuratus</italic>, <italic>C. gigas</italic> and <italic>Mytilus galloprovincialis</italic> emphasizing specific reproductive processes <xref rid="pone.0092202-Boutet1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092202-Fabioux1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092202-Fabioux2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092202-Fleury1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092202-Obata1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>In <italic>R. decussatus</italic>, apart from a few specific gene expression analyses (see <xref rid="pone.0092202-Moreira1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>) and a first version of DNA microarray designed to unravel host-parasite interactions <xref rid="pone.0092202-Leite1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, very little information is available on genome-wide expression profiling for physiological, environmental or aquaculture questions.</p><p>For the present work, cDNA libraries of oocytes, larval stages and different gonadal maturation stages were sequenced on the Illumina platform, and a custom oligonucleotide microarray representing 51,678 assembled contigs was designed and used to characterize the transcriptomic bases of reproduction in <italic>R. decussatus</italic>.

The clam gonad undergoes continuous development until it becomes fully mature. At that moment, the gonads or gonadal tissue form a significant portion of the soft parts of the animal. Gonaducts that will carry the gametes to the body chamber develop, enlarge and are readily observed in the gonad. For this reason, in males as in females, the gonadal area increases with the evolution of the reproductive stages and is considered as a proxy of the reproductive effort <xref rid="pone.0092202-Serdar1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Reproductive effort and the underlying mechanisms are of great interest for many marine bivalve species that have a very high fecundity, a characteristic of the &#8220;r&#8221; demographic strategy. Indeed, gametogenesis has a major impact on several physiological functions, generating phenotypic and genetic trade-offs with growth and survival (as established in oysters <xref rid="pone.0092202-Ernande1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>), meaning that reproductive effort improves at the expense of survival. We identified 7,226 annotated probes correlated with female gonad area and therefore, potentially, with the number and/or the size of the gametes produced. These probes included <italic>Foxl2</italic>, an evolutionarily conserved female-specific transcription factor, which is conserved from the sponge <italic>Suberites domuncula</italic> to humans <xref rid="pone.0092202-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>; <italic>VTG</italic>; <italic>condensing 2</italic>, expressed in oocytes and involved in maintaining the rigidity of chromosomes in prophase; Mitotic apparatus protein <italic>p62</italic> that binds to condensed chromosomes at prophase of meiosis I; and <italic>Cep57</italic>, a centrosomal protein required for microtubule attachment to centrosomes. These female-specific genes, which were positively correlated with gonad areas, were also identified as potentially involved in oogenesis in <italic>C. gigas</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0092202-Dheilly1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In males, genes expressed included the <italic>SPAG6</italic>, <italic>SPAG16</italic> and <italic>SPAG17</italic>, <italic>MOSPD2</italic>, sperm surface protein <italic>Sp17</italic>, sperm flagellar proteins 1 and 2 and <italic>dpy-30</italic>, all involved in spermatogenesis. <italic>dpy-30</italic> is involved in male development and described as an attractive new candidate gene for the regulation of sex differentiation in oysters <xref rid="pone.0092202-Dheilly1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.

The presence of gametes in the water provides an additional stimulus that generates a spawning response in broodstock, due to the presence of hormones (pheromones) that will act as recognition signals between gametes <xref rid="pone.0092202-ParwadaniAji1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Indeed, a surface glycoprotein was identified as the mate recognition signal in the caridean shrimp <italic>Palaemonetes pugio</italic> where glucosamine was considered a pheromone functioning in mate recognition <xref rid="pone.0092202-Caskey1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Although it had a low statistical significance value for enrichment in DAVID (P&#8202;=&#8202;0.09), &#8220;N-Glycan biosynthesis&#8221; (dre00510) was found among the enriched KEGG pathways with the highest number of gene entries. N-glycans have an important role acting as recognition signals and binding between the extracellular coat of the egg and components of the sperm plasma membrane, generally termed &#8220;primary binding&#8221; <xref rid="pone.0092202-DiPatrizi1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Taking into account that &#8220;N-Glycan biosynthesis&#8221; (dre00510) pathway was down-regulated in the population of Ria Formosa, we propose that, in some way, this recognition process can explain some of the differences in spawning induction success observed between the two Portuguese populations. Indeed, it was previously demonstrated that environment can strongly affect reproduction of <italic>R. decussatus</italic>, notably in terms of fecundity level <xref rid="pone.0092202-Matias2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Additionally, among the genes involved in N-Glycan biosynthesis, we found fucosyltransferase (<italic>FucT</italic>) differentially expressed with a fold change of 2.23. This enzyme is implicated in species-specific binding of sperm to eggs in mammals <xref rid="pone.0092202-Wassarman1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0092202-Chiu1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0092202-Venditti1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. In addition, ADAMs family genes (A Disintegrin and A Metalloprotease domain) as well as several integrin ligands appeared differentially expressed between the two populations. Several studies have indicated that these molecules are involved in cell adhesion and sperm-egg interaction (<italic>e.g</italic>. <xref rid="pone.0092202-Evans1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>

<xref rid="pone.0092202-Eto1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that &#8220;primary binding&#8221; could be responsible for the main differences in the reproductive behavior of the two populations.</p><p>Recent histological examinations of these two populations showed significant differences in the dynamics of gametogenesis <xref rid="pone.0092202-Matias2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>: the maturation process begins earlier in the northern population probably due to contrasted environmental factors mainly temperature, which is already characterized as the main source of variation in the timing of gametogenesis (<italic>e.g</italic>. <xref rid="pone.0092202-Fabioux3" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>). Sea surface temperature (SST) was relatively lower compared to Ria Formosa lagoon, though with higher chlorophyll values <xref rid="pone.0092202-Matias2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Nonetheless, similar values of oocyte diameter and gonadic area were reported, suggesting similar investment in reproduction in the two populations. In terms of gene expression, hierarchical clustering using Pearson's correlation, identified three main clusters: Ria Formosa, Ria de Aveiro and Female Stage III and IV from Ria de Aveiro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092202-g005">Figure 5</xref>), suggesting that the biggest differences originate from the females in the later stages of gametogenesis, and may be due to a difference in gamete maturity that may be implicated in the differences in response to spawning induction. These differences can originate from environmental differences and/or some genetically based variation between the two populations. Among all the comparisons made between populations for each reproductive stage and sex, the one performed with stage IV females presented the highest number of differentially expressed probes (5,133 probes; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092202.s013">Table S13</xref>). In this comparison, &#8220;Cell cycle&#8221; (dre04110), &#8220;Spliceosome&#8221; (dre03040), &#8220;Ubiquitin mediated proteolysis&#8221; (dre04120) and &#8220;Oocyte meiosis&#8221; (dre04114) terms were the most represented in the enriched KEGG pathway terms with 45, 32, 30 and 28 genes, respectively. Due to their specific environments, these populations might adopt different reproductive strategies: the Ria de Aveiro population retrieves its energy reserves immediately after spawning, however, the same is not verified in clams from Ria Formosa Lagoon, with their consequent decline. Considering these facts, it is likely that, at some point, the process of oogenesis diverged between females of the two populations. Among the genes differentially expressed, the <italic>SKP1</italic> and the <italic>Mad2l1</italic> previously described, were present. The <italic>SKP1</italic> is an essential component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, which mediates the ubiquitination of proteins involved in cell cycle progression, signal transduction and transcription. Other important differentially expressed genes were found, such as <italic>cdc16</italic>, <italic>cdc20</italic>, <italic>cdc27</italic>, which are components of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a cell cycle-regulated E3 ubiquitin ligase controlling progression through mitosis and the G1 phase of the cell cycle. In addition, genes like <italic>CCNB1</italic> and <italic>CCNE2</italic> were present and are essential in controlling the progression of cells through the cell cycle, by activating <italic>Cdk</italic> enzymes. Cyclin-encoding transcripts represent maternal mRNAs, known to be stocked in oocytes during oogenesis and maternally transmitted to embryos before the start of embryonic transcription <xref rid="pone.0092202-Wada1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.</p><p>A total of 3,588 differentially expressed probes were also obtained in the comparison made between males of stage II. &#8220;Insulin signaling pathway&#8221; (dre04910) was the most represented in the enriched KEGG pathway terms. In addition to its function in somatic cells, it was demonstrated that insulin signaling plays an essential role in cell proliferation and growth during male <italic>Drosophila</italic> gametogenesis where sperm production is regulated by hormonal control via insulin-like peptides <xref rid="pone.0092202-Ueishi1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Moreover, the level of some mRNA in insulin pathway was also identified as correlated with gamete quality in fishes <xref rid="pone.0092202-Aegerter1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0092202-Bobe1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Additionally, the <italic>MAPK1</italic> was found differentially expressed. Studies have shown that male reproductive function is modulated via the <italic>MAPK</italic> cascade. The <italic>MAPK</italic> cascade is involved in numerous male reproductive processes, including spermatogenesis, sperm maturation and activation, capacitation and acrosome reaction, before fertilization of the oocyte <xref rid="pone.0092202-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Considering that no additional significant results were observed for the remaining comparisons performed, we suggest that it is in the later stages of oogenesis (stage IV) and in the earlier stages of spermatogenesis (stage II), that the major differences between the two studied populations occur.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we identified several differentially expressed probes, which led us to a specific pathway involved in the recognition signals and binding between the oocyte and components of the sperm plasma membrane.
