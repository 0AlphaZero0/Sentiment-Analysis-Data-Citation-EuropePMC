</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The European clam, Ruditapes decussatus (Linnaeus, 1758) is a bivalve mollusc of the family Veneridae, native to the European Atlantic and Mediterranean coastal waters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The European clam, despite a relatively low European production (8200 tons/year) [1], is considered a high value seafood product and one of the most important bivalve species economically in Southern European countries like Italy, Spain and Portugal [2]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The culture of R. decussatus is clearly limited by the availability of seed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Its production is almost exclusively based on natural recruitment, which is subject to high annual fluctuations due to pollution and other environmental factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>To address this situation, artificial spawning and larval rearing programs were developed to provide an alternative source of seed [2], but still need improvement to gain robustness of seed production. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>R. decussatus is a gonochoric molluscan species (possessing separate sexes) that reproduces annually [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Generally, the gonad regresses at the end of the annual reproductive cycle, which is the end of summer in temperate regions, and regenerates at the beginning of the following one (the end of winter). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>During the initial stage of gametogenesis, period of sexual rest (I), gonadal follicles are absent and connective and muscular tissue occupies the entire zone from the digestive gland to the foot. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>There is no evidence of gonadal development and determination of sex is not possible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>During the second stage of gametogenesis (II) follicles and gonadal acini begin to appear in females and males, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>They increase in size, and appear filled with oocytes in the growth phase in the females and with immature gametes (spermatogonia and spermatocytes) in the males. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>During advanced gametogenesis (III) the follicles occupy a large part of the visceral mass and it's possible to observe the first signs of partial emission of gametes when it occurs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The maturation period (IV) corresponds to the maturity of the majority of gametes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Throughout this period partial spawning may occur, and it concludes with the total emission of gametes [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Currently, the knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of reproduction in marine bivalves is very limited, but is expected to increase rapidly, due to the advent of high throughput genomic approaches [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Here, a large and exhaustive approach is proposed for investigating the molecular bases of variability in reproductive success and, more generally, the reproductive mechanisms in R. decussatus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Some specific studies have recently explored this topic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The gonadal transcriptome was described and lists of genes of interest for reproductive stage and sex were established for the alternative and irregular protandrous hermaphrodite, the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas [5] and for the functional hermaphrodite scallop Nodipecten subnodosus [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, cross-referencing these lists of genes allowed the identification of potential markers of early sex differentiation and new highly valuable information on genes specifically expressed by mature spermatozoids and mature oocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Additionally, dedicated studies have been made in Argopectyen purpuratus, C. gigas and Mytilus galloprovincialis emphasizing specific reproductive processes [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In R. decussatus, apart from a few specific gene expression analyses (see [12]) and a first version of DNA microarray designed to unravel host-parasite interactions [13], very little information is available on genome-wide expression profiling for physiological, environmental or aquaculture questions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>For the present work, cDNA libraries of oocytes, larval stages and different gonadal maturation stages were sequenced on the Illumina platform, and a custom oligonucleotide microarray representing 51,678 assembled contigs was designed and used to characterize the transcriptomic bases of reproduction in R. decussatus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Microarray analyses were performed in four gonadal maturation stages of two Portuguese wild populations, Ria Formosa in Southern Portugal (37°01′N; 07°49′W) and Ria de Aveiro in Western coast of Portugal (40°42′N; 08°40′W). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>These populations were already characterized by different responses to spawning induction, which is of great interest to study in a context of improvement of aquaculture production [2], [14]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The present study provides new highly valuable genomic information for the understanding of reproduction of this species and emphasizes some candidate genes as possible starting points for further functional studies, for instance on spawning and gamete quality with the aim of elucidating how and to what extent environmental factors affect relevant reproductive-gene expression. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>The differences between males and females increased over time, following the continuous gametogenesis from stage II to stage IV gonads. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Considering gene expression pattern, there is no evidence of sex determination at stage I based on the PCA results, showing that, with this analysis, clam sex is undetermined at stage I. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>In the hierarchical clustering performed on the probes differentially expressed between sexes (Figure 4), a stage I individual was detected clustered on the same branch as females. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Although the sex of this clam could not be determined histologically, we suggest that this individual had already initiated sex differentiation, being possibly in a later stage I, and could therefore be classified as female according to its gene expression pattern. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Indeed, through Pavlidis template matching (PTM) analysis by TMev, we observed that this specific sample over expressed VTG, a female specific glycoprotein identified as being necessary for building up the oocyte in oysters [5], among other species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Oysters, at an undetermined sex stage, were found to express male- or female-specific genes, suggesting that sex differentiation already took place at the first stage of gametogenesis, even if it could not be visualized histologically [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>As a result, in some cases of individuals in later stage I, gene expression patterns could indicate sex determination without histological information. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Following the strong sex effect on gene expression reported above, with 16,996 probes differentially expressed between sexes, 9 KEGG pathways were revealed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Among these pathways, “oocyte meiosis” (dre04114) and “Progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation” (dre04914) were the most represented with 45 and 38 genes, respectively, as well as “Cell cycle” (dre04110) with 49 genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>These pathways are characteristic of females, certainly related to the higher transcription rate in female germ cells compared to male germ cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Indeed, oocytes provide most of the information for the development of zygotes [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Among the genes involved, we found the Mad2l1, a component of the spindle-assembly checkpoint that prevents the onset of anaphase until all chromosomes are properly aligned at the metaphase plate, and the CaM family, which belongs to one of the two main groups of calcium-binding proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>Calmodulins are supposed to be very important in the oogenesis of R. decussatus, since Ca2+ increases are recognized as essential for the oocytes to be released from the metaphase I arrest [21] [22] [23] [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>The oocytes of the European clam (classified as class II, due to their meiotic maturation distinct from other bivalve species) are held in the ovaries at prophase of the first division of meiosis and their development reinitiates during spawning, by hormonal stimulation or other stimuli. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>A second barrier to development occurs at metaphase I, prior to extrusion of the first polar body, until fertilization releases this metaphase arrest, allowing further stages of maturation to take place [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cyclins, found differentially expressed (CCNB1, CCNB2 and CDK2), also trigger metaphase/anaphase transition and further progress through meiosis by disappearing, due to protein synthesis inhibition [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>In order to better understand the differences between sexes in each reproductive stage, the same analysis was performed in each one. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>The number of differentially expressed probes increased as the reproductive stages developed, with stage IV presenting the highest number of differentially expressed probes, confirming the results from PCA analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Speriolin, a novel centrosomal protein present in the connecting piece region of mouse and human sperm [26], was present in the list of differentially expressed probes between males and females at stage IV, with a FC value of 332, as well as TSSK-5 with a FC value of 249. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>mRNA expression of these genes is highly testis-specific, with a very low level detected in other tissues of the marine bivalve Argopecten purpuratus [7]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>From the 13,218 probes that exhibited a significant change in expression over the reproductive cycle of male and female gonads, 9 KEGG pathways appeared notably represented. “Focal adhesion” (dre04510) and “Regulation of actin cytoskeleton” (dre04810), were the most represented, with 74 and 62 genes, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>In sea star oocytes, the cortical actin cytoskeleton was noticed to play critical roles in modulating Ca2+ release during meiotic maturation, as well as in regulating cortical granule exocytosis [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Additionally, “microtubule-based process” (GO:0007017), one of the enriched biological processes with the highest representation, participates in several important events in spermatogenesis, including nuclear elongation, cytoplasmic redistribution and reduction and development of the flagellum [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Within the genes involved in this pathway, we found the dynein light chain 2 (dynll2a and dynll2b), several kinesin family members (KIF11, KIF17, and KIF7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>These genes were also found highly expressed in male gonads in C. gigas and may be involved in flagella and cilia structure, locomotion and control [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>VTG, a female specific glycoprotein previously described and Condensin-2, expressed in oocytes and involved in maintaining the rigidity of chromosomes in prophase were identified in our female samples with increase in expression as oogenesis progressed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>In terms of male specific genes, we identified the MOSPD2 and the SCP-2, involved in the meiotic phase of spermatogenesis, also with an increase in expression during progression of spermatogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>All these genes also increased in expression along the gametogenic cycle in male and female gonads of C. gigas [5]. scp2 and scp3, genes involved in synaptonemal complex formation, were recently found to be highly expressed in the maturing testis of the scallop Nodipecten subnodosus [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>This synaptonemal complex is a meiosis-specific structure essential for chromosome pairing since disruption of the localization of scp2 and scp3 during early recombination resulting in aneuploidy [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that synaptonemal complex formation, and therefore meiosis I, was occurring from early to late testis maturation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>This results is similar to what was found in N. subnodosus, for which the authors concluded that the expression pattern of scp2 and scp3 might serve as future markers for the meiotic stage and may prove helpful in differentiating primary and secondary spermatocytes, which is not morphologically possible [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>A quantitative correlation between microarray data and values of gonad area considered as a proxy of the reproductive effort (e.g. in oyster [30]), were evaluated separately for females and males. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>The clam gonad undergoes continuous development until it becomes fully mature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>At that moment, the gonads or gonadal tissue form a significant portion of the soft parts of the animal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Gonaducts that will carry the gametes to the body chamber develop, enlarge and are readily observed in the gonad. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>For this reason, in males as in females, the gonadal area increases with the evolution of the reproductive stages and is considered as a proxy of the reproductive effort [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Reproductive effort and the underlying mechanisms are of great interest for many marine bivalve species that have a very high fecundity, a characteristic of the “r” demographic strategy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Indeed, gametogenesis has a major impact on several physiological functions, generating phenotypic and genetic trade-offs with growth and survival (as established in oysters [32]), meaning that reproductive effort improves at the expense of survival. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>We identified 7,226 annotated probes correlated with female gonad area and therefore, potentially, with the number and/or the size of the gametes produced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>These probes included Foxl2, an evolutionarily conserved female-specific transcription factor, which is conserved from the sponge Suberites domuncula to humans [33]; VTG; condensing 2, expressed in oocytes and involved in maintaining the rigidity of chromosomes in prophase; Mitotic apparatus protein p62 that binds to condensed chromosomes at prophase of meiosis I; and Cep57, a centrosomal protein required for microtubule attachment to centrosomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>These female-specific genes, which were positively correlated with gonad areas, were also identified as potentially involved in oogenesis in C. gigas [5]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>In R. decussatus, as in other bivalves, the period of spawning in natural populations differs with geographic location and, once reproductive maturity is reached, it may be triggered by several environmental factors including temperature, chemical and physical stimuli, water currents or a combination of these and other factors [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>The presence of gametes in the water provides an additional stimulus that generates a spawning response in broodstock, due to the presence of hormones (pheromones) that will act as recognition signals between gametes [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>Indeed, a surface glycoprotein was identified as the mate recognition signal in the caridean shrimp Palaemonetes pugio where glucosamine was considered a pheromone functioning in mate recognition [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Although it had a low statistical significance value for enrichment in DAVID (P = 0.09), “N-Glycan biosynthesis” (dre00510) was found among the enriched KEGG pathways with the highest number of gene entries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>N-glycans have an important role acting as recognition signals and binding between the extracellular coat of the egg and components of the sperm plasma membrane, generally termed “primary binding” [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>Taking into account that “N-Glycan biosynthesis” (dre00510) pathway was down-regulated in the population of Ria Formosa, we propose that, in some way, this recognition process can explain some of the differences in spawning induction success observed between the two Portuguese populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>Indeed, it was previously demonstrated that environment can strongly affect reproduction of R. decussatus, notably in terms of fecundity level [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>Additionally, among the genes involved in N-Glycan biosynthesis, we found fucosyltransferase (FucT) differentially expressed with a fold change of 2.23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>This enzyme is implicated in species-specific binding of sperm to eggs in mammals [38] [39] [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>In addition, ADAMs family genes (A Disintegrin and A Metalloprotease domain) as well as several integrin ligands appeared differentially expressed between the two populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>Several studies have indicated that these molecules are involved in cell adhesion and sperm-egg interaction (e.g. [41] [42] [43]), supporting the hypothesis that “primary binding” could be responsible for the main differences in the reproductive behavior of the two populations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Recent histological examinations of these two populations showed significant differences in the dynamics of gametogenesis [14]: the maturation process begins earlier in the northern population probably due to contrasted environmental factors mainly temperature, which is already characterized as the main source of variation in the timing of gametogenesis (e.g. [18]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>Sea surface temperature (SST) was relatively lower compared to Ria Formosa lagoon, though with higher chlorophyll values [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, similar values of oocyte diameter and gonadic area were reported, suggesting similar investment in reproduction in the two populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>In terms of gene expression, hierarchical clustering using Pearson's correlation, identified three main clusters: Ria Formosa, Ria de Aveiro and Female Stage III and IV from Ria de Aveiro (Figure 5), suggesting that the biggest differences originate from the females in the later stages of gametogenesis, and may be due to a difference in gamete maturity that may be implicated in the differences in response to spawning induction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>These differences can originate from environmental differences and/or some genetically based variation between the two populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>Among all the comparisons made between populations for each reproductive stage and sex, the one performed with stage IV females presented the highest number of differentially expressed probes (5,133 probes; Table S13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>In this comparison, “Cell cycle” (dre04110), “Spliceosome” (dre03040), “Ubiquitin mediated proteolysis” (dre04120) and “Oocyte meiosis” (dre04114) terms were the most represented in the enriched KEGG pathway terms with 45, 32, 30 and 28 genes, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Due to their specific environments, these populations might adopt different reproductive strategies: the Ria de Aveiro population retrieves its energy reserves immediately after spawning, however, the same is not verified in clams from Ria Formosa Lagoon, with their consequent decline. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>Considering these facts, it is likely that, at some point, the process of oogenesis diverged between females of the two populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>Among the genes differentially expressed, the SKP1 and the Mad2l1 previously described, were present. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>The SKP1 is an essential component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, which mediates the ubiquitination of proteins involved in cell cycle progression, signal transduction and transcription. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>Other important differentially expressed genes were found, such as cdc16, cdc20, cdc27, which are components of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a cell cycle-regulated E3 ubiquitin ligase controlling progression through mitosis and the G1 phase of the cell cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>In addition, genes like CCNB1 and CCNE2 were present and are essential in controlling the progression of cells through the cell cycle, by activating Cdk enzymes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>Cyclin-encoding transcripts represent maternal mRNAs, known to be stocked in oocytes during oogenesis and maternally transmitted to embryos before the start of embryonic transcription [44]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>A total of 3,588 differentially expressed probes were also obtained in the comparison made between males of stage II. “Insulin signaling pathway” (dre04910) was the most represented in the enriched KEGG pathway terms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>In addition to its function in somatic cells, it was demonstrated that insulin signaling plays an essential role in cell proliferation and growth during male Drosophila gametogenesis where sperm production is regulated by hormonal control via insulin-like peptides [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the level of some mRNA in insulin pathway was also identified as correlated with gamete quality in fishes [46] [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the MAPK1 was found differentially expressed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>Studies have shown that male reproductive function is modulated via the MAPK cascade. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>The MAPK cascade is involved in numerous male reproductive processes, including spermatogenesis, sperm maturation and activation, capacitation and acrosome reaction, before fertilization of the oocyte [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>Considering that no additional significant results were observed for the remaining comparisons performed, we suggest that it is in the later stages of oogenesis (stage IV) and in the earlier stages of spermatogenesis (stage II), that the major differences between the two studied populations occur. </plain></SENT>
