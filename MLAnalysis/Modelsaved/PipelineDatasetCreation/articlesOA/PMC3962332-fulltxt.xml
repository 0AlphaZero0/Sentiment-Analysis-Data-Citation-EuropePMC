In mammals, a current model suggests that pubertal reactivation of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion down-regulates MT1 melatonin receptors in pituitary gonadotroph cells, via the induction of early growth response factor-1 (EGR-1). Here we have examined this model by testing the hypotheses that inhibition of <italic>Mt1</italic> expression by GnRH occurs directly in gonadotroph cells, can be reversed in adulthood by blockade of GnRH receptors, and requires EGR-1. We first confirmed the endogenous expression of <italic>Mt1</italic> mRNA in the &#945;T3-1 gonadotroph cell line. Stimulation of these cells with a GnRH agonist resulted in a rapid increase of <italic>Egr-1</italic> mRNA expression, which peaked after 30&#8211;60 minutes, and a more prolonged elevation of nuclear EGR-1 immunoreactivity. Moreover, the GnRH agonist significantly decreased <italic>Mt1</italic> mRNA. We then treated adult male rats with the GnRH antagonist cetrorelix or saline. After 4 weeks of daily injections, cetrorelix significantly reduced serum LH concentration and testis weight, with histological analysis confirming absence of spermatogenesis. Despite the successful inhibition of GnRH signalling, pituitary <italic>Mt1</italic> expression was unchanged. Next we studied the proximal region of the rat <italic>Mt1</italic> promoter. Consistent with previous work, over-expression of the transcription factor PITX-1 increased <italic>Mt1</italic>-luciferase reporter activity; this effect was dependent on the presence of consensus PITX-1 promoter binding regions. Over-expression of EGR-1 inhibited PITX-1-stimulated activity, even following mutation of the consensus EGR-1 binding site. Finally, we studied <italic>Egr1</italic>
<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> mice and observed no difference in pituitary <italic>Mt1</italic> expression between <italic>Egr1</italic>
<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> and wild-type litter mates. This work demonstrates that GnRH receptor activation directly down-regulates <italic>Mt1</italic> expression in gonadotroph cells. However, pituitary <italic>Mt1</italic> expression in adults is unaltered by blockade of GnRH signalling or absence of EGR-1. Our data therefore suggest that melatonin receptor regulation by GnRH is not reversible in adulthood and doesn't require EGR-1.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC; grant BB/F020309/1; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/home/home.aspx">http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/home/home.aspx</ext-link>).

It is secreted into the blood and cerebrospinal fluid by the pineal gland, and is produced locally by other tissues within the body, such as the retina <xref rid="pone.0090056-Tosini1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In mammals, melatonin signals through two receptors of the G-protein-coupled super-family, termed MT1 and MT2 <xref rid="pone.0090056-Dubocovich1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Compared to adults, foetuses and neonates exhibit a more widespread receptor distribution, suggesting that melatonin may have as yet unknown roles in development <xref rid="pone.0090056-Davis1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms controlling these developmental changes in melatonin signalling.</p><p>Pineal melatonin production is driven by the master circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus and thus exhibits a robust daily rhythm. This rhythm varies in proportion to the length of the night and so melatonin encodes both daily and seasonal time <xref rid="pone.0090056-Reiter2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In mammals, melatonin is essential for photoperiodic physiology and can regulate circadian clock gene expression in several peripheral tissues <xref rid="pone.0090056-Johnston1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0090056-TorresFarfan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, indicating a possible ability to synchronise peripheral circadian clocks. In addition to control of rhythmic physiology, melatonin is also reported to control many other biological processes. One of these is suppression of the endocrine response of the developing pituitary gland to the key reproductive factor, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) <xref rid="pone.0090056-Vanecek1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. This effect disappears in the postnatal rodent pituitary gland and thus may be relevant to the timing of puberty <xref rid="pone.0090056-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0090056-Martin3" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Interestingly, melatonin secretion has been associated with reproductive development and the timing of human puberty in some studies <xref rid="pone.0090056-Silman1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0090056-Crowley1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However aspects of this work has methodological flaws <xref rid="pone.0090056-Silman1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090056-deHolanda1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and other studies have failed to replicate the finding <xref rid="pone.0090056-Srinivasan1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090056-vanGeijlswijk1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>We have previously studied the regulation of MT1 melatonin receptors in the pituitary gland and suggested a mechanism controlling MT1 expression during reproductive development. In our model, <italic>Mt1</italic> promoter activity is stimulated by the transcription factor pituitary homeobox-1 (PITX-1) <xref rid="pone.0090056-Johnston2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0090056-Johnston4" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. During early stages of development, PITX-1-stimulation of <italic>Mt1</italic> is thought to be inhibited by factors involved in Rathke's Pouch proliferation, such as MSX-1 <xref rid="pone.0090056-Johnston5" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Consistent with this hypothesis, the decline in <italic>Msx-1</italic> coincides with the onset of <italic>Mt1</italic> expression in the foetal rat pituitary. Following a period of melatonin sensitivity, it is proposed that the pubertal reactivation of GnRH secretion then finally down-regulates <italic>Mt1</italic> expression, likely via induction of early growth response factor-1 (EGR-1; also known as NGFI-A and Krox-24) <xref rid="pone.0090056-Johnston3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090056-Johnston4" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>This model received preliminary support from the observation that adult <italic>hypogonadal</italic> mice, which are unable to synthesise GnRH, exhibit elevated levels of <italic>Mt1</italic> expression than their wild type controls <xref rid="pone.0090056-Johnston3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. However, the model is yet to be thoroughly tested. In particular, it is unclear whether GnRH directly regulates gonadotroph MT1 expression, whether the inhibitory effects of GnRH require EGR-1 and are reversible in adulthood. Here, we have addressed these questions using a combination of in vivo and in vitro techniques. As in previous work by ourselves and others, much of the data derives from the rat, in which developmental changes of <italic>Mt1</italic> are most extensively characterised. Due to the availability of suitable gonadotroph cell lines and transgenic &#8216;knockout&#8217; animals, other parts of the study have used mouse tissue. Such an approach takes advantage of the benefits of each system and has been used successfully before, e.g. <xref rid="pone.0090056-Johnston3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell culture and transient transfection assays</title><p>Unless otherwise specified, all cells were cultured at 37&#176;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in growth medium: DMEM (Invitrogen Ltd, Paisley, UK) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), antibiotic/antimycotic (Invitrogen), and sodium pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich Co Ltd, Poole, UK).

Despite this, functional blockade of GnRH receptors in adult rats for 4 weeks fails to alter in vivo expression of <italic>Mt1</italic>. In transient transfection assays, over-expression of EGR-1 inhibits PITX-1-stimulated rat <italic>Mt1</italic> promoter activity independently of an EGR-1 consensus sequence. However, there is no difference in pituitary <italic>Mt1</italic> expression in <italic>Egr-1</italic>
<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> mice and wild type controls.</p><p>Our previous studies led us to hypothesise that the perinatal decline in pituitary MT1 melatonin receptor expression is due to the pubertal reactivation of GnRH secretion from the hypothalamus. We therefore first studied <italic>Mt1</italic> expression in murine &#945;T3-1 gonadotroph cells, which model newly differentiated gonadotrophs as they express the common glycoprotein alpha subunit (&#945;GSU) and functional GnRH receptors, but not the LH beta subunit <xref rid="pone.0090056-Windle1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090056-Horn1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Here, we demonstrate that &#945;T3-1 cells also express <italic>Mt1</italic> mRNA, making them an ideal model to study the interaction between GnRH and endogenous melatonin receptors. As described previously, stimulation of &#945;T3-1 cells with a GnRH agonist rapidly induces transient expression of <italic>Egr-1</italic> mRNA <xref rid="pone.0090056-Tremblay1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, with a more prolonged induction of EGR-1 protein in nuclear-enriched extracts. Following this induction of nuclear EGR-1 protein, we observed a significant decrease in <italic>Mt1</italic> mRNA. Allowing for a delay between <italic>Mt1</italic> transcriptional inhibition and decrease in steady state mRNA levels, the relative time course of these events may be consistent with a functional relationship between EGR-1 and <italic>Mt1</italic> in perinatal gonadotroph cells. The half life of <italic>Mt1</italic> mRNA is estimated to be 2&#8211;3 hours in ovine pars tuberalis cells <xref rid="pone.0090056-Barrett1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Despite differences in cell type and unknown extent of transcriptional repression in our GnRH-treated &#945;T3-1 cells, the timing of <italic>Mt1</italic> inhibition is not inconsistent with its estimated half life. However, attempts to demonstrate a causal relationship between these events were prevented by an inability to transfect the &#945;T3-1 cells with inhibitors of EGR-1 expression or function.</p><p>Our previous in vivo data demonstrated that adult rodents unable to synthesise GnRH throughout development exhibit elevated pituitary <italic>Mt1</italic> expression <xref rid="pone.0090056-Johnston3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, but the regulation of <italic>Mt1</italic> by GnRH signalling in adulthood is unknown. We therefore next investigated the effect of a GnRH receptor antagonist, cetrorelix, on <italic>Mt1</italic> expression in the adult rat pituitary. Daily intra-peritoneal injections of cetrorelix successfully shut-down the rats' reproductive system, as demonstrated by analysis of serum LH concentration and testis morphology. However, despite this physiological effect, there was surprisingly no change in pituitary <italic>Mt1</italic> expression. This finding contrasts with the ability of cetrorelix to induce MT1 receptor expression in the GT1-7 neuronal cell line <xref rid="pone.0090056-Ishii1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> and suggests that changes during normal gonadotroph development maintain inhibition of <italic>Mt1</italic> mRNA, despite the lack of GnRH signalling.</p><p>A limitation of the current study is that our in situ hybridisation protocol measured gene expression in all cell types present in the tissue sections and not just gonadotroph cells. However, to explain our cetrorelix data, any elevation of gonodotroph <italic>Mt1</italic> mRNA caused by the treatment would have to be mirrored by an equal decrease in <italic>Mt1</italic> expression within other cell types. Moreover, the increased <italic>Mt1</italic> mRNA observed in <italic>hypogonadal</italic> mice was readily detectable by the same in situ hybridisation protocol <xref rid="pone.0090056-Johnston3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The most likely explanation of our results is therefore that cetrorelix had no effect on gonadotroph <italic>Mt1</italic> expression in the adult rat pituitary. It also remains possible that adult mice treated with cetrorelix may exhibit a similar increase in pituitary <italic>Mt1</italic> mRNA expression as we previously observed in <italic>hypogonadal</italic> mice. However the species-specific mechanisms that could cause such a difference are unclear.</p><p>We next extended previous analyses of rat <italic>Mt1</italic> promoter activity in vitro. As shown previously <xref rid="pone.0090056-Johnston3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, over-expression of PITX-1 induces activity of a &#8722;445 bp <italic>Mt1</italic>-luciferase construct and this PITX-1-stimulated activity is strongly inhibited by co-transfection with an EGR-1 expression vector. The ability of PITX-1 to stimulate <italic>Mt1</italic> promoter activity was inhibited by mutagenesis of either of its consensus sequences, indicating that both are required for successful promoter activation. However, EGR-1 retained its ability to inhibit PITX-1-stimulated promoter activity even after mutation of its consensus binding sequence. This finding suggested that, in our in vitro system, EGR-1 is able to inhibit <italic>Mt1</italic> promoter activity without binding to DNA and thus presumably via protein-protein interactions. Such a mechanism would be consistent with reports of functional interactions between EGR-1 and other proteins involved in transcriptional regulation <xref rid="pone.0090056-Tremblay1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090056-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0090056-Hansson1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p><p>Finally, in order to investigate the role of EGR-1 in melatonin receptor regulation in vivo, we examined <italic>Mt1</italic> expression in the pituitary of <italic>Egr-1</italic>
<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> mice. As observed previously <xref rid="pone.0090056-Johnston3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, adult wild type mice exhibited weak pituitary <italic>Mt1</italic> expression. In contrast to the upregulation of <italic>Mt1</italic> in <italic>hypogonadal</italic> mice that are unable to synthesise GnRH, and despite inhibition of <italic>Mt1</italic> promoter activity by EGR-1 in vitro, there was no difference in pituitary <italic>Mt1</italic> expression between <italic>Egr-1</italic>
<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> mice and wild type litter mates. Thus, despite the ability of EGR-1 over-expression to inhibit <italic>Mt1</italic> promoter activity in vitro, EGR-1 is not necessary for GnRH to regulate <italic>Mt1</italic> in vivo. One possible explanation for this finding is that there is developmental compensation in the knock-out model <xref rid="pone.0090056-Tourtellotte1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. However, <italic>Egr-1</italic>
<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> mice remain infertile due to a lack of LH synthesis <xref rid="pone.0090056-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090056-Topilko1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, indicating that developmental compensation within the pituitary would have to be specific for <italic>Mt1</italic> regulation. A second and perhaps more likely explanation for the absence of an effect of genotype is that additional pathway(s) link GnRH signalling to <italic>Mt1</italic> expression, thus providing functional redundancy of signal transduction mechanisms. At present we are unable to distinguish between these possibilities.</p><p>In summary, we have provided novel information describing the regulation of pituitary <italic>Mt1</italic> melatonin receptor mRNA, both in vivo and in vitro. Although underlying signal transduction mechanisms are unclear, our current data expand upon previous work and reveal a direct ability of GnRH signalling to down-regulate melatonin receptor expression in &#945;T3-1 gonadotroph cells. Despite this effect and the elevated <italic>Mt1</italic> previously observed in <italic>hypogonadal</italic> mice, blockade of GnRH signalling in adult animals didn't increase pituitary <italic>Mt1</italic> mRNA. Together these findings suggest that GnRH may induce a long-term change in melatonin sensitivity, rather than merely a tonic inhibition of gene transcription. As discussed elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0090056-Johnston4" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, the developmental timing of pituitary melatonin receptor down-regulation is similar to the onset of hypothalamic GnRH signalling in rodents and sheep, which have greatly differing gestational lengths. Moreover, rat and ovine <italic>Mt1</italic> promoters possess some common regulatory elements <xref rid="pone.0090056-Johnston3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090056-Johnston4" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The findings presented herein may therefore be relevant to multiple mammalian species.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Prof Jacques Drouin for donation of the PITX-1 expression vector, Prof Jeffrey Milbrandt for donation of the EGR-1 expression vector, Prof Pamela Mellon and Dr Rob Fowkes for donation of &#945;T3-1 cells, Dr Julie Howarth and Ms Theresa Gregory for assistance with histology.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0090056-Reiter1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
