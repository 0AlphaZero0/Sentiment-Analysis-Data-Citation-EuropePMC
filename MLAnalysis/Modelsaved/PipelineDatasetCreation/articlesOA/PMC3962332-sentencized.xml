<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We first confirmed the endogenous expression of Mt1 mRNA in the αT3-1 gonadotroph cell line. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of these cells with a GnRH agonist resulted in a rapid increase of Egr-1 mRNA expression, which peaked after 30–60 minutes, and a more prolonged elevation of nuclear EGR-1 immunoreactivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the GnRH agonist significantly decreased Mt1 mRNA. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Despite the successful inhibition of GnRH signalling, pituitary Mt1 expression was unchanged. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Consistent with previous work, over-expression of the transcription factor PITX-1 increased Mt1-luciferase reporter activity; this effect was dependent on the presence of consensus PITX-1 promoter binding regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Over-expression of EGR-1 inhibited PITX-1-stimulated activity, even following mutation of the consensus EGR-1 binding site. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The hormone melatonin is implicated in multiple diverse aspects of physiology [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>It is secreted into the blood and cerebrospinal fluid by the pineal gland, and is produced locally by other tissues within the body, such as the retina [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In mammals, melatonin signals through two receptors of the G-protein-coupled super-family, termed MT1 and MT2 [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Compared to adults, foetuses and neonates exhibit a more widespread receptor distribution, suggesting that melatonin may have as yet unknown roles in development [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms controlling these developmental changes in melatonin signalling. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Pineal melatonin production is driven by the master circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus and thus exhibits a robust daily rhythm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>This rhythm varies in proportion to the length of the night and so melatonin encodes both daily and seasonal time [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In mammals, melatonin is essential for photoperiodic physiology and can regulate circadian clock gene expression in several peripheral tissues [6]–[9], indicating a possible ability to synchronise peripheral circadian clocks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In addition to control of rhythmic physiology, melatonin is also reported to control many other biological processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>One of these is suppression of the endocrine response of the developing pituitary gland to the key reproductive factor, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>This effect disappears in the postnatal rodent pituitary gland and thus may be relevant to the timing of puberty [11]–[13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, melatonin secretion has been associated with reproductive development and the timing of human puberty in some studies [14]–[16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>However aspects of this work has methodological flaws [14], [15] and other studies have failed to replicate the finding [17], [18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>We have previously studied the regulation of MT1 melatonin receptors in the pituitary gland and suggested a mechanism controlling MT1 expression during reproductive development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In our model, Mt1 promoter activity is stimulated by the transcription factor pituitary homeobox-1 (PITX-1) [19]–[21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>During early stages of development, PITX-1-stimulation of Mt1 is thought to be inhibited by factors involved in Rathke's Pouch proliferation, such as MSX-1 [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this hypothesis, the decline in Msx-1 coincides with the onset of Mt1 expression in the foetal rat pituitary. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Following a period of melatonin sensitivity, it is proposed that the pubertal reactivation of GnRH secretion then finally down-regulates Mt1 expression, likely via induction of early growth response factor-1 (EGR-1; also known as NGFI-A and Krox-24) [20], [21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>This model received preliminary support from the observation that adult hypogonadal mice, which are unable to synthesise GnRH, exhibit elevated levels of Mt1 expression than their wild type controls [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>However, the model is yet to be thoroughly tested. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>In particular, it is unclear whether GnRH directly regulates gonadotroph MT1 expression, whether the inhibitory effects of GnRH require EGR-1 and are reversible in adulthood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Here, we have addressed these questions using a combination of in vivo and in vitro techniques. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>As in previous work by ourselves and others, much of the data derives from the rat, in which developmental changes of Mt1 are most extensively characterised. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Due to the availability of suitable gonadotroph cell lines and transgenic ‘knockout’ animals, other parts of the study have used mouse tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Such an approach takes advantage of the benefits of each system and has been used successfully before, e.g. [20]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that activation of GnRH receptors in gonadotroph cells down-regulates expression of Mt1 mRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Despite this, functional blockade of GnRH receptors in adult rats for 4 weeks fails to alter in vivo expression of Mt1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>In transient transfection assays, over-expression of EGR-1 inhibits PITX-1-stimulated rat Mt1 promoter activity independently of an EGR-1 consensus sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>However, there is no difference in pituitary Mt1 expression in Egr-1 −/− mice and wild type controls. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Our previous studies led us to hypothesise that the perinatal decline in pituitary MT1 melatonin receptor expression is due to the pubertal reactivation of GnRH secretion from the hypothalamus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>We therefore first studied Mt1 expression in murine αT3-1 gonadotroph cells, which model newly differentiated gonadotrophs as they express the common glycoprotein alpha subunit (αGSU) and functional GnRH receptors, but not the LH beta subunit [23], [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrate that αT3-1 cells also express Mt1 mRNA, making them an ideal model to study the interaction between GnRH and endogenous melatonin receptors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>As described previously, stimulation of αT3-1 cells with a GnRH agonist rapidly induces transient expression of Egr-1 mRNA [27], with a more prolonged induction of EGR-1 protein in nuclear-enriched extracts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Following this induction of nuclear EGR-1 protein, we observed a significant decrease in Mt1 mRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Allowing for a delay between Mt1 transcriptional inhibition and decrease in steady state mRNA levels, the relative time course of these events may be consistent with a functional relationship between EGR-1 and Mt1 in perinatal gonadotroph cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>The half life of Mt1 mRNA is estimated to be 2–3 hours in ovine pars tuberalis cells [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Despite differences in cell type and unknown extent of transcriptional repression in our GnRH-treated αT3-1 cells, the timing of Mt1 inhibition is not inconsistent with its estimated half life. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>However, attempts to demonstrate a causal relationship between these events were prevented by an inability to transfect the αT3-1 cells with inhibitors of EGR-1 expression or function. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Our previous in vivo data demonstrated that adult rodents unable to synthesise GnRH throughout development exhibit elevated pituitary Mt1 expression [20], but the regulation of Mt1 by GnRH signalling in adulthood is unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>We therefore next investigated the effect of a GnRH receptor antagonist, cetrorelix, on Mt1 expression in the adult rat pituitary. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Daily intra-peritoneal injections of cetrorelix successfully shut-down the rats' reproductive system, as demonstrated by analysis of serum LH concentration and testis morphology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>However, despite this physiological effect, there was surprisingly no change in pituitary Mt1 expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>This finding contrasts with the ability of cetrorelix to induce MT1 receptor expression in the GT1-7 neuronal cell line [29] and suggests that changes during normal gonadotroph development maintain inhibition of Mt1 mRNA, despite the lack of GnRH signalling. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>A limitation of the current study is that our in situ hybridisation protocol measured gene expression in all cell types present in the tissue sections and not just gonadotroph cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>However, to explain our cetrorelix data, any elevation of gonodotroph Mt1 mRNA caused by the treatment would have to be mirrored by an equal decrease in Mt1 expression within other cell types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the increased Mt1 mRNA observed in hypogonadal mice was readily detectable by the same in situ hybridisation protocol [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>The most likely explanation of our results is therefore that cetrorelix had no effect on gonadotroph Mt1 expression in the adult rat pituitary. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>It also remains possible that adult mice treated with cetrorelix may exhibit a similar increase in pituitary Mt1 mRNA expression as we previously observed in hypogonadal mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>However the species-specific mechanisms that could cause such a difference are unclear. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>We next extended previous analyses of rat Mt1 promoter activity in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>As shown previously [20], over-expression of PITX-1 induces activity of a −445 bp Mt1-luciferase construct and this PITX-1-stimulated activity is strongly inhibited by co-transfection with an EGR-1 expression vector. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>The ability of PITX-1 to stimulate Mt1 promoter activity was inhibited by mutagenesis of either of its consensus sequences, indicating that both are required for successful promoter activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>However, EGR-1 retained its ability to inhibit PITX-1-stimulated promoter activity even after mutation of its consensus binding sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>This finding suggested that, in our in vitro system, EGR-1 is able to inhibit Mt1 promoter activity without binding to DNA and thus presumably via protein-protein interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Such a mechanism would be consistent with reports of functional interactions between EGR-1 and other proteins involved in transcriptional regulation [27], [30]–[33]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Finally, in order to investigate the role of EGR-1 in melatonin receptor regulation in vivo, we examined Mt1 expression in the pituitary of Egr-1 −/− mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>As observed previously [20], adult wild type mice exhibited weak pituitary Mt1 expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the upregulation of Mt1 in hypogonadal mice that are unable to synthesise GnRH, and despite inhibition of Mt1 promoter activity by EGR-1 in vitro, there was no difference in pituitary Mt1 expression between Egr-1 −/− mice and wild type litter mates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Thus, despite the ability of EGR-1 over-expression to inhibit Mt1 promoter activity in vitro, EGR-1 is not necessary for GnRH to regulate Mt1 in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>One possible explanation for this finding is that there is developmental compensation in the knock-out model [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>However, Egr-1 −/− mice remain infertile due to a lack of LH synthesis [35], [36], indicating that developmental compensation within the pituitary would have to be specific for Mt1 regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>A second and perhaps more likely explanation for the absence of an effect of genotype is that additional pathway(s) link GnRH signalling to Mt1 expression, thus providing functional redundancy of signal transduction mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>At present we are unable to distinguish between these possibilities. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>In summary, we have provided novel information describing the regulation of pituitary Mt1 melatonin receptor mRNA, both in vivo and in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Although underlying signal transduction mechanisms are unclear, our current data expand upon previous work and reveal a direct ability of GnRH signalling to down-regulate melatonin receptor expression in αT3-1 gonadotroph cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Despite this effect and the elevated Mt1 previously observed in hypogonadal mice, blockade of GnRH signalling in adult animals didn't increase pituitary Mt1 mRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Together these findings suggest that GnRH may induce a long-term change in melatonin sensitivity, rather than merely a tonic inhibition of gene transcription. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>As discussed elsewhere [21], the developmental timing of pituitary melatonin receptor down-regulation is similar to the onset of hypothalamic GnRH signalling in rodents and sheep, which have greatly differing gestational lengths. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Moreover, rat and ovine Mt1 promoters possess some common regulatory elements [20], [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>The findings presented herein may therefore be relevant to multiple mammalian species. </plain></SENT>
