Organic matters, nutrients load and oxygen concentration fluctuated highly along the river and over time because of WWTPs discharge. Tag pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes revealed the significant effect of seasonality on the richness, the bacterial diversity (Shannon index) and BCC. The major grouping: -winter/fall samples versus spring/summer samples- could be associated with fluctuations of <italic>in situ</italic> bacterial activities (dissolved and particulate organic carbon biodegradation associated with oxygen consumption and N transformation). BCC of the samples collected upstream from the WWTPs discharge were significantly different from BCC of downstream samples and WWTPs effluents, while no significant difference was found between BCC of WWTPs effluents and the downstream samples as revealed by ANOSIM. Analysis per season showed that allochthonous bacteria brought by WWTPs effluents triggered the changes in community composition, eventually followed by rapid post-disturbance return to the original composition as observed in April (resilience), whereas community composition remained altered after the perturbation by WWTPs effluents in the other seasons.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was mainly performed in the scope of the GESZ research project (Towards the Good Ecological Status of River Zenne: Reevaluating Brussels wastewater management) from the &#8220;Impulse Environment 2008&#8221; program of the Brussels Institute for Research and Innovation (Innoviris).

Some of these sewage-contaminated rivers are amongst the most extreme examples of ecosystems disturbed by human activities. The impact of wastewater release on the receiving river depends primarily on the size of the city, the type of treatment applied to wastewaters and the flow of the river; the higher the river flow is, the higher its dilution capacity is. The UN predicted that, for 2050, 70% of the world population will be living in cities and this urban growth will mainly occur in less developed countries, where wastewater treatment facilities are scarce <xref rid="pone.0092579-United1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.

This small river, with an annual average discharge of 4 m<sup>3</sup> s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> upstream from Brussels, crosses the city and receives the effluents released by the two WWTPs of Brussels (treating together more than 1.5 million inhabitant equivalents); the average flow of treated wastewaters is in the same order of magnitude than the Zenne River flow rate upstream from Brussels. The river waters downstream from Brussels are thus roughly half composed of treated wastewaters, this proportion being even higher during the low flow periods of the river <xref rid="pone.0092579-Brion1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Seven stations along the river and the treated effluents of the two Brussels&#8217;s WWTPs were sampled during four sampling campaigns at different seasons in 2010. The BCC was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon 454 pyrosequencing; in parallel, a large set of environmental parameters were measured.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>No specific ethical or institutional permits were required to sample the Zenne River and the experimental studies did not involve endangered or protected species.

The Zenne watershed (surface 991 km<sup>2</sup>) is characterized by agricultural activities in its upstream part and an important urbanization in its downstream part. The annual average discharge of the Zenne River arriving in Brussels from the upstream part of the watershed is 4 m<sup>3</sup> s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (deduced from the last 20 years water flow data monitored by the Hydrologisch Informatie Centrum &#8211; HIC). Before the river reaches the Brussels area, it already receives several effluents of small scale WWTPs. The population density in the watershed is very high (on average 1260 inhabitants km<sup>&#8722;2</sup>) and mostly located in Brussels city and suburbs. The Zenne River has a total length of 103 km and crosses Brussels city from South to North over a distance of about 20 km. For sanitation purposes, the Zenne River was covered in the 19th century (1867&#8211;1871) in most of the stretch located in the Brussels region. In Brussels area, the Zenne River receives the sewage waters from two large WWTPs: the Brussels South WWTP (360,000 equivalent-inhabitants) in operation since the year 2000 and the Brussels North WWTP (1.2 million equivalent-inhabitants) in operation since 2007. The Zenne River also receives waters from two tributaries around the Brussels region the Zuunbeek, and the Woluwe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092579-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Some small tributaries located in the Brussels area are diverted in the sewer collectors so that their waters reach Brussels WWTPs.</p><fig id="pone-0092579-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0092579.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Map of the Zenne drainage network.</title><p>Location of the sampling stations and the two Brussels WWTPs are represented.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0092579.g001"/></fig><p>The two Brussels WWTPs function according to different technologies. The Brussels South WWTP treatment line includes a primary settling stage and a secondary biological treatment (activated sludge). At Brussels North WWTP, there are two treatment lines. The first one (biological line) includes a primary settling stage followed by a modern tertiary treatment technology (simultaneous removal of biodegradable organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus by an activated sludge process). The other treatment line (rain line) runs in parallel to the biological line when the discharge reaching the WWTP is too high in wet weather situations; this rain line uses only a coagulation-assisted high-rate lamellar settling process. On an annual basis, the volume treated in the biological line accounts for roughly 90% of the total volume reaching the WWTP.</p><p>Four sampling campaigns were performed in 2010 (January, April, July and October). Overall these sampling campaigns took place during marked dry weather periods; the discharge of the Zenne River just upstream from Brussels was always low during these campaigns:, 2.5 m<sup>3</sup> s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> in January 2010, 1.4 m<sup>3</sup> s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> in April 2010 and 2.0 m<sup>3</sup> s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> in July 2010, 2.9 m<sup>3</sup> s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> in October 2010. Comparatively, the April campaign was characterized by the driest conditions, both upstream and downstream Brussels city. Regarding October, there was actually a small rainfall occurring in Central Belgium during the sampling campaign but this did not even cause combined sewer overflow (CSO) discharge in the Zenne.</p><p>Seven stations were sampled along the Zenne River (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092579-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) in the stretch located downstream from the confluence with its major right-bank tributary the Sennette. Accordingly, a kilometric scale along the longitudinal course of the river was defined; it is arbitrarily set at zero at Lembeek (station Z1) and increases from upstream to downstream. Stations Z1 (0 km) and Z3 (13 km) are located upstream from Brussels. Station Z5 (20 km) is located just downstream from the Brussels South WWTP effluents release. Stations Z7 (30 km) and Z9 (34 km) are located upstream and downstream from the Brussels North WWTP, respectively. Stations Z10 (39 km) and Z12 (51 km) are significantly downstream from the Brussels conurbation area. Besides, in each of the sampling campaigns, the effluents of both Brussels WWTPs were sampled (average daily samples collected with refrigerated automatic samplers) and analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Physico-chemical Analysis and Bacterial Enumeration</title><p>Temperature, pH, and electrical conductivity (EC) were measured directly on site using a portable WTW 340 multiprobe.

For dissolved (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) analysis, samples were filtered on GF/F glass fiber filters previously combusted at 550&#176;C. DOC was measured in the filtrate while the material retained on the filter was used to estimate POC. Glassware receiving the water samples for DOC analysis was muffled at 550&#176;C for 4 h after cleaning; samples for DOC analysis were preserved with H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (0.1% final concentration).

These abnormal increases in POC concentrations seem to be associated in April with the discharge of sludge from the activated sludge process at Brussels South WWTP. Such sludge release often occurs at Brussels South WWTP and was confirmed by microscopic observation for the studied April 2010 situation. In addition, in April, the driest studied period, the water mass at Z5 was very heterogeneous (due to the absence of a good mixing between WWTP South effluents and river water) so that particles were overrepresented in this sample. In January, the increase in POC downstream from Brussels area seems to be due to some untreated wastewater released into the river from station Z10. A significant increase in the ratio POC/SPM at Z10 and Z12 stations (25 to 30% C compared to 15% in Z9) was an indication of a high release of untreated sewage (with SPM rich in organic carbon) upstream from station Z10. On the other hand, DOC content was detected in the range of 5&#8211;13 mg/L in all the sampling stations.

Gram-positive <italic>Tetrasphaera</italic>-related organisms (<italic>Actinobacteria</italic>) are putative polyphosphate-accumulating organisms that are abundant in many full-scale enhanced biological phosphorus removal plants <xref rid="pone.0092579-Nielsen1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref> and <italic>Haliscomenobacter</italic> are one of the filamentous bacteria detected in wastewater treatment plants which are responsible for biomass bulking <xref rid="pone.0092579-Eikelboom1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092579-Kotay1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>.

Bacterial community was strongly modified just downstream from the WWTPs effluents discharges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092579-g007">Fig. 7</xref>) and in few kilometers the initial bacterial community composition was recovered and this phenomenon was observed after both WWTPs discharges. This difference between BCC in April and January was also shown by clustering. Two major clusters were observed in April, on one hand, the WWTPs samples and the river samples collected just downstream from the effluents and, on the other hand, the remaining river samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092579-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). The system seems to be resilient, since the initial situation is recovered already a few kilometers downstream from the discharges of WWTPs (disturbance). SIMPER analysis revealed the dissimilarity between WWTPs and upstream samples 71%. This was due to the bloom of <italic>Malikia</italic> and <italic>Flavobacterium</italic> in the upstream stations and the dominance of <italic>Zooglea, Arcobacter, Acidovorax,</italic> and <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> in the WWTPs&#8217; effluents. <italic>Arcobacter</italic> and <italic>Zooglea</italic> were previously isolated from sewage <xref rid="pone.0092579-Belanchea1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092579-Moreno1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. <italic>Flavobacteri</italic>a are found in different environment such as soil and freshwater, some of whose species are known to cause disease in freshwater fishes <xref rid="pone.0092579-Starliper1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref> whereas hydrogen-oxidizing and polyhydroxyalkanoate accumulating <italic>Malikia</italic> are restricted to freshwater habitats <xref rid="pone.0092579-Spring1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. We could not find any correlation between <italic>Malikia</italic> bloom and any environmental parameters measured in April. <italic>Malikia</italic> bloom might be due to the low level of river flow at this driest sampling time. Besides, in contrast to January, the impact of WWTPs effluents release has only been observable just downstream from the WWTPs discharges (Z5 and Z9 stations), while the BCC of samples collected further downstream from the WWTPs discharges were similar to the BCC in the upstream part of the river (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092579-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). In this case, the composition and structure of bacterial community seems to be dominated by <italic>in situ</italic> processes carried by bacterial groups well adapted to the riverine conditions, with an exception of the sampling points just downstream from the WWTPs discharges.</p><fig id="pone-0092579-g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0092579.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Taxonomic classification of bacterial reads at genus level along the river in April.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0092579.g007"/></fig><p>As it is described above, the impact of WWTPs effluents was season dependent. A recent study showed that sediments of two different rivers with different characteristics in their upstream watershed had almost indistinguishable BCC downstream from the WWTPs discharges, suggesting the potential of WWTPs to reduce the natural variability <xref rid="pone.0092579-Drury1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>.

Our study showed that disturbance strength has the potential to change the composition of bacterial communities and confirms previous findings that bacterial communities are generally not resistant to disturbances <xref rid="pone.0092579-Drury1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092579-Allison1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092579-Berga1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. Indeed, community composition remained altered after the perturbation by WWTPs discharges in three out of the four seasons. However in April, -the driest sampled season -, recovery to pre-disturbance community composition was observed just few kilometers downstream from the WWTPs (pulse disturbance). This is an evidence of the bacterial community resilience in a strongly polluted urban river. Studies dealing with in-situ evidences of freshwater bacterial community stability are scarce and essential for accurate modeling and management of water resources. Environmental and biological factors associated with resilience and resistance must be further studied to assess and prevent the impact of (treated or untreated) sewage pollution on the freshwater ecosystem functioning.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0092579.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Rarefaction analysis for individual and pooled samples of river and wastewater treatment plant at 97% cutoff level.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0092579.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0092579.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>Longitudinal profiles of CHAO and Shannon index.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0092579.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0092579.s003"><label>Figure S3</label><caption><p>The community structure of bacterial genera in wastewater treatment plants.
