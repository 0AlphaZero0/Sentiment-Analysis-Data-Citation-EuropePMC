</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Rivers flowing through cities are often used as receiving body for treated and untreated urban wastewaters all over the world [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Some of these sewage-contaminated rivers are amongst the most extreme examples of ecosystems disturbed by human activities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The impact of wastewater release on the receiving river depends primarily on the size of the city, the type of treatment applied to wastewaters and the flow of the river; the higher the river flow is, the higher its dilution capacity is. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The UN predicted that, for 2050, 70% of the world population will be living in cities and this urban growth will mainly occur in less developed countries, where wastewater treatment facilities are scarce [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>By 2025, it is expected that 27 megacities of more than 10 million inhabitants will exist, 21 of which in less developed countries [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Considering the importance, scarcity and fragility of freshwater ecosystems, research about the impact of the release of high amount of sewage on rivers functioning and ecological health is essential to preserve and have a rational management of this resource over a long term period. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>It is now well known that microbial community inhabiting aquatic systems are one of the key players in the biogeochemical cycling of organic matter and nutrients and thus in the recovery and maintenance of ecosystem health and balance [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Sewage brings high loads of organic and inorganic pollutants that strongly modify the habitat of native freshwater bacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>For instance, basic parameters such as temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen which are known as drivers of the bacterial community composition (BCC) [5], [6], [7] in aquatic systems can be influenced by urban wastewater discharges. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the loads of toxic trace metals from industries, of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) and pharmaceuticals resulting from human activities could also affect the BCC [8], [9], [10], [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Additionally, high concentrations of particulate matter within wastewater can modify light penetration in the water column and prevent phototrophic organisms’ growth. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Sewage also brings high loads of allochthonous microorganisms [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>If the allochthonous bacteria remain active after their release in the environments, as it has been previously suggested [13], [14], [15], they can have a major impact on the BCC of the river and could influence biogeochemical cycles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Besides, utilization of waters contaminated with allochthonous pathogenic microorganisms causes health risk. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Investigating the microbial population dynamic and composition of sewage polluted rivers and evaluating the resistance (insensitivity to disturbance) and resilience (the rate of recovery after disturbance (of microbial communities are essential for understanding how ecosystem health and functioning could be affected by the disturbances related to major sewage discharges. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Despite the importance of these ecosystems and the increasing interest and advances in freshwater microbial ecology [16], [17], [18], [19], papers devoted to BCC of urban rivers are still underrepresented in the scientific literature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Until now, the majority of the studies dealing with microbial community in urban aquatic settings have focused on indicator bacteria related to fecal and organic pollution [20], [21], [22], [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Although some studies were done on polluted river sediments [24],[25],[26],[27], to the best of our knowledge only few papers have examined the BCC of urban rivers waters [7], [28], [29], [30]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The objectives of the present study were thus: (1) to study the spatial and temporal variations of the BCC along a sewage polluted urban river; (2) to identify the main environmental factors driving the microbial population dynamics in the watercourse; (3) to compare the river BCC before and after the discharge of major wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) effluents; and (4) to analyze the fate and dynamics of different functional groups of sewage related bacteria once discharged into the river. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, the Zenne River in Brussels (Belgium), a river highly disturbed by urban wastewater, was chosen as a model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>This small river, with an annual average discharge of 4 m3 s−1 upstream from Brussels, crosses the city and receives the effluents released by the two WWTPs of Brussels (treating together more than 1.5 million inhabitant equivalents); the average flow of treated wastewaters is in the same order of magnitude than the Zenne River flow rate upstream from Brussels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The river waters downstream from Brussels are thus roughly half composed of treated wastewaters, this proportion being even higher during the low flow periods of the river [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Seven stations along the river and the treated effluents of the two Brussels’s WWTPs were sampled during four sampling campaigns at different seasons in 2010. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The BCC was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon 454 pyrosequencing; in parallel, a large set of environmental parameters were measured. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>The richness increased after the release of Brussels North WWTP, the standard deviations were large for all the sampling stations, reflecting the important seasonal variations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>The diversity (Shannon index) slightly increased after the release of both WWTPs and these stations located just downstream from the WWTPs presented lower standard deviations (indicating lower seasonal variations) than the other sampling stations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the impact of WWTPs discharge, three artificial groups of samples were compared: (1) the 8 samples of treated wastewaters; (2) the 8 river samples collected upstream from Brussels South WWTP discharge (Z1 and Z3 stations from the four sampling campaigns); (3) the 20 river samples collected downstream from Brussels South WWTP discharge (5 samples per sampling campaign). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>First of all, the richness estimation did not change significantly after the discharge, although significant effect of WWTPs discharges on the BCC in the water column was observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a recent study showed that WWTP effluent significantly reduced bacterial diversity and richness in rivers sediments [48], which might indicate a different response of BCC to the WWTP discharges in the water column and the sediments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>It has also been previously reported that the community structure of free living bacteria and particle-attached bacteria were different [16]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>Bacterial community was strongly modified just downstream from the WWTPs effluents discharges (Fig. 7) and in few kilometers the initial bacterial community composition was recovered and this phenomenon was observed after both WWTPs discharges. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>This difference between BCC in April and January was also shown by clustering. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>Two major clusters were observed in April, on one hand, the WWTPs samples and the river samples collected just downstream from the effluents and, on the other hand, the remaining river samples (Fig. 6B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>The system seems to be resilient, since the initial situation is recovered already a few kilometers downstream from the discharges of WWTPs (disturbance). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>SIMPER analysis revealed the dissimilarity between WWTPs and upstream samples 71%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>This was due to the bloom of Malikia and Flavobacterium in the upstream stations and the dominance of Zooglea, Arcobacter, Acidovorax, and Acinetobacter in the WWTPs’ effluents. Arcobacter and Zooglea were previously isolated from sewage [59], [60]. Flavobacteria are found in different environment such as soil and freshwater, some of whose species are known to cause disease in freshwater fishes [61] whereas hydrogen-oxidizing and polyhydroxyalkanoate accumulating Malikia are restricted to freshwater habitats [62]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>We could not find any correlation between Malikia bloom and any environmental parameters measured in April. Malikia bloom might be due to the low level of river flow at this driest sampling time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>Besides, in contrast to January, the impact of WWTPs effluents release has only been observable just downstream from the WWTPs discharges (Z5 and Z9 stations), while the BCC of samples collected further downstream from the WWTPs discharges were similar to the BCC in the upstream part of the river (Fig. 6B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>In this case, the composition and structure of bacterial community seems to be dominated by in situ processes carried by bacterial groups well adapted to the riverine conditions, with an exception of the sampling points just downstream from the WWTPs discharges. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>However in April, -the driest sampled season -, recovery to pre-disturbance community composition was observed just few kilometers downstream from the WWTPs (pulse disturbance). </plain></SENT>
