Ewing sarcoma is characterised by translocations encoding fusion transcription factors with an EWSR1 transactivation domain fused to an ETS family DNA binding domain. microRNAs are post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression and aberrantly expressed microRNAs have been identified as tumor suppressors or oncogenes in most cancer types. To identify potential oncogenic and tumor suppressor microRNAs in Ewing sarcoma, we determined and compared the expression of 377 microRNAs in 40 Ewing sarcoma biopsies, 6 Ewing sarcoma cell lines and mesenchymal stem cells, the putative cellular origin of Ewing sarcoma, from 6 healthy donors. Of the 35 differentially expressed microRNAs identified (fold change &gt;4 and q&lt;0.05), 19 were higher and 16 lower expressed in Ewing sarcoma. In comparisons between Ewing sarcoma samples with EWS-FLI or EWS-ERG translocations, with differing dissemination characteristics and of primary samples and metastases no significantly differential expressed microRNAs were detected using various stringency criteria. For miR-31, the microRNA with lowest expression in comparison to mesenchymal stem cells, functional analyses were performed to determine its potential as a tumor suppressor in Ewing sarcoma. Two of four miR-31 transfected Ewing sarcoma cell lines showed a significantly reduced proliferation (19% and 33% reduction) due to increased apoptosis in one and increased length of G1-phase in the other cell line. All three tested miR-31 transfected Ewing sarcoma cell lines showed significantly reduced invasiveness (56% to 71% reduction). In summary, we identified 35 microRNAs differentially expressed in Ewing sarcoma and demonstrate that miR-31 affects proliferation and invasion of Ewing sarcoma cell lines in ex vivo assays.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by the Deutsche Krebshilfe (project reference 108873 and 108128), the Bundesministerium f&#252;r Bildung und Forschung (TranSaRNet and 01GM0869) and NIH grants 1U01 CA114757 and 1R01-CA134604.

Ten of the 19 genes were differentially expressed in ES compared to MSCs (q-value &lt;0.05) and four of these genes showed a significant higher expression in the ES biopsies (q-value &lt;0.05 and median fold change &gt;2): CACNB2 33.3 fold, FZD3 6.4 fold, RDX 2.1 fold and VAV3 2.5 fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093067.s004">Figure S4A</xref>).

Ten of these were also described in other recent studies of ES, which were predominantly focussed on the identification of EWS/FLI regulated miRNAs. For most of the 16 lower but only a minor fraction of the 19 higher expressed miRNAs aberrant expression has been described in other malignancies.</p><p>In addition to the identification of miRNAs differentially expressed in all ES samples, we also examined an association of miRNAs with specific features of subgroups of ES such as translocation type or dissemination characteristics. However, no differences in miRNA expression related to this features were identified at high stringency (fold change &gt;4 and p&lt;0.05). Here, at first, limitations regarding group sizes and that only 377 of the more than 1500 miRNAs were analysed has to be considered. Furthermore, imprecise grouping regarding the dissemination characteristics may hamper identification of relevant miRNAs, as in up to 50% of the patients with a diagnosis of localised disease by conventional means micro-metastasis were already detectable by RT-PCR, although this has so far not been confirmed by other studies <xref rid="pone.0093067-Avigad1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. These limitations may be the cause that in our study miR-34, which has recently been shown to be significantly upregulated in patients without any adverse events <xref rid="pone.0093067-Nakatani1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, was only 2.23-fold higher expressed (p&#8202;=&#8202;0.002) in primary tumors from patients without metastasis compared to tumors from patients who had metastases at presentation or within the first year of diagnosis. However, even when these limitations of our study are taken into account, the comparisons between various groups of ES indicate that the expression pattern of the 377 miRNAs analysed is relatively uniform in ES samples. Regarding the different translocation types this is in line with a lack of differential mRNA expression and indistinguishable clinical behaviour <xref rid="pone.0093067-Ginsberg1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093067-LeDeley1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. This consistent miRNA expression pattern could be due to the uniform presence of an aberrant fusion transcription factor in all ES cases as the dominant determinator of the tumor cell phenotype, regulating the expression of more than 1000 genes <xref rid="pone.0093067-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093067-Prieur1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, and likely also the expression of many miRNAs. However, as in other tumor types, where different transforming events may cause a greater variability in miRNA expression, also in ES additional genomic aberrations may influence miRNA expression, and this could be, in addition to the usage of different detection platforms, the cause for the small overlap with EWSR1/FLI1 regulated miRNAs identified in other studies.</p><p>Although miR-31 was the lowest expressed miRNA in ES in comparison to MSCs in this study, low expression of miR-31 was only noticed in two of the other studies on miRNAs in ES but not further examined <xref rid="pone.0093067-DeVito1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093067-Mosakhani1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The lack of detection of differential miR-31 expression in most other studies on miRNAs in ES could be related to the causes for the reduced miR-31 expression. Although EWS/FLI may influence miR-31 expression via its direct target EZH2 <xref rid="pone.0093067-Richter1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, other factors likely also influence miR-31 expression and hamper the detection of differential miR-31 expression in cell lines with or without EWS/FLI expression. One factor could be deletions encompassing the <italic>MIR31</italic> gene, which have been detected in 4 of 11 ES cell lines (among them TC-71 and RD-ES) and in 3 of 26 primary ES and most likely contribute in a significant fraction of cases to the lack or reduced expression of miR-31 (Savola et al 2007; Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia of the Broad Institute).</p><p>Reduced miR-31 expression has also been observed in many other cancer types and been associated with increased proliferation, migration and invasion of tumor cells <xref rid="pone.0093067-Creighton1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093067-Yamagishi1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093067-Fuse1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093067-Bhatnagar1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093067-Veerla1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> and the degree of reduced miR-31 expression correlated with the metastatic potential of human breast cancer cell lines <xref rid="pone.0093067-Valastyan2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. A direct comparison of miR-31 expression in ES, breast cancer and OS cell lines by quantitative RT-PCRs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093067.s010">Table S6</xref>) revealed that in 2 ES cell lines miR-31 expression was even lower than in metastatic breast cancer and between 17 and 7383 fold lower than in OS cell lines. Indeed, transfection of ES cell lines with a miR-31 mimic led to decreased proliferation and invasion in ex vivo assays. When miR-31 expression was related to clinicopathological features of ES biopsies, a significantly lower expression of miR-31 was detected in tumors with larger sizes. Together, these results identify miR-31 as a potential tumor suppressor in ES whose influence on proliferation and invasiveness should be further investigated in in vivo models. Interestingly, beside miR-31 several other miRNAs (miR-10b, miR-100, miR-138 and miR-196), whose expression levels have been related to the dissemination characteristics of various tumor types <xref rid="pone.0093067-LopezCamarillo1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, were differentially expressed in comparisons of all ES to MSCs but not between primary ES cases and metastases. This also points to a uniform miRNA expression pattern in ES compared to other tumor types and may indicate that ES have a uniformly high propensity for dissemination.</p><p>In summary, we identify 35 miRNAs consistently differentially expressed in ES biopsies and cell lines compared to MSCs, and demonstrate that the lower expression of miR-31, the miRNA with the strongest differential expression in ES, contributes to the proliferation and invasiveness of ES cell lines in ex vivo assays.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0093067.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of miRNA expression profiles for the 33 primary tumor biopsy samples.

Also in direct comparisons of cotransfection of miR-31, control miRNA or miR-31 inhibitor with the wildtype reporter no differences in reporter activity were observed.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0093067.s004.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0093067.s005"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Primer sequences for qRT-PCR and cloning of the potential VAV3 miR-31 binding sites.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0093067.s005.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0093067.s006"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p>miRNAs differentially expressed comparing miRNA expression profiles generated with TLDAs of ES-biopsies to MSCs.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0093067.s006.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0093067.s007"><label>Table S3</label><caption><p>miRNAs differentially expressed comparing miRNA expression profiles generated with TLDAs of ES cell lines to MSCs.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0093067.s007.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0093067.s008"><label>Table S4</label><caption><p>Values from the apoptosis assays corresponding to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093067-g002">Figure 2B</xref>.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0093067.s008.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0093067.s009"><label>Table S5</label><caption><p>Values from the cell cycle analysis corresponding to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093067-g002">Figure 2C</xref>.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0093067.s009.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0093067.s010"><label>Table S6</label><caption><p>Expression of miR-31 in MSCs and different cancer cell lines (ES, OS, breast cancer).</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0093067.s010.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0093067.s011"><label>Dataset S1</label><caption><p>Characterisation of mesenchymal stem cells.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0093067.s011.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0093067.s012"><label>Dataset S2</label><caption><p>Establishment of the transfection protocol.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0093067.s012.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Inka Buchroth for excellent technical assistance and Regina Kloss and the M&#252;nster Ewing trial-centre staff for their kind support.
