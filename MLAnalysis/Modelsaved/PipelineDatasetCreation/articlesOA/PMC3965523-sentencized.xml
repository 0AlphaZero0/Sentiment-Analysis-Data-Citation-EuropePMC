</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Ewing sarcoma (ES) is the second most frequent bone tumor in children and young adults with an overall incidence of about 1.3 cases per million people [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The histochemically characterised small, blue round cell tumor is highly aggressive with a distinct propensity for dissemination [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Despite significant progress in treating Ewing sarcoma over the last years, the prognosis of the 20% of patients with primary disseminated disease remains poor, with an event free survival of less than 20% [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The typical genomic aberration in ES is a translocation between the EWSR1 gene and an ETS-family member with FLI1 in 85% and ERG in 5–10% of cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In the resulting fusion protein the transactivation domain of EWS is combined with the DNA-binding domains of FLI1 or ERG to create an aberrant transcription factor [6], [7], which effects the expression of more than 1000 genes [8], [9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Currently most evidence indicates that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the progenitors of ES. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In ES cell lines EWS-FLI1 knockdown results in a MSC-like gene expression pattern and expression of EWS-FLI1 in heterologous cell types has shown that only MSCs of either mesodermal or neural crest origin are permissive for EWS-FLI1 [10]–[13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Importantly, although EWS-FLI can induce malignant transformation of murine MSCs, it is by itself insufficient to transform human stem cells indicating that other cooperating events are required [11], [13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>microRNAs (miRNAs) are 18–25 nucleotide long non-coding RNA that act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression by hybridizing to complementary target-mRNA regions causing inhibition of translation with or without degradation of the mRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Today it is assumed that there are more than 1500 miRNAs which affect the expression of over 60% of human genes [14], [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Over the last years aberrantly expressed miRNAs were identified in most tumor types and for several of those an important role in tumor pathogenesis and metastasis could be demonstrated [16], [17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Recently the roles of miRNAs in ES were analysed in several studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>These were either focussed on the detection of miRNAs regulated by EWS-FLI1 in ES cell lines [18]–[22], or on the identification of prognostic miRNAs by comparison of ES with different clinical course or the detection of miRNAs specifically related to ES stem cells [23]–[25]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>To identify differentially expressed miRNA relevant for ES pathogenesis and clinical behaviour, including also miRNAs affected by events other than EWS-FLI, we used a different experimental approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>We generated miRNA expression profiles of 377 highly characterized miRNAs of the more than 1500 miRNAs for 40 fresh-frozen ES samples, including primary cases and metastases, cases with different translocation types and six ES cell lines and compared these to those of MSCs from six healthy donors as the putative cells of origin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>For miR-31, which is the miRNA with lowest expression in all ES samples compared to MSC samples, we demonstrate effects on proliferation and invasion of ES cell lines. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>In addition to the identification of miRNAs differentially expressed in all ES samples, we also examined an association of miRNAs with specific features of subgroups of ES such as translocation type or dissemination characteristics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>However, no differences in miRNA expression related to this features were identified at high stringency (fold change &gt;4 and p&lt;0.05). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Here, at first, limitations regarding group sizes and that only 377 of the more than 1500 miRNAs were analysed has to be considered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, imprecise grouping regarding the dissemination characteristics may hamper identification of relevant miRNAs, as in up to 50% of the patients with a diagnosis of localised disease by conventional means micro-metastasis were already detectable by RT-PCR, although this has so far not been confirmed by other studies [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>These limitations may be the cause that in our study miR-34, which has recently been shown to be significantly upregulated in patients without any adverse events [24], was only 2.23-fold higher expressed (p = 0.002) in primary tumors from patients without metastasis compared to tumors from patients who had metastases at presentation or within the first year of diagnosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>However, even when these limitations of our study are taken into account, the comparisons between various groups of ES indicate that the expression pattern of the 377 miRNAs analysed is relatively uniform in ES samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Regarding the different translocation types this is in line with a lack of differential mRNA expression and indistinguishable clinical behaviour [38], [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>This consistent miRNA expression pattern could be due to the uniform presence of an aberrant fusion transcription factor in all ES cases as the dominant determinator of the tumor cell phenotype, regulating the expression of more than 1000 genes [9], [40], and likely also the expression of many miRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>However, as in other tumor types, where different transforming events may cause a greater variability in miRNA expression, also in ES additional genomic aberrations may influence miRNA expression, and this could be, in addition to the usage of different detection platforms, the cause for the small overlap with EWSR1/FLI1 regulated miRNAs identified in other studies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Although miR-31 was the lowest expressed miRNA in ES in comparison to MSCs in this study, low expression of miR-31 was only noticed in two of the other studies on miRNAs in ES but not further examined [19], [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>The lack of detection of differential miR-31 expression in most other studies on miRNAs in ES could be related to the causes for the reduced miR-31 expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Although EWS/FLI may influence miR-31 expression via its direct target EZH2 [42], other factors likely also influence miR-31 expression and hamper the detection of differential miR-31 expression in cell lines with or without EWS/FLI expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>One factor could be deletions encompassing the MIR31 gene, which have been detected in 4 of 11 ES cell lines (among them TC-71 and RD-ES) and in 3 of 26 primary ES and most likely contribute in a significant fraction of cases to the lack or reduced expression of miR-31 (Savola et al 2007; Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia of the Broad Institute). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Reduced miR-31 expression has also been observed in many other cancer types and been associated with increased proliferation, migration and invasion of tumor cells [32], [34], [36], [43], [44] and the degree of reduced miR-31 expression correlated with the metastatic potential of human breast cancer cell lines [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>A direct comparison of miR-31 expression in ES, breast cancer and OS cell lines by quantitative RT-PCRs (Table S6) revealed that in 2 ES cell lines miR-31 expression was even lower than in metastatic breast cancer and between 17 and 7383 fold lower than in OS cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Indeed, transfection of ES cell lines with a miR-31 mimic led to decreased proliferation and invasion in ex vivo assays. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>When miR-31 expression was related to clinicopathological features of ES biopsies, a significantly lower expression of miR-31 was detected in tumors with larger sizes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Together, these results identify miR-31 as a potential tumor suppressor in ES whose influence on proliferation and invasiveness should be further investigated in in vivo models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, beside miR-31 several other miRNAs (miR-10b, miR-100, miR-138 and miR-196), whose expression levels have been related to the dissemination characteristics of various tumor types [46], were differentially expressed in comparisons of all ES to MSCs but not between primary ES cases and metastases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>This also points to a uniform miRNA expression pattern in ES compared to other tumor types and may indicate that ES have a uniformly high propensity for dissemination. </plain></SENT>
