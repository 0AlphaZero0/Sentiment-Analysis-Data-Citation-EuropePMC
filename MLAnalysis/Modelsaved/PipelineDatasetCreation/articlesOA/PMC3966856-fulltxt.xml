Manure is often contaminated with veterinary antibiotics which enter the soil together with antibiotic resistant bacteria. However, little information is available regarding the main responders of bacterial communities in soil affected by repeated inputs of antibiotics via manure. In this study, a microcosm experiment was performed with two concentrations of the antibiotic sulfadiazine (SDZ) which were applied together with manure at three different time points over a period of 133 days. Samples were taken 3 and 60 days after each manure application. The effects of SDZ on soil bacterial communities were explored by barcoded pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments amplified from total community DNA. Samples with high concentration of SDZ were analyzed on day 193 only. Repeated inputs of SDZ, especially at a high concentration, caused pronounced changes in bacterial community compositions. By comparison with the initial soil, we could observe an increase of the disturbance and a decrease of the stability of soil bacterial communities as a result of SDZ manure application compared to the manure treatment without SDZ. The number of taxa significantly affected by the presence of SDZ increased with the times of manure application and was highest during the treatment with high SDZ-concentration. Numerous taxa, known to harbor also human pathogens, such as <italic>Devosia</italic>, <italic>Shinella</italic>, <italic>Stenotrophomonas</italic>, <italic>Clostridium</italic>, <italic>Peptostreptococcus</italic>, <italic>Leifsonia</italic>, <italic>Gemmatimonas</italic>, were enriched in the soil when SDZ was present while the abundance of bacteria which typically contribute to high soil quality belonging to the genera <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Lysobacter</italic>, <italic>Hydrogenophaga</italic>, and <italic>Adhaeribacter</italic> decreased in response to the repeated application of manure and SDZ.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) in the framework of the Research Unit FOR 566 &#8220;Veterinary medicines in soil: Basic research for risk analysis&#8221; (SM59/5-3).

In particular organic and bio-dynamic farms depend on manure or compost as sources for fertilization. However, industrial husbandries with typically large numbers of animals sharing limited space depend on the prophylactic and therapeutic use of antibiotics. In addition, in several parts of the world antibiotics are still being used as growth promoters. Although antibiotics as growth promoters were banned in many European countries, considerable amounts of antibiotics such as tetracyclines, &#946;-lactams and sulfonamides are still used in animal husbandries <xref rid="pone.0092958-Kools1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Depending on their physicochemical properties, many antibiotics such as sulfonamides are to a large extent excreted via urine or feces and are not or only to a low extent degraded during manure storage <xref rid="pone.0092958-Lamshft1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092958-Heuer1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Thus, spreading manure on agricultural soils does not only introduce nutrients required for maintaining the soil fertility but also antibiotics, their metabolites and antibiotic resistant bacteria. Indeed, antibiotics have been detected in the environment due to the use of manure for soil fertilization or direct deposition via dung and urine of animals grazing on pastures <xref rid="pone.0092958-Sarmah1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092958-Sittig1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>The rapid sequestration of most antibiotics in soils, as e.g. observed for the sulfonamide antibiotic SDZ <xref rid="pone.0092958-Rosendahl1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, leads usually to low concentrations of bioavailable SDZ, which are far below the minimal inhibitory concentrations after a single application of manure. Most data published indicated only short-term effects on the microbial community after a single application of manure spiked with antibiotics followed by a fast regeneration of the community structure <xref rid="pone.0092958-Hammesfahr1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092958-Hammesfahr2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and its function <xref rid="pone.0092958-Schauss1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0092958-Kotzerke2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However, agricultural management implies in most cases a repeated application of manure mainly during the vegetation period to keep the level of nutrients needed for best possible plant growth. Surprisingly, little is known of the effects of repeated application of manure containing antibiotics on microbial communities in soil which might cause cumulative effects. Despite a rapid dissipation and sequestration of SDZ in soil <xref rid="pone.0092958-Heuer1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092958-Rosendahl1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092958-DeGelder1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> an increased abundance of <italic>sul1</italic> and <italic>sul2</italic> resistance genes and their transferability was observed in soils treated with manure containing SDZ compared to control manure under microcosm, mesocosm and field conditions <xref rid="pone.0092958-Heuer2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0092958-Jechalke1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, suggesting that manure containing antibiotics enhanced the spreading of the antibiotic resistance genes in soils. In particular the repeated application of manure in combination with antibiotics may set the ground for an increased abundance of resistant bacteria as recently reported by Heuer <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0092958-Heuer3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and thus might stimulate the spreading of antibiotic resistance genes and mobile genetic elements in agricultural ecosystems. Antibiotic resistance genes localized on mobile genetic elements can be captured by human and veterinary pathogens and thus pose a threat to the treatment of bacterial diseases <xref rid="pone.0092958-Heuer4" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0092958-Forsberg1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>In the present microcosm experiment, the effect of repeated application of manure containing antibiotics on the soil bacterial community was investigated by 454 sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments amplified from total community (TC)-DNA. We have chosen the sulfonamide SDZ as a model compound as it is still frequently used in pig husbandry <xref rid="pone.0092958-Sarmah1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and highly persistent in manure <xref rid="pone.0092958-Sukul1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Manure unspiked and spiked with SDZ in two concentrations was applied three times, and the bacterial community composition was monitored over a period of 193 days. We hypothesized that repeated application of manure spiked with SDZ to soil would increase the degree of disturbance and reduce the resilience of soil bacterial communities compared to a single application of manure spiked with SDZ or soils treated with manure not containing antibiotics. Resilience was measured as the stability of bacterial diversity after changes in soil properties (<xref rid="pone.0092958-Griffiths1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>; here manure addition). To differentiate between short and long-term effects, the soil was sampled 3 and 60 days after each manure application, respectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Experimental design</title><p>The experimental design is described in detail by Heuer <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0092958-Heuer3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In short, topsoil samples (Ap horizon) of a silt loam soil (Orthic Luvisol) with no history of manure application were used. Pots were filled with 100 g of 2 mm-sieved soils and treated with 4 g of manure from healthy pigs (approximately 30 m<sup>3</sup>/ha) spiked with SDZ or not to achieve a SDZ concentration in soil of 10 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, or no SDZ (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), which corresponded to samples S10, S100, and S0, respectively. Soil samples without manure application served as controls (U). To avoid effects based on different manure composition at the different time points of application, manure was taken before the experiment and frozen in aliquots at &#8722;20&#176;C. For each time point of application, an aliquot of the manure was thawn and the corresponding amount of SDZ was directly applied before mixing the manure into the soil. The SDZ concentration S10 was chosen in accordance to maximal inputs of sulfonamides detected in agricultural soils <xref rid="pone.0092958-Heuer1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092958-Lamshft2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Manure loads were applied on days 0, 63 and 133. The loosely covered pots were incubated at 15&#176;C in the dark. Water was added to the microcosms twice a week to compensate for weight losses and to maintain a soil moisture of about 55% of the soil's water-holding capacity. For each treatment and time point 5 replicates were prepared and treated individually for the subsequent analysis. Samples were taken every 3rd and 60th day after manure application (days 3, 60, 66, 123, 136 and 193) and kept at &#8722;80&#176;C until further analysis.

Both datasets revealed similar changes of bacterial community composition after manure application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092958-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In general, the Pearson dissimilarities of the bacterial community compositions between the S0 and S10 soils increased with repeated manure application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092958-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Shortly after each manure application the dissimilarity between the bacterial community composition of S0 and S10 soils was strongly increased. Sixty days after the first and second manure applications the dissimilarity remained at the same level as shortly after manure application, while 60 days after the third application a decrease in dissimilarity between S0 and S10 soil was observed. Compared with the S10 soils on day 193, the S100 soils were less similar to S0 soils in the bacterial community composition, indicating that a higher concentration of SDZ caused more pronounced changes of the soil bacterial communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092958-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

The increase in the relative abundance of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> (Table S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092958.s001">File S1</xref>) is likely related to the high abundance of these organisms in the manure (data not shown).

In the present study, the effects of repeated application of SDZ manure on soil bacterial communities were explored by barcoded pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons from TC-DNA. More pronounced changes of bacterial communities were observed for soils that were repeatedly treated with SDZ manure. The strongest effects were observed for soils treated three times with manure containing a high concentration of SDZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092958-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092958-g004">4</xref>).

Nevertheless, the enrichments of <italic>Shinella</italic>, <italic>Stenotrophomonas</italic>, <italic>Clostridium</italic> and <italic>Peptostreptococcus</italic> in soil which was continually treated with manure containing a high concentration of SDZ still urge for further investigation due to potential implications for public health. The enrichment of these bacteria, which are phylogenetically closely related to human pathogens, may improve the chance of transferring antibiotic resistance genes to human pathogens, since horizontal gene transfer is more prevalent between closely related organisms than between those distantly related (reviewed by Boto <xref rid="pone.0092958-Boto1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>). Soil particles carrying viable bacteria can be transported over long distances and might contribute to the spreading of antibiotic resistant bacteria over wide geographic ranges <xref rid="pone.0092958-Prospero1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. The ecological role of taxa such as <italic>Devosia</italic>, <italic>Leifsonia</italic> and <italic>Gemmatimonas</italic> has not been fully understood and thus the effect of their changed abundance on soil functions remains to be explored.

<xref rid="pone.0092958-Sullivan1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092958-Weller1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Several studies suggested that these beneficial bacteria belonging to <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> or <italic>Lysobacter</italic> probably play an important role for soil suppressiveness and plant growth <xref rid="pone.0092958-Hayward1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092958-Mendes1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. In the present study, the consensus sequences of an OTU with decreased relative abundance in soil treated with SDZ manure shared 100% similarities with 16S rRNA gene of the strain of <italic>P. brassicacearum</italic> (NCBI accession number: NR_074834) which is a beneficial root-associated bacterium <xref rid="pone.0092958-Ortet1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. The decline of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Lysobacter</italic> in arable soils might increase the susceptibility towards fungal pathogens. However, in general the application of manure to soils is one strategy to suppress soilborne diseases. Our data showed that the relative abundance of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> was much higher in soils treated with manure than in untreated soils on days 3 and 193. The presence of SDZ in manure likely reduces the beneficial effects of manure on improving soil health as the abundance of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> was reduced. However, resilience of these beneficial populations might still occur in the rhizosphere as decreased concentrations of SDZ were recently observed in the rhizosphere of maize and grass compared to bulk soil <xref rid="pone.0092958-Rosendahl1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Little is known about the ecological roles of <italic>Hydrogenophage</italic>, <italic>Haliangium</italic>, <italic>Adhaeribacter</italic> in soil. <italic>Hydrogenophaga</italic> spp. were reported as main biphenyl degraders in the rhizosphere of horseradish (<italic>Armoracia rusticana</italic>) contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls <xref rid="pone.0092958-Uhlik1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>.</p><p>The present study is the first to explore the influence of veterinary antibiotics entering soil via manure on the diversity and abundance of <italic>Acidobacteria</italic>. The results revealed that Gp4 was negatively affected by repeated application of manure containing the high concentration of SDZ. Low concentrations of SDZ in manure seemed to favor Gp6 and Gp10, while high concentrations of SDZ could deprive the effects. <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> are known to be adapted to an oligotrophic lifestyle. Indeed, in the present study the relative abundance of <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> was significantly higher in the untreated soil than in the soil amended with manure. Due to their high abundance and ubiquitous distribution in soils, <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> might play an important role in terrestrial ecosystems. In combination with the analysis of three genomes of a<italic>cidobacterial</italic> isolates, Ward <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0092958-Ward1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref> suggested that <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> might significantly contribute to the terrestrial carbon cycle.</p><p>Along with nutrients, a large amount of manure bacteria was also introduced into soil which could have also contributed to the dramatically altered bacterial community compositions observed in the present study shortly after each manure application. However, the majority of these introduced manure bacteria might not be very well adapted to soil, allowing the resilience of the indigenous soil bacteria community. In the present study we showed that repeated application of manure spiked with SDZ to soil increased the degree of disturbance and reduced the resilience of soil bacterial communities compared to a single application of manure spiked with SDZ or soils treated with manure without antibiotics. In a recent study by Poulsen <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0092958-Poulsen1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, the taxonomic composition of bacterial communities based on the abundance of phyla and proteobacterial classes were highly similar between soils with amendments of different organic wastes such as manure. In the present study, we observed clear effects of manure on the soil bacterial community composition as the NMDS analysis revealed separated groups for S0 and untreated soils on day 193 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092958-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In contrast to several subgroups of the <italic>Acidobacteria</italic>, <italic>Myxococcales</italic> (<italic>Deltaproteobacteria</italic>), numerous taxa belonging to different phyla (<italic>Proteobacteria, Firmicutes</italic> and <italic>Bacteriodetes</italic>) were observed with significantly higher relative abundance in the soils amended with manure than in the untreated control 60 days after the third application. Very likely the added nutrients favored taxa with a more copiotrophic lifestyle. In contrast to the field experiment analyzed by Poulsen <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0092958-Poulsen1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, the conditions in the present experiment were more controlled and the time period after the last manure amendment might have been shorter although this was not specified in the Poulsen study.</p><p>In summary, repeated input of SDZ into the Merzenhausen soil via manure, especially at a high concentration, caused pronounced changes in soil bacterial communities. The presence of SDZ provided a selective advantage for species affiliated to the genera <italic>Devosia, Shinella, Stenotrophomonas, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, Leifsonia, Gemmatimonas</italic>, while suppressing <italic>Pseudomonas, Lysobacter, Hydrogenophage, Haliangium, Adhaeribacter</italic>. We could show that SDZ-containing manure caused a more pronounced disturbance of the soil bacterial community compared to control manure and reduced resilience at least for the time period studied. However, whether the findings obtained can be generalized to other soil types with different soil properties remains an open question which needs further attention. Furthermore, mainly the long-term consequences of repeated manure application for soil ecosystem functions and human health demand further investigations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0092958.s001"><label>File S1</label><caption><p>
