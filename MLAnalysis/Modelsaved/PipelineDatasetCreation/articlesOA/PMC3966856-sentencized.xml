</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The use of animal manure for fertilization of agricultural soils has a long tradition in many parts of the world and is generally assumed to be ecologically more friendly and sustainable than mineral fertilizer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In particular organic and bio-dynamic farms depend on manure or compost as sources for fertilization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, industrial husbandries with typically large numbers of animals sharing limited space depend on the prophylactic and therapeutic use of antibiotics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In addition, in several parts of the world antibiotics are still being used as growth promoters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Although antibiotics as growth promoters were banned in many European countries, considerable amounts of antibiotics such as tetracyclines, β-lactams and sulfonamides are still used in animal husbandries [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Depending on their physicochemical properties, many antibiotics such as sulfonamides are to a large extent excreted via urine or feces and are not or only to a low extent degraded during manure storage [2], [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Thus, spreading manure on agricultural soils does not only introduce nutrients required for maintaining the soil fertility but also antibiotics, their metabolites and antibiotic resistant bacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Indeed, antibiotics have been detected in the environment due to the use of manure for soil fertilization or direct deposition via dung and urine of animals grazing on pastures [4], [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The rapid sequestration of most antibiotics in soils, as e.g. observed for the sulfonamide antibiotic SDZ [6], leads usually to low concentrations of bioavailable SDZ, which are far below the minimal inhibitory concentrations after a single application of manure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Most data published indicated only short-term effects on the microbial community after a single application of manure spiked with antibiotics followed by a fast regeneration of the community structure [7], [8] and its function [9]–[11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>However, agricultural management implies in most cases a repeated application of manure mainly during the vegetation period to keep the level of nutrients needed for best possible plant growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, little is known of the effects of repeated application of manure containing antibiotics on microbial communities in soil which might cause cumulative effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Despite a rapid dissipation and sequestration of SDZ in soil [3], [6], [12] an increased abundance of sul1 and sul2 resistance genes and their transferability was observed in soils treated with manure containing SDZ compared to control manure under microcosm, mesocosm and field conditions [13]–[15], suggesting that manure containing antibiotics enhanced the spreading of the antibiotic resistance genes in soils. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In particular the repeated application of manure in combination with antibiotics may set the ground for an increased abundance of resistant bacteria as recently reported by Heuer et al. [16] and thus might stimulate the spreading of antibiotic resistance genes and mobile genetic elements in agricultural ecosystems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Antibiotic resistance genes localized on mobile genetic elements can be captured by human and veterinary pathogens and thus pose a threat to the treatment of bacterial diseases [17]–[19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In the present microcosm experiment, the effect of repeated application of manure containing antibiotics on the soil bacterial community was investigated by 454 sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments amplified from total community (TC)-DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>We have chosen the sulfonamide SDZ as a model compound as it is still frequently used in pig husbandry [4] and highly persistent in manure [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Manure unspiked and spiked with SDZ in two concentrations was applied three times, and the bacterial community composition was monitored over a period of 193 days. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that repeated application of manure spiked with SDZ to soil would increase the degree of disturbance and reduce the resilience of soil bacterial communities compared to a single application of manure spiked with SDZ or soils treated with manure not containing antibiotics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Resilience was measured as the stability of bacterial diversity after changes in soil properties ([21]; here manure addition). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>To differentiate between short and long-term effects, the soil was sampled 3 and 60 days after each manure application, respectively. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>The importance of the soil microbiome for various ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling, soil fertility, degradation of pollutants, and plant growth promotion is well recognized [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>However, antibiotics introduced into agricultural fields via manure might alter the ability of soil microbes to fulfill crucial ecosystem services, changing the diversity and activity of key functional groups by enhancing antibiotic resistant populations while decreasing the abundance of sensitive populations in soils [16], [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the effects of repeated application of SDZ manure on soil bacterial communities were explored by barcoded pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons from TC-DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>More pronounced changes of bacterial communities were observed for soils that were repeatedly treated with SDZ manure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>The strongest effects were observed for soils treated three times with manure containing a high concentration of SDZ (Figures 2 and 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>For the first time, taxonomic groups affected by the presence of SDZ were systematically identified, and numerous taxa were found with significantly altered relative abundance (Tables 1 and 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>These findings largely extended our understanding of the influence of SDZ introduced via manure on soil bacterial communities. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Although the bioavailable fraction of SDZ in soil rapidly decreased after each manure application [16], cumulative inputs of SDZ via manure still affected bacterial communities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Also in the study by Byrne-Bailey et al. [31], the proportion of sulfachloropyridazine resistant bacteria increased in soils after treatment with manure containing antibiotics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>The repeated application of SDZ manure to grassland soil was found to affect nitrite oxidizing bacteria [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>The influence of SDZ on soil bacterial communities is more likely to be detected when additional nutrients (root exudates, manure) are added to stimulate bacterial growth [33], [34] as SDZ affects only growing bacteria and bacterial activities are generally low in oligotrophic environments such as soils. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>The amendment of soil with SDZ manure resulted in a significantly increased relative abundance of numerous Gram-negative and Gram-positive taxa such as Devosia, Shinella, Stenotrophomonas, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, Leifsonia, Gemmatimonas, suggesting that the presence of SDZ provided a selective advantage for these taxa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Mainly the increase in bacteria affiliated to Clostridia detected shortly after the addition of manure likely resulted from manure-derived bacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>In our study more than 60% of sequences in manure could be affiliated to Clostridium (data not shown), which confirms data from previous studies where the dominance of Clostridium in manure has been reported [35]–[37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>A steep decrease of Clostridia was observed 60 days after the application. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Only in S100 soils the relative abundance of Clostridia was found to be significantly higher than in the other soils on day 193, suggesting that the high concentration of SDZ slowed down the decline of Clostridium populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Whether the enhanced abundance of Clostridium in S100 soils was due to the selection of SDZ resistant populations deserves further research. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Although the resistance to SDZ was not reported yet for most of these taxa, it is likely that some of the populations enriched in the present study might be resistant to SDZ either due to the presence of resistance genes or due to intrinsic resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Isolates belonging to Stenotrophomonas and Clostridium were previously reported to be resistant to other sulfonamide antibiotics [38], [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Based on the same TC-DNA, Heuer et al. [16] found an accumulation of sul gene carrying populations in the soil repeatedly treated with SDZ manure. Sul genes located on mobile genetic elements such as class 1 integrons or plasmids might have spread among different taxa [40], [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>The presence of antibiotics, even at very low concentrations could accelerate the genetic exchanges between bacteria [42], [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>The enhanced transferability of resistant genes was recently also reported by Jechalke et al. [15] in a field experiment using manure from SDZ-treated pigs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>However, we cannot exclude that some of the taxa were intrinsically resistant to, or even able to mineralize SDZ as a SDZ degrader identified as Microbacterium lacus was recently isolated from the same Merzenhausen soil [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in the present study an OTU affiliated to Leifsonia, which is phylogenetically closely related to Microbacterium was found to be enriched in S100 soils. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>In this study, the consensus sequences of an enriched OTU in soils treated with manure shared high similarity with the 16S rRNA gene of S. maltophilia which is also known as a human pathogen [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>However, these enriched bacteria are not necessarily human pathogens as Stenotrophomonas was also found in different environments such as rhizosphere or soils [45], [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the enrichments of Shinella, Stenotrophomonas, Clostridium and Peptostreptococcus in soil which was continually treated with manure containing a high concentration of SDZ still urge for further investigation due to potential implications for public health. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>The enrichment of these bacteria, which are phylogenetically closely related to human pathogens, may improve the chance of transferring antibiotic resistance genes to human pathogens, since horizontal gene transfer is more prevalent between closely related organisms than between those distantly related (reviewed by Boto [47]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Soil particles carrying viable bacteria can be transported over long distances and might contribute to the spreading of antibiotic resistant bacteria over wide geographic ranges [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>The ecological role of taxa such as Devosia, Leifsonia and Gemmatimonas has not been fully understood and thus the effect of their changed abundance on soil functions remains to be explored. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Few studies suggested that some members of Devosia [49], [50] and Gemmatimonas [51] might be associated with nitrogen cycling. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>The relative abundances of several other taxa such as Pseudomonas, Lysobacter, Hydrogenophaga, Haliangium, and Adhaeribacter were found to be significantly lower in the soils treated by SDZ manure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Several members of Lysobacter or Pseudomonas are known as biological control agents against soilborne phytopathogens such as Rhizoctonia solani, Thielaviopsis basicola [52], [53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Several studies suggested that these beneficial bacteria belonging to Pseudomonas or Lysobacter probably play an important role for soil suppressiveness and plant growth [45], [54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the consensus sequences of an OTU with decreased relative abundance in soil treated with SDZ manure shared 100% similarities with 16S rRNA gene of the strain of P. brassicacearum (NCBI accession number: NR_074834) which is a beneficial root-associated bacterium [55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>The decline of Pseudomonas and Lysobacter in arable soils might increase the susceptibility towards fungal pathogens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>However, in general the application of manure to soils is one strategy to suppress soilborne diseases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Our data showed that the relative abundance of Pseudomonas was much higher in soils treated with manure than in untreated soils on days 3 and 193. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>The presence of SDZ in manure likely reduces the beneficial effects of manure on improving soil health as the abundance of Pseudomonas was reduced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>However, resilience of these beneficial populations might still occur in the rhizosphere as decreased concentrations of SDZ were recently observed in the rhizosphere of maize and grass compared to bulk soil [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the ecological roles of Hydrogenophage, Haliangium, Adhaeribacter in soil. Hydrogenophaga spp. were reported as main biphenyl degraders in the rhizosphere of horseradish (Armoracia rusticana) contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls [56]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>The present study is the first to explore the influence of veterinary antibiotics entering soil via manure on the diversity and abundance of Acidobacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>The results revealed that Gp4 was negatively affected by repeated application of manure containing the high concentration of SDZ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Low concentrations of SDZ in manure seemed to favor Gp6 and Gp10, while high concentrations of SDZ could deprive the effects. Acidobacteria are known to be adapted to an oligotrophic lifestyle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Indeed, in the present study the relative abundance of Acidobacteria was significantly higher in the untreated soil than in the soil amended with manure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Due to their high abundance and ubiquitous distribution in soils, Acidobacteria might play an important role in terrestrial ecosystems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>In combination with the analysis of three genomes of acidobacterial isolates, Ward et al. [57] suggested that Acidobacteria might significantly contribute to the terrestrial carbon cycle. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Along with nutrients, a large amount of manure bacteria was also introduced into soil which could have also contributed to the dramatically altered bacterial community compositions observed in the present study shortly after each manure application. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>However, the majority of these introduced manure bacteria might not be very well adapted to soil, allowing the resilience of the indigenous soil bacteria community. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>In the present study we showed that repeated application of manure spiked with SDZ to soil increased the degree of disturbance and reduced the resilience of soil bacterial communities compared to a single application of manure spiked with SDZ or soils treated with manure without antibiotics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>In a recent study by Poulsen et al. [58], the taxonomic composition of bacterial communities based on the abundance of phyla and proteobacterial classes were highly similar between soils with amendments of different organic wastes such as manure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we observed clear effects of manure on the soil bacterial community composition as the NMDS analysis revealed separated groups for S0 and untreated soils on day 193 (Figure 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>In contrast to several subgroups of the Acidobacteria, Myxococcales (Deltaproteobacteria), numerous taxa belonging to different phyla (Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteriodetes) were observed with significantly higher relative abundance in the soils amended with manure than in the untreated control 60 days after the third application. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Very likely the added nutrients favored taxa with a more copiotrophic lifestyle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the field experiment analyzed by Poulsen et al. [58], the conditions in the present experiment were more controlled and the time period after the last manure amendment might have been shorter although this was not specified in the Poulsen study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>In summary, repeated input of SDZ into the Merzenhausen soil via manure, especially at a high concentration, caused pronounced changes in soil bacterial communities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>The presence of SDZ provided a selective advantage for species affiliated to the genera Devosia, Shinella, Stenotrophomonas, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, Leifsonia, Gemmatimonas, while suppressing Pseudomonas, Lysobacter, Hydrogenophage, Haliangium, Adhaeribacter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>We could show that SDZ-containing manure caused a more pronounced disturbance of the soil bacterial community compared to control manure and reduced resilience at least for the time period studied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>However, whether the findings obtained can be generalized to other soil types with different soil properties remains an open question which needs further attention. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, mainly the long-term consequences of repeated manure application for soil ecosystem functions and human health demand further investigations. </plain></SENT>
