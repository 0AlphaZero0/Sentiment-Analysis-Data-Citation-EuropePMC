</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Egg mimicry by cuckoos is a textbook example of coevolution, arising from selection by discriminating hosts that reject mismatched eggs from their nests [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, a non-mutually exclusive alternative hypothesis is that cuckoos themselves impose selection on eggs [2]: it should pay a laying cuckoo to detect and destroy an egg laid by another parasitic female, lest it kill or outcompete her own chick were it to hatch first. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Tests to date of this hypothesis in common cuckoos Cuculus canorus [2] and Horsfield's bronze-cuckoos Chalcites basalis [3] have revealed no clear evidence in support. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Egg discrimination by parasites should be most likely to evolve when multiple parasitism (or ‘superparasitism’: more than one parasitic female laying in the same host nest) is common. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This is so in the greater honeyguide Indicator indicator, an African brood parasite whose chick obligately kills its nest-mates [4]: in my study population in Zambia, 35% of parasitized nests where the final clutch composition was known (n = 40) contained more than one parasitic egg, compared with 11% and 3%, respectively, in the cuckoo species above. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This might result from the apparent lack of territoriality of greater honeyguide females [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Greater honeyguide eggs differ in size and shape in the nests of different species, correlated to the size and shape of host eggs but remaining on average larger than them [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This phenotypic differentiation corresponds partially to two ancient genetic matrilines specializing on hosts in each of two nest types [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Parasitic eggs are always white, unlike those of some of their hosts, but egg size and shape may be more informative cues of identity in the darkness of the tree cavities or deep burrows in which hosts breed [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>However, the possible adaptive role of this specialization remains unknown. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This study experimentally tests the source of selection on greater honeyguide egg size in nests of its commonest host, the little bee-eater Merops pusillus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>First, I establish that hosts do not reject or desert foreign eggs differing from their own in size and shape. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>I then test the hypothesis that honeyguide females themselves impose selection on egg dimensions by eliminating potential competitors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>A possible mechanism is egg-puncturing behaviour: like certain other brood parasitic birds [1,7], greater honeyguides typically make 1–37 (mean 7.3) punctures in host eggs when laying their own [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Embryo mortality increases with puncture quantity, and lightly punctured eggs sometimes hatch viable offspring [4,8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Honeyguides puncture more heavily when laying late relative to the host, suggesting they can strategically adjust puncturing behaviour in relation to its potential benefits [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>I therefore test the prediction that laying female honeyguides preferentially puncture potentially parasitic eggs. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Bee-eaters nest in deep subterranean burrows that we excavated then reconstructed at each visit [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>About two-thirds of little bee-eater breeding attempts were visited by at least one greater honeyguide [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>To test whether hosts reacted defensively to a foreign egg, I added an experimental egg to unparasitized host clutches, usually before or shortly after clutch completion (three to six eggs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>This mimics the laying behaviour of real honeyguides, which do not remove host eggs and lay any time during host incubation [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>For logistical and ethical reasons, it was impractical to use real honeyguide eggs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Instead, experimental eggs were unmarked white or off-white eggs of other species, larger than host eggs and differing in shape from host and honeyguide eggs to varying degrees (table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Medium-sized experimental eggs roughly corresponded in size to eggs laid by greater honeyguides specializing on larger hosts, whereas the largest eggs were larger than any greater honeyguide eggs at this site [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Eggs were considered accepted if they remained in the host nest for more than 3 days. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>To test whether laying honeyguides preferentially punctured experimental eggs, I added an egg as soon as possible after clutch initiation to pre-empt real parasitism (sample sizes in table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In 17 of the 27 trials visited by a honeyguide, a control egg (a little bee-eater egg from another nest) was exchanged for a host egg, in case hosts use some other cue to detect foreign eggs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Some trials also contributed to the previous experiment if honeyguide parasitism occurred after more than 3 days. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Nests were revisited every 3–5 days. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>If parasitized, the number of punctures and independent cracks in each egg was counted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>If either a host (n = 13) or an experimental (n = 12) egg was completely destroyed or so badly cracked open that counting punctures and cracks was impossible, it was arbitrarily assigned the maximum recorded in a bee-eater egg (n = 37 punctures [8]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>(Heavily damaged eggs usually remained in the nest but if no longer whole were usually removed by hosts.) This assumption is conservative because host eggs were smaller than experimental eggs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Bigger eggs may be punctured more simply because a honeyguide puncturing at random in a dark nest chamber may have a higher chance of hitting a larger egg. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Therefore, I conservatively analysed punctures per unit surface area. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Volume and surface area were calculated following [9,10]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Conclusions were unchanged when analysing punctures per unit surface area and taking shell thickness of the experimental egg and clutch membership into account (egg identity effect: F2,86 = 4.72, p = 0.011; shell thickness effect: F1,25 = 0.01, p = 0.93). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>The egg identity effect arose because experimental eggs were punctured more frequently than control (t86 = −2.73, p = 0.008) or host eggs (t86 = −2.59, p = 0.011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Differences in puncture rate arose primarily from egg size, because when log-transformed egg volume and shape (breadth/length) were substituted for egg identity, only volume predicted variation in puncture rate (volume effect: F1,86 = 8.84, p = 0.004; shape effect: F1,86 = 0.40, p = 0.53).

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>This study has shown that (i) little bee-eater hosts of the greater honeyguide do not react to the presence of a foreign egg that differs from their own in size and shape, and (ii) laying female greater honeyguides do react to the presence of a large foreign egg in bee-eater nests they are parasitizing, by preferentially puncturing it. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>This suggests that discriminatory egg puncturing by laying female honeyguides imposes a significant selection pressure on previously laid honeyguide eggs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Selection for smaller egg size in greater honeyguides therefore appears more likely to have arisen from interference competition among parasites, than from coevolution with host defences. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Further to eliminating conspecific competitors, puncturing behaviour by greater honeyguides reduces how many host hatchlings their chick needs to kill [4,8] and may allow incubation to continue if their egg is laid late relative to the host clutch [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>It might perhaps also provide an additional cue of prior parasitism if it reveals the greater shell thickness of another parasitic egg (table 1), although thickened eggshells could also be a defence against multiple parasitism as suggested for other egg-puncturing brood parasites such as cowbirds and Clamator cuckoos [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="?"><plain>Why do honeyguides not heavily puncture all eggs regardless of their dimensions? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Presumably, puncturing is tempered by costs, which remain untested; excessive puncturing might directly trigger host desertion [8] or increase a laying honeyguide's chances of detection by hosts (see below). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>If multiple parasitism exacerbates puncturing behaviour, this would provide an additional route through which parasitic competition can promote virulence [12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="85" pm="?"><plain>Why do bee-eaters not react to foreign eggs? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>This is puzzling because interactions between honeyguides and bee-eaters probably have a long evolutionary history, given that the matriline of greater honeyguides parasitizing bee-eaters diverged over 3 Ma from a sister lineage parasitizing various tree-nesting host species [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Bee-eaters commonly desert nests visited by a honeyguide ([4] and this study), frequently also ejecting the entire clutch and sometimes re-using the burrow. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>This suggests that hosts might respond to cues other than presence of a foreign egg, such as heavily punctured eggs or the sight of an adult honeyguide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Clearly, any such defences are frequently breached, so it remains puzzling that bee-eaters have not evolved tactile egg discrimination comparable with that of their parasites or to that of a cowbird host which recognizes eggs on the basis of breadth [13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>In summary, when multiple parasitism is high, interference competition might be an important selective force on avian brood parasites, as it is in, for example, bacteria and helminths [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Parasitic competition might thus promote virulence and influence egg size, as honeyguides adapt to avoid the same grisly fate that they impose upon their hosts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>If greater honeyguides behave similarly when parasitizing other hosts, competition might also shape host-specific mimicry and select against host switches between ancient lineages of host specialists [6]. </plain></SENT>
