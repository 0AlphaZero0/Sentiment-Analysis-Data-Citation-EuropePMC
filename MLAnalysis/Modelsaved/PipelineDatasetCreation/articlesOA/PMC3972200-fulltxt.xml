<italic>Brassica</italic> species (tribe Brassiceae) belonging to U's triangle&#8212;<italic>B. rapa</italic> (AA), <italic>B. nigra</italic> (BB), <italic>B. oleracea</italic> (CC), <italic>B. juncea</italic> (AABB), <italic>B. napus</italic> (AACC) and <italic>B. carinata</italic> (BBCC)&#8212;originated via two polyploidization rounds: a <bold><italic>U</italic></bold> event producing the three allopolyploids, and a more ancient <bold><italic>b</italic></bold> genome-triplication event giving rise to the A-, B-, and C-genome diploid species. Molecular mapping studies, <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, and genome sequencing of <italic>B. rapa</italic> support the genome triplication origin of tribe Brassiceae, and suggest that these three diploid species diversified from a common hexaploid ancestor. Analysis of plastid DNA has revealed two distinct lineages&#8212;Rapa/Oleracea and Nigra&#8212;that conflict with hexaploidization as a single event defining the tribe Brassiceae. We analysed an R-block region of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> present in six copies in <italic>B. juncea</italic> (AABB), three copies each on A- and B-genomes to study gene fractionation pattern and synonymous base substitution rates (Ks values). Divergence time of paralogues within the A and B genomes and homoeologues between the A and B genomes was estimated. Homoeologous R blocks of the A and B genomes exhibited high gene collinearity and a conserved gene fractionation pattern. The three progenitors of diploid <italic>Brassicas</italic> were estimated to have diverged approximately 12 mya. Divergence of <italic>B. rapa</italic> and <italic>B. nigra</italic>, calculated from plastid gene sequences, was estimated to have occurred approximately 12 mya, coinciding with the divergence of the three genomes participating in the <bold><italic>b</italic></bold> event. Divergence of <italic>B. juncea</italic> A and B genome homoeologues was estimated to have taken place around 7 mya. Based on divergence time estimates and the presence of distinct plastid lineages in tribe Brassiceae, it is concluded that at least two independent triplication events involving reciprocal crosses at the time of the <bold><italic>b</italic></bold> event have given rise to Rapa/Oleracea and Nigra lineages.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) and Centre of Excellence on Mustard Breeding by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Government of India.

Taxonomically, Brassicaceae is a well-defined family with a much conserved floral structure. Classification within the family, in contrast, has been contentious and has undergone many revisions <xref rid="pone.0093260-Lysak1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0093260-AlShehbaz2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.

Relationship between many taxa, however, remains poorly resolved as a consequence of processes such as convergent evolution and reticulation.</p><p>In this study, we focused on evolution within the tribe Brassiceae, which contains some of the world's most extensively grown vegetable and oilseed crops. The most recent polyploidization event in the tribe Brassiceae was described by U <xref rid="pone.0093260-U1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> based on cytogenetic analysis of three allopolyploid species, <italic>B. juncea</italic> (AABB; 2<italic>n</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;36), <italic>B. napus</italic> (AACC; 2<italic>n</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;38) and <italic>B. carinata</italic> (BBCC; 2<italic>n</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;34), and their three diploid progenitor species <italic>B. rapa</italic> (AA; 2<italic>n</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;20), <italic>B. nigra</italic> (BB; 2<italic>n</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;16) and <italic>B. oleracea</italic> (CC; 2<italic>n</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;18). This round of polyploidy has been termed the <bold><italic>U</italic></bold> event <xref rid="pone.0093260-Lysak1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The three allopolyploids behave as strict diploids, in all probability because of a mechanism that suppresses homoeologous chromosome pairing <xref rid="pone.0093260-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093260-Cifuentes1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>A more intriguing case of polyploidization is an earlier genome triplication event, referred to as event <bold><italic>b</italic></bold>
<xref rid="pone.0093260-Lysak1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, which gave rise to the three diploid <italic>Brassica</italic> species of U's triangle, i.e., <italic>B. rapa, B. nigra</italic> and <italic>B. oleracea</italic>, as well as other species included in tribe Brassiceae. While earlier molecular mapping studies of <italic>B. nigra</italic> suggested the possibility of genome triplication <xref rid="pone.0093260-Lagercrantz1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093260-Lagercrantz2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, the first clear evidence for this past event came from comparative mapping of the A and C genomes of <italic>B. napus</italic> (AACC) with genic markers from the model crucifer&#8212;<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0093260-Parkin1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Based on extensive gene collinearity between <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and the A and C genomes of <italic>B. napus</italic> (AACC), the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genome has been divided into blocks A through X <xref rid="pone.0093260-Schranz1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.

This difference can be attributed to gene losses in the Nigra lineage after the Rapa-Nigra split. A few lineage-specific genes described in the BRAD database, i.e., Bra023507, Bra023535, Bra006266, Bra006330, Bra006328, Bra006269, Bra006281, Bra006325 and Bra006326, were not present in either A or B genomes of <italic>B. juncea</italic>. It is interesting to observe that out of 10 lineage-specific genes on the LG-A3 R block (MF1) of <italic>B. rapa</italic>, only 3 have been retained on LG A3 of <italic>B. juncea</italic>, whereas all 9 lineage-specific genes on the LG-A10 R block (LF) of <italic>B. rapa</italic> are present on LG A10 of <italic>B. juncea</italic>.</p><p>A total of 82 CDSs showing no identity with <italic>A. thaliana</italic> orthologues at collinear positions were recognised by the annotation pipeline.

BLASTX comparison of the predicted CDSs with protein databases using a threshold of <italic>E</italic>&lt;e<sup>&#8722;5</sup> revealed significant similarity with protein(s) in the UniProt database.

Transposon-related CDSs were not included in subsequent analyses.

More than 80% of the CDSs expressed in the transcriptome were highly divergent from <italic>B. rapa</italic> gene transcripts and appeared to be ancient insertions. Most of these insertions were observed in the B genome, with a few specific to the A genome. The remaining 20% of CDSs were mostly <italic>Brassica</italic> lineage-specific genes or gene fragments that appear to have recently transposed from noncollinear regions. Most of these transpositions were specific to the A genome. It can be concluded that the A and B genomes of <italic>B. juncea</italic> contain many unique CDSs. This situation may be due to either loss of these CDSs from homoeologous sites after genome triplication or to divergence in the progenitor species contributing to evolution of the A and B genomes.</p><p>An interesting feature is the tandemly duplicated nature of several genes present in single copies in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093260-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

The evolutionary divergence between the ancestral genomes&#8212;X, Y, Z&#8212;that took part in genome triplication has been reported to be more than divergence within each genome i.e between X-X&#8242;, Y-Y&#8242;, Z-Z&#8242; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093260.s009">Table S7</xref>).

The model presented here reconciles both nuclear and plastid genome divergence times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093260-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>
<italic>Brassica</italic> species have poor reproductive barriers, and hybrids could have readily formed at hexaploidy and subsequently between the descendants. Cytogenetic studies have clearly demonstrated the high intercrossability of <italic>Brassica</italic> species and significant pairing between homoeologous chromosomes <xref rid="pone.0093260-Harberd1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0093260-Prakash1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. As a consequence, a large number of species belonging to the tribe Brassiceae have been referred to as <italic>Brassica</italic> coenospecies.</p><p>A study of the Brassiceae <bold><italic>U</italic></bold> polyploidization event clearly demonstrates that reciprocal crosses can occur and survive. <italic>Brassica napus</italic> (AACC) and <italic>B. juncea</italic> (AABB) have A-genome (<italic>B. rapa</italic>) plastid genomes, whereas <italic>B. carinata</italic> (BBCC) has a B-genome (<italic>B. nigra</italic>) plastid genome <xref rid="pone.0093260-Erickson1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. The three polyploids originated in isolation. Further, sufficient data exists from plastid and nuclear genome studies of <italic>B. napus</italic> lines to suggest that this allopolyploid had two or more independent origins <xref rid="pone.0093260-Cifuentes1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093260-Allender1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Thus, the <bold><italic>U</italic></bold> polyploidization event involved both reciprocal and multiple crossing events. It is therefore entirely plausible that the <bold><italic>b</italic></bold> event involved multiple crosses that included reciprocal crossing.</p><p>The main difference between <bold><italic>b</italic></bold> and <bold><italic>U</italic></bold> events is the chromosomal number of the resulting allopolyploids. The <bold><italic>U</italic></bold> event gave rise to strict allotetraploids with chromosome numbers exactly equal to the sum of any two of the three U-triangle species&#8212;<italic>B. rapa</italic> (AA), <italic>B. oleracea</italic> (CC) and <italic>B. nigra</italic> (BB). In comparison, the <bold><italic>b</italic></bold> polyploidization event led to the evolution of mesoploids with chromosome numbers much reduced from the initial hexaploid chromosome number (2<italic>n</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;6<italic>x</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;42) <xref rid="pone.0093260-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>Does the R-block gene fractionation pattern reported in this study support the hypothesis of independent origin of the two mesoploid genomes A and B? The six R blocks studied here (three from the A genome and three from the B genome) show very high gene collinearity and a conserved gene fractionation pattern with respect to the R block of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and homoeologous LGs. The fractionation pattern is different between <italic>B. rapa</italic> and <italic>B. nigra</italic> in only seven of the 104 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093260-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Gene redundancy exists in all these cases, as paralogues are available. Thus differential gene content could be explained either way&#8212;as evidence of independent origin or gradual gene loss over time.</p><p>Many gene duplications are specific to the B genome. Because these duplicated genes are of relatively recent origin, they do not provide any support for independent genome origins. The duplicated genes common to both A and B genomes may have either independent origins or shared lineages, and therefore are not rigorous evidence for the two-independent-lineage hypothesis. An interesting observation is the presence of many reading frames on LG B2 (MF2-R) and LG B8 (LF-R). These CDSs are unique to the B genome. Such unique CDSs were also observed on LG A2 (MF2-R) and LG A10 (LF-R) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0093260-t001">Table 1</xref>). Some of these CDSs show identity with genes from distantly related plant families. It is possible that these genes were present in the putative Brassica ancestor but have been selectively lost in some of the descendants which constituted diverged species pools X, Y and Z. The differential loss of these CDS can be cited as an evidence for independent origin of A and B lineages.</p><p>A third piece of evidence can be gleaned from block arrangements on the A, B and C genomes. Based on the arrangement of 24 genomic blocks <xref rid="pone.0093260-Schranz1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, some previous mapping studies using genic markers <xref rid="pone.0093260-Parkin1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093260-Panjabi1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> uncovered identical block arrangements between three LGs of A and C genomes (A1&#8211;C1, A2&#8211;C2 and A3&#8211;C3) and significant similarity between three LGs of the A and B genomes (A4&#8211;B4, A5&#8211;B5 and A6&#8211;B6). Our recent mapping work (unpublished) using transcriptome-based SNPs, however, has revealed much more extensive reshuffling on most LGs of the B genome. None of the LGs of the B genome seem to have the same block arrangement as those of the A genome. These differences are further suggestive of independent A and B genome origins.</p><p>Based on the divergence times estimated from synonymous base substitution rates in nuclear and plastid genes and their somewhat similar gene fractionation patterns, we conclude that reciprocal crossing between similar genomes at the time of the <bold><italic>b</italic></bold> event most plausibly explains the origin of <italic>Brassica</italic> A and B genomes. A recently published phylogenetic analysis of 89 Brassiceae species using sequences from four plastid intergenic regions&#8212;<italic>rpl32-trnL, atpI-atpH, psbD-trnT</italic> and <italic>ycf6-psbM</italic>&#8212;uncovered eight lineages: Rapa-Oleracea, Savignya, Nigra, Cakile, Crambe, Henophyton, Zilla and Vella <xref rid="pone.0093260-Arias1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Data was analysed by three different algorithms&#8212;maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference; all three methods yielded similar results confirming the eight independent lineages. Just like the Rapa/Oleracea and Nigra lineages, these additional lineages may also have resulted from independent triplication events involving species that were descendants of a putative ancestral species. Thus even though tribe Brassiceae is monophyletic &#8211; hexaploidization, the <bold><italic>b</italic></bold> event, was not a single event but a number of independent events involving hybridization between closely related or somewhat divergent species.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plant materials and <italic>B. juncea</italic> BAC libraries</title><p>BAC library development was performed by Amplicon Express (Pullman, Washington, USA) using the <italic>B. juncea</italic> East European line Heera.
