</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The evolution of land plants, particularly angiosperms, has been characterised by repeated rounds of polyploidization [1] and reticulation [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Both of these processes appear to have played a major role in the evolution of the Brassicaceae [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Taxonomically, Brassicaceae is a well-defined family with a much conserved floral structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Classification within the family, in contrast, has been contentious and has undergone many revisions [4]–[6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The most recent taxonomic treatment of the family, which also takes into consideration evidence from molecular systematics, identifies 49 tribes, 321 genera and 3,600 species [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Relationship between many taxa, however, remains poorly resolved as a consequence of processes such as convergent evolution and reticulation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In this study, we focused on evolution within the tribe Brassiceae, which contains some of the world's most extensively grown vegetable and oilseed crops. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The most recent polyploidization event in the tribe Brassiceae was described by U [7] based on cytogenetic analysis of three allopolyploid species, B. juncea (AABB; 2n = 36), B. napus (AACC; 2n = 38) and B. carinata (BBCC; 2n = 34), and their three diploid progenitor species B. rapa (AA; 2n = 20), B. nigra (BB; 2n = 16) and B. oleracea (CC; 2n = 18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>This round of polyploidy has been termed the U event [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The three allopolyploids behave as strict diploids, in all probability because of a mechanism that suppresses homoeologous chromosome pairing [8], [9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>A more intriguing case of polyploidization is an earlier genome triplication event, referred to as event b [4], which gave rise to the three diploid Brassica species of U's triangle, i.e., B. rapa, B. nigra and B. oleracea, as well as other species included in tribe Brassiceae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>While earlier molecular mapping studies of B. nigra suggested the possibility of genome triplication [10], [11], the first clear evidence for this past event came from comparative mapping of the A and C genomes of B. napus (AACC) with genic markers from the model crucifer—Arabidopsis thaliana [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Based on extensive gene collinearity between A. thaliana and the A and C genomes of B. napus (AACC), the A. thaliana genome has been divided into blocks A through X [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Each A. thaliana gene block is present in at least three copies in each of the two constituent genomes, A and C, of B. napus [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Similar results have been observed between the A and B genomes of B. juncea (AABB) and A. thaliana in regard to triplication of each A. thaliana gene block [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Unequivocal evidence for gene triplication was also uncovered by in situ hybridization of A. thaliana genomic bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) with pachytene-stage chromosome preparations of some key Brassiceae taxa [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of the B. rapa genome has provided strong evidence for genome triplication [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The triplication event involving three ancestors (each one with n = 7) leading to the formation of a hexaploid (2n = 42) was followed by gene fractionation [16], [17], chromosome reshuffling and reduction in chromosome number [18], leading to the evolution of present-day diploid taxa of tribe Brassiceae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Based on gene fractionation patterns, it has been proposed that the hexaploidy was the result of two independent events: two diploid genomes first coming together to produce a tetraploid, followed by crosses with a third diploid species [16], [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Early-entry genomes (termed MF1 and MF2) are the most heavily fractionated, with the last genome to enter (designated as LF) experiencing the lowest gene loss [16], [17], [19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In taxonomic classifications, tribe Brassiceae has generally been considered to be monophyletic based on three conserved morphological traits—conduplicate cotyledons, segmented fruits and simple or no trichomes [5], [6], [20]–[22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis of the nuclear genome has uncovered evidence of ancient genome triplication across tribal members, supporting a monophyletic origin for Brassiceae [12], [14]–[16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Analysis of plastid DNA, however, reveals the presence of two distinct lineages—the Nigra (also called Sinapis) lineage and the Rapa/Oleracea lineage [23]–[27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The presence of these two lineages was first established by RFLP analysis of plastid DNA from various genera and species [23], [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>These observations have since been confirmed in a number of studies on plastid genes [26] and plastid non-coding sequences [15], [25], [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The findings of major studies on plastid DNA divergence confirming the presence of two distinct lineages are summarized in Table S1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The number of distinct lineages has increased to eight through analysis of more number of species [25], [27]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Two competing hypotheses can be put forth to explain the evolution of the Brassica A and B genomes: (a) A and B genomes diverged after a single b event, or (b) A and B genomes arose independently from different reciprocal crosses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Three types of data—gene fractionation patterns, gene block arrangements and synonymous nucleotide substitution rates in homologous genes—are the most pertinent for assessing the validity of these two hypotheses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the genomic structure of an R-block region of B. juncea (AABB). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The R block is present in triplicate in genomes A (contributed by B. rapa) and B (contributed by B. nigra). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>R blocks are gene rich and fairly large [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Our initial interest was focused on the R block on linkage group (LG) A10 of B. juncea, as it contains some of the most important yield-related quantitative trait loci (QTLs) mapped in B. juncea using a doubled haploid (DH) population derived from a cross between the East European gene pool line Heera and the Indian gene pool cultivar Varuna [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>We aligned genomic BACs in the six R blocks, sequenced the BACs, annotated the sequences and studied gene fractionation pattern in a syntenic region of the R blocks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Pairwise synonymous base substitution rates (Ks values) and divergence times were calculated for paralogous (within A and B genomes) and homoeologous (across A and B genomes) nuclear genes to estimate divergence times of the paralogues and homoeologues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Pairwise synonymous base substitution rates and divergence times were also calculated for the plastid genes matK and ndhF and compared with the nuclear gene divergence times. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>We propose that a hypothesis of reciprocal crosses between progenitor genomes at the time of the entry of the third genome provides the most parsimonious explanation for the presence of two or more plastid lineages in tribe Brassiceae. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>A study of the Brassiceae U polyploidization event clearly demonstrates that reciprocal crosses can occur and survive. Brassica napus (AACC) and B. juncea (AABB) have A-genome (B. rapa) plastid genomes, whereas B. carinata (BBCC) has a B-genome (B. nigra) plastid genome [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>The three polyploids originated in isolation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Further, sufficient data exists from plastid and nuclear genome studies of B. napus lines to suggest that this allopolyploid had two or more independent origins [9], [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Thus, the U polyploidization event involved both reciprocal and multiple crossing events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>It is therefore entirely plausible that the b event involved multiple crosses that included reciprocal crossing. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>The main difference between b and U events is the chromosomal number of the resulting allopolyploids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>The U event gave rise to strict allotetraploids with chromosome numbers exactly equal to the sum of any two of the three U-triangle species—B. rapa (AA), B. oleracea (CC) and B. nigra (BB). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>In comparison, the b polyploidization event led to the evolution of mesoploids with chromosome numbers much reduced from the initial hexaploid chromosome number (2n = 6x = 42) [18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="221" pm="?"><plain>Does the R-block gene fractionation pattern reported in this study support the hypothesis of independent origin of the two mesoploid genomes A and B? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>The six R blocks studied here (three from the A genome and three from the B genome) show very high gene collinearity and a conserved gene fractionation pattern with respect to the R block of A. thaliana and homoeologous LGs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>The fractionation pattern is different between B. rapa and B. nigra in only seven of the 104 Arabidopsis genes (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Gene redundancy exists in all these cases, as paralogues are available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Thus differential gene content could be explained either way—as evidence of independent origin or gradual gene loss over time. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Many gene duplications are specific to the B genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Because these duplicated genes are of relatively recent origin, they do not provide any support for independent genome origins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>The duplicated genes common to both A and B genomes may have either independent origins or shared lineages, and therefore are not rigorous evidence for the two-independent-lineage hypothesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>An interesting observation is the presence of many reading frames on LG B2 (MF2-R) and LG B8 (LF-R). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>These CDSs are unique to the B genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Such unique CDSs were also observed on LG A2 (MF2-R) and LG A10 (LF-R) (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Some of these CDSs show identity with genes from distantly related plant families. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>It is possible that these genes were present in the putative Brassica ancestor but have been selectively lost in some of the descendants which constituted diverged species pools X, Y and Z. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>The differential loss of these CDS can be cited as an evidence for independent origin of A and B lineages. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>A third piece of evidence can be gleaned from block arrangements on the A, B and C genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Based on the arrangement of 24 genomic blocks [13], some previous mapping studies using genic markers [12], [14] uncovered identical block arrangements between three LGs of A and C genomes (A1–C1, A2–C2 and A3–C3) and significant similarity between three LGs of the A and B genomes (A4–B4, A5–B5 and A6–B6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Our recent mapping work (unpublished) using transcriptome-based SNPs, however, has revealed much more extensive reshuffling on most LGs of the B genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>None of the LGs of the B genome seem to have the same block arrangement as those of the A genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>These differences are further suggestive of independent A and B genome origins. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Based on the divergence times estimated from synonymous base substitution rates in nuclear and plastid genes and their somewhat similar gene fractionation patterns, we conclude that reciprocal crossing between similar genomes at the time of the b event most plausibly explains the origin of Brassica A and B genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>A recently published phylogenetic analysis of 89 Brassiceae species using sequences from four plastid intergenic regions—rpl32-trnL, atpI-atpH, psbD-trnT and ycf6-psbM—uncovered eight lineages: Rapa-Oleracea, Savignya, Nigra, Cakile, Crambe, Henophyton, Zilla and Vella [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Data was analysed by three different algorithms—maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference; all three methods yielded similar results confirming the eight independent lineages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Just like the Rapa/Oleracea and Nigra lineages, these additional lineages may also have resulted from independent triplication events involving species that were descendants of a putative ancestral species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Thus even though tribe Brassiceae is monophyletic – hexaploidization, the b event, was not a single event but a number of independent events involving hybridization between closely related or somewhat divergent species. </plain></SENT>
