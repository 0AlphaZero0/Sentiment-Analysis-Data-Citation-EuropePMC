</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Each year, an estimated nine million people contract human tuberculosis (TB), and two million people die from the disease worldwide [1]. Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacillus (Mtb) is the causative agent of TB. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Mtb undergoes various genomic reprogramming events upon infection, which subsequently prevent the immune system from completely eliminating latent infectious agents [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Despite the identification of cell-mediated immune responses and pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that play crucial roles against Mtb infection, the underlying mechanism controlling Mtb adaptation remains poorly understood [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Mtb primarily targets the pulmonary macrophages, and thus pervious studies on immune responses against Mtb infection have focused mainly on the alveolar macrophages or dendritic cells (DCs) [4], [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>However, increasing evidence has suggested that pulmonary epithelial cells—to which Mtb is able to directly bind and penetrate—also represent an important step in the Mtb infection process [6]–[8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In addition to its role as a physical barrier, the pulmonary epithelium produces an array of innate immune receptors, antimicrobial proteins, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that directly target pathogens and/or recruit immune cells to the site of infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The pulmonary epithelium is of significant importance to understanding the Mtb infection process, because pulmonary epithelial cells are both the source for initiating the host immune system, as well as the initial targets for invasion by Mtb [9]–[11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Previous in vitro studies using human airway epithelial cells demonstrated that Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) infection activated various signaling pathways to induce the production of numerous factors important in regulating immunity including chemokines CXCL8, CXCL10, CCL5, and CCL2 [12]–[16], cytokine IL-10 [12], and antimicrobial peptides β-defensin-2, cathelicidin LL-37, and hepcidin [18]–[21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Chuquimia et al. recently showed that airway epithelial cells were able to internalize and restrict BCG growth, functioned as antigen presenting cells for primed T cells [13], and produced a secretion profile that differed from that seen from pulmonary macrophages [14]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs (miRNAs, or miRs) are small non-coding RNA molecules, which predominantly function to negatively regulate gene expression by complementing to the 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTRs) of messenger RNAs (mRNA) [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Specifically, miRNAs have been shown to regulate the inflammatory response during immune cell lineage commitment, differentiation, and maturation [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, miRNAs regulate the macrophage immune response and the Toll-like Receptor (TLR) signaling pathway [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>For instance, miR-223 was reported to negatively regulate both the proliferation and activation of neutrophils by targeting myeloid Elf1-like factor 2C [18]; miR-125b and let-7 were down-regulated in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in macrophages, in which the miR-125b regulated the immune response by targeting tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α mRNA [19], whereas let-7 through a mechanism of targeting IL-6 mRNA [20]; miR-21 has also been found to be able to further negatively regulate LPS-activated TLR4 signaling by targeting the tumor suppressor gene, Programmed Cell Death 4 (PDCD4), which in turn decreased nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) activation and resulted in the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Similarly, miR-146a has been demonstrated an ability to inhibit TLR signaling, subsequently inhibit the production of inflammatory mediators, by targeting TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and IL-1R-associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1) [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, the role of miRNAs in the regulation of immune response in pulmonary epithelial cells in response to microbial infection has not been established. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>miR-124 is a miRNA enriched in the brain and plays a crucial role in gastrulation and neural development [23], [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In addition, the expression of miR-124 was suppressed in several types of cancer, including medulloblastoma, glioma, oral squamous cell carcinomas and hepatocellular carcinoma [25]–[27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, its expression was down-regulated in breast cancer specimens and cell lines, and enforced expression of miR-124 showed a reduction in cell motility and invasion in human breast cancer cells [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Over expression of miR-124 was linked to the suppression of inhibitory member of apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 (iASPP), which subsequently led to an increased expression of NF-κB (p65) [29], [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Treating patients suffering from immunosuppressed glioblastoma with the systemic administration of miR-124 or adoptive miR-124–transfected T-cell transfers resulted in a remarked up-regulation of IL-2, interferon (IFN)-γ, and TNF-α [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>These studies imply that miR-124 may performs an immunoregulatory role in epithelial cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In light of the above findings, we hypothesize that miR-124 performs a role in the regulation of the immune response in pulmonary epithelial cells during mycobacterial infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>To this end, we interrogated the function of miR-124 in an in vitro infection system using a human alveolar epithelial cell line, A549 cells, and in vivo murine lungs, with Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>We found that miR-124 was induced upon BCG stimulation, which in turn attenuated the inflammatory response by suppressing TLR signaling in epithelial cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of suppression was in part through miR-124 directly binding to multiple components of the TLR signaling pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Thus, this study identifies a previously unrecognized negative feedback mechanism by which miR-124 expression is able to attenuate excessive inflammation in alveolar epithelial cells in the context of mycobacterial infection. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Infection with BCG induced miR-124 expression in A549 cells by about 3-fold over non-infected control cultures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Indeed, miR-124 induction seen in BCG-infected cultures resembled cultures that had been transfected with miR-124 mimic (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, an additive level of miR-124 transcription, a 5.8-fold increase in miR-124 expression, was measured when the cells were transfected with mimic and infected with BCG, in comparison with the naïve control. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the transfection of a miR-124 inhibitor decreased endogenous miR-124 by 2.5-fold and partially inhibited BCG-dependent induction of miR-124 expression (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in vivo study also exhibited a significant increased miR-124 transcript in the murine lung infected with BCG, in comparison with the PBS controls (p&lt;0.05) (Figure 1B). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Since the TLR pathway is known to play a pivotal role in modulating the immune response against mycobacterial infection [32], the online computational miRNA target prediction tool, TargetScan, was used to identify potential targets of miR-124 within the TLR pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The TLR6, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and TNF-α, were identified as potential targets of miR-124 by virtue of possessing several seed sequences of miR-124 within the 3′UTR of their mRNA (Table S1 in File S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>To validate whether miR-124 is able to directly target these molecules, dual-luciferase reporter vectors containing either wild-type 3′UTR sequence or the 3′UTR sequence with scrambled miR-124 seed sequences of TLR6, MyD88, TRAF6 or TNF-α mRNA were constructed (Figure 2A), and tested by co-transfecting the constructs with miR-124 mimic, inhibitor or control (Figure 2B–2E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>The results showed decreased luciferase activities in cells co-transfected with miR-124 mimic and all dual-luciferase reporters harboring the wild-type 3′UTR sequences, and enhanced luciferase activities in cells transfected with miR-124 inhibitor compared to cells transfected with miR-124 control (p&lt;0.05). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Specifically, in a co-transfection experiment, miR-124 mimic reduced the luciferase activity of cells expressing pMIR-Report/TLR6 by 1.9-fold (Figure 2B), pMIR-Report/MyD88 by 2.1-fold (Figure 2C), pMIR-Report/TRAF6 by 2.0-fold (Figure 2D), and pMIR-Report/TNF-α by 2.3-fold (Figure 2E), relative to the negative control miRNA (miR-124 nc); whereas in cells co-transfected with a miR-124 inhibitor, luciferase activities were enhanced in cells expressing pMIR-Report/TLR6 by 2.5-fold (Figure 2B), pMIR-Report/MyD88 by 2.4-fold (Figure 2C), pMIR-Report/TRAF6 by 1.3-fold (Figure 2D), and pMIR-Report/TNF-α by 4.9-fold (Figure 2E) relative to miR-124 nc transfected cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>No significant change in luciferase activity was detected in cells co-transfected with either miR-124 nc or with reporters containing a mutant 3′UTR (Figure 2B–2E). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>TLR signaling is a crucial modulator of the immune response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>The TLR pathway has important roles in detecting pathogens and in initiating an inflammatory response that subsequently primes specific adaptive immune responses during infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Dysregulation of this process is a hallmark of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>It is therefore important that TLR signaling is tightly regulated. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>In this report, miR-124 was identified as a negative regulator of immune responses in alveolar epithelial cells following mycobacterial infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>miR-124 expression was induced by BCG infection and repressed TLR signaling by directly targeting multiple signaling components in the TLR pathway, including TLR6, MyD88 and TRAF6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>In addition, miR-124 was able to suppress the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-α. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Of note, as a tumor suppressing miRNA [34], less abundant endogenous miR-124 was detected in naïve A549 cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.microrna.org">http://www.microrna.org</ext-link>), however its transcription was dramatically elevated following BCG stimulation, and an additive effect of transfection of miR-124 mimic and BCG infection on miR-124 transcript was also observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>This result indicates that the A549 cell line is a reliable in vitro model for investigating miR-124 function in regulating the immune response of alveolar epithelial cells in response to bacterial infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the introduction of miR-124 mimic or inhibitor to BCG-infected cells showed more significant alterations to pro-inflammatory cytokine expression compared to naïve cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, the transfection of miR-124 mimic or inhibitor displayed moderate alterations of MyD88, TRAF6, NFκB, and several pro-inflammatory cytokine transcripts excluding TLR6, in both naïve and BCG-stimulated A549 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>We reasoned that miR-124 was capable of targeting multiple components of the TLR signaling cascade, and targeting any of components might functionally impact on the expression of its down-stream target genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Since the TLR signaling cascade is initiated by the activation of TLRs, the activation or repression of TLRs may alter the subsequent expression of down-stream genes [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>As such, targeting of TLR6 by miR-124 might lead to decreased expression of down-stream targets of the TLR signaling cascade, including MyD88 and TRAF6, as well as inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, even in uninfected cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Given that miRNAs are capable of negatively modulating TLR signaling to maintain homeostatic inflammation, mounting evidence has also shown that components of the TLR signaling cascade are capable of altering miRNA expression in a variety of cell types, particularly in macrophages [17], [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>For instance, TLR signals and pro-inflammatory mediators have been shown to induce miR-146a, miR-155 and miR-9 [36]–[39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Since the same miRNAs that regulate components of the TLR pathway are induced during TLR signaling, miRNAs likely operate in positive or negative feedback loops to modulate inflammation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the first miRNA identified to be modulated by TLR signaling, miR-146, targets TLR signaling molecules IRAK1 and TRAF6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>The miR-146 expression could be rapidly induced in human acute monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells upon exposure to LPS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Such induction was NF-κB-dependent, and was further found in macrophages, bone marrow-derived monocytes, and T-cells following a stimulation of TLR ligands, including TLR-2, TLR-3 and TLR–5 [17], [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Another example is miR-155, one of the most extensively characterized miRNAs, could be augmented in macrophages by many types of TLR ligands through both MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent TLR pathways [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>miRNAs have been shown to modulate the TLR signaling pathway by targeting proteins in its signaling cascade [41], including the transcription factors [42], signaling modulators [21], and its downstream of pro-inflammatory factors [38]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>In this context, infectious pathogens initially trigger TLR signaling, and miRNAs may enhance TLR signaling to assist in mounting an inflammatory reaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>However, to avoid prolonged/excessive inflammation, miRNAs eventually work to diminish pro-inflammatory signals [17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>To date, several proteins in the TLR cascade have been experimentally confirmed as direct targets of miRNAs, including MyD88, IRAK1, IRAK2, and TRAF6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>The repression of these common signaling proteins leads to a broad suppression of TLR signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Most bacterial pathogens engage multiple TLRs to trigger several non-redundant TLR signaling cascades. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Therefore, miRNA-mediated targeting of signaling proteins shared in multiple pathways serves as efficient means to attenuate robust signal activation and avoid over-amplification of a pro-inflammatory response [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>In agreement with this notion, we found miR-124 was able to attenuate a pro-inflammatory response in alveolar epithelial cells by targeting multiple components of the TLR pathway, including the signaling adaptors of MyD88 and TRAF6, upon mycobacterial infection. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>As a critical adaptor of TLR signaling and mediator of the immune response, MyD88 initiates a cascade of signaling events eventually leading to the expression of inflammatory gene targets [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>In an effort to identify miR-124 induction by TLR signaling, and in support of the notion that MyD88 could directly activate miR-124 transcription, we showed that MyD88 was able to induce miR-124 transcription upon BCG infection in A549 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, miR-124 transcription was elevated by overexpressing MyD88 and was decreased when MyD88 expression was silenced by MyD88 siRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>This observation demonstrated a crucial crosstalk between miR-124 and MyD88 in modulate inflammatory response, and a feedback regulatory mechanism of miR-124/MyD88 in the alveolar epithelial cells against infection, suggesting that MyD88 is a critical mediator through which miR-124 exerts its biological functions in alveolar epithelial cells in response to mycobacterial infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>In this regard, the bacterial pathogen (BCG) triggers TLR signaling activation, and augments MyD88 expression, which in turn induces miR-124 expression, subsequently the miR-124 post-transcriptionally down-regulated the MyD88 protein expression via directly targeting its mRNA and other targets in TLR signaling cascade, resulting in an attenuation of MyD88-dependent TLR signaling activity, and a substantial reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine and/or chemokine production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>As a functional consequence, the pathogen induced-pro-inflammatory response in the epithelial cells is suppressed (Figure 9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, additional mechanisms in TLR signaling pathway are also likely to contribute to miR-124-mediated immunoregulation in epithelial cells in response to mycobacterial infection, which needs to be further elucidated. </plain></SENT>
