</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Rhabdomyolysis is defined as a clinical and biochemical syndrome resulting from the lysis of skeletal muscle cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It usually affects healthy individuals following excessive physical activity, trauma, infections, use of medications or illicit drugs and other toxic agent’s consumption.1,2 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Metabolic myopathies might be a rare cause of rhabdomyolysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>They result due to an inability of muscle cells to produce an adequate amount of energy for their needs because of underlying defects in glucose, glycogen, lipid or nucleoside metabolism.3 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This heterogeneous group of inherited diseases include disorders of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) such as very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>VLCAD is a key enzyme catalyzing the first reaction in the mitochondrial beta-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids with a chain length of 14 to 20 carbons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This autosomal recessive disorder has a prevalence of about 1:85,000,4 and was first identified in 1992 by Izai et al.5 The human VLCAD gene has been identified and located on the short arm of chromosome 17 between bands p11.2 and p11.13105.6 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Since 2004, Portuguese Newborn Screening Program includes this disorder in its panel. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Until the end of 2012 a total of 738,816 neonates were screened and eight VLCAD deficiency cases were identified (1:92,352). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In this cohort, VLCAD deficiency is the second more prevalent FAO after medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The early detection avoids the morbility and mortality diseaseassociated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>There are three phenotypes described, according to the age at onset of clinical manifestations:7-10 i) early infantile-onset cardiac type, a severe form that involves hyperthrophic cardiomyopathy and sometimes leads to sudden death in the early infantile period; ii) childhood-onset hypoglycemia type, of moderate-severity childhood onset, that usually presents as a hypoketotic hypoglycemia eventually with hepatomegaly which is induced by fasting or preceding infections; and iii) adolescent/adult-onset myopathic type, of mild severity and adolescent or adult onset, that occurs during situations of increased energy demand, e.g., after physical exercise or fasting and mostly results in muscle weakness or muscle pain that can proceed to severe rhabdomyolysis with highly elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) concentrations.11-15 </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>On admission her temperature was normal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Except for tenderness in her muscles with mobilization difficulties, the physical and neurologic examinations were normal. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Blood sample analysis showed CPK 215,800 U/L (normal&lt;167), lactate dehydrogenase 6000 U/L (normal 240-480), myoglobin 30,950 ng/mL (normal 25-58); and aspartate aminotransferase 4773 U/L (normal 10-50). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Glucose, urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, calcium and phosphorous levels were normal. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Based on clinical presentation, family history and laboratory results, the diagnosis of metabolic myopathy with rhabdomyolysis precipitated by exercise was suspected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>For further clarification additional investigations revealed serum lactate 1.20 mmol/L (normal 0.63-2.44), pyruvate 77 μmol/L (normal 54.1-119.9), ammonia 77 μg/dL (normal 45-80) and free carnitine 15 μmol/L (normal 30-50). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The urine organic acids profile showed 3-hydroxybutyric acid and acetoacetic acid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Acylcarnitine analysis by tandem mass spectrometry of the patient’s dried blood spot disclosed elevated tetradecanoyl carnitine (C14) (0.26 μM, normal&lt; 0.24), tetradecenoyl carnitine (C14:1) (0.26 μM, normal&lt;0.18) and tetradecadienoyl carnitine (C14:2) (0.13 μM, normal&lt;0.08), suggesting VLCAD deficiency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>This was confirmed on acyl-CoA dehydrogenase very longchain (ACADVL) gene analysis, using standard polymerase chain reaction procedures, with in-house designed primers, to amplify from genomic DNA all exons and exon-intron boundaries of this gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis was performed in an ABI Prism 3100xl genetic analyzer using the Big Dye terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) and allowed the identification of a homozygous mutation, p.L500del (c.1500_1502delCCT), already described.8 Echocardiography was performed and showed no signs of hypertrophy or cardiomyopathy. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Despite having received advice on lifestyle and diet, a second episode of rhabdomyolysis occurred two months later, following a prolonged physical effort, a two hour long soccer game without hydration or food intake during the exercise. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Between the two episodes she was asymptomatic with no laboratory abnormalities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Since the second episode, patient compliance has improved, and she remains asymptomatic when following a dietary regimen avoiding fasting for more than eight hours overnight, prolonged exercise and a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Episodes of exercise intolerance followed by dark urine as a result of rhabdomyolysis, and increased serum CPK activity are symptoms of skeletal muscle disease that can be acquired or inherited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Recognized heritable causes of rhabdomyolysis are defects in the glycogen metabolism and glycolysis, in the respiratory chain or in fatty acid oxidation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Within the group of disorders of fatty acid metabolism, carnitine palmitoyl-transferase II deficiency is the most frequently reported condition, but other defects, like VLCAD deficiency, have also been described. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>For the present patient, common causes of rhabdomyolysis were excluded, including muscle injury, drugs, toxins or infections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>A metabolic etiology, namely a fatty acid metabolism disorder, was suspected given the onset of symptoms after prolonged physical exercise and the suggestive family history, such as parent’s consanguinity and brother’s similar symptoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Studies were conducted to confirm this diagnosis and exclude other above mentioned metabolic disorders, also associated to this presentation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>The key biochemical test which allowed an accurate diagnosis of VLCAD deficiency was the measurement of blood spotted onto filter paper acylcarnitines by tandem mass spectometry that revealed accumulation of tetradecenoyl carnitine (C14:1).7 These biochemical results were sufficiently characteristic to proceed directly to mutation analysis of ACADVL, the only gene known to be associated with this disorder.6 The molecular basis of VLCAD deficiency is very diverse with more than 80 mutations reported in the literature.9,11,14,16 In fact, no prevalent mutation has yet been detected. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>In this particular case we report a known mutation,8 first described in 2006 which results in deletion of leucine at position 501 of the mature VLCAD protein, and are associated with the same phenotype i.e., the myopathic type. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Both parents were found to be heterozygous for this mutation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Several studies have addressed the question whether or not it is possible to correlate genotype and phenotype in VLCAD deficiency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>In fact the only established relations are the presence of null mutations in severe and early phenotypes and missense mutations in milder and later phenotypes.11,14,16 In patients with two null mutations, the complete absence of VLCAD activity will affect many tissues, including the heart and liver, resulting in cardiomyopathy, hepatomegaly, and recurrent episodes of metabolic decompensation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Patients with missense mutations or single-amino acid deletion mutations may have sufficient residual VLCAD activity, when receiving adequate nourishment, to avoid liver and cardiac symptoms, and may not undertake sufficient sustained exercise, in childhood, to precipitate severe muscle symptoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>The late onset of disease in adolescent/adult patients could simply be the result of their avoidance to metabolic stress during childhood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, it is possible that they have mutations with higher residual enzyme activity than that observed in patients with the mild childhood phenotype, resulting in a difference in tolerance of metabolic stress between the two groups of patients.11 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Although VLCAD deficiency may present with severe cardiac involvement during childhood, almost all patients with later presentation, including the case presented here, did not have symptomatic cardiac abnormalities. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Treatment of VLCAD deficiency is based on dietary modification, with avoidance of longchain fatty acids and eventually supplementation with medium chain triglycerides (MCT), so that the enzyme-deficient step can be bypassed.17 Such diet should reverse most symptoms, although during periods of stress, like exercise, the MCT dosage may need to be raised in order to supply the extra energy, thus helping to prevent mobilization of long-chain fatty acids from the adipose tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Fasting needs to be avoided for similar reasons.18 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of the older brother through family screening, stresses the need to consider this group of disorders in similar cases of extreme exercise intolerance and rhabdomyolysis. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>In a patient with rhabdomyolysis, and after more common causes are excluded, it is important to consider the possibility of a metabolic disease, in order to provide a quick and adequate diagnosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>In this particular case, the history of parent’s consanguinity and a brother with similar symptoms help us to have a high index of suspicion of this disorder. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>After the diagnosis, adjustments in life-style and diet are crucial in the prevention of recurrent episodes of metabolic decompensation. </plain></SENT>
