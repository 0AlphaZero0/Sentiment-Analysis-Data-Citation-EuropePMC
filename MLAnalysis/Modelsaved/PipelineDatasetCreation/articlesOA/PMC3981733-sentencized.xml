</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Secreted phospholipases A2 (sPLA2s) are enzymes that hydrolyse glycerophospholipids at the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone in a calcium-dependent manner, releasing fatty acids and lysophospholipids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>These enzymes are members of the PLA2 superfamily, which is widely distributed in nature, and 15 groups and subgroups have been described, including five categories termed secreted PLA2, cytosolic PLA2, Ca2+ independent PLA2, the platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase, and lysosomal PLA2 [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Among them, group IIA sPLA2 includes mammalian inflammatory-type and Viperid snake venom sPLA2s [2], [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Besides their relevant role in cell membrane physiology, mammalian group IIA sPLA2s are recognized as important paracrine and autocrine players in inflammatory processes by their ability to release fatty acids from cell membranes, leading to subsequent production of pro-inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, sPLA2 enzymes, particularly group IIA sPLA2s, have been implicated in the pathophysiology of several inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, asthma and arthritis [4], [5], [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Besides structural homology, snake venom group IIA sPLA2s share functional features with mammalian group IIA sPLA2s, owing to their ability to induce inflammatory events in both in vivo and in vitro experimental models [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>sPLA2s are abundant components in the proteomes of snake venoms from Bothrops genus [8] and have been associated with the prominent local inflammatory effects induced by these venoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>An Asp49 sPLA2, named myotoxin-III (MT- III), has been purified from Bothrops asper snake venom [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>This group IIA sPLA2 has been reported to induce inflammatory events in in vivo experimental models [10], [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this venom sPLA2 exhibits the ability to directly activate inflammatory functions in isolated macrophages, such as increased phagocytic capacity, release of cytokines [11], [12], up-regulation of lipid mediator cascade, with release of prostaglandins [13], and increased formation of lipid droplets (LDs) [14], which are organelles implicated in the differentiation of macrophages into foam cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, the initial steps leading to this sPLA2-induced activation of macrophages are still unknown. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Macrophages are pivotal cells in innate immune responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Activation of these cells initiates cascades of events that lead to acute inflammatory processes and the switch from the acute to the resolutive phase of inflammation, by releasing resolutive mediators, such as PGJ2 and IL-10 [15], [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In addition, macrophages are relevant cells in the development of many chronic inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Macrophages loaded with LDs, termed foam cells, constitute an early hallmark of atherosclerotic lesion formation and a major cell source of inflammatory mediators [17], [18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The macrophage innate response is initiated by activation of diverse membrane recognition receptors, such as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Nowadays, at least 13 TLRs have been described, each of them with a degree of specificity for various endogenous and exogenous ligands, eliciting different, but sometimes overlapping, immune responses [19], [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In inflammatory processes, recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by TLRs except TLR3 activates cell-signaling pathways mediated by the MyD88 [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Other kinds of stimuli, named endogenous damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), are also capable of activating MyD88-dependent innate immune signaling by TLRs [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Some of the well- characterized DAMPs include: fibronectins [22], heat-shock proteins [23], pro-inflammatory cytokines from the monocyte-macrophage system [24], and free fatty acids (FFA) [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Among the TLRs, TLR2 constitutes a molecular link between elevated circulating FFA and inflammation [26]–[28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>TLR2 binds lipid-based structures via their long-chain saturated FFA moieties [25], [29], triggering inflammatory responses through MyD88 signaling [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Although TLRs are critical receptors directing specific inflammatory programs in macrophages, the involvement of TLR2 and MyD88 adaptor molecule signaling pathways in the activation of macrophages by group IIA sPLA2 remains unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The understanding of the mechanism(s) involved in sPLA2s-induced activation of in a pivotal immune innate cell, such as the macrophage, shall provide valuable information on new targets to confront the inflammatory diseases where group IIA sPLA2s enzymes are involved. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In the present study the involvement of TLR2 and MyD88 adaptor molecule in the signaling cascade (inflammatory signaling) elicited by MT-III in macrophages was investigated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>To test this possibility, the effects of MT-III in macrophages from wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice, TLR2 gene knockout (TLR2−/−) mice and MyD88 gene knockout (MyD88−/−) were evaluated in terms of PGE2, PGD2, PGJ2, IL-1β and IL-10 biosynthesis, LDs formation, COX-2 and perilipin-2 expression and release of free fatty acids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Herein, we present the first evidence that TLR2 and MyD88 adaptor molecule are implicated in the inflammatory response triggered by a group IIA sPLA2 enzyme in macrophages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Engagement of TLR2/MyD88 signaling pathway by the venom sPLA2 MT-III coordinates events related to both initiation and resolution of the inflammatory response in macrophages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Our observations also suggest that saturated free fatty acids are major agonists for engagement of TLR2/MyD88 pathway induced by this group IIA sPLA2. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>This is the first demonstration that a secreted group IIA PLA2 directly activates macrophages to release PGJ2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Noteworthy, the present findings also evidence, for the first time, that the production of a resolutive mediator is regulated by the TLR2 pathway. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>A previous report of our group demonstrated that, similarly to mammalian GIIA sPLA2s [70], MT-III up-regulates COX-2 protein expression, a critical enzyme for PGs production in macrophages [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>We herein extended the understanding of this mechanism by showing that MT-III up-regulates COX-2 expression via TLR2 and MyD88 signaling pathways in macrophages, based on the inability of TLR2−/− and MyD88−/− macrophages to express COX-2 in response to MT-III stimulus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Taking these data into account, and considering results showing that MyD88 adaptor molecule is involved in MT-III-induced production of PGE2, but not PGD2 or PGJ2, it is suggested that COX-2 is the major PGE2 biosynthetic pathway, whereas production of PGD2 and PGJ2 may be associated to both COX-2 and COX-1 biosynthetic pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this hypothesis, a previous report has shown the ability of MT-III to induce an increment in the activity of COX-1 along with expression of COX-2 in macrophages [13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>The ability of sPLA2s, including MT-III, to induce the release of cytokines has been previously demonstrated [12], [71]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>The data presented herein demonstrate that this sPLA2 induces the release of IL-10 and IL-1β in a process mediated by TLR2/MyD88 signaling pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>These findings also bring additional evidence that engagement of TLR2/MyD88 signaling pathway coordinates both the acute and resolutive responses in macrophages upon stimulation by the sPLA2 MT-III. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, increased IL-10 biosynthesis, observed in MT-III-stimulated WT macrophages, suggests that in our experimental conditions this cytokine regulates the synthesis of PGE2 via TLR2/MyD88 pathway activation, as a tight regulation of PGE2 biosynthesis by IL-10 has been previously demonstrated in macrophages [62]–[64]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>LDs are cytoplasmic inclusions found in numerous immune cells associated with inflammation [51], [54], [65], such as foam macrophages, which are major cells of atherosclerotic lesions [66]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>We recently demonstrated that MT-III induces LDs formation, recruitment and increased expression of the LD scaffold protein perilipin-2 in macrophages [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>The results obtained herein demonstrate, for the first time, that TLR2 and MyD88 are essential elements for LD formation induced by MT-III, since TLR2−/− and MyD88−/− macrophages failed to respond with increased numbers of LDs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>These results are in agreement with previous reports by others showing that TLR2/MyD88 pathway is involved in LDs formation in leukocytes [47]–[49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, our data further demonstrate that TLR2 deletion does not affect the ability of MT-III to induce a significant increase of perilipin-2 protein expression, but inhibits its capacity to mobilize constitutive perilipin-2 in the cytosol, evidencing that although not signaling for up regulation of perilipin-2 expression, this receptor is engaged for its recruitment, triggering an important mechanism for LD formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>In contrast, MyD88 deleted cells blocked MT-III- induced expression and mobilization of perilipin-2, implying the participation of this adaptor molecule in this effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Therefore, activation of a TLR other than TLR2 is involved in MT-III- induced expression of perilipin-2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of participation of TLR2 and MyD88 pathways in the mechanisms leading to LDs formation induced by group IIA sPLA2, and that MyD88 is a crucial adaptor molecule mediating perilipin-2 expression and mobilization induced by this class of enzymes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Experimental studies have previously demonstrated that TLRs, particularly TLR2 via MyD88-dependent pathway, have relevant roles in the differentiation of recruited monocytes into lipid-laden macrophages (foam cells), and ultimately to the development of atherosclerotic lesions [67], [68]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Considering the reported increased expression of group IIA sPLA2s at the site of atherosclerotic lesions [9], our present findings may shed light on the early mechanisms involved in the ability of sPLA2s to induce formation of foam macrophages. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms by which MT-III activates TLR2 were not presently investigated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that a free fatty acid (FFA)-rich microenvironment leads to the activation of TLR2 [28], [60]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there are data demonstrating that products of cleavage of membrane phospholipids by sPLA2s, including saturated fatty acids, lysophosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylserine, are able to activate this receptor [60], [72], [73], [74]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>In this context, we herein demonstrate that MT-III reduced the levels of saturated FFA, such as palmitic and stearic acid, as well as monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids in macrophages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Decreased levels of both palmitic and oleic acids correlated with increased amounts of these fatty acids in the extracellular medium, indicating that they are released from macrophages upon the action of MT-III, thus allowing their interaction with surface membrane receptors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>On this basis, we suggest that, in the present experimental conditions, saturated FFAs resulting from the catalytic action of MT-III on membrane phospholipids are autocrine ligands for TLR2, which then triggers an inflammatory program in macrophages, via pathways dependent on MyD88. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>However, participation of lysophospholipids in this mechanism cannot be ruled out. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>In support of our hypothesis, when catalytic activity of MT-III is inhibited, increments in LD formation are abrogated [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>In addition, the involvement of TLR2 in the release of the cytokines IL-1β and IL-10 induced by minimally modified LDL in macrophages has been previously described [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we provide evidence of a critical role for TLR2 and MyD88 adaptor molecule in mediating sPLA2-induced inflammatory responses in macrophages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>We have shown for the first time that the TLR2 and Myd88 adaptor molecule are involved in cellular and molecular inflammatory processes triggered by the venom sPLA2 MT-III in macrophages, that include the production of eicosanoids and cytokines and the formation of LDs, as well as an increased expression of COX-2 and perilipin-2 mobilization and expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, these findings indicate that TLR2, via MyD88 adaptor molecule, links sPLA2s with LD and foam cell formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we speculate that saturated free fatty acids released by MT-III enzyme activity from phospholipids in the macrophage membrane, are autocrinally recognized by TLR2, thereby initiating an inflammatory signaling cascade in macrophages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Altogether, these findings amplify the current knowledge on the mechanisms involved in the stimulatory effects of Group IIA sPLA2s in macrophages, specially those that trigger inflammatory events, including foam cell formation, which is a hallmark of atherosclerosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Such a mechanism may contribute to the identification of useful new targets for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for inflammatory diseases related to lipid imbalance where group IIA sPLA2s enzymes are involved. </plain></SENT>
