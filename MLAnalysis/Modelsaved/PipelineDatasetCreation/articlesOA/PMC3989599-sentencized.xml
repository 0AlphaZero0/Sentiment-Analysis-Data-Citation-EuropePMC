<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The development of a Drosophila embryo starts with the nucleus of the fertilized egg, which contains most of the cell’s genetic material, dividing 13 times in quick succession, without the cell itself splitting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These divisions are amongst the fastest known for any animal, and given the fast developmental speed, the embryo must efficiently express all genes it needs to stay alive. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, some mRNA molecules contain regions called ‘introns’ that are not translated and must instead be removed via a time-consuming process called ‘splicing’ before the protein is produced. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The shortness of these molecules is thought to reflect the fact there is not enough time to produce longer mRNA molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="?"><plain>Is the same ‘need for speed’ also responsible for the lack of introns in these molecules? </plain></SENT>
</text></SecTag></p><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Now, Guilgur et al. have tested this hypothesis by manipulating a gene named fandango, which codes for part of the cellular machinery that removes introns from mRNA molecules, in fruit flies. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Timing and coordination of biological processes is crucial for cellular homeostasis and normal development. Drosophila melanogaster embryonic development starts with thirteen nuclear divisions without cytokinesis (syncytial blastoderm), these divisions being among the fastest known for any animal embryonic system (Foe and Alberts, 1983). Drosophila syncytial blastoderm formation relies on the maternally encoded gene products loaded into the egg during oogenesis (Tadros and Lipshitz, 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>After fertilization, as nuclei enter interphase 14, the maternal to zygotic transition (MZT) occurs in which the soma suddenly becomes transcriptionally active and many of the maternally encoded gene products are rapidly degraded (Anderson and Lengyel, 1979; McKnight and Miller, 1976; Yasuda et al., 1991). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>While the major burst of zygotic transcription occurs once the nuclei arrest in interphase 14, there is an initial wave of zygotic gene expression during the syncytial nuclear divisions 8–13 (Pritchard and Schubiger, 1996; ten Bosch et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Due to the extreme speed of syncytial nuclear divisions, a limitation to the size of early zygotic transcriptional units has been suggested (McKnight and Miller, 1976; Rothe et al., 1992; Shermoen and O’Farrell, 1991). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Consistently, approximately 70% of early zygotic genes are small in size and intronless (De Renzis et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>As only 20% of Drosophila genes are intronless, it has been proposed that small intronless genes have an important selective advantage for transcription during the syncytial blastoderm formation (De Renzis et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In yeast, Drosophila, and human cells, pre-mRNA splicing is mostly co-transcriptional (Ameur et al., 2011; Khodor et al., 2011), with in vivo splicing rates being in the order of 30 s to approximately 3 min once the intron is transcribed (Alexander et al., 2010; Huranova et al., 2010; Schmidt et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>As most early zygotic transcripts are intronless (De Renzis et al., 2007), syncytial blastoderm interphases can be as short as 4 to 5 min, and given the fact that mitosis inhibits splicing (Shin and Manley, 2002), we hypothesized that further to the selective pressure for small transcriptional units, there is also a pressure to avoid pre-mRNA splicing during early zygotic expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>We isolated two mutant alleles for a subunit of the NTC/Prp19 complexes, known to be important for efficient spliceosome activation, which specifically impaired pre-mRNA splicing of early zygotic but not maternally encoded transcripts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>We showed that the differential splicing defects were not related to any particular structure/sequence of the early zygotic transcripts or differential association of spliceosomal components to the NTC/Prp19 complexes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Ectopic maternal expression of an early zygotic transcript in a mutant background was sufficient to suppress its splicing defects, suggesting that they were dependent on the developmental context of gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>We reasoned that constraints on pre-mRNA splicing are present during Drosophila early embryonic development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Consistently, a small early zygotic transcript with four introns was poorly spliced in wild-type embryos. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Such constraints on pre-mRNA splicing are a likely explanation why most early zygotic genes are intronless and suggest that highly proliferative tissues need coordination between cell cycle and gene architecture for correct gene expression and avoidance of abnormally processed transcripts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Our results strongly argue in favor of a developmental pre-requisite for highly efficient splicing during fast development, therefore we propose that the requirement for overall splicing efficiency is likely to vary during development. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>To confirm the mutants’ identity, we rescued their zygotic lethality, female sterility (germ-line clones), and blastoderm cellularization defects (maternal mutant embryos) using a genomic fragment construct that contained a wild-type copy of CG6197 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Both isolated alleles of CG6197 showed identical phenotypes: maternal mutant embryos (hereafter referred to as mutant embryos) showed normal syncytial nuclear divisions (Figure 1A,B) but subsequently failed to elongate the cortical nuclei, which became mislocalized during blastoderm cellularization (Figure 1C–F, quantification in Figure 1G). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom, Elisa Izaurralde, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The manuscript by Guilgur et al. identifies and characterizes mutations in Drosophila genes encoding components of the spliceosomal NTC/Prp19 complexes, a critical component of spliceosome activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the authors describe a differential requirement for the NTC/Prp19 components in the splicing of transcripts from maternally versus early zygotically expressed genes in the Drosophila embryo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pre-mRNA splicing defects detected in these mutants correlate with zygotic gene expression and the rapid mitoses characteristic of cell division in early Drosophila embryos. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These observations are interesting in light of two related findings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>First, that mitosis inhibits pre-mRNA splicing in organisms that undergo nuclear membrane breakdown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Second, in yeast intron size is small and most genes lack introns suggesting that the genomes of rapidly dividing cells were selected for intron loss. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the manuscript reveals a feedback or coordination between the time required to complete nuclear division and architecture of expressed genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The mechanism remains unclear, but this study opens new research avenues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>For example, what happens with pre-mRNAs that have “no time” to be spliced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Do they accumulate in the nucleus for later splicing or are they degraded by nuclear quality control (NQC) mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Another interesting question is how splicing efficiency adapts to cell cycle duration, and how a given transcript is processed in highly and non-proliferating cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Although there are many questions that remain unanswered, the finding that there is an evolutionary pressure for early zygotic genes to lack introns is novel. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the proposed coordination between the time to complete nuclear division and splicing efficiency provides an interesting mechanism to regulate gene expression and forms the basis for future studies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Overall, the paper is interesting, the data and observations support the conclusions drawn and should be published with minor revisions, outlined below. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>1) There is almost too much data in this paper, including a lot in the supplemental materials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Even the main figures often have multiple panels, some of which could be moved to the supplemental materials to simplify presentation of the main and seminal points. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>2) There are numerous grammatical or typographical errors that need to be fixed before publication. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>3) Finally, although the authors imply this, they should state explicitly the connections between the small or no intron containing zygotic genes, rapid cell divisions in the early embryo and intron loss in yeast and single cell eukaryotes. </plain></SENT>
