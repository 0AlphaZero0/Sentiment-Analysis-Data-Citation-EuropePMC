</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Women with symptoms and signs of ischemia, referred for invasive coronary evaluation, often have no evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>We and others have identified that symptomatic patients with non-obstructive CAD have an elevated risk of adverse outcomes and all-cause mortality compared with cohorts without symptoms and/or signs of ischemic heart disease [2], [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>About 45% to 60% of such patients have coronary vascular dysregulation (endothelial or non-endothelial dependent macro- or microvascular dysfunction) capable of causing ischemia with invasive provocative testing [1], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we and others have linked coronary vascular dysregulation with adverse outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Thus, additional indices of coronary vasomotor function, beyond standard anatomy from angiography, would be useful to improve risk stratification of these patients [5]–[9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) frame count (TFC) provides a simple angiographic index of coronary blood flow that does not require additional coronary artery instrumentation [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The intra- and inter-observer reproducibility of TFC is good, and dye injection rate and catheter size do not affect its measurement [11], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The TFC has correlated with other invasive and non-invasive measures of coronary blood flow [13]–[16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Further, TFC estimates of coronary flow after reperfusion for acute myocardial infarction predict short- and long-term clinical outcomes [17]–[19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>However, the prognostic implication of an abnormal TFC in patients without acute myocardial infarction or obstructive CAD and with suspected microvascular dysfunction remains unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we aimed to determine if TFC at rest is predictive of adverse outcomes in patients without obstructive CAD. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The WISE protocol was approved by the relevant institutional review boards (IRB) (University of Florida IRB, Allegany General Hospital IRB, University of Pittsburgh IRB, University of Alabama at Birmingham IRB), and has previously been described [20]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Major exclusion criteria included comorbidities likely to compromise follow up. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Qualitative and quantitative coronary angiographic analyses were conducted by a core laboratory masked to patient data [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>As previously described, the TFC was determined as the number of cine frames required for contrast to reach standardized distal coronary landmarks [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The first frame used for TFC is the frame in which dye fully enters the artery of interest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The last frame that is counted is the frame when dye enters the distal landmark branch (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>The distal landmark branch of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery was the distal bifurcation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>In normal coronaries, the TFC in the LAD is on average 1.7 times longer than the TFC in the other coronary arteries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the LAD frame counts were divided by 1.7 to provide a corrected TFC (cTFC) [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Those patients who had an angiogram recorded in a way that allowed the determination of TFC by the core lab and were found not to have obstructive CAD are included in this analysis. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>To determine the cTFC cutpoint for predicting hospitalization for angina, we generated a receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve using logistic regression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>The cTFC value corresponding to the point of the curve closest to 100% sensitivity and specificity was selected and verified in subsequent runs of incremental cut-points near that value. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to examine the relationship between baseline characteristics and adverse outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Baseline characteristics were chosen for entry into multivariable Cox models on the basis of their discrimination between those patients above and below the optimal cTFC cutpoint, as well as on univariate associations with adverse outcomes of P&lt;0.20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>A combination of forward and backward selection procedures were used to aid in determining the best model of independent predictors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>This was followed by forcing potential confounders into the models and determining their effect on the relationship of interest. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Using previously published data for women in the WISE with non-obstructive coronary disease [9], we assumed a reference 6-year event-free survival rate of 91% for such women without coronary microvascular dysfunction (e.g. normal cTFC). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Event-free survival was taken as freedom from first occurrence of death (all-cause), nonfatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>We assumed that women with abnormal coronary microvascular function (e.g. high cTFC) would have reduced event-free survival. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>This was expressed as a hazard ratio of 2.5 (corresponding to a 6-year event free survival rate of approximately 79%) with proportional hazard assumption. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Assuming 5% censoring, we would need 300 women to achieve 80% power and need 500 women to achieve 95% power, using a two-sided log-rank test with alpha level of 0.05. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>SAS procedure PROC POWER was used to perform the power analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>We suspected we were underpowered in our comparison of the incidence of the binary outcome of major events between TFC groups, and we used the Kaplan-Meier estimated rates of major events between our two TFC groups in this pilot study (20% vs. 13%) to determine the sample size necessary to detect a statistically significant difference at a power of 80% and an alpha of 0.05 using the SAS procedure PROC POWER with two-sided Pearson's chi square test. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Microvascular coronary dysfunction is prevalent in patients presenting with chest pain who have no evidence of obstructive CAD on standard angiography, and is associated with adverse outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Microvascular coronary dysfunction is commonly diagnosed by evaluating coronary blood flow before and after administration of adenosine with a Doppler-tipped guide wire in the coronary. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>TFC does not require placement of a wire in the coronary artery, and has been shown to correlate with coronary blood flow and prognosis in patients with acute coronary events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>The correlation of TFC with adverse outcomes in patients with no obstructive disease but suspected microvascular coronary dysfunction is less clear. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>In the 298 women included in this study who had chest pain but no evidence of obstructive CAD, a high cTFC was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for angina. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a high cTFC remained the strongest predictor of hospitalization for angina after controlling for baseline characteristics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, ACE inhibitor use was also associated with an increased risk of angina hospitalization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that patients randomized to an ACE inhibitor had greater improvement in angina severity as compared to those who received placebo [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>So these data are biased by WISE investigators likely prescribing an ACE-I for those with more severe angina. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Additionally, follow-up blood pressure for our current cohort was higher than the baseline blood pressure in those patients randomized to an ACE inhibitor in the Pauly et al trial [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>We suspect that baseline ACE inhibitor use in our current cohort is likely a marker of more advanced vascular disease, which may have contributed to an increased risk of angina hospitalization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>In this pilot investigation, cTFC was not associated with a statistically significant increase in risk of major events (myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, or all-cause death), CV events, all-cause mortality, or CV mortality. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Studies comparing TFC to more invasive measures of coronary vasomotion (endothelial or non-endothelial dependent macro- or microvascular function) have provided various results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Many studies have shown that TFC does correlate with measures of coronary vasomotion [23]–[26], whereas others have shown no correlation of TFC and coronary flow reserve [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Most of these studies were small. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Some of these studies included patients with obstructive CAD and others excluded patients with obstructive CAD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Some of these studies determined the change in TFC from baseline to the TFC at hyperemia, and correlated this change in TFC with measures of coronary vasomotion, whereas some looked at only the correlation of TFC at rest with measures of coronary vasomotion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it remains unclear if TFC at rest can replace evaluation of coronary vasomotion with more traditional methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Because TFC at rest does not require instrumentation of the coronary artery nor vasoactive medication, future study evaluating the correlation of TFC at rest with CFR determined after administration of adenosine and change in coronary artery diameter and coronary blood flow after acetylcholine in patients without obstructive CAD remains warranted. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>The major limitation of our study is the relatively small number of major events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Because of the small number of events, the current analysis provides low statistical power to find a relationship between TFC and major events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>In order to have appropriate power to determine if there is a significant difference in major event rates between TFC groups, we estimate that we would need approximately 880 patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in women with signs and symptoms of ischemia but no obstructive CAD, resting cTFC provides independent prediction of hospitalization for angina. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Larger studies are required to determine if resting cTFC is predictive of major events in patients without obstructive coronary artery disease. </plain></SENT>
