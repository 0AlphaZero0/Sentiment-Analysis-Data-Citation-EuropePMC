</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Despite advances in medical and surgical therapy, breast cancer annually kills more than 40,000 women in the United States, and the majority of these patients succumb to metastatic disease [1,2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Tumor cell migration is part of the metastatic cascade, in which tumor cells invade, migrate and leave the primary tumor to gain access to the circulation and reach distal secondary sites [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Breast tumor kinase (Brk), an intracellular non-receptor tyrosine kinase, which belongs to the Src family tyrosine kinases, is overexpressed in up to 86% of invasive human breast tumors [4,5,6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Brk has a significant role in the promotion of cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Brk promotes signaling through EGFR, HER2, insulin-like growth factor-1R, MET and integrins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Brk shares several direct substrates with Src, including paxillin and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), indicating possible redundant functions [4,5,6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Importantly, Brk and FAK phosphorylation (activation) can consequently lead to AKT, paxillin and MAPK activation [7,8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>FAK is a highly phosphorylated protein localized in focal adhesion contacts of cells [8,9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Its activity is regulated by integrin-mediated cell adhesion, as well as the activation of growth factor receptor and G-protein-linked receptor signaling [8,9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>FAK is involved in various cell functions, including proliferation, survival, motility, invasion and metastasis [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>FAK tyrosine Y397 is the main autophosphorylation site of FAK leading to the activation of its intrinsic kinase function, as well as downstream signaling molecules [8,9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The interaction of Y397-activated FAK and Src causes tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple sites in FAK (-576, -577, -925), as well as signaling molecules, such as paxillin, which connects FAK to various intracellular signaling molecules, such as Ras/MAPK, PI3K/AKT and Rho family GTpases [7,8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Both Brk and FAK have been associated with increased invasion and migration of tumors; hence, inhibiting these redundant pathways has been proposed as a strategy to block the invasive growth of cancer cells [7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The traditional approach to treat invasive breast cancer has been the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy, which in most cases associated with toxicity and resistance [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Therefore, recent efforts focused on developing entities that have selective and specific molecular target(s) in cancer cells in order to improve efficacy and limit toxicity [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Marine-derived natural products are among the unique resources for anticancer drug discovery [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Sipholenol A (Figure 1), a sipholane triterpenoid, was isolated from the Red Sea sponge, Callyspongia (Siphonochalina) siphonella [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Semisynthetic analogs of sipholenol A have been prepared to improve its antimigratory and antiproliferative activities against different breast cancer cell lines [12,13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Recently, sipholenol A-4-O-3′,4′-dichlorobenzoate (SPA) (Figure 1) showed the most potent anticancer activity with no toxicity on the non-tumorigenic human epithelial breast cells [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In addition, it resulted in a marked inhibition of the phosphorylation of Brk in a cell-free Z′-LYTE™ kinase assay (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) and Western blot analysis in the human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 [13]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>EGFR is expressed in T-47D, BT-474 and MDA-MB-231 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>HER-2 is expressed at lower levels in the ER-negative cell line, MDA-MB-231, and expressed at higher levels in the ER-positive cell lines, MCF-7, BT-474 and T-47D. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Met is expressed in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and BT-474, while it is absent in T-47D cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the four human breast cancer cell lines (MBA-MD-231, MCF-7, BT-474 and T-47D) were chosen to identify the mechanism of action by which SPA inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation and motility and the potential involvement of Brk and FAK signaling. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Breast cancer is the second most common form of cancer worldwide and the leading cause of cancer death among women [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Although there have been significant improvements in the prevention and diagnosis of this disease, the mortality remains relatively high because of metastatic disease [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Tumor cell metastasis includes the detachment of cancer cells from primary tumor, then degrading the basement membrane for the migration and invasion of tumor cells into the peripheral tissue, and finally intravasation into blood or lymphatic vessels and attachment at the target tissue [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Among these essential steps, cell migration and invasion mainly contribute to the metastatic spread. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Thus, screening novel compounds is an effective way to eradicate high-invasive breast cancer [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates hit-to-lead optimization of SPA, a structurally optimized ester derivative of the marine-derived sipholenol A, as a new antitumor entity with a unique ability to interfere with the interplay of Brk and FAK signaling networks, suggesting its therapeutic potential for the control of highly invasive breast cancers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>The cross talk between Brk and FAK promotes breast tumor metastasis [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>In addition to Akt and MAPK signaling, both Brk and FAK control the ability of malignant cells to become invasive by activating paxillin and Rac1 [4,8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>SPA caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the proliferation, migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, BT-474 and T-47D human breast cancer cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>This suggests the ability of SPA to exert its anticancer effect across a broad spectrum of breast cancer cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>In an orthotopic nude mice model, SPA suppressed tumor growth, and this effect was associated with the reduction of Ki-67 (mitosis marker) and CD31 (angiogenesis marker) expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Findings in this study suggest that SPA is capable of preventing the progression of breast cancer by inhibiting Brk and FAK signaling. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Breast tumor kinase (Brk) is an intracellular tyrosine kinase and possesses SH3, SH2 and kinase domains, homologues to Src [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Brk was identified from a human metastatic breast tumor [16], and subsequent analysis revealed its overexpression in about two-thirds of primary breast tumors, with the highest level in advanced tumors [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Brk overexpression positively correlates with the expression of EGFR family receptors [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Therefore, Brk stimulates the proliferation of breast tumor cells and mediates epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced mitogenic and migratory effects [4,5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Brk associates with the EGF receptor after receptor activation, which subsequently leads to an increased recruitment of PI3K and activation of Akt [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>In addition to stimulating cell growth, Brk is a potent inducer of migration and invasion [4,17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>This function is mediated in part by its phosphorylation of paxillin, which leads to the activation of Rac1 via the adaptor protein, CrkII [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Recently, Brk was shown to mediate EGF-induced activation of MAPK, which contributes in part to the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells in response to these growth factors [19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>FAK, a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase, has been implicated in controlling integrin- and growth factor receptor-mediated biological processes, including cell spreading, motility, migration, differentiation, angiogenesis and survival [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>FAK regulates cell migration mainly by its auto-phosphorylation at Tyr 397 (Y397), which subsequently phosphorylates other sites of FAK, including its kinase domain, thereby triggering the activation of cell migration signal pathways [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, FAK functions as a scaffolding protein associating with P130Cas, paxillin and other adaptors to promote cell migration and adhesion [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Increased FAK expression and activity are correlated with malignant or metastatic disease and poor patient prognosis [9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Numerous studies have described the importance of marine natural products to treat human diseases, including cancer [21,22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Marine natural products are deemed a rich resource of potential chemical molecules exhibiting anticancer properties [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Sipholenol A, a marine-derived natural product, was first isolated from the Red Sea sponge Callyspongia siphonella in 1983 [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Previous studies suggested that the substituted aromatic sipholenol A esters have improved antimigratory activity versus unsubstituted aromatic esters [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>SPA afforded the most active analogue as an anticancer agent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>The cell-based in vitro activity of SPA was well-correlated with its cell-free Brk phosphorylation inhibitory activity coupled with the absence of any cytotoxicity to the non-tumorigenic MCF10A cells [13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>In this study, the inhibitory effect of SPA appears to be mediated through the suppression of Brk and FAK phosphorylation and subsequent inhibition of the phosphorylation of the downstream signaling molecules, such as AKT, MAPK and paxillin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>SPA inhibited EGF-dependent mitogenesis, as indicated by a relative large reduction in positive Ki-67 staining in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Ki-67 is a nuclear antigen localized at the periphery of the chromosome scaffold and nuclear cortex [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Ki-67 is expressed in all phases of the cell cycle of proliferating cells (G1 phase, S phase, G2 phase and M phase), but not cells in the resting phase (G0 phase) [23,24,25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>SPA treatment also caused a significant reduction in EGF-induced cell cycle progression, which was accompanied by the reduced expression of cyclin D1 and CDK4 and a corresponding increase in p21 and p27 levels in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>In this study, four breast cancer cell lines representing a wide range of breast tumor phenotypes were used to determine the anticancer effect of SPA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>SPA treatment caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the cell proliferation and migration of MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, BT-474 and T-47D breast cancer cells, as shown by MTT and wound-healing assays. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>To study cell invasion, the MDA-MB-231 cell line was used for its aggressive and highly invasive nature [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>In addition, SPA treatment inhibited Brk phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner in the four tested breast cancer cell lines with no effect on the total Brk levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Molecular modeling experiments showed that SPA was docked into the FAK kinase domain without showing any binding affinity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>When SPA was docked at the structural pocket of the X-ray crystal structure of the FERM domain of FAK (containing the Y397 site), it showed a perfectly fitting docking pattern. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Western blot experiments showed that SPA mainly inhibits the phosphorylation of FAK at the Y397 site, which validates the molecular modeling results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>This offered SPA significant advantages because selective blocking of the phosphorylation at the Y397 FAK site consequently will block the activation of several FAK’s downstream signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>SPA showed little or no effect on the FAK’s ATP-binding site, which shares structural features with several diverse tyrosine kinases, unlike most of other current known small molecule FAK inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>This favors SPA’s uniqueness and selectivity over available FAK inhibitors by avoiding the expected off-target side effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, SPA had little or no activity on other FAK phosphorylation sites. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of Brk and FAK activation caused the inhibition of the activation of downstream signaling molecules, such as AKT, MAPK, paxillin and Rac1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>These results were confirmed by siRNA experiments, which showed that the depletion of Brk or FAK in the cells caused a decrease in the levels of p-AKT, p-MAPK, p-paxillin and p-Rac1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Previous studies showed that non-malignant MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells were resistant to SPA antiproliferative effects [13], consistent with the observed tolerance of nude mice to this drug. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Intraperitoneal administration (3×/week) of SPA at 10 mg/kg for 33 days in MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing nude mice did not give rise to overt signs of toxicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>SPA treatment caused a reduction of tumor volume and mitosis, as shown by Ki-67, p-Brk and p-FAK immunostaining and histopathology studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>It also caused a marked reduction in microvessel formation in the tumors. </plain></SENT>
