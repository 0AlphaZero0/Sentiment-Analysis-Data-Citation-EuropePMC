</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The progress of protein crystallography has been heavily dependent on methodological advances from recombinant protein production to crystallization and crystal diffraction data collection and evaluation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The process encounters several bottlenecks, with insufficient crystal quality being a major bottleneck. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Protein crystals have solvent contents of 30–90%, in which the protein molecules are in general held together weakly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Protein crystals are therefore influenced by the environment and are susceptible to stress of all kinds, in particular to changes in the composition of the solvent in which the crystals are kept, its pH and (the focus of this study) the humidity of the environment, which is in equilibrium with the water surrounding the protein lattice (crystal water). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Changes in the moisture to which the crystals are exposed lead to the removal or addition of crystal water, causing changes in crystal lattice parameters and macroscopic variation in crystal volume and, just as importantly, realignment of the mosaic blocks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Simple procedures involving the equilibration of crystals against salt solutions of varying concentrations using serial transfer have shown some success and have been reviewed (Heras &amp; Martin, 2005 ▶; Russo Krauss et al., 2012 ▶). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>They lack control, are laborious and may/are likely to miss the optimal conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>However, a recently published plate-screening technique enables these experiments to be more easily carried out (Douangamath et al., 2013 ▶). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Indeed, numerous experiments with a large variety of protein crystals in our laboratory have shown that the transition to a better ordered state, a new phase, occurs (if it occurs) at a sharply defined humidity and within a narrow range. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Some years ago, we therefore initiated a research programme in which we explored the influence of continuously adjustable and defined changes in humidity on crystal properties, and developed a method and instrument for this purpose (Kiefersauer et al., 2000 ▶). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Based on this, the FMS (Free Mounting System) has been developed and is produced on an industrial basis on a small scale by Proteros Bio­structures Co., Martinsried, Germany. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The essential components of these instruments are a device for programmed and precisely and reproducibly controlled variation of the relative humidity (rh) of the air stream in which the freely mounted crystal is bathed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Dew-point variation (chiller technology) by fixed gas temperature thus allows precise control and change of the rh with an accuracy of ±0.2%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>A number of references document its successful use for various protein crystals, including membrane proteins (Soulimane et al., 2001 ▶; Abad-Zapatero et al., 2011 ▶; Breitenlechner et al., 2005 ▶; Chotiyarnwong et al., 2007 ▶; Dobbek et al., 2002 ▶; Engel et al., 2003 ▶; Estébanez-Perpiña et al., 2000 ▶; Hagelueken et al., 2012 ▶; Henrich et al., 2003 ▶; Koch et al., 2004 ▶; Kyrieleis et al., 2005 ▶). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In many cases, it was the last resort to rescue protein structure projects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the FMS model, Sanchez-Weatherby et al. (2009 ▶) developed a device to improve compatibility with synchrotron X-ray beamlines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Continued further development of the FMS resulted in the version shown in Supplementary Figs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>S1 and S21. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The crystal-containing loop is mounted in front of the humidity nozzle in the humidified gas stream. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Crystal preparation requires the removal of excess liquid at the crystal and is performed under the stereo microscope with the liquid-removal device positioned by the xyz micro-manipulator (Owis; Supplementary Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The response of the crystal shape, dilation or shrinkage, to the humidity changes is analysed with a zoom microscope (Opto Sonderbedarf) connected to a digital camera (Sony). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Flash-cooling of the crystal can be performed by rotation of the nozzles supplying the humid air and the cold nitrogen, respectively, pneumatically in fractions of a second (see also Supplementary Movie S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>This technique allows the direct comparison of room-temperature/cooled states of an individual crystal by X-ray analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Additionally, there is always the option to return to the room-temperature state by a back-switch of the nozzles for a second trial of flash-cooling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Every step in the process can be checked by X-ray diffraction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Often, and as has been shown by others (Pellegrini et al., 2011 ▶), the addition of supplementary cryoprotectant to the crystal prior to cryocooling is not required. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>An optical device records and measures shadow projections of the crystal mounted on the tip of a micropipette or in a loop via a video system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>By back-projections, crystal shape and volume can be easily calculated and the response of the crystal dimensions to humidity changes can be monitored (Kiefersauer et al., 1996 ▶). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Phase changes of the crystals affecting the dimensions (usually shrinkage on lowering the humidity) are thus detected instantaneously and can be correlated with changes in X-ray diffraction quality, which require more time to record but, of course, constitute the ultimate check. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>When the optimal phase is reached, the crystals are flash-cooled by swapping in the cryo-jet for data collection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The optimal phase ideally displays higher resolution X-ray diffraction, reduced mosaic spread and increased tolerance to flash-cooling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>For illustration, Fig. 1 ▶ shows the procedure and results of FMS experiments with carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) crystals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>In Fig. 1 ▶(a) (left) the change of crystal dimension viewed from one direction is traced when the humidity was gradually varied from 95 to 86%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The red trace shows the stepwise dimensional change from 0% to −6.5% for forward (high to low humidity) and backward directions with a fresh crystal; the blue trace shows repeated experiments with the same crystal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Both curves and their comparison document a pronounced hysteresis, probably a consequence of the substantial changes in crystal lattice packing and molecular contacts associated with the phase changes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>By partial rehydration the best crystal state is reached. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>This seems to be particular to the CODH crystal system (Fig. 1 ▶ a, right). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Movies in the Supporting Information show diffraction patterns and crystal size at different humidities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>The change of dimension is usually very anisotropic, as shown for a lysozyme crystal in Fig. 1 ▶(b) (Kiefersauer et al., 2000 ▶; Kiefersauer, 1998 ▶). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The anisotropic crystal shrinkage correlates with the number and strengths of crystal packing forces (Nadarajah &amp; Pusey, 1996 ▶). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>For detection and analysis in practice, one would select a crystal orientation displaying the most significant change, at a ϕ value of 72° in this case. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>This necessitates humidity pre-scans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Processing, evaluation and integration of a few scans at different orientations afford determination of the crystal volume and may be used for other purposes, i.e. an analytical absorption correction. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we explored the possibility of inducing humidity changes through temperature variation by irradiation of the crystals with IR light. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Temperature can be changed very quickly in this way, and repetitions with high frequency are possible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>The technique also offers other options which the traditional humidity-control procedure cannot supply. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Here, the parameters of the crystal surroundings (relative humidity, gas temperature) are constant whereas the IR exposure to the crystal (time, power) can be varied. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>We used a laser diode as the infrared radiation source operating at a wavelength of 938 nm and within an optical power range of 0.5–30 W (Amtron GmbH, 52146 Würselen, Germany; laser type LS453). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The laser beam is guided by a fibre optic (3 m length, 200 µm core diameter) to the laser optic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>In the focus (50 mm distance from the optic, optic diameter 30 mm) the IR beam is round and has a diameter of 200 µm with a divergence of 20°. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>The position of the laser optic can be changed by an xyz micromanipulator (Narishige Model W3-30) manually controlled from outside the laser cabinet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>The laser system itself allows several possibilities for controlling the time profile and power of the laser beam. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Here, we used only the analogue input. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Laser power depends on the amplitude of the analogue signal and follows its change instantaneously. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>The analogue signal is generated by a data-acquisition (DAQ) device (PCI-6221, National Instruments). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>To protect the experimenter, the experimental setup is housed in a metal cabinet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Appropriate safety precautions were installed by connecting the laser to an interlock system which switched it off when the cabinet was opened. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Access of the flexible tubes into the cabinet was configured so that it was radiation-tight. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Opposite to the opening of the FMS head, the loop with the crystal on it was placed in the gas stream (flow rate 1 l min−1, dry nitrogen as the gas medium). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>For the alignment of the crystal in the centre of the gas stream and the IR beam, a glass capillary was mounted in the FMS head which protruded 1 mm out of the opening. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>The humidity channel of the FMS head was extended by approximately 3 mm with a cylinder of thin-walled transparent plastic foil to avoid interference of the FMS head (control of gas temperature) with the laser beam. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Additionally, automatic control of the laser power is implemented. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>By setting the desired relative change in crystal size, the laser power is regulated automatically to reach and fix this value without delay. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>The protein crystal is assumed to be a cube of water with an edge length of 100 µm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>The absorption coefficient of water at room temperature (20°C) and at a wavelength of 938 nm can be found to be α = 0.1688 cm−1 (Palmer &amp; Williams, 1974 ▶). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>The experiments described above were conducted with the stand-alone setup shown in Fig. 2 ▶ and document the feasibility of IR laser-induced crystal annealing and its successful application, which matches and even exceeds the traditional method. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>As it may be carried out much faster, it offers the potential for a quick complete exploration of the phase space of a crystal as manifested in discontinuities of the crystal size/laser power scan detected by the optical device and method described. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Their ease of observation depends on the orientation of the crystal and may require a number of scans. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>We envisage that the accessible phase space depends on the characteristics of the IR pulse (strength and duration), and wish to explore its effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Strong irradiation may be extended into a regime where partial protein unfolding is coupled with global crystal disorder and is followed, after laser shut-off, by re-annealing of the molecular structure and the reformation of a crystal lattice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>As the partial unfolding may result in rearrangements of the protein–protein contacts forming the crystal structure, this could result in new crystal forms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Also, in this context, the wavelength of the IR light should have an impact which has to be explored. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>As suggested in this work, the rate of crystal shrinkage is an important parameter, which may allow thermodynamic energy barriers to be overcome if it occurs very rapidly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>By soaking the crystal with an IR-absorbing dye, the absorbed energy can be enhanced manyfold and the crystal shrinkage accelerated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Combination with the CryoSwitch allows the preferred crystal state to be retained by flash-cooling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Another interesting scenario would be irradiation of the crystal enclosed with PFPE oil. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>In this case, water is prevented from diffusing in/out of the crystal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Instead of shrinking, the crystal will expand with heat (thermal expansion), as had already been shown in an initial experiment (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, if the crystal remains in the cryostream, precisely controlled temperature annealing with the IR laser is possible. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>In the present setup, the crystal, after annealing by IR irradiation, had to be transferred to the X-ray generator and mounted on the camera for the diffraction tests. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>The humidity had to be adjusted with the FMS system for the transfer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>This is in principle an unnecessary operation, because, as documented by the examples, the crystal volume and the optimal phase can be maintained by constant irradiation alone without re-adjustment of the external humidity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>An obvious and simple solution is the integration of the laser and optical device with the X-ray camera mounted on the X-ray generator. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>In principle, this poses no problem, but requires further engineering, mechanical and electrical constructions, as the safety issues with IR lasers are strict and they require shielding and external control. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>An intermediate solution with the present standalone instruments would be to stabilize the optimized crystal using an oil film applied as droplets using a pico-dropper (Böttcher et al., 2011 ▶). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>This also requires mechanical and electrical design and engineering. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Engineering work in this direction is in progress. </plain></SENT>
