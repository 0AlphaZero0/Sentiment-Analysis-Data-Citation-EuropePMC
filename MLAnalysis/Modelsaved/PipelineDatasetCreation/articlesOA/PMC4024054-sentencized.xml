</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-activated nuclear transcription factors that function as key regulators of lipid metabolism.1,2 Long-chain fatty acids, in particular polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and their metabolites, have been shown to be potent endogenous ligands of PPARs.3–7 PPARs bind to their target DNA sequences after formation of heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) as a binding partner.4,5,8 Both the PPARs and RXR contain zinc finger structures in their DNA-binding domain that are essential for the binding of the nuclear response elements in the promoter region of their target genes.9–11 Peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) is the major subtype in the liver, where it plays a central role in the regulation of fatty acid degradation.1–3Pparα-deficient mice exhibit defective mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and ketone body production, and fatty livers in response to starvation.12–14 Transcript levels of Pparα and of PPARα target genes encoding key enzymes of fatty acid oxidation, including the mitochondrial Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA-isomerase (Eci1 or Dci) gene, have been reported to be depressed in the liver of Zn-deficient young rats.15,16 The enzyme Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA-isomerase (EC 5.3.3.8) is needed for the conversion of 3-cis-and 3-trans-enoyl-CoA esters of unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) to the 2-trans-enoyl-CoA esters for continued degradation of unsaturated fatty acids in the β-oxidation cycle.17,18 PPARγ as a transcription factor regulates mainly adipocyte differentiation and lipid storage.19,20 Pparγ-mRNA levels of thoracic aorta have been found to be significantly higher in Zn-depleted mice than in Zn-adequate and Zn-supplemented animals.21 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the rats fed the LZ-CB and LZ-SF diets displayed markedly reduced food intakes as well as lower final body weights than those offered the HZ-SF diet free choice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>There were, however, no conspicuous differences in the outer appearance of the animals other than body size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>The deficient Zn status of the animals fed the LZ diets is clearly evident from the greatly reduced plasma and femur Zn concentrations relative to the values recorded for the animals consuming the HZ diets (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>In the LZ-SF group, final body weights and Zn concentrations in plasma and femur were markedly lower (26, 35, and 23%, respectively) than in the LZ-CB group despite the same dietary Zn level, indicating an effect of fat source. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>It may be argued that the LZ-CB diet was consumed in higher amounts than the LZ-SF diet because of a preference for the CB-containing diet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>This possibility, however, is not supported by the following observations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>First, an interaction between dietary Zn level and fat type has been observed previously.22 Food intake, growth rate, and plasma Zn concentrations of weanling rats fed moderately Zn-deficient diets were reduced to a greater extent when their diet was enriched with sunflower oil as compared with beef tallow, whereas these diets were consumed in comparable amounts, and growth rates were comparable when the dietary Zn content was high.22 In support, numerous previous studies did not find a differential intake among Zn-adequate, high-fat (≥15%) diets supplemented with saturated versus unsaturated fats.22,26–29 Second, restriction of food intake per se does not lead to reduced plasma Zn concentrations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Plasma and femur Zn concentrations in the groups fed the HZ-SF diet either free choice or in restricted amounts were comparable (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>This agrees with former studies showing that plasma or serum Zn concentrations are not altered when Zn-adequate diets are fed in restricted amounts as compared with ad libitum feeding.22,30–33 Finally, growth retardation because of an alimentary Zn deficit cannot be attributed to a loss of appetite as the primary cause. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>It has already been shown in 1970 that increasing the food intake of Zn-depleted young rats by force-feeding does not alleviate the growth arrest but instead quickly elicits severe signs of ill health and morbidity of the animals.34 Taken together, the evidence of the present study indicates a poorer Zn status of the rats fed the LZ-SF diet compared with those fed the LZ-CB diet despite comparable liver Zn concentrations, in agreement with previous studies.22,35 The underlying mechanism for this effect of fat source on Zn status awaits further research. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Fatty acids are an important energy source for the liver. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>The expression of hepatic genes coding for proteins and key enzymes involved in fatty acid catabolism in the liver is mediated by PPARα, the major PPAR transcription factor in hepatocytes.1–3 The expression of PPARα in the liver of rats and mice has been found to follow a diurnal rhythm.36–40 Oishi et al38 show that this circadian expression of Pparα is regulated directly by clock genes and is abolished in homozygous Clock mutant mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>But food plays a dominant role as a zeitgeber for circadian oscillations of gene expression in the liver and other peripheral tissues (see below).41 Pparα-mRNA must be translated first into its protein counterpart before it can serve its role as nuclear transcription factor and ultimately transactivate its numerous target genes, including those involved in lipid metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>In the liver of rats, PPARα protein levels closely followed the diurnal cycling of Pparα-mRNA levels suggesting an efficient translation of its mRNA.36 Yang et al42 also reported corresponding increases in the expression of PPARα at both the transcript and protein levels in the liver of Rheb1 null mice as a result of a pronounced decrease in food intake. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>These knockout mice exhibited increases in hepatic transcript levels of genes involved in β-oxidation and ketogenesis (including carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and mitochondrial 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase), and markedly elevated serum levels of BHB concentrations compared with normal control mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>These findings reflect responses at all levels of cell function from gene transcription in the nucleus to hepatic fatty acid catabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Activation of the transcriptional activity of PPARs is a highly complex regulatory process that involves ligand binding, release of corepressors, and binding of the nuclear receptor RXR and diverse coactivators.43–45 Recent studies suggest that natural ligands for PPARα in the liver are dietary and newly synthesized fatty acids,46,47 whereas plasma free fatty acids released by TAG lipolysis in adipose tissue activated hepatic PPARβ/δ.48 PPARα and PPARβ/δ presumably mediate the expression of similar target genes.48 The activated PPAR–RXR heterodimer binds to specific peroxisome-proliferator response elements (PPREs) of the target genes to initiate transcription. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Functional PPREs have been identified for several of the targets of PPARα (including Cpt1A, Acadl, and Hmgcs2) but not for the auxiliary enzymes of UFA oxidation.2,49 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>In our study, the relative transcript levels of the Pparα gene in the liver of the rats fed the HZ CB and SF diets in restricted amounts were about twice as high as those in the animals fed the corresponding LZ diets free choice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>This marked effect, however, cannot be attributed to the difference in dietary Zn supply. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>The Pparα-mRNA levels of the ad libitum-fed LZ-CB and LZ-SF groups were comparable to the level of the ad libitum-fed HZ-SF group, clearly indicating that the moderate Zn deficiency of the animals fed the LZ diets did not impair Pparα transcription. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>We instead conclude that the higher Pparα-mRNA abundance in the HZ-CBR and -SFR groups is the consequence of the feeding protocol. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Both short-term starvation12,50,51 and chronic food restriction52,53 have been shown to alter hepatic PPARα expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>In agreement with our experiment, hepatic Pparα transcript levels in rats exposed to a 85% food restriction (12-hour light–dark cycle, but without restriction in time of food access) were about twofold higher after a 12-hour fasting period than in control animals fed the same diet free choice.53 Regarding our study, it must be considered that the restricted food allocation in the HZ-CBR and HZ-SFR groups caused the animals to adapt to a daytime feeding pattern. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>These rats had almost completely consumed their daily ration by 23.30 hours when food was removed for a 10–12-hour overnight fasting period before sacrifice at the end of the experiment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>At that time, the animals fed free choice had eaten at most half of the amount of food that they had consumed on the previous day, thus imposing an unaccustomed metabolic stress on these animals because of the lack of food during their habitual night-time feeding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in food intake pattern between the animals offered the Zn-deficient CB and SF diets and those receiving the HZ-SF diet free choice, which agrees with previous observations.54 I n rodents, as nocturnal animals who consume most of their food during the dark hours under a 12-hour light–dark cycle, Pparα-mRNA abundance in the liver reaches peak levels toward the end of the light phase, when energy homeostasis relies on fatty acid degradation and possibly on ketogenesis and gluconeogenesis, whereas nadir values are recorded at the beginning of the light cycle.36–40 This circadian rhythm has been shown to shift by approximately 12 hours when food access is restricted to daytime hours.39 Such a shift may have also occurred in the restrictedly fed rats of our study, and thus can explain the elevated Pparα transcript levels in these animals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>This assumption is supported by plasma BHB concentrations (Fig. 2), which were approximately twofold higher in the ad libitum-fed rats than in the restrictedly fed animals, suggesting that the former animals were affected by the overnight food withdrawal to a greater extent than those accustomed to the habitual food shortage during the dark hours. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Similarly, plasma ketone body concentrations after an overnight fast were about three times as high in Zn-deficient rats as in pair-fed control rats that had become meal eaters.55 Furthermore, rats that were continuously fed a Zn-supplemented diet showed much higher fasting plasma concentrations of free fatty acid than meal-eating rats.56 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Previous studies15,16 found that the transcription levels of Pparα and of genes coding for proteins involved in fatty acid degradation, including the Eci1 gene, were markedly down-regulated in the liver of Zn-depleted young rats as compared with Zn-adequate control animals, whereas transcript levels of genes involved in de novo fatty acid synthesis were up-regulated along with increased hepatic TAG concentrations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>These findings obviously conflict with our results, which indicate that the hepatic transcript levels of Pparα (Pparγ and Eci1 as well) were not reduced in the rats fed the LZ-CB and LZ-SF diets as compared with the animals fed the HZ-SF diet free choice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Prominent differences between our and the former studies15,16 concern diet composition, in particular zinc, carbohydrate, and fat content; and the feeding protocol. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>First, it could be argued that the rats offered the LZ-CB and LZ-SF diets were exposed only to a moderate Zn deficit, allowing considerable growth rates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Second, fat contributed about 60% and carbohydrates (starch and sucrose) only about 22% of ME intake in our study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Hence, it is reasonable to assume that hepatic de novo fatty acid synthesis was greatly depressed in our experiment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>In support, in weanling rats fed very similar high-fat, low-carbohydrate diets, the hepatic activity of glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase, which belongs to the lipogenic enzyme family and closely correlates with the rate of fatty acid synthesis in the liver,57 was greatly reduced as compared with animals fed a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet.22 Third, the most decisive difference in the experimental protocols concerns the feeding regimen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>In the former studies,15,16 the young rats were force-fed by intragastric tube to equalize the amount and frequency of intake of the Zn-deficient and Zn-supplemented diet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>These diets were fed at a level (11.6 g dry matter/day) that exceeds amounts that Zn-depleted young rats have been observed to consume voluntarily,58 whereas the identical quantity of the Zn-adequate diet given to the control rats was evidently below the expected amount of free-choice intake and limited their weight gain to merely 2.4 g/d,15 a level that is about 40% below the gain (~4 g/d) in the LZ-SF group of our experiment at a similar body weight. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Force-feeding of severely Zn-deficient diets above appetite is likely to stimulate energy storage, because the deficit of zinc inhibits cell division, nitrogen retention, and lean tissue growth.59–61 Hence, the metabolic response to forced overnutrition can be expected to induce lipogenesis and fatty livers, and induce a down-regulation of the transcription of Pparα and its target genes of the fatty acid oxidation pathway.62 In agreement with such a nutritional state, the livers of young rats force-fed Zn-deficient diets displayed markedly higher activities of lipogenic enzymes63 and increased triglyceride concentrations.58 In contrast, triglyceride concentrations in the liver of young rats offered Zn-deficient diets for voluntary consumption were not higher than in the liver of Zn-supplemented control animals fed ad libitum or restrictedly.22,58 In line with these former studies, hepatic TAG concentrations did not differ between the rats fed the LZ and HZ diets in our experiment (Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, chronic underfeeding is prone to enhance hepatic Pparα expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>In the liver of mice that were fed below appetite for seven days in a synchronized pair-feeding protocol (food access only during the 12-hour dark cycle before sacrifice the following morning), Pparα-mRNA abundance was more than threefold higher than in control animals receiving food ad libitum.52 Taken together, it may be presumed that the formerly observed marked difference in the transcription of Pparα and target genes encoding enzymes of fatty acid catabolism in the liver of force-fed Zn-deficient rats15,16 was not because of a deficit of zinc per se but instead was the consequence of feeding the Zn-deficient diet above and the Zn-supplemented diet below appetite of the animals, inducing metabolic states of over- and underfeeding, respectively. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Zinc is, beyond doubt, essential for the transcriptional activity of PPAR proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>These nuclear transcription factors, and their heterodimeric binding partner RXR as well, contain Zn finger structures in their DNA-binding domain, which are critical for the polarity and specificity of the receptor element binding.10,11 The DNA-binding activity of PPARα and PPARγ proteins has been found to be impaired in cultures of Zn-deprived porcine vascular cells, and PPAR agonists could induce PPAR-binding activity only in Zn-sufficient cells.64 Furthermore, the DNA-binding activity of PPARγ was significantly reduced in the liver of Zn-deficient mice.21 The pivotal role of PPARα-mediated transcription of genes coding for proteins and enzymes involved in fat catabolism is clearly evident from studies with Pparα-null mice, which develop hypoglycemia, hypoketonemia, and fatty livers when they are exposed to starvation because of their inability to increase hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis.12–14 Similar metabolic symptoms have been observed in Eci1-deficient mice.65 Eci1 and Hmgcs2, the latter coding for the mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the hepatic synthesis of ketone bodies, are among the genes that are regulated by PPARα.2,14,49,66 In consideration of these metabolic findings, it can be hypothesized that an impaired transcriptional activity of the PPARα protein toward its target genes because of a deficit of zinc should adversely affect fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis in the liver, especially when fat is the preponderant source of energy and the intake of available carbohydrates is low as it was the case in our study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>However, the metabolic evidence available from our experiment and that from previous research indicates that alimentary Zn deficiency does not compromise mitochondrial fatty acid degradation and ketogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>In our experiment, the hepatic Eci1-mRNA levels did not differ between the rats fed the LZ and HZ diets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>This indirectly suggests that the activity of PPARα as nuclear transcription factor was not impaired by the mild Zn deficiency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, plasma BHB concentrations after the overnight fasting period were comparable among the ad libitum-fed animals independent of the dietary Zn supply. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>In previous studies, severe Zn deficiency did not adversely affect fatty acid oxidation or ketogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>As early as in 1966, Theuer and Hoekstra67 reported that the oxidation of 14C-labeled palmitic acid administered to severely Zn-deficient weanling rats 14 hours after food withdrawal was not impaired as compared with Zn-adequate control animals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Also, the extent of β-oxidation of linoleic and α-linolenic acid, and serum BHB concentrations were higher in Zn-deficient pregnant and nonpregnant rats than in Zn-adequate control animals.68,69 Fasting plasma ketone body concentrations in Zn-depleted young rats were about three times as high as in Zn-supplemented pair-fed animals.55 Plasma BHB concentrations and oxidation of BHB in pregnant rats given a suboptimal zinc diet (6 μg Zn/g diet) were markedly higher than in Zn-sufficient controls.70 Both groups were in a negative energy balance because of the late stage of pregnancy, but there was no evidence of maternal hypoglycemia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Thus, our study is consistent with these former studies suggesting that zinc is not a critical nutrient in β-oxidation of fatty acids and ketogenesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>In our experiment, the SF diet did not induce higher Pparα-mRNA levels than the CB diet despite a more than twofold higher intake of unsaturated fatty acids (predominantly linoleic acid). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>This finding agrees with previous studies showing that the transcription of the Pparα gene itself is much less responsive to the type of fatty acid intake than the transcriptional activity of the PPARα protein on its target genes.47,71,72 Remarkably, Eci1-mRNA levels were not related to Pparα-mRNA levels (r = 0.20, P &gt; 0.05). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Overall, the former were higher in the liver of the SF-fed animals, especially in the HZ-SF group (P &lt; 0.05), than in the CB-fed groups, suggesting a moderate response to the dietary fat source. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>This agrees with previous studies reporting that rodents fed diets enriched with linoleic acid as compared with saturated fatty acids displayed elevated Eci1 transcript levels, even though the differences were not significant.73–75 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the moderate Zn deficiency did not impair gene expression of Pparα, Pparγ, and Eci1 in the liver of weanling rats fed fat-enriched diets, in which CB and SF oil were the preponderant energy source (about 60% of the dietary ME). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>The observed elevated abundance of Pparα-mRNA in the restrictedly fed animals corroborates a sensitive response to changes in the feeding regimen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>There was a notable increase in the hepatic Eci1 transcription in response to the SF oil-based diets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Plasma BHB levels suggest that β-oxidation of fatty acids and ketogenesis was not affected by the moderate Zn deficiency. </plain></SENT>
