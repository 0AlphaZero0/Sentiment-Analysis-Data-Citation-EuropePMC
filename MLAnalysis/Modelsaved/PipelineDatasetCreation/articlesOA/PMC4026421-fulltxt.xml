However, the molecular mechanisms of this pathway and its potential for clinical application remain unknown. In this study, we found that PI4KII&#945; could be an ideal combinatorial target for EGFR treatment via regulating EGFR degradation. Results showed that PI4KII&#945; knockdown reduced EGFR protein level, and the expression of PI4KII&#945; shows a strong correlation with EGFR in human breast cancer tissues (<italic>r</italic>&#160;=&#160;0.77, <italic>P</italic>&#160;&lt;&#160;0.01). PI4KII&#945; knockdown greatly prolonged the effects and decreased the effective dosage of AG-1478, a specific inhibitor of EGFR. In addition, it significantly enhanced AG1478-induced inhibition of tumor cell survival and strengthened the effect of the EGFR-targeting anti-cancer drug Iressa in xenograft tumor models. Mechanistically, we found that PI4KII&#945; suppression increased EGFR ligand-independent degradation. Quantitative proteomic analysis by stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and LC-MS/MS suggested that HSP90 mediated the effect of PI4KII&#945; on EGFR. Furthermore, we found that combined inhibition of PI4KII&#945; and EGFR suppressed both PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways, and resulted in downregulation of multiple oncogenes like PRDX2, FASN, MTA2, ultimately leading to suppression of tumor growth. Therefore, we conclude that combined inhibition of PI4KII&#945; and EGFR exerts a multiple anti-tumor effect. Dual inhibition of EGFR at protein and activity level via combinatorial blocking of PI4KII&#945; presents a novel strategy to combat EGFR-dependent tumors.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s13238-014-0055-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase II&#945; (PI4KII&#945;)</kwd><kwd>EGFR</kwd><kwd>dual inhibition</kwd><kwd>enhanced anti-tumor effect</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>Iressa</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; HEP and Springer 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Phosphatidylinositol 4 kinase II&#945; (PI4KII&#945;) is the dominant PI4K in mammalian cells. It is mainly localized with the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network and endosomes (Lu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2012</xref>; Minogue and Waugh, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2012</xref>). The results of our previous study indicated that PI4KII&#945; is a novel regulator of tumor-related processes, including angiogenesis and HIF-1&#945; accumulation, by way of activating HER-2/PI3K and ERK cascades (Li et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2010</xref>). Other studies showed that PI4KII&#945; is involved in pathways related to tumor progression, for example, Pan et al. (Pan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2008</xref>) and Qin et al. (Qin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2009</xref>) reported that PI4KII&#945; is important for WNT signaling pathway; Chu et al., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2010</xref>) reported that PI4KII&#945; subtype specifically influences AKT activity. Christina et al. reported that inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II (INPP4B) is a tumor suppressor (Gewinner et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2009</xref>), indicating that the D-4 position phosphorylated productions of phosphatidylinositol (PI) are essential for tumor growth. All above suggest that PI4KII&#945; could be a promising target for cancer therapy. However, the application significance and molecular mechanisms behind these links remain unclear.</p><p>Previous reports have established the relationship between PI4KII&#945; and ERBB families: Scott et al., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1991</xref>) showed that PI4K activity increases after stimulation of the ERBB-2 (HER-2). Kauffmann-Zeh et al., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1994</xref>) reported that EGF regulates PI4KII&#945; activity and is associated with ERBB-1 (EGFR), and Minogue et al., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2006</xref>) demonstrated that PI4KII&#945; influences the endosomal trafficking of EGFR. Our own work demonstrated previously that knockdown of PI4KII&#945; drastically reduces HER-2 autophosphorylation (Li et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2010</xref>). The activation of ERBB families is involved in controlling diverse cellular responses such as proliferation, differentiation, motility, and apoptosis as well as tumorigenesis (Flynn et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2009</xref>; Harandi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2009</xref>; Tai et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2010</xref>).</p><p>Here we examined the regulatory mechanisms by which PI4KII&#945; controls EGFR protein levels, and tested the effect of dual inhibition of PI4KII&#945; and EGFR on tumor growth. We found that EGFR inhibition at both protein and activity level via combinatorial blocking of PI4KII&#945; proved superior as a strategy to suppress EGFR-dependent tumor growth. The combined anti-tumor mechanisms were also investigated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Regulation of HER-2 activity and EGFR protein levels by PI4KII&#945;</title><p>We have previously reported that the reduction in PI4KII&#945; level diminishes the autophosphorylation activity of HER-2, whilst its protein level remains unchanged (Li et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2010</xref>). Here we further indicated that the suppression of PI4KII&#945;, but not PI4KII&#946;, resulted in downregulation of HER-2 activity (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A), and this effect was reversed by direct delivery of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). Above results suggest this regulation is PI4KII&#945; subtype-specific and kinase activity dependent. Since PI4KII&#945; RNAi does not affect HER-2 expression, we wondered whether the effect of PI4KII&#945; on HER-2 activity instead interferes with the formation of HER-2/EGFR heterodimers, and the result shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C confirmed this suspicion. At the same time, we noted that the protein level of EGFR was much lower in PI4KII&#945; RNAi cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure&#160;1</label><caption><p>Effect of PI4KII&#945; knockdown on both HER-2 activity and HER-2/EGFR interaction.

In addition, PI4P could completely rescue the reduction of EGFR protein level induced by PI4KII&#945; knockdown (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). We further examined the effect of PI4KII&#945; on EGFR in two different primary isolated breast cancer cells (PIBC-1 and PIBC-2). As shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C, the regulatory connection between PI4KII&#945; and EGFR/p-HER-2 is also present in primary isolated breast cancer cells. Then we detected the expression of both proteins in 43 human breast cancer tissues, Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D shows the immunoblotting results of the expression of EGFR and PI4KII&#945; in representative human breast cancer samples and Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>E is a statistical analysis of all tested samples.

To investigate if the effect of PI4KII&#945; on EGFR protein level is dependent on HER-2 activity, we examined it in the HER-2 negative MDA-MB-231 cells. The results indicate that this effect is independent of HER-2 (Fig. S1A).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure&#160;2</label><caption><p>Regulation of EGFR protein levels by PI4KII&#945; knockdown.

To this end, we first investigated whether AG1478 (a specific EGFR inhibitor) is more efficient in PI4KII&#945; suppressed cells. As shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A, both AG1478 and PI4KII&#945; knockdown significantly suppressed HER-2 activity. Interestingly, even though AG1478 is removed from the cell culture medium after 12&#160;h, its inhibitory effect is retained in MCF-7 cells treated with PI4KII&#945; RNAi. In contrast, the inhibitory effects completely disappeared in the control samples. We then treated cells with a combination of PI4KII&#945; siRNA and 100&#160;nmol/L AG1478 for different times, and found that the effect of AG1478 was weakened after 6&#160;h of incubation in the control cells, but its effect remained the same in PI4KII&#945; RNAi cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). All above results indicate that PI4KII&#945; knockdown has the ability to extend the effective time of AG1478. Then we determined the effects of PI4KII&#945; suppression on AG1478 effective dosage, and as shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C, the effective dose of AG1478 was about 5&#160;nmol/L in control cells, while just 1&#160;nmol/L of AG1478 was sufficient to exhibit significant effects in PI4KII&#945; RNAi cells.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure&#160;3</label><caption><p>Ehanced effects of PI4KII&#945; knockdown and EGFR inhibition by AG1478 on HER-2 activity and cell viability.

As shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D, combined inhibition of PI4KII&#945; and EGFR was more effective in inhibiting cell viability compared to single application of either method in the three cell lines as indicated, in particular in NSCLC A549 cells and the triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB231 cells. Singular treatment with 5&#160;&#956;mol/L AG1478 reduced the number of viable A549 control cells by approximately 22.5%, but by more than 78% in combinational treated A549 cells. Addition of 5&#160;&#956;mol/L AG1478 resulted in approximately 50% inhibition of cell proliferation in PI4KII&#945; RNAi MDA-MB-231 cells, but showed no inhibitory effects at all in the control MDA-MB-231 cells. The enhanced effects were confirmed in primary isolated breast cancer cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>E), indicating that the observed effects are not limited to cell lines. Using a soft agar assay, we measured the enhanced effects of PI4KII&#945; knockdown and EGFR inhibitor on anchorage-independent growth of MCF-7 cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>F). 10&#160;&#956;mol/L AG 1478 yielded a reduction in cell colony formation by approximately 36%, and PI4KII&#945; knockdown reduced the number of colonies by approximately 67%. In contrast, combinatorial treatment achieved an 87% reduction in colony formation. Together, these results indicate that combined treatment with PI4KII&#945; siRNA could significantly enhance the AG1478 anti-tumor effects in cell level.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Combinatorial effects of PI4KII&#945; and EGFR on suppression of tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>To determine whether simultaneous inhibition of PI4KII&#945; and EGFR exhibited similar enhanced effects <italic>in vivo</italic>, xenograft models were used. As shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B, both Iressa (an EGFR targeted anti-tumor drug) treatment and PI4KII&#945; knockdown inhibited MCF-7 tumor growth, which is consistent with our previous results showing that downregulation of PI4KII&#945; results in nearly complete inhibition of MCF-7 cell-induced tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic> (Li et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2010</xref>). Following regular drug administration, Iressa alone showed about 47% inhibition of tumor growth as assessed by tumor volume. In comparison, when Iressa treatment was combined with PI4KII&#945; knockdown, tumor almost completely disappeared during the same time period. EGFR is known to be an important anti-tumor target for NSCLC treatment (Harandi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2009</xref>). Therefore, we investigated whether the cooperative therapeutic effects of PI4KII&#945; and EGFR inhibition also exist for A549-induced tumor. As shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>E, treatment with Iressa inhibited A549 cell-induced tumor growth by about 74%. In contrast, upon PI4KII&#945; knockdown in combination with Iressa, the A549 cell-induced tumor exhibited negligible signs of growth. Combined inhibition of PI4KII&#945; and EGFR displayed far superior anti-tumor traits than single drug use, both in terms of tumor volume and weight. Next, we detected PI4KII&#945; and EGFR expression in these tumors, and the results indicated that the expression level of EGFR was markedly decreased in PI4KII&#945; RNAi cell-induced tumors in both types of xenograft models (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>F).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure&#160;4</label><caption><p>Enhancing effects of PI4KII&#945; knockdown on anti-tumor activity of the EGFR inhibitor Iressa <italic>in vivo</italic>.

We then tested the effect of PI4KII&#945; knockdown on EGFR degradation. Leupeptin (lysosome inhibitor, Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A) was added into the PI4KII&#945; RNAi-treated cells, and it can partly rescue the effect of PI4KII&#945; knockdown on EGFR protein level. These results suggest that PI4KII&#945; regulates EGFR at least partially through the lysosome degradation pathway. To determine the molecules mediating the downregulation of EGFR, we performed quantitative proteomic analysis by employing stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) in combination with LC-MS/MS. Samples were prepared as described in the MATERIALS AND METHODS section and as shown in Fig. S3. A total of 252 targets were identified on the basis of the LC-MS/MS results (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B; Table S1). For instance, the heavy/light ratio of the heat shock protein HSP90AB1 (NM_007355) was approximately 0.52, indicating that PI4KII&#945; knockdown results in downregulation of HSP90AB1 protein levels. An earlier report showed that HSP90 interacts with EGFR and prevents its degradation (Sawai et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2008</xref>; Ahsan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2012</xref>), we therefore wondered whether HSP90 is providing a functional link between PI4KII&#945; and EGFR. To this end, we firstly confirmed the MS result by Western blot. As shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C, HSP90 was significantly downregulated in PI4KII&#945; RNAi-treated cells. Furthermore, HSP27 was observed to be upregulated, which is consistent with its assumed role as a downstream target of HSP90 (McCollum et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2006</xref>). Furthermore, enhanced effects of geldanamycin (GA, a specific inhibitor of HSP90) and PI4KII&#945; siRNA on the induction of ligand-free EGFR degradation were detected (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>D). Overexpression of HSP90AB1 in PI4KII&#945; RNAi-treated MCF-7 cells rescued the effects of PI4KII&#945; knockdown on EGFR (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>E). Thus, it can be assumed that the physiological role of PI4KII&#945; is at least partly dependent on HSP90.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure&#160;5</label><caption><p>Mechanisms for regulation of EGFR expression upon PI4KII&#945; knockdown.

To this end, we tested the effects of PI4KII&#945; knockdown on both PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways in two different cell lines, the EGFR-positive MCF-7 cells and the EGFR-negative MDA-MB-453 cells (Fig. S2B). In the MCF-7 cells, PI4KII&#945; knockdown suppressed both p-AKT and p-ERK1/2 level. When combined with an AG1478 treatment, the observed inhibitory effects were markedly enhanced (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A). In contrast, in MDA-MB-453 cells, PI4KII&#945; knockdown only decreased the level of p-AKT, but not those of p-ERK (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B), indicating that the effect of PI4KII&#945; on the MAPK pathway depends on EGFR function. It is well established that both PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways play important roles in regulation of a plethora of genes associated with tumor progression. In order to understand the precise gene targets involved in our combinatorial inhibition approach, we performed a quantitative comparison of protein targets in MCF-7 cells treated with or without combination treatment (PI4KII&#945; siRNA&#160;+&#160;10&#160;&#956;mol/L AG1478) by employing SILAC and LC-MS/MS (Fig. S3). A total of 348 proteins were identified (Table S2). We found, for instance, that 6 cancer-related targets changed their expression levels: HSPD1 (Ghosh et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2008</xref>), PARP1 (Cipak and Jantova, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>), XRCC5 (Yang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2008</xref>), PRDX2 (Stresing et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2013</xref>), MTA2 (Cui et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2006</xref>) and FASN (Zhou et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2003</xref>) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C). Four of them were validated by Western blot (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D). With the exception of HSPD1, all targets were downregulated upon combinatorial treatment, suggesting that it can suppress cancer cell survival by affecting the expression levels of these validated cancer-related target genes (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C). In conclusion, our results indicate that PI4KII&#945; knockdown reduces EGFR protein level in a degradation-dependent pathway, and the dual inhibition of EGFR protein level by PI4KII&#945; RNAi and EGFR activity by its specific small molecular inhibitors exerts superior outcomes for tumor therapy.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure&#160;6</label><caption><p>Signaling pathways and oncogenes affected by the combinatorial inhibition of both PI4KII&#945; and EGFR.

To overcome these drawbacks, combinatorial treatment involving multiple targets is an absolute imperative (Koppikar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2008</xref>; Ren et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2008</xref>; Martelli et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2012</xref>). In this study, we found that PI4KII&#945; could be an ideal combinatorial target for EGFR treatment via regulating EGFR degradation. Based on our experimental results, we propose a model for the combinatorial inhibition of EGFR and PI4KII&#945;: First, PI4KII&#945; knockdown inhibits the PI3K/AKT pathway directly (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>E, blue lines). Second, PI4KII&#945; promotes the degradation of EGFR in HSP90-dependent pathway, and the reduced EGFR expression then affects the activity of HER-2, and further suppresses both PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways (green lines). Third, EGFR inhibitors can further enhance weakening of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways (red lines). Therefore, combined inhibition of PI4KII&#945; and EGFR showed tripled anti-tumor effect (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>E). To our knowledge, this is the first report to shed a light on the superiority of the combined inhibition of PI4KII&#945; and EGFR as a new therapeutic anti-tumor strategy.</p><p>To date, EGFR is one of the most successful rational drug targets in clinical cancer therapy (Flynn et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2009</xref>). The clinical efficacy of anti-EGFR therapy has been confirmed for a growing number of cancer types, including breast, colon, pancreas, head and neck, renal and lung carcinomas (Harandi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2009</xref>). Therefore, the discovery of the specific regulator of EGFR should yield important insights for improved clinical application. At present, two main anti-EGFR approaches have been pursuit for clinical development, namely the use of monoclonal antibodies (mAb, e.g. Cetuximab and Panitumumab) and small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors (smTKIs, e.g.: Gefitinib, Erlotinib and Lapatinib). Antibodies compete with growth factor ligands and result in EGFR internalization and degradation, whilst the kinase inhibitors compete with ATP for binding to the tryrosine kinase portion of the receptor (Imai and Takaoka, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2006</xref>; Harandi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2009</xref>). However, both approaches exhibit serious limitations: the effect of smTKIs depends on the presence of certain mutant form of EGFR (For example: the single-point substitution mutation L858R in exon 21), however, this mutant form is only present in approximately 30%&#8211;50% of Asians and 10% of non-Asians (Shim et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2011</xref>; Kerr, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2013</xref>). Moreover, the efficacy of smTKIs in combination with chemotherapy or radiotherapy has been shown to be very low (Giaccone et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2004</xref>; Herbst et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2004</xref>; Harandi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2009</xref>). The anti-tumor effects of mAbs are restricted to only a fraction of patients, and also will disappear if the extracellular domain of EGFR becomes mutated during the genetic development of the tumor. Besides, mAbs drugs show several additional weaknesses in their clinical application: expensive, only be administered intravenously, and low efficiency in terms of tissue penetration, tumor retention and blood clearance (Imai and Takaoka, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2006</xref>). Thus, there is urgent clinical need to develop novel anti-EGFR approaches with improved therapeutic characteristics.</p><p>The effects of dual-reagent targeting of EGFR have been examined previously using pre-clinical models. Huang et al. (Huang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2004</xref>) and Matar et al. (Matar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2004</xref>) reported that Cetuximab (a mAb that causes EGFR degradation) in combination with either Gefitinib or Erlotinib showed enhanced inhibition of tumor cell growth when compared to the effects of either agent alone. Two other agents, for example, an HSP90 inhibitor and Gemcitabine, also enhance the effects of EGFR targeted smTKIs (Feng et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2007</xref>; Bartholomeusz et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2011</xref>; Ahsan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2012</xref>; Xu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2012</xref>). It is worth noting that all of the above-mentioned reagents share one feature with siRNA-induced PI4KII&#945; knockdown, namely promoting EGFR degradation (Feng et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2007</xref>; Harandi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2009</xref>; Ahsan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2012</xref>). We therefore predict that the enhanced effects on EGFR inhibition may be obtained not only through PI4KII&#945; or HSP90, but also through activation of other elements that induce EGFR degradation, for example Caspase 3 and Pnck activators (He et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2006</xref>; Deb et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2011</xref>). The dual suppression of EGFR protein and activity presents a promising avenue for EGFR-targeted therapies, with the advantage of improving efficiency, reducing side effects and lowering the effective dosage, while at the same time minimizing resistance. Taking these points into account, PI4KII&#945; is undoubtedly an ideal target for tumor therapy: (i) PI4KII&#945; knockdown increases EGFR degradation in a subtype-specific manner, since PI4KII&#945; is just one subtype within the PI4K family, specific downregulation of PI4KII&#945; is unlikely to induce complicated side effects, as other PI4K family members remain functional. Recently, Simons et al. have shown that mice with heterozygous deficiency of PI4KII&#945; do not display effects on life span (Simons et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2009</xref>). (ii) Apart from its effect on EGFR degradation, PI4KII&#945; inhibition directly interferes with the PI3K/AKT pathway, thus the combined inhibition of PI4KII&#945; and EGFR results in a triple anti-tumor effect (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>E).</p><p>In conclusion, we investigated the pivotal role of PI4KII&#945; in the regulation of EGFR protein levels, and our functional studies indicate that PI4KII&#945; represents a promising therapeutic target that could be used in combination with existing EGFR treatments used in breast cancer and NSCLC therapy. We propose that the inhibition of EGFR at the levels of expression and activity should be used as a new strategy, as it exhibits far superior results for EGFR-dependent tumor inhibition. Up to now, we have resolved the crystal structure of PI4KII&#945; (Zhou et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2014</xref>) and subtype-specific PI4KII&#945; inhibitor candidates based on rational design are currently screened for mimicking the effects observed here for PI4KII&#945; siRNA knockdown. Furthermore whether the inhibition of PI4KII&#945; and HER-2 also exits the combinatorial anti-tumor effect will be investigated in the future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Reagent, plasmids and antibodies</title><p>AG1478, and geldanamycin were purchased from R&amp;D Systems (Minneapolis, USA).
