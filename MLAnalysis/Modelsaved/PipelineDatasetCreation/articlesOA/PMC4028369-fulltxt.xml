We contrasted a natural enzyme, LovD, which acts on a protein-bound (LovF) acyl substrate, with a laboratory-generated variant that was transformed by directed evolution to accept instead a small free acyl thioester, and no longer requires the acyl carrier protein. The resulting 29-mutant variant is 1000-fold more efficient in the synthesis of the drug simvastatin than the wild-type LovD. This is the first non-patent report of the enzyme currently used for the manufacture of simvastatin, as well as the intermediate evolved variants. Crystal structures and microsecond molecular dynamics simulations revealed the mechanism by which the laboratory-generated mutations free LovD from dependence on protein-protein interactions. Mutations dramatically altered conformational dynamics of the catalytic residues, obviating the need for allosteric modulation by the acyl carrier LovF.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P3">Directed evolution encompasses iterative cycles of genetic diversification and screening to generate novel proteins with desired functions.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Due to the large number of mutations that are generally introduced to generate the dramatic increases sought after, deriving scientific insights from such experiments is difficult.

The acyl transfer reaction in the LovD active site proceeds via a ping-pong mechanism, involving a covalent acyl intermediate at Ser76 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The sequential acylation-deacylation reactions are promoted by acid/base catalysis involving hydrogen bonding and proton shuttling by catalytic residues Tyr188 and Lys79. Simvastatin, an important cholesterol-lowering agent, differs from the natural LovD product (lovastatin) by only one methyl group and was prepared by whole-cell biocatalysis by supplying cells with a non-natural acyl donor.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> However, wild-type LovD displayed poor activity towards the non-natural acyl donor.</p><p id="P5">Envisioning a potential enzymatic manufacturing route to simvastatin, laboratory-directed evolution was applied to transform LovD to a variant that accepts as a substrate the free unnatural acyl donor, &#945;-dimethylbutyryl-<italic>S</italic>-methylmercaptopropionate (DMB-SMMP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The improvement on the catalytic proficiency of the evolved enzymes was rationalized through structural comparisons of crystal structures of LovD and evolved variants and via molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

Over the nine rounds of evolution, diversity obtained from targeted NNK libraries or from homologous sequences was recombined. A total of 61,779 LovD variants were screened from an aggregate of 200 different libraries. In rounds 1 and 3 the best variants were identified from random mutagenesis libraries (L361M in round 1 and G275S in round 3); in all other rounds, the best variant was identified from combinatorial libraries and had 2 to 6 mutations.

As a consequence, as the enzyme evolves, the active site became inaccessible to potential binding proteins such as the ACP domain of LovF.

Therefore we analyzed the dynamics of several mutants along the evolutionary pathway at longer timescales (1&#8211;1.5 &#181;s) using the special purpose protein dynamics computer, ANTON.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p id="P11">MD simulations reproduced the shrinkage of the active site channel noted in the crystallographic structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>) of both LovD6 and LovD9 with respect to wild-type LovD. More significantly, in the simulations of the wild-type enzyme sequence, the apparently optimum catalytic conformation of the catalytic Ser76&#8211;Lys79&#8211;Tyr188 triad observed in the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>) underwent a rapid transition to an inactive conformation characterized by a very long Lys79&#8211;Tyr188 distance (~9 &#197;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>), which was maintained along the whole microsecond trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). In aqueous solution, the non-catalytic conformation of Tyr188 around &#967;<sup>1</sup> dihedral angle was stabilized by the neighboring residue Ile325, producing an unproductive hydrogen-bonded arrangement which differs dramatically from the one observed in the crystalline state. Simultaneously, the protein backbone at Tyr188 changes from an extended conformation (&#968; ~150&#176;) to a turn (&#968; ~50&#176;), which traps catalytic Lys79 in a non-productive conformation as well (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11a</xref>). Additional interactions not observed in the crystal structures, such as between Tyr327 and Gly364 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11b,c</xref>), create a completely different hydrogen bond network in the active site.</p><p id="P12">The first round of evolution (LovD1) introduced a single mutation (L361M), which was maintained in subsequent rounds of evolution. This residue is located in a &#946;-sheet 15&#197; from the &#945;-helix holding the active residue Ser76 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). In the simulations, this single mutation relative to the wild type sequence restored the Tyr188 backbone in its catalytic conformation and maintained it for about 300 ns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4c</xref>). Thereafter, the Tyr188 side chain underwent the same detrimental conformational change observed in the wild type LovD and remained in the inactive arrangement for an additional 800 ns before returning to the active conformation. Therefore, in LovD1 the arrangement of the catalytic triad was organized for catalysis about 30% of the simulation time, which agrees with the modest increase in activity measured for this enzyme. In LovD3, which displays a 10-fold increase in k<sub>cat</sub> compared to LovD, the correct arrangement of the catalytic triad was conserved ~56% of the simulation time, and the conformational change to the inactive arrangement occurs only after 800 ns. In LovD6 and LovD9, the catalytically active conformation of the Ser76&#8211;Tyr188&#8211;Lys79 triad was maintained during the whole simulations. The averaged Tyr188&#8211;Lys79 distance was, in both cases, close to the optimized QM value of 3.0 &#197; (3.6&#177;0.4, and 3.7&#177;0.7 &#197; for LovD6 and LovD9, respectively). As depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>, the progressive weakening of the detrimental interaction of Tyr188 with Ile325, and the subsequent restoration of the catalytic triad in the catalytic conformation, correlate with the increase in the activity of the enzyme in the absence of the LovF-ACP partner, especially in the initial stages of the evolution process. While LovD6 and LovD9 both maintain the catalytic triad in an optimal conformation, LovD9 showed a <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> ~3 times higher than that of LovD6 and is ~2-fold more productive in simvastatin synthesis, indicating that other factors beyond the active site configuration impact catalysis.</p><p id="P13">Besides L361M, other remote mutations in the &#946;-sheet region were found along the evolution trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). These buried mutations, all involving nonpolar and structurally similar residues, modify the protein backbone dynamics in such a way that the distance between the &#945;-carbons of Gly364 in the mutated &#946;-sheet and Tyr327, located in the same flexible loop as the catalytic Tyr188, was progressively reduced from 9.2&#177;0.4 &#197; in the wild-type to 7.6&#177;0.7 &#197; in LovD9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a&#8211;e</xref> shows how the multiple, often non-catalytic, arrangements of Tyr188 and Tyr327 in wild-type LovD became gradually more ordered in mutants LovD1, LovD3 and LovD6 and then localized in the optimal catalytic arrangement in LovD9, as a result of an apparent lowering of the free energy of the catalytic arrangement relative to the non-catalytic conformations. The progressive tightening of the second shell residues prevents Tyr188 from drifting into non-catalytic conformations, and as a consequence the catalytic activity of the triad is retained.</p><p id="P14">Thus, according to the MD simulations the catalytically-competent conformations predicted by QM calculations were progressively stabilized and appear with increasing frequency as a result of the dynamic effects of remote mutations on the active site residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>). The relative free energy of the catalytic conformation, reflected in the population observed in dynamics simulations, is lowered gradually during enzyme optimization.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Role of interprotein interactions in active site dynamics</title><p id="P15">As noted above, the crystal structures of different enzyme variants all showed a very similar, catalytically competent arrangement of the active site, irrespective of their catalytic proficiencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). MD models for the monomeric enzymes in solution showed wide variations in the population of these active site conformers as evolution progresses. A possible source of this different behavior is that associations of proteins in the crystalline state somehow influence the conformational states of the active site of LovD, in the same way that association of LovF-ACP influences the active site. The effects of protein-protein interactions on the structure and dynamics of the active site were analyzed by performing MD simulations on both the LovD dimer as observed in the crystal form, and the complex formed between LovD and the LovF acyl carrier domain (ACP). While a model for simulating the dynamics of the LovD dimer was directly available from the X-ray structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>), no structure of the LovD/LovF-ACP complex was available; complexes involving other modular synthases are likewise unresolved.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Computational models of LovD/LovF-ACP were therefore generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>), both including and lacking the 4'-phosphopantetheine (PPN) acylating group, using homology modelling and protein docking techniques.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> MD simulations demonstrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>) that protein-protein interactions lead to stabilization of the active site residues in an optimal catalytic conformation, which was conserved permanently in the LovD dimer, and for most of the simulation in the LovD/ACP complex. In the LovD dimer, the flexibility of Tyr188 was substantially reduced compared to the monomeric state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 15</xref>). The presence of a flexible loop (323&#8211;329) from another protein chain in the vicinity of the active site precluded the great distortion of the active site occurring in the monomer state in solution, although some mobility is still observed in the catalytic residues.</p><p id="P16">In the LovD-ACP complexes, the detrimental conformational change of Tyr188 side chain did not take place along the whole trajectory either (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 16</xref>). The distance between Tyr188 and Lys79 was reduced from 8.7&#177;0.5 &#197; for monomeric LovD to 3.7&#177;0.6 &#197; for LovD-ACP-PPN. In the case of LovD-ACP lacking the PPN group, Tyr188 was still very flexible and the Tyr188-Lys79 distance was elongated to 5.2&#177;1.6, indicating the key role of the PPN acylating arm to properly orient Tyr188 for catalysis. In agreement with the trend exhibited by the evolved LovD1&#8211;9 variants, the detrimental Tyr188-Ile324 interaction was elongated from 3.0&#177;0.8 &#197; in monomeric LovD to 6.8&#177;1.2 &#197; and 9.3&#177;1.5 &#197; for LovD-ACP and LovD-ACP-PPN, respectively. Interestingly, after 850 ns, the long acylating PPN arm abandoned the active site, and the Tyr188-Ile324 interaction was substantially reduced to approximately 7 &#197;, approaching the non-catalytic arrangement. The backbone arrangement of Tyr188 remained in an extended conformation in both LovD-ACP-PPN and LovD-ACP complexes. Overall, these simulations supported the important role protein-protein interactions play in stabilizing the active site of wild type LovD.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S6"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p id="P17">Enzymes may be improved as a result of various features, including lowering of the activation barrier (increasing <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>) and increasing substrate binding (lowering <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub>), but also protein expression, folding, stability, and other characteristics that do not directly relate to the intrinsic activity of the enzyme. Given the scattered distribution of mutations throughout the protein, the specific role of every mutation introduced in LovD1&#8211;9 cannot be assessed exactly; moreover, most of these positions are located far away from the active site. Based on their close location to the active site, mutations N191S, N191G, L192I (rounds 2&#8211;5) are likely to affect catalysis directly. These residues are situated at the end of an &#945;-helix nearby the catalytic triad (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 17a</xref>) and prevent the detrimental interaction between the long side chain amide group of the natural Asn191 and the backbone carbonyl of Tyr188. The role of the three other mutations located close to the active site (L174F, A178L, S172N) which also appear early in the evolutionary pathway (rounds 2&#8211;4) is more difficult to assess since they are located in flexible loops, and could be affecting catalysis indirectly. Alternatively, these three mutations may affect folding kinetics as they appear to be part of a loop structure that wraps around a second loop. Triggered by the first key L361M mutation, up to four modifications were made at four consecutive strands of the internal &#946;-sheet; three of them (V370I, A383V, I35L) were introduced sequentially at the last stages of the evolution process (rounds 5&#8211;8) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 17b</xref>). Such an evolution pattern where subsequent mutations are spatially adjacent to other mutations has been observed previously,<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and may increase enzyme stability through improved hydrophobic packing of the core. Another group of mutations (A247S, A9V, K26E, H404K, I4N, R28S) is located in the ACP-PPN binding motif (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 17b</xref>) hypothesized from our homology model/docking studies. This motif includes two antiparallel &#945;-helices flanked by flexible loops, and the mobile tail (residues 1&#8211;12) found to contribute to ACP binding in our MD simulations. These mutations often include charged residues and might disrupt the formation of the protein-protein complex occurring in the natural enzyme; the conserved mutation K26E,<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> which changes the electrostatic environment of this local domain drastically, is probably key to produce this effect. Finally, based on ProSAR analysis during the evolution work we believed that another set of late mutations (round 5&#8211;9) Q241M, A261V and A261H provide thermostability to the protein, and N43R, D96R, H404K reduce aggregation.</p><p id="P18">In natural LovD, the interaction with LovF-ACP plays a key role in ordering the active site for catalysis. The interaction with the ACP partner provides an induced fit to organize the catalytic triad. This interaction must be crucial for substrate specificity towards the acyl group bound to LovF. Such a mechanism suppresses LovD activity towards other acyl donors in the cell, such as those involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. Some remote LovD homologs, such as EstB,<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> are active on small molecule substrates, while LovD is prevented from reacting with these substrates because the catalytic machinery is not properly poised without binding to the LovF-ACP carrier. Distinct evolutionary pressures have apparently led to diverse enzymes in this superfamily having varied substrate specificities and dependencies on protein interactions. We used directed evolution to convert an enzyme in this family that is naturally activated by protein binding into one that does not require a protein partner for catalysis.</p><p id="P19">The influence of remote mutations on the free energy of the catalytic conformation of the active site were revealed in our study by long timescale all-atom unbiased simulations that illuminated how numerous mutations remote from the active site increased, by three orders of magnitude, the catalytic activity in an enzyme acting on an unnatural substrate. Directed evolution increases activity for the small molecule substrate DMP-SMMP by rendering the catalytic site organization independent of LovF-ACP. This was accomplished by distributed mutations that lower the free energy of the catalytic arrangement of the triad relative to non-catalytic arrangements. The dynamics that produce this type of preorganization<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> have been the focus of many investigations of enzyme catalysis.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> In previous studies, remote mutations introduced in dihydrofolate reductase have been shown to interfere with the network of protein motions coupled to the reaction coordinate.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> We have shown how mutations incorporated into LovD are the evolutionary response to increase activity when the protein partner LovF is absent. These findings showed how features of natural enzymes that are necessary for effective chemistry in the cell can be modified to provide more effective catalysts for a manufacturing setting. The influence of protein-protein interactions in natural enzymes must be compensated for in the engineering of new or improved biocatalysts by evolution or design.</p><p id="P20">The computational design of stable and functional enzymes is a longstanding and very challenging goal. Our approach is to learn how to predict beneficial mutations and to incorporate that understanding into the computational design process. Major achievements in enzyme engineering reported recently<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and the results reported here for LovD share a common and intriguing feature: many mutations leading to high activity are scattered remotely from the active site. By contrast, design protocols currently in use often involve manual reversion of second-shell mutations to the native residues, based on the idea that such mutations will be deleterious to folding. The results presented here demonstrated the crucial role that remote mutations can have on modulation of the catalytic proficiency of the active site by conformational changes transmitted throughout the protein backbone. Future design protocols will need to predict and allow remote mutations, evaluated by &#181;s MD. While computationally expensive, &#181;s MD simulations are capable of predicting the structural consequences of mutations, particularly how mutations remote from the active site can alter the active site geometry. Experience shows that precise control of catalytic group geometries at the ideal positions for catalysis is crucial for high activity, and the remote mutation/MD evaluation strategy is a way to build this into the computational design process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S8" specific-use="web-only"><title>ONLINE METHODS</title><sec id="S9"><title>Production of the LovD gene</title><p id="P22">The acyltransferase encoding gene <italic>lovD</italic> from wild-type <italic>Aspergillus terreus</italic> (GenBank AAD34555.1) was designed for expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> using standard codon optimization.
