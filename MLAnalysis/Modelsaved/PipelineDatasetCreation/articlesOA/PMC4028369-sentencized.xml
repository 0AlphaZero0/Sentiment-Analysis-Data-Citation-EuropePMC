</text></title><p id="P6"><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Through limited mutagenesis studies reported earlier, we evolved LovD to a simvastatin synthase, improving its kcat five-fold for the unnatural reaction.7 In subsequent experiments, nine rounds of directed evolution using ProSAR-based directed evolution technologies8 provided an enzyme that exhibits a turnover number of ~25,000 in cell lysates over the course of the reaction, representing an increase of three orders of magnitude compared to the natural enzyme, and thereby enabling large scale simvastatin manufacture9,10 (Online Methods). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>A summary of the mutations incorporated, the turnover numbers measured in cell lysates, and the kinetic data for the purified enzymes of rounds 1, 3, 6, and 9 are given in Table 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Over the nine rounds of evolution, diversity obtained from targeted NNK libraries or from homologous sequences was recombined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>A total of 61,779 LovD variants were screened from an aggregate of 200 different libraries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In rounds 1 and 3 the best variants were identified from random mutagenesis libraries (L361M in round 1 and G275S in round 3); in all other rounds, the best variant was identified from combinatorial libraries and had 2 to 6 mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>While the binding affinities (KM values) for the wild type LovD, LovD3 and LovD9 fell in a narrow range (within 0.2 to 0.5 mM), we indeed observed a dramatic increase of the kcat values. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, the kcat/KM value of LovD3 was more than 20 times higher than wild-type LovD, while those of LovD6 and LovD9 were around 230 and 330 times higher. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The optimized mutant, LovD9, contained 29 mutations resulting in a high reactivity towards the unnatural substrate (kcat/KM ~430 min−1 mM−1), and simultaneously showed complete loss of activity towards the natural α-methylbutyryl-ACP substrate. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The dimeric arrangements shared an overall similarity but were different in detail (Supplementary Fig. 4), and were presumed to be non-biological. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P8"><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The active site is gradually more buried in the evolved proteins, as shown in Fig. 2c–e. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously, the width of the substrate access channel was reduced throughout the evolutionary process, as indicated by the channel solvent-accessible volumes calculated for the X-ray structures of wild type LovD and LovD6 (Supplementary Fig. 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, as the enzyme evolves, the active site became inaccessible to potential binding proteins such as the ACP domain of LovF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>However, while this constriction explained the decrease in activity towards protein-bound α-methylbutyryl-ACP, the increase in activity toward DMP-SMMP presented an intriguing mystery. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P9"><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Despite the notable changes in the shape of the binding cleft (Supplementary Fig. 5 and 6), the crystal structures showed only very minor differences in the arrangement of the catalytic residues involved in the reaction (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The positions of both the backbone and side chain orientations of the key residues Lys79, Tyr188 and Ser76 are maintained in LovD, LovD6 and LovD9, and are very close to the optimum positions predicted from the quantum mechanical optimizations of the resting state (Fig. 3b) and the transition state for acylation of the serine residue (Fig. 3c). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P10"><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The minimal differences observed crystallographically between the active sites structures of LovD variants prompted us to explore MD simulations to analyze potential effects of remote mutations on the active site dynamics.12,13 Whereas LovD wild-type and some variants are dimers in the crystal form, the existence of a single peak in all gel filtration chromatography traces (Supplementary Fig. 8) and a single spot on all SDS-PAGE gels (Supplementary Fig. 9), both corresponding to a molecular weight of 46 kDa, indicated that all the LovD proteins were monomers in aqueous solution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Hence, monomeric forms of the LovD structure were extracted from the observed crystal structures and used for unbiased all-atom MD simulations including explicit water (Online Methods). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Picosecond or nanosecond simulations are generally not long enough to describe transitions between active and inactive protein conformations12, and in our studies nanosecond simulations similarly did not provide new insights (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Therefore we analyzed the dynamics of several mutants along the evolutionary pathway at longer timescales (1–1.5 µs) using the special purpose protein dynamics computer, ANTON.14–16 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P11"><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>MD simulations reproduced the shrinkage of the active site channel noted in the crystallographic structures (Supplementary Fig. 10) of both LovD6 and LovD9 with respect to wild-type LovD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>More significantly, in the simulations of the wild-type enzyme sequence, the apparently optimum catalytic conformation of the catalytic Ser76–Lys79–Tyr188 triad observed in the crystal structure (Fig. 4a) underwent a rapid transition to an inactive conformation characterized by a very long Lys79–Tyr188 distance (~9 Å, Fig. 4b), which was maintained along the whole microsecond trajectory (Fig. 4c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>In aqueous solution, the non-catalytic conformation of Tyr188 around χ1 dihedral angle was stabilized by the neighboring residue Ile325, producing an unproductive hydrogen-bonded arrangement which differs dramatically from the one observed in the crystalline state. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously, the protein backbone at Tyr188 changes from an extended conformation (ψ ~150°) to a turn (ψ ~50°), which traps catalytic Lys79 in a non-productive conformation as well (Supplementary Fig. 11a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Additional interactions not observed in the crystal structures, such as between Tyr327 and Gly364 (Supplementary Fig. 11b,c), create a completely different hydrogen bond network in the active site. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P12"><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>The first round of evolution (LovD1) introduced a single mutation (L361M), which was maintained in subsequent rounds of evolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>This residue is located in a β-sheet 15Å from the α-helix holding the active residue Ser76 (Fig. 2b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>In the simulations, this single mutation relative to the wild type sequence restored the Tyr188 backbone in its catalytic conformation and maintained it for about 300 ns (Fig 4c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, the Tyr188 side chain underwent the same detrimental conformational change observed in the wild type LovD and remained in the inactive arrangement for an additional 800 ns before returning to the active conformation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in LovD1 the arrangement of the catalytic triad was organized for catalysis about 30% of the simulation time, which agrees with the modest increase in activity measured for this enzyme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>In LovD3, which displays a 10-fold increase in kcat compared to LovD, the correct arrangement of the catalytic triad was conserved ~56% of the simulation time, and the conformational change to the inactive arrangement occurs only after 800 ns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>In LovD6 and LovD9, the catalytically active conformation of the Ser76–Tyr188–Lys79 triad was maintained during the whole simulations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>The averaged Tyr188–Lys79 distance was, in both cases, close to the optimized QM value of 3.0 Å (3.6±0.4, and 3.7±0.7 Å for LovD6 and LovD9, respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>As depicted in Supplementary Fig. 12, the progressive weakening of the detrimental interaction of Tyr188 with Ile325, and the subsequent restoration of the catalytic triad in the catalytic conformation, correlate with the increase in the activity of the enzyme in the absence of the LovF-ACP partner, especially in the initial stages of the evolution process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>While LovD6 and LovD9 both maintain the catalytic triad in an optimal conformation, LovD9 showed a kcat ~3 times higher than that of LovD6 and is ~2-fold more productive in simvastatin synthesis, indicating that other factors beyond the active site configuration impact catalysis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P13"><text><SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Besides L361M, other remote mutations in the β-sheet region were found along the evolution trajectory (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>These buried mutations, all involving nonpolar and structurally similar residues, modify the protein backbone dynamics in such a way that the distance between the α-carbons of Gly364 in the mutated β-sheet and Tyr327, located in the same flexible loop as the catalytic Tyr188, was progressively reduced from 9.2±0.4 Å in the wild-type to 7.6±0.7 Å in LovD9 (Supplementary Fig. 13). Fig. 5a–e shows how the multiple, often non-catalytic, arrangements of Tyr188 and Tyr327 in wild-type LovD became gradually more ordered in mutants LovD1, LovD3 and LovD6 and then localized in the optimal catalytic arrangement in LovD9, as a result of an apparent lowering of the free energy of the catalytic arrangement relative to the non-catalytic conformations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The progressive tightening of the second shell residues prevents Tyr188 from drifting into non-catalytic conformations, and as a consequence the catalytic activity of the triad is retained. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P14"><text><SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Thus, according to the MD simulations the catalytically-competent conformations predicted by QM calculations were progressively stabilized and appear with increasing frequency as a result of the dynamic effects of remote mutations on the active site residues (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The relative free energy of the catalytic conformation, reflected in the population observed in dynamics simulations, is lowered gradually during enzyme optimization. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P15"><text><SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>As noted above, the crystal structures of different enzyme variants all showed a very similar, catalytically competent arrangement of the active site, irrespective of their catalytic proficiencies (Fig. 3a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>MD models for the monomeric enzymes in solution showed wide variations in the population of these active site conformers as evolution progresses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>A possible source of this different behavior is that associations of proteins in the crystalline state somehow influence the conformational states of the active site of LovD, in the same way that association of LovF-ACP influences the active site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>The effects of protein-protein interactions on the structure and dynamics of the active site were analyzed by performing MD simulations on both the LovD dimer as observed in the crystal form, and the complex formed between LovD and the LovF acyl carrier domain (ACP). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>While a model for simulating the dynamics of the LovD dimer was directly available from the X-ray structure (Fig. 6a), no structure of the LovD/LovF-ACP complex was available; complexes involving other modular synthases are likewise unresolved.17,18 Computational models of LovD/LovF-ACP were therefore generated (Fig. 6b), both including and lacking the 4'-phosphopantetheine (PPN) acylating group, using homology modelling and protein docking techniques.19 MD simulations demonstrated (Fig. 6c) that protein-protein interactions lead to stabilization of the active site residues in an optimal catalytic conformation, which was conserved permanently in the LovD dimer, and for most of the simulation in the LovD/ACP complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>In the LovD dimer, the flexibility of Tyr188 was substantially reduced compared to the monomeric state (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Fig. 15). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>The presence of a flexible loop (323–329) from another protein chain in the vicinity of the active site precluded the great distortion of the active site occurring in the monomer state in solution, although some mobility is still observed in the catalytic residues. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P16"><text><SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>In the LovD-ACP complexes, the detrimental conformational change of Tyr188 side chain did not take place along the whole trajectory either (Supplementary Fig. 16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>The distance between Tyr188 and Lys79 was reduced from 8.7±0.5 Å for monomeric LovD to 3.7±0.6 Å for LovD-ACP-PPN. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>In the case of LovD-ACP lacking the PPN group, Tyr188 was still very flexible and the Tyr188-Lys79 distance was elongated to 5.2±1.6, indicating the key role of the PPN acylating arm to properly orient Tyr188 for catalysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>In agreement with the trend exhibited by the evolved LovD1–9 variants, the detrimental Tyr188-Ile324 interaction was elongated from 3.0±0.8 Å in monomeric LovD to 6.8±1.2 Å and 9.3±1.5 Å for LovD-ACP and LovD-ACP-PPN, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, after 850 ns, the long acylating PPN arm abandoned the active site, and the Tyr188-Ile324 interaction was substantially reduced to approximately 7 Å, approaching the non-catalytic arrangement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>The backbone arrangement of Tyr188 remained in an extended conformation in both LovD-ACP-PPN and LovD-ACP complexes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Overall, these simulations supported the important role protein-protein interactions play in stabilizing the active site of wild type LovD. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P17"><text><SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Enzymes may be improved as a result of various features, including lowering of the activation barrier (increasing kcat) and increasing substrate binding (lowering KM), but also protein expression, folding, stability, and other characteristics that do not directly relate to the intrinsic activity of the enzyme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Given the scattered distribution of mutations throughout the protein, the specific role of every mutation introduced in LovD1–9 cannot be assessed exactly; moreover, most of these positions are located far away from the active site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Based on their close location to the active site, mutations N191S, N191G, L192I (rounds 2–5) are likely to affect catalysis directly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>These residues are situated at the end of an α-helix nearby the catalytic triad (Supplementary Fig. 17a) and prevent the detrimental interaction between the long side chain amide group of the natural Asn191 and the backbone carbonyl of Tyr188. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>The role of the three other mutations located close to the active site (L174F, A178L, S172N) which also appear early in the evolutionary pathway (rounds 2–4) is more difficult to assess since they are located in flexible loops, and could be affecting catalysis indirectly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, these three mutations may affect folding kinetics as they appear to be part of a loop structure that wraps around a second loop. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Triggered by the first key L361M mutation, up to four modifications were made at four consecutive strands of the internal β-sheet; three of them (V370I, A383V, I35L) were introduced sequentially at the last stages of the evolution process (rounds 5–8) (Supplementary Fig. 17b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Such an evolution pattern where subsequent mutations are spatially adjacent to other mutations has been observed previously,11 and may increase enzyme stability through improved hydrophobic packing of the core. </plain></SENT>
