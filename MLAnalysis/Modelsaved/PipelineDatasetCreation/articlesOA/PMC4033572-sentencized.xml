<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The use of MRI in clinical practice has had a particularly notable impact on the investigation of patients with axial spondyloarthritis (SpA). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Prior to MRI, there was reliance on radiographs as the most important imaging tool for identifying patients with sacroiliitis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>With MRI, inflammation in the axial skeleton can now be visualized even in the absence of radiographic damage (7,8). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) has established classification standards for patients with axial SpA, including patients with and without radiographic sacroiliitis (9,10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The imaging arm of the ASAS criteria requires the presence of sacroiliitis on MRI or radiography in addition to 1 SpA feature for patients with chronic low back pain with the onset of back pain at age ≤45 years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Positive MRI findings for sacroiliitis characteristic of SpA were further defined by the ASAS/Outcome Measures in Rheumatology MRI working group as the presence of bone marrow edema highly suggestive of SpA, with &gt;1 bone marrow edema lesion on a single slice or 1 bone marrow edema lesion present on at least 2 consecutive slices (11). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The ASAS classification criteria for axial SpA were specifically developed to facilitate the conduct of clinical trials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Fulfillment of the imaging arm of the criteria takes into account the presence of MRI-documented inflammation only in the sacroiliac (SI) joints, but not in the spine (10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In daily clinical practice, MRI findings can be useful in confirming a clinical diagnosis of nonradiographic axial SpA and detecting objective evidence of active inflammation in patients with an established diagnosis of nonradiographic axial SpA (7,8). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Of the 130 patients diagnosed as having axial SpA who underwent MRI of the SI joints and spine, only 5.4% had active inflammation in the spine but not in the SI joints (10). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>The findings described in this report confirm previously published data and add new insights to the growing body of literature on MRI in axial SpA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>We showed that among patients with active nonradiographic axial SpA as defined by BASDAI and total back pain scores, spinal inflammation on MRI may be observed in half of those without MRI evidence of SI joint inflammation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Sex differences were noted in MRI findings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>More males were in the subgroup with MRI evidence of inflammation of both the spine and SI joints at study entry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>An observation that has important clinical relevance is the finding that SPARCC spine MRI scores correlated with symptom duration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>Only approximately one-third of patients in this study with bone marrow edema in the spine regardless of the presence or absence of sacroiliitis seen on MRI had symptom duration of &lt;5 years, but approximately two-thirds of patients had symptom duration of ≥5 years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Previous studies in patients with duration of axial SpA symptoms of &lt;5 years and MRI evidence of either SI joint or spine inflammation have shown lower percentages of patients with MRI evidence of spine inflammation than in our study (20,21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Although the patient populations in those studies were somewhat different from our patient population, the data suggest that MRI evidence of spine inflammation in the absence of MRI evidence of SI joint inflammation may not be a lesser concern in patients with shorter symptom duration. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>The small but significant negative correlation noted between the SPARCC SI joint score and the BASDAI is most likely a chance finding; this is underscored by a lack of correlation of baseline SPARCC SI joint and spine scores with other baseline clinical disease activity measures in nonradiographic axial SpA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>This is generally consistent with previous reports in patients with axial SpA (22–25). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>However, the lack of correlation with CRP level is surprising (22–25) and indicates that both CRP level and MRI findings should be considered in the evaluation for active disease in patients with nonradiographic axial SpA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>The distribution of DVU involvement along the spine in our study population confirms previous findings that the thoracic and lumbar regions of the spine are the areas most frequently affected by inflammation in axial SpA (26–29). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>This study has several limitations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>The study population had longstanding nonradiographic axial SpA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>The scope of the analyses did not include evaluation of correlation of MRI findings with treatment response or change in disease activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>We used a definition of positive MRI evidence of active inflammation in the spine—a SPARCC spine score of ≥2—that has not been previously validated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>The analyses were focused on evaluating MRI evidence of active inflammation in the spine and SI joints in patients with established nonradiographic axial SpA that is clinically active. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the findings and conclusions do not necessarily address the approach to imaging used in clinical practice when making a diagnosis of axial SpA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Typically, the SI joints are imaged first in the diagnostic evaluation of a patient in whom axial SpA is suspected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>An important question for clinicians is whether imaging of the spine should be performed if the SI joint scan does not reveal axial SpA but the disease is strongly suspected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>This study was not designed to address that important question. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>There was also no group of patients without axial SpA who served as a control for this exercise. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>In summary, spinal inflammation without evidence of SI joint inflammation on MRI was observed in patients with longstanding nonradiographic axial SpA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to confirm these findings in patients with nonradiographic axial SpA with shorter symptom duration and to investigate the optimal use of SI joint and spine MRI in clinical practice for monitoring disease activity and response to therapy. </plain></SENT>
