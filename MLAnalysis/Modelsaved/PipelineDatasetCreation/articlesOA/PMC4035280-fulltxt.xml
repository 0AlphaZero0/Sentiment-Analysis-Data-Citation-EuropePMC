We have previously demonstrated that the CBX7 gene is drastically down-regulated in thyroid carcinomas and its expression progressively decreases with malignant grade and neoplastic stage <xref rid="pone.0098295-Pallante1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Moreover, further studies have shown that the correlation of the loss of CBX7 with a highly malignant phenotype and a consequent poor prognosis is a general event in oncology. In fact, the loss of CBX7 expression has been recently shown to be associated with increasing malignancy grade in colon <xref rid="pone.0098295-Pallante2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, bladder <xref rid="pone.0098295-Hinz1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, pancreatic <xref rid="pone.0098295-Karamitopoulou1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, breast <xref rid="pone.0098295-Mansueto1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, gastric <xref rid="pone.0098295-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and lung carcinoma <xref rid="pone.0098295-Forzati1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, whereas the retention of CBX7 expression correlates with a longer survival of the colon and pancreatic cancer patients <xref rid="pone.0098295-Pallante2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098295-Karamitopoulou1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The restoration of CBX7 expression in thyroid, gastric and colon carcinoma cell lines inhibits cell growth with an accumulation of the cell population in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, suggesting a negative role of CBX7 in the control of the G1/S transition of the cell cycle.</p><p>It has been recently demonstrated that CBX7 is able to positively regulate the expression of the gene encoding the E-cadherin <xref rid="pone.0098295-Federico1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> that is known to play a critical role in maintaining normal epithelial cell morphology, and whose loss of expression represents a general feature of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition <xref rid="pone.0098295-Thiery1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098295-Thiery2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In fact, it has been shown that CBX7 is able to preserve the expression of E-cadherin by interacting with histone deacetylase 2 and inhibiting its activity on the CDH1 promoter <xref rid="pone.0098295-Federico1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Consistently, a direct correlation between the levels of E-cadherin and CBX7 expression has been reported in thyroid and pancreatic carcinomas <xref rid="pone.0098295-Karamitopoulou1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098295-Federico1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Therefore, these results would suggest that the loss of the CBX7 gene expression may play a critical role in the late stages of human carcinoma progression.</p><p>The tumour suppressor role of CBX7 has been very recently confirmed by the phenotype of cbx7 knockout mice. Indeed, these mice develop liver and lung adenomas and carcinomas, and accordingly, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from the cbx7 knockout mice have a higher growth rate and a reduced susceptibility to senescence than their wild type counterparts <xref rid="pone.0098295-Forzati1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Cyclin E overexpression, due to the lack of cbx7 that negatively regulates its expression, likely accounts for the phenotype of the cbx7 knockout mice. A similar mechanism is likely involved in human lung carcinogenesis since Cyclin E up-regulation, associated with the loss of CBX7 expression, has been observed in most of the human lung carcinomas analyzed <xref rid="pone.0098295-Forzati1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>The aim of the present study has been to investigate other mechanisms by which the loss of CBX7 expression may contribute to the appearance of a highly malignant phenotype. We first generated six thyroid carcinoma cell clones in which the expression of CBX7 has been restored, then, by using the powerful oligonucleotide microarray hybridization technique, we analysed the gene expression profile of the FRO cell line in which the expression of CBX7 was restored, compared to the same cell line not expressing CBX7.</p><p>We found that CBX7 was able to positively regulate 120 genes and negatively regulate 196 genes. Among them, we identified several specific effector genes, such as SPP1 (encoding the osteopontin protein), whose function is known to be essential for the acquisition of a fully malignant phenotype. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that CBX7 protein directly binds to the promoters of these regulated genes and functional studies confirmed that CBX7 expression was able to modulate the promoters of the CBX7-regulated genes. Finally, quantitative RT-PCR analyses showed an inverse correlation between CBX7 and its down-regulated genes and a positive correlation with its up-regulated ones in human thyroid and lung carcinoma samples at different degree of malignancy.</p><p>Taken together, the data reported here indicate that CBX7 negatively or positively controls the expression of several genes coding for proteins having a critical role in human cancer progression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Microarray analysis</title><p>GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), consisting of 764,885 probe sets covering over 28,869 genes, was used to evaluate genes differentially expressed.

<bold>Correlation between CBX7 and CBX7-regulated genes in human lung carcinomas.</bold>
<bold>A</bold>) The expression of CBX7, FOS, FOSB, EGR1, SPP1, SPINK1 and STEAP1 evaluated by qRT-PCR in lung carcinomas was reported as box and whiskers distribution (min to max). Each box depicted comprises 50% of samples (from 25% percentile to 75% percentile) and its width indicates the distribution of the samples. Whiskers indicate the minimum and the maximum value. The horizontal lane in the box represents the median value of each sample, above or below which, there are 50% of samples. Results are expressed as Fold Change with respect to a pool of normal samples which were set equal to 1. The range of variability of CBX7 and CBX7-regulated gene expression in normal lung tissues was less than 10%. <bold>B</bold>) Correlation (Pearson r) was evaluated between the expression of CBX7 and CBX7-regulated genes in lung carcinomas.
