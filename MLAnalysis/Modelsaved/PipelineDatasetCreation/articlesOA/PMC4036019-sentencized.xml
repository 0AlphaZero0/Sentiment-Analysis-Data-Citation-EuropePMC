<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because of its poor solubility in water (only 60 mg L−1 at 20°C), its excretion as a nontoxic solid minimizes water loss. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Not merely regarded as nitrogenous waste, UA is apparently utilized as a nitrogen source or metabolic reserve in some insects, particularly those existing on a nitrogen-poor diet (e.g.6, 10, 18, 44). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Wood-feeding termites store UA in their fat bodies and transfer it via Malpighian tubules to the hindgut, where gut microbiota recycle UA nitrogen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Termite tissues lack uricase or any UA utilizing activity, whereas gut microbiota degrade UA and consequently the feces of termites contain only small amounts of UA (43, 44). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>UA degradation in the termite gut is an anaerobic process responsible primarily for gut bacteria (44). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>It is estimated that an amount of uric acid nitrogen equivalent to 30% of the total nitrogen in an average termite colony may be recycled or redistributed annually through the action of gut uricolytic bacteria (3, 44). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Besides the decomposition and utilization of cellulose and acquisition of new nitrogen by fixation of atmospheric N2, the recycling of UA nitrogen is an important and significant aspect of the symbiosis with gut microbiota (3, 4). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Anaerobic uricolytic bacteria were successfully detected on the BHIU plate from eight termite species at rates ranging 0.1 to 48.6% CFU (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>They corresponded to the population level of 2.1×103 to 4.0×104 cells per gut except in the case of Neotermes koshunensis (1.1×106 cells per gut). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Because of the low culturability of gut bacteria (0.6% to 13% of total gut bacteria (37, 50)), isolated uricolytic bacteria seem to represent mere minor populations in the guts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, diverse uricolytic bacteria were identified in this study (see below). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>A soil-feeding termite Pericapritermes nitobei (Termitidae) was also examined, but uricolytic bacteria were not obtained, probably because its food (soil organic matter) is rich in nitrogenous compounds and recycling of UA is less significant in this termite. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>The uricolytic isolates were taxonomically classified, and 16 different species were identified (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>They were classified into any of the three bacterial groups Clostridia, Enterobacteriaceae (Gammaproteobacteria), and low G+C Gram-positive cocci (Bacilli). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first report for the isolation of uricolytic bacteria in Clostridia from termite guts, although a variety of Clostridia strains have been isolated (for reviews, see references 3, 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Bacteria related to S. termitidis (belonging to Fusobacteria) could not be isolated in this study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Strains belonging to Clostridia occurred in six of the eight examined termite species (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence, they were classified into five species in any of the clusters XIVa, XI, and I of clostridia, as defined by Collines et al.(5) (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Species represented by strain NkU-1 (cluster XIVa) were common to three termite species and occurred frequently among uricolytic isolates from Hodotermopsis sjoestedti. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Species represented by strain Cd6 (cluster XIVa), which occurred commonly in two termites and frequently among uricolytic isolates from Nasutitermes takasagoensis, were closely related to C. sphenoides and C. celerecrescens (each 99.9% identity). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Indeed, type strains of these two Clostridium species degraded UA in the BHIU plate medium as much as strains NkU-1 and Cd6 (determined by clear zone formation), whereas those of C. xylanolyticum and C. aerotorelance did not (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>All of the isolates in Clostridia were distantly related to well-studied UA-degrading Clostridium species, C. acidiurici, C. purinolyticum (both belonging to cluster XII), and C. cylindrosporum (forms a unique lineage near cluster I or II) (45, 49, 57). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>From avian ceca, phenotypically diverse uricolytic bacteria are isolated and many apparently belong to Clostridia(1, 48), although most were distinct from the isolates in this study and classified into the genus Eubacterium or Peptostreptococcus. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>From R. speratus, various anaerobic bacteria affiliated to the genera Enterobacter, Clostridium, Lactococcus, Bacillus, and Bacteroides were isolated in addition to previously reported Disgonomonas sp. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, only Enterobacter sp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>(strain RsN-1) could degrade UA on the BHIU plate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>The isolates in Clostridium and Lactococcus from R. speratus corresponded to completely different species from the uricolytic strains from other termites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Lactococcus spp. are those of major culturable bacteria in termite guts, but only a few among numerous isolates have demonstrated UA-degrading ability (2, 41, 50); therefore, UA degraders were sporadically distributed in phylogenetically diverse culturable anaerobic bacteria even in the same genus (i.e. Lactococcus or Clostridium). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>The degradation of UA was initially examined in liquid culture in several strains. Clostridium sp. strain NkU-1, its closely related three strains from the same termite, and Lactococcus sp. strain Cd31 degraded UA almost completely, whereas Enterococcus sp. strain Cd23, Enterobacter sp. strains GfU-1, and its close relative isolated from the same termite degraded UA only partially (56%, 31%, and 12% of added UA after 4 days culture, respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Incomplete UA degradation is quite a similar phenomenon to those reported previously for isolates from the termite gut (41, 42). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Indeed, in the case of strain UAD-1 (originally described as group N Streptococcus sp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>(41) but our preliminary analysis indicated that it belonged to the genus Enterococcus), incomplete degradation of UA has been shown unless formate or a formicogenic substrate as a reductant is present in the medium (42). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>The previously isolated strain of Citrobacter sp. degrades only a small amount of UA in liquid culture, although it forms a prominent clear zone in plate medium and the degradation of UA on the plate is verified (41, 42). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Strain NkU-1 represents one of the most common uricolytic bacteria, it degraded UA well in liquid culture, and the physiology of related species from the termite gut has not been characterized so far. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Thus, the following taxonomic and nutritional investigations focused on this strain. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>The cells of strain NkU-1 were motile, peritrichous, straight rods, 2.0–4.0×0.8–1.0 μm, and often occurred in short chains in the log growth phase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Spores were oval and terminal or subterminal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>A major fermentation product from glucose (PYG medium) was acetate (73%), but formate, propionate, and butylate were also detected (10.1–4.8%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>The temperature for optimum growth was 35°C and optimum pH for growth was 7.2; the specific growth rate was 0.71 μ per hour under the optimal condition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Catalase, oxidase, and urease were negative. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Indol was produced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Strain NkU-1 utilized a variety of carbohydrates and produced acids from glucose, mannitol, lactose, saccharose, maltose, salicin, xylose, arabinose, gelatin, esculin, glycerol, cellobiose, mannose, melezitose, raffinose, rhamnose, and trehalose, but not from sorbitol. </plain></SENT>

C. saccharolyticum and C. amygdalium showed 98.9% identity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>The sequence of strain NkU-1 showed less than 98.6% identity to the other species. C. saccharolyticum shows similar characteristics, utilizing a variety of carbohydrates to strain NkU-1, but differs in that it is negative in Gram staining, is non-motile, and has no flagella (26). C. amygdalium is moderately thermophilic (optimum temperature 45°C) and shows a narrower spectrum of carbohydrate utilization (45). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>In addition, G+C content of C. saccharolyticum and C. amygdalium (28 and 32%, respectively) is lower than that of strain NkU-1 (41.1±1.2%; n=4); therefore, strain NkU-1 likely corresponds to a novel species in the clostridia cluster XIVa, although further study, such as measuring DNA relatedness, is necessary. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>The result indicated that strain NkU-1 did not utilize UA as a sole carbon and energy source. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>Strain NkU-1 efficiently utilized UA as a nitrogen source when these carbon sources were supplied (Table 3), and UA served as a good nitrogen source as ammonium chloride and ammonium sulfate (data not shown). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Time course and dose-effect analyses (Fig. 2) confirmed the dependence of UA degradation on cell growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Only a low level of NH3 was excreted at the vigorously growing stage of the cells (Day 1) or at a low level of UA supply (1.5 or 3.0 mM) because nitrogen of degraded UA could be first assimilated into growing cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Taking this amount of nitrogen into consideration (calculated based on the ratio between the increase of protein from Days 0 to 1 and the amount of nitrogen of degraded UA minus excreted NH3 at Day 1), entire recovery of UA nitrogen was obtained as excreted NH3 at the later stage of cell growth (98% and 106% at Days 3 and 4, respectively); therefore, strain NkU-1 likely produced a stoichiometric amount of NH3 by UA degradation (4 mol NH3 from 1 mol UA). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>In addition to UA, purine, hypoxanthine, guanine, and xanthine, and the corresponding ribonucleotides to the latter three (inosine, guanosine, and xantosine) stimulated the cell growth of strain NkU-1 (OD and protein concentration (mg mL−1) ranged from 0.90 to 0.95 and 0.11 to 0.15, respectively, after three days culture) in otherwise growth-limiting, carbon-rich but nitrogen-poor GY medium (OD and protein reached only 0.36 and 0.04, respectively). </plain></SENT>

</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Significance of the isolates and symbiotic UA recycling </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>A unique feature of strain NkU-1 with respect to UA utilization is that it apparently does not use UA as a carbon and energy source, which is in clear contrast to that of previous isolates from the gut of R. flavipes and three purinolytic clostridia species; they utilize UA as a carbon and energy as well as nitrogen source and UA increases the cell yield when incorporated into growth-limiting media (41, 42, 49). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Because carbohydrates derived from plant matter are rich in the gut environment and strain NkU-1 can utilize many of them, there is less demand for UA as a carbon and energy source. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>As opposed to the purinolytic clostridia, none of the isolates from termite guts show an absolute requirement of UA for growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Strain NkU-1 likely utilizes various purines as a nitrogen source as in the cases of purinolytic clostridia species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>The previously isolated strain UAD-1 utilizes only UA effectively, whereas the other examined strains display rather broader versatilities of purines (41). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Although the limited versatility reasonably relates to the UA-forming ability of the host termites, as discussed previously (41), the ecological significance of the difference of the versatility of purines is unclear. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>A common feature of strain NkU-1 with previous isolates from the termite gut is the excretion of NH3 as the major product of UA degradation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>As discussed previously (41, 44), NH3 produced by UA degradation can be cycled back to the host insect tissue directly or indirectly after assimilation by gut microbiota. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>For the latter scheme, some behaviors of host termites such as proctodeal trophallaxis (the exchange of hindgut content among nestmates), necrophagy, and cannibalism likely play important roles (7, 21, 55). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Cockroaches also stored UA in their fat bodies and utilization of uric acid nitrogen by intracellular symbionts (Blattabacterium sp.) has been hypothesized (6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>In the genome sequence of the Blattabacterium symbiont, however, there is no candidate gene for uricolytic enzymes (47), suggesting that the symbiont does not play a role, at least in the initial step of UA utilization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>One of the plausible alternative explanations is the recycling of UA by gut bacteria as in the case of termites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>In a shield bug, bacteria localized extracellularly in the lumen of a specialized structure (so-called swollen crypt) in the midgut (15) have been demonstrated to be responsible for uricolysis during a prereproductive non-feeding period of the host, although associated uricase activity is emphasized (18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Therefore, UA recycling by gut bacteria seems to be a general mechanism for the conservation of nitrogen in terrestrial insects, particularly whose natural diets are low in combined nitrogen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Many insects depend on plant materials and they usually suffer from poverty of nitrogen sources. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, yeast-like endosymbionts of planthoppers have been demonstrated to be involved in uric acid recycling, although the related yeast-like symbionts of aphids are not (10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>More extensive investigations of the nature of symbiotic recycling of UA in insects are ecologically very important. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Because most studies on anaerobic microbial degradation of UA were conducted more than three decades ago, modern molecular studies are anticipated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Approaches using functional key genes such as nifH, nirK, and amoA are clearly powerful tools for studies on nitrogen cycles in certain environments (e.g. 19, 22, 23, 25, 40, 46, 62, 63) as well as in the termite-gut microbial community (20, 28, 29, 34, 36, 59), but anaerobic UA degradation has not been well-defined genetically; no key gene for this process has been identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Although experiments with stable isotope measuring or labeling (e.g. 24, 55) may be applicable, the isolation and characterization of anaerobic UA-degrading bacteria are of special significance for further physiological, biochemical, and genome studies, as generally discussed for as-yet-uncultured but ecologically important microorganisms (27, 31). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>The strains isolated in this study will be very useful for these future studies. </plain></SENT>
