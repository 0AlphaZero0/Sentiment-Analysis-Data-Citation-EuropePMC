However, the mechanisms that mediate their function and the composition of the variant-containing chromatin are still largely unknown. A proteomic interrogation of chromatin containing the different H2A variants macroH2A.1.2, H2A.Bbd and H2A revealed a strikingly different protein composition. Gene ontology analysis reveals a strong enrichment of splicing factors as well as components of the mammalian replisome in H2A.Bbd-containing chromatin. We find H2A.Bbd localizing transiently to sites of DNA synthesis during S-phase and during DNA repair. Cells that express H2A.Bbd have a shortened S-phase and are more susceptible to DNA damage, two phenotypes that are also observed in human Hodgkin's lymphoma cells that aberrantly express this variant. Based on our experiments we conclude that H2A.Bbd is targeted to newly synthesized DNA during replication and DNA repair. The transient incorporation of H2A.Bbd may be due to the intrinsic instability of nucleosomes carrying this variant or a faster chromatin loading. This potentially leads to a disturbance of the existing chromatin structure, which may have effects on cell cycle regulation and DNA damage sensitivity.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Chromatin consists of an equal mass of DNA and histone proteins and is bound by a plethora of associated factors (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1&#8211;6</xref>). The fundamental unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, a structure that contains 147 bp of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer made up by the four core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. Individual nucleosomes can differ from each other by a multitude of post-translational modifications and by the incorporation of distinct histone variants. Whereas relatively few variants for H4 and H2B are known, most eukaryotes have several isoforms of H3 and H2A (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Canonical histones, which constitute the majority of the histones in a cell, are incorporated during S-phase whereas most histone variants are assembled independently of DNA synthesis. Genome-wide association studies in various organisms demonstrate a non-random association of histone variants across the genome (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) suggesting a possible function in setting up defined chromatin structures.</p><p>The structure of chromatin can undergo massive and global rearrangements during cellular differentiation (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9&#8211;12</xref>), which are often accompanied by a substantial difference in the chromatin composition. Changes in chromatin structure and nuclear morphology are frequently observed during oncogenic transformation and are often used as diagnostic markers. In this light it is noteworthy that the overexpression of specific histone variants has recently been shown to be a hallmark of several cancer types. The gene encoding the replication-independent H3.3 variant for example has been found to carry a driving mutation in paediatric glioblastoma (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The two prevalent mutations result in a disturbed modification of H3K27 and/or H3K36 presumably causing a mis-regulation of epigenetic marks. The centromeric H3 variant CENP-A on the other hand is overexpressed in primary colorectal cancers, which leads to a mistargeting of this variant (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) resulting in mitotic defects and an increase in aneuploidy, a hallmark of cancerous cells (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Besides H3, several H2A variants have also been shown to be mis-regulated in cancer (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17&#8211;20</xref>). The two most divergent H2A variants H2A.Bbd and macroH2A show a striking dichotomy when it comes to their involvement in cancer: whereas H2A.Bbd RNA is overexpressed in strongly proliferating Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) cells (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), the expression of macroH2A significantly suppresses melanoma progression (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). These findings suggest that the two variants may have opposing properties in regulating cellular physiology.</p><p>MacroH2A has been named after its large C-terminal macro domain (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Initially it was shown to be enriched on the inactive female X-chromosome in mammals (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) but has later been shown to also localize to large autosomal domains (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1&#8211;3</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24&#8211;26</xref>). MacroH2A stabilizes nucleosome core particles (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and interferes with the remodeling activity of the SWI/SNF complex (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Consistent with a rather repressive function, macroH2A mostly localizes to heterochromatic regions and correlates with H3K27me3-rich regions (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). H2A.Bbd preferentially binds H4 hyperacetylated regions and was named Barr body-deficient according to its striking exclusion from the inactive female X-chromosome when expressed ectopically (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). H2A.Bbd-containing nucleosomes organize less DNA and are less stable than canonical nucleosomes (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The mouse genome contains four genes encoding putative homologues of H2A.Bbd termed H2A.Lap1&#8211;4 (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The H2A.Lap1 isoform is expressed in testis and brain and localizes to the transcription start sites of active genes in round spermatids where it can even localize to the inactive X-chromosome (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). When ectopically expressed in HeLa cells, H2A.Bbd is enriched on active genes where it is involved in transcriptional activation and mRNA processing (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). This potential role of H2A.Bbd in transcriptional activation and splicing regulation may have important implications in HL cells that express increased levels of H2A.Bbd and also show an increased mobilization of transposable elements (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).</p><p>Despite a large body of work with regard to the structure and localization of nucleosomes carrying these two histone variants, surprisingly little is known about their function under physiological or pathophysiological conditions. Mice lacking both macroH2A genes are viable and fertile (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39&#8211;41</xref>) but their somatic cells are more susceptible to epigenetic remodeling compared to wild type suggesting that this histone variant acts as a barrier to induced pluripotency (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Mice lacking the H2A.Bbd homologues H2A.lap1&#8211;4 have not been reported so far but the testis-specific expression pattern suggests a role of this histone variant during male gametogenesis (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). In order to better understand the role of H2A.Bbd upon expression in somatic cells and its role during tumor progression, we ectopically expressed the H2A.Bbd variant in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and analyzed the composition of chromatin domains containing H2A.Bbd by comparing it to domains that either contained canonical H2A or the differentially localizing macroH2A.1.2 variant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Cell culture and cell transfection</title><p>Female MEF cells were grown under standard conditions in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and penicillin/streptomycin (PAA).

These cell lines express the corresponding histones at approximately similar levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). After several weeks in culture, we noticed that whereas the levels of GFP-H2A.Bbd and GFP-H2A remained the same, the amount of GFP-macroH2A.1.2 dropped, as seen by immunoblot of nuclear extracts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). This phenomenon was observed in several attempts and may be caused by a negative effect of high levels of macroH2A.1.2 on the cell cycle (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) and a subsequent negative selection of the highly expressing cell clones. In agreement with previously published results, we detect GFP-macroH2A.1.2 co-localizing with the inactive X-chromosome labeled with an antibody recognizing H3K27me3 (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) whereas GFP-H2A.Bbd is largely excluded from the Barr Body (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The canonical GFP-H2A in contrast does not show enrichment on a particular chromosome or nuclear domain (data not shown).</p><p>Upon establishment of stable lines expressing the different GFP-tagged histones, we isolated chromatin fragments from MEFs using micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion. As chromatin is organized in large domains in which not all nucleosomes contain the same histone isoform (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), we pooled chromatin fragments of different lengths that were released from the nuclei using a combination of different extraction protocols (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The tagged histone variants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) were released with similar efficiency from the nuclei, suggesting that the physicochemical properties of the nucleosomal arrays carrying specific variants in MEFs are roughly the same. MNase treatment released more than 80% of the tagged chromatin, which is comparable to the amount isolated by Tolstorukov <italic>et&#160;al.</italic> (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) and significantly higher than the levels released in experiments performed by Ishibashi <italic>et&#160;al.</italic> (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). This difference may be due to experimental differences or differences in cell culture conditions as we also observe a small fraction of GFP-H2A.Bbd in the nuclear matrix fraction. However, our isolation procedure was selective for chromatin-bound histones, as we could not release histones from nuclei without MNase digestion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p><p>The nucleosomal arrays containing GFP-H2A.Bbd, GFP-macroH2A.1.2 or GFP-H2A were purified by GFP-affinity chromatography (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The analysis of the protein composition of these fibres showed that, not surprisingly, the oligonucleosomal arrays contain not only the tagged versions of H2A used for purification but also all four canonical histones. This is in good agreement with our previous findings that chromatin domains are not homogenous with regard to their histone isoform/variant composition (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p><p>The non-histone proteins that were isolated together with the tagged short nucleosomal arrays were identified and quantified by separation of the proteins via SDS-PAGE, and a subsequent identification by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Proteins were identified from these runs using the Andromeda algorithm of the MaxQuant protein analysis package and quantified using their iBAQ values (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). We identified a total number of 1428 proteins in three independent biological replicates for each variant and control. More than 50% of the proteins are identified in at least two independent biological replicates. The overlap varies between samples: 53.4% for H2A.Bbd, 51.6% for H2A and 53.1% for -macroH2A.1.2 (Supplementary Figure S1). A protein was considered to be specifically chromatin-bound when its average log2 transformed iBAQ value had a difference of at least 3.5 between the GFP-H2A variant sample and the background control and it was detected in at least two samples. The application of these filters resulted in the identification of 607 bona fide chromatin proteins. For every chromatin-bound protein, we determined its variant specificity value as the log2 value of the ratio of the corresponding enrichment factors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). As expected based on the different chromosomal distributions ((<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), the GFP-H2A.Bbd- and GFP-macroH2A.1.2-containing short nucleosomal arrays were the most divergent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). For the functional analysis, we focused our further analysis towards the proteins enriched in the GFP-H2A.Bbd-containing chromatin. Very little is known about the effect of H2A.Bbd on chromatin structure and its molecular function. We therefore wondered whether a global analysis of the H2A.Bbd bound proteome would provide a deeper insight. To this end, we performed a gene ontology analysis for factors enriched in the GFP-H2A.Bbd compared to the GFP-macroH2A.1.2 and the GFP-H2A samples (upper right panel, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Consistent with the recent finding that H2A.Bbd might play a role in RNA splicing (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), we observe a strong overrepresentation of gene ontology categories related to RNA maturation (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). In addition, when we compared the H2A.Bbd- with macroH2A.1.2-containing chromatin, we found a strong enrichment of factors involved in DNA replication such as PCNA, the MCM proteins, the FACT complex and the CAF1 complex (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). These proteins are also strongly enriched when comparing GFP-H2A.Bbd chromatin with chromatin isolated from cells expressing the GFP-tagged H2A isoform (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>), suggesting that they are specific for GFP-H2A.Bbd rather than excluded from chromatin that contains high levels of GFP-macroH2A.1.2.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>DNA replication factors are significantly over-represented in the GFP-H2A.Bbd compared to the GFP-macroH2A.1.2 pull-down</p></caption><table-wrap-foot><fn id="T1FN1"><p>Top enrichment terms for the factors enriched in the H2A.Bbd/macroH2A.1.2 sample.

In contrast with the hypothesis that H2A.Bbd is preferentially found in transcriptionally active chromatin, these cells showed a strong association with DAPI dense regions within the nucleus, which are usually considered to be transcriptionally inert (Supplemental Figure S2). Based on our observation that GFP-H2A.Bbd is associated with the replication machinery, we wondered whether the cells that showed this particular localization pattern are in fact engaged in replicating heterochromatic DNA.</p><p>We therefore labeled asynchronously growing MEFs ectopically expressing GFP-H2A.Bbd with EdU to identify cells that are in S-phase. Consistent with our hypothesis we observed a striking co-localization of the EdU signal with GFP-H2A.Bbd in all S-phase cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and Supplementary Figure S3). However, after a 1 h chase following the 30 min EdU labelling, the co-localization is lost suggesting a transient interaction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). To get a better understanding of the dynamic localization of H2A.Bbd to sites of DNA synthesis, we performed live cell imaging of cell lines expressing GFP-tagged H2A.Bbd (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and Supplementary movie). High-resolution microscopy revealed that H2A.Bbd is incorporated slightly after PCNA is recruited to sites of DNA replication, which confirms our finding that H2A.Bbd interacts with PCNA-containing chromatin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Using this technique we could also determine a residence time of H2A.Bbd at replication foci of less than 10 min at early replicating foci and 30 min at sites of late replication (Supplementary Figure S4). As we see a close association with PCNA, we wondered whether GFP-H2A.Bbd is also incorporated at sites of DNA damage. For this we microirradiated MEFs expressing GFP-tagged H2A.Bbd at 450 nm for 1200 ms. After irradiation, PCNA quickly localizes to sites of DNA damage followed by GFP-H2A.Bbd, which is similar to their timing of localization to DNA replication sites. However, in contrast to replication sites, GFP-H2A.Bbd can be detected at repair foci for at least 2 h (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>H2A.Bbd accumulates at DNA damage sites following PCNA.

In agreement with the hypothesis that H2A.Bbd facilitates chromatin remodeling or assembly during DNA replication, we detect a 20% shorter S-phase in the GFP-H2A.Bbd expressing MEFs compared to the GFP-H2A expressing cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). Moreover, the expression of H2A.Bbd also increases the sensitivity to UV based DNA damage as measured by the increased formation of CPDs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). The shortening of S-phase and increased sensitivity toward DNA damage are hallmarks of cancer cells. Indeed, the analysis of Gene Expression Omnibus microarray data sets from HL cell lines and primary HL samples in comparison with normal tissue revealed increased levels of H2A.Bbd RNA in a large number of HL lines ((<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>); Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). Consistent with this finding, chromatin isolated from HL cells contains much higher levels of H2A.Bbd than control cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>) where H2A.Bbd is not detectable.

However, the physicochemical properties of chromatin and its function are mainly defined by associated proteins. As the current knowledge about the proteome bound to the H2A.Bbd-containing chromatin is limited, we performed a detailed proteomic analysis on chromatin isolated from cells expressing a GFP-tagged version of H2A.Bbd and used the purification of nucleosomal arrays containing GFP-macroH2A.1.2 and GFP-H2A as highly specific filters for a differential proteomics approach. As the cells we use to analyze H2A.Bbd bound chromatin do not show significant expression levels of this variant, the system most likely reflects the situation in tumor cells that have a high expression level for H2A.Bbd.</p><p>In agreement with earlier findings investigating chromatin fibres containing H3 variants H3.1 and H3.3 (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), we observed that arrays of nucleosomes containing either one of the two H2A variants also contain a sizeable amount of canonical histones. Despite this apparent heterogeneity of the purified fibres, these histone variants have a major impact on the proteomic composition of chromatin. Noteworthy, the number of proteins detected in GFP-H2A.Bbd chromatin is higher compared to chromatin isolated from GFP-H2A or GFP-macroH2A 1.2. This observation could be due to an intrinsic feature of H2A.Bbd containing chromatin or a result of slight expression differences of the histone variants within the cells. In order not to bias our quantitative analysis, we normalized the resulting quantitative information of all variant specific chromatin proteins to the total amount of isolated chromatin using the histone H4 iBAQ values.</p><p>We observed a striking enrichment of factors involved in DNA replication within the GFP-H2A.Bbd-containing nucleosomal arrays in an asynchronous population of cells. Although most proteins reported to reside in the mammalian replisome are enriched in the GFP-H2A.Bbd associated chromatin, not all enrichment values are significantly different among the variant containing chromatin when analyzed by rigorous statistical testing. This may well be due to the fact that only a fraction of cells within the population is actively replicating and incorporating H2A.Bbd at sites of DNA synthesis.</p><p>Nevertheless, the presence of factors associated with DNA replication in the chromatin containing GFP-H2A.Bbd prompted us to analyze its involvement in this process using alternative methods. Indeed, when we analyzed DNA replication by immunohistochemistry and live cell imaging, we observed a strong co-localization pattern of GFP-H2A.Bbd with sites of DNA replication. Interestingly, a previous report had reported a dotted staining pattern in a small fraction of H2A.Bbd transfected MEFs (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), which in light of our findings most likely reflects replicating chromatin. Histone variants have been shown to be recruited to DNA repair foci (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), however, they have not been found co-localizing with replicating DNA. H2A.Bbd is a striking exception to this rule. Interestingly, this enrichment is only transient as the co-localization of H2A.Bbd with newly synthesized DNA is only detected for less than 60 min, which may be the reason why it has gone unnoticed so far. This apparent instability of the newly formed nucleosome is in agreement with the observed low intrinsic stability of the H2A.Bbd-containing particles and its inability to bind the linker histone H1 (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).</p><p>H2A.Bbd is incorporated at both early and late replicating chromatin during S-phase, which points to a general role of the DNA synthesis machinery in the incorporation of this histone variant. Alternatively, the localization of H2A.Bbd to sites of DNA synthesis might reflect its ability to bind to naked DNA at replication sites. However, we do not think this is the sole mechanism of incorporation as we do not observe it for the canonical H2A variant that is expressed to comparable levels and has a similar affinity for naked DNA.</p><p>The differential residence time of H2A.Bbd in early or late replicating foci may be related to the different efficiency of replication fork progression in eu- and heterochromatin or to a different binding dynamics of an H2A.Bbd interacting factor. What is intriguing, however, is the substantial increase in residence time on DNA repair foci, which may be due to an extended presence of PCNA at those regions.</p><p>Like most other studies performed before, we do not investigate H2A.Bbd containing chromatin isolated from cells that naturally express this variant. It is therefore difficult to make a conclusion about its physiological function. However, it is tempting to speculate that the incorporation of H2A.Bbd at sites of DNA synthesis could physiologically contribute to the maturation of sperm and the replacement of the canonical histone with protamines. The putative mouse homologue H2A.Lap1 is expressed in all stages of spermatogenesis with the highest level between the late pachytene and round spermatid stage when it is exported to the cytosol and another H2A.Bbd-like histone becomes incorporated into the chromatin (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17&#8211;20</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The presence of H2A.Bbd-like histones in mouse coincides with episodes of increased DNA breakage in sperm (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Moreover, the DNA repair machinery might facilitate the incorporation of H2A.Bbd, thereby facilitating DNA recombination and protamine exchange. As spermatocytes expressing H2A.Bbd are postmitotic, it is unlikely that H2A.Bbd plays a role in DNA replication.</p><p>As pointed out above, our system more closely resembles the elevated expression of H2A.Bbd in HL cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">D</xref>. Such an overexpression might result in a faster S-phase progression similar to what we observe in MEFs expressing GFP-H2A.Bbd (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Indeed, HL cell lines with lower expression of H2A.Bbd (cell lines L-540 and HDLM-2) have longer doubling times than cell lines with higher expression of H2A.Bbd (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). HL high sensitivity to radio- and chemotherapy is known for a long time and has led to the development of highly effective treatment regimens (reviewed in (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>)). H2A.Bbd is specifically overexpressed in HL cell lines and in HL cells <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and might be involved in the high success of radio- and chemotherapy for treatment of these patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="SEC5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our data support a functional compartmentalization of chromatin by histone variants and their associated factors. The finding that H2A.Bbd transiently localizes to sites of DNA synthesis in cells thereby increasing S-phase progression and sensitizing the cells for DNA damaging UV irradiation opens up new avenues for the investigation of the function of this exceptional histone variant in healthy and diseased tissue.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SEC6"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gku303/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p>
