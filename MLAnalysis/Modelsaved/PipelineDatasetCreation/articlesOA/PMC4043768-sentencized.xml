</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In eukaryotes the 35S nuclear ribosomal DNA units (rDNA) occur in tandem repeats with a high copy number, and can be located at one or more chromosomal loci [1], the so-called nucleolar organizing region-NOR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The rDNA repeat includes the coding region for the 18S, 5.8S and 25S rRNA genes, the internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) and the intergenic spacer (IGS). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The IGS located between the 3' end of the 25S rRNA gene and the 5' end of the 18S rRNA gene comprises the 3′ external spacer (3′-ETS), the non-transcribed region (NTS), and the 5' external transcribed spacer (5′-ETS) [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The rRNA genes are more conserved across species than the NTS region, which show sequence and length variation between species, populations, and even within individuals [3]–[7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Studies concerning the structural organization of the 25S-18S IGS have been performed in many animal and plant species (reviewed in [2]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The presence of conserved structural features such as several types of repeating elements (or sub-repeats) functioning as enhancers, sequences with self-complementarity that could generate a conserved secondary structure, transcription initiation (TIS), and termination sites (TTS), which are involved in the regulation of transcription of the 18-5.8-25S rDNA cistrons led to the recognition of the NTS as a functional important region [2]–[4], [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Comparative studies have also been performed in several plant species of the same and different families [3], [8]–[10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The 25S-18S IGS of almost all plant species studied so far show length heterogeneity mainly due to duplications or deletions of the sub-repeat region (SR) that can be present in different numbers and arranged in very complex patterns [8], [11], [12], of the 5′-ETS [3], [4], and duplications of the promoter [8], [13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Fagaceae is an important family of temperate forest trees, which comprises several genera, with about 1000 species spread throughout the North Hemisphere, carrying an interesting evolutionary story [14]–[16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Various studies in this family used the variation in the internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) of the 18-5.8-25S rDNA and the 5S rDNA intergenic spacers (5S-IGS) mainly for systematic and phylogenetic purposes [17]–[20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>However, the sequence structure of the NTS and ETSs have only been studied in two very closely related sympatric species: Quercus petraea and Q. robur [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Besides this study, the ribosomal RNA genes variation was evaluated in six Quercus spp. [21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The number of NOR loci is variable in different Fagaceae species [8], [22], [23]: besides the prevalence of two rDNA loci in the great majority of the species, in Fagus sylvatica L. and Quercus sessilifolia Blume a different number of rDNA loci is present while two Castanea species show variability in the chromosomal location of the two loci [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Several attempts to correlate the number of rDNA loci with the number of IGS variants have been made in Quercus and other species [8], [24] through the allocation of different variants to different loci. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>This situation is the outcome of the homogenization within an rDNA array through the process of concerted evolution [25]–[27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Moreover, intrachromosomal homogenization has a substantially greater rate than the one of interchromosome exchange [24], [28], [29], although the existence of intralocus variation in Q. petraea and Q. robur was already demonstrated [30]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The comparative analysis of the IGS sequence between divergent genera of the Fagaceae has never been attempted, in spite of the structural and functional importance of its constituents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In this work, we have determined the sequence and compared the structural organization of the 25S-18S IGS in Fagus sylvatica L. and Quercus suber L. aiming to understand the molecular organization and sequence evolution of the NTS and 5′-ETS in two distant Fagaceae genera. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Also, the similarity of the IGS homologous regions in different genera, and infrageneric lineages of the Fagaceae has been investigated through FISH. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Fagus sylvatica and Quercus suber ribosomal intergenic spacers showed, like in the white oaks [8], an organization typical of most ribosomal IGS composed by five different regions: sub-repeats (SR), AT-rich, promoter and external transcribed sequences (3′ and 5′-ETS) - with structural features of plant IGS sequences and all functional elements needed for rRNA gene activity [3]–[5], [8], [11], [47], [49], [50], [58], [59]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>The average GC content of the entire Cork Oak IGS as well as each of the different regions were similar to the value reported for the white oaks [8], and slightly higher than in Beech and Cork Oak genomes [60], [61]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>The CG content of this region is responsible for the positive Chromomycin A3 staining at the NORs of several Quercus spp. [57], and other plant species [62]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the CpG islands found in the Fagaceae 5′-ETS accounts for the GC richness of this region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>In other species such as in A. thaliana these islands were found in the SR region that is discreetly rich in GC (53%, [13]), closer to the Beech values. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Different regions inside the IGSs have different base composition as reported for analogous regions of several plants [58], however the internal non-contiguous transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) are known to present similar GC contents, the so called GC balance, probably resulting from a molecular co-evolution process in these regions [63]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, these two spacers share similar GC contents in oaks and Beech [16], [64], while the distinct IGS regions have very divergent contents between them, despite lying in a unique region with no gene sequence constrain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>During evolution deletions or insertions of AT-rich or GC-rich sequences could accelerate the divergent base composition, and therefore, be responsible for these contrasting values [63]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these differences should be maintained by functional compelling rather than by sequence characteristics of this region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>For instance, the AT-rich segment upstream the promoter, that has also been referred in the IGS of other plant species [3]–[6], [8], [11], [13], [49], [50], [58], although diverging in their sequence is rich in stretches of AT base pairs, which motifs represent potential binding protein regions involved in transcription initiation sites [65], in gene regulation [66], [67], and also in the initiation of DNA replication [68], [69]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>In addition to these elements, SAR/MAR attachment sites like DNA topoisomerase II recognition sites and TG-dinucleotides, found in both spacers are known to maintain the rDNA in correct position during the interphase [70]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Although, Beech, Cork and white Oaks share around 70% of sequence identity in this region, the structural organization in both genera differ [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>While the Beech region is continuous, the oaks present a GC-rich block interruption resulting in two AT-rich domains: AT short and AT long. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>In Cork Oak, these two sub-regions share a similarity of 56%, and only two small motifs of 7 bp, therefore it does not seem plausible that the two sub-regions occurred from a duplication event; instead, an insertion of the GC stretch is more likely. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this GC-rich segment shares small motifs with the SR and 5′-ETS regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>In the human genome, regions that have diverged rapidly are called human accelerated regions (HARs) and are predominantly non-coding sequences located in introns and intergenic regions. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>A shift to GC-rich situations in the AT-rich region may improve gene transcription, and DNA replication through chromatin conformation and nucleosome positioning modulating the accessibility of regulatory molecules to the DNA sequence [72]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Cytosine is a DNA base that can be chemically modified, and in plants, the cytosines in CpG, CpNpG and CpHpH contexts are prone to methylation [73]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>This is one of the most important epigenetic modifications leading to gene silencing, and the methylation in the promoter region is known to repress the rRNA gene expression within a NOR [74]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>The idea that this motif could be specific of the trees, as previously suggested [8], [84] is unlikely since the olive tree, Olea europea [83], as well as the Gymnosperm Podocarpus elongatus [82] own the predominant TATA motif. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>The presence of the TATA motif in Gymnosperms [82] and in several families of the Angiosperms suggests that this regulatory element sequence should have appeared several times during evolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>This also evidences that rather than the sequence itself a structural code is determinant for its function, probably by directing specific DNA–protein interactions involved in transcriptional control [74]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>The presence of a unique promoter region in the “basic” 2 Kb IGS variants of Beech and Cork Oak is opposed to the dual promoters in the 4 Kb variant of Q. robur [8]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Although long IGSs seems to have higher transcription rates that can favor these variants instead of smaller ones [8], [59], in Arabidopsis only the short rDNA variants are mainly expressed in adult leaves [87]. </plain></SENT>
