</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Increased urinary albumin excretion (UAE) is today considered an expression of abnormal endothelial permeability and an integrated marker of cardiovascular and renal risk [1], [2], [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Largely studied in diabetes, its importance as a risk factor in hypertension and in the general population has been established in the last years [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>A large number of cross-sectional and follow-up studies have established the relationship between UAE and blood pressure (BP) as well as insulin levels [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The importance of other casual factors such as obesity and smoking contribute, to a minor degree, to the increment of UAE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The role of genetic factors in the risk to develop an increment in UAE has been a matter of controversy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the risk of UAE and polymorphisms of candidate genes was initially described [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>A recent review about the potential genetic factors described the most relevant information available but no firm conclusions can be established [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a GWAS analysis of a very large number of subjects did not find genetic traits associated with UAE, although how the phenotype was assessed had all the potential for inaccuracy [8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Intermediate mechanisms have also provided some insights into the increment of UAE and its association with high cardiovascular and renal risk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Inflammation [9] and oxidative stress [10] have been associated to microalbuminuria as intermediate mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Other potential associations can be explored by using the metabolomic profile. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The study of small-molecule metabolites in biological fluids with NMR spectroscopy (1H-NMR spectra), a fast and reproducible technique, may be useful for understanding metabolic imbalances and for detecting previously unsuspected links to pathological conditions [11], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Recently studies using metabolomics have been applied to identify a discriminatory metabolite profile in a large number of diseases [13], [14], [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Up to now no information about the link between metabolomic profiles and UAE in the general population has been provided. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>A further step in identifying the factors related to the risk to develop microalbuminuria could be to take advantage of combining data provided from genomic and metabolomic analyses, the goal of the present study in a general population. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Eighty-two microliters of D2O were added to 418 µl of blood serum and placed in a 5-mm NMR tube. 1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Avance DRX 600 spectrometer (Bruker GmbH, Rheinstetten, Germany). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Samples were measured at 37°C. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Nominal temperature of the sample was kept at 37°C. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>A single-pulse pre-saturation experiment was acquired in all samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>The spectra were referenced using the doublet of Alanine at 1.478 ppm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>The chemical shift region including resonances between 0.50 and 4.70 parts per million of spectrometer frequency (ppm) was investigated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>The spectra were normalized to total aliphatic spectral area to eliminate differences in metabolite total concentration. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>A principal component analysis (PCA) for each serum was firstly performed corresponding to an unsupervised multivariate data reduction routine, which serves to evaluate the data distribution and intersample similarities quickly (e.g., clusterings and outliers). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>After the PCA analysis, a partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) is usually used to build a statistical model that optimizes the separation between the two groups (subjects with and without microalbuminuria). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>The multivariated chemometric models were cross-validated with 10-fold Venetian blind cross-validation; in each run 10% of the data were left out of the training and used to test the model. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that with the same metabolomic environment, individuals sharing the TT genotype of the rs10492025 polymorphism seems to have a higher risk, and those with the CC genotype of the rs4359 polymorphism partially protected from the development of microalbuminuria in the presence of hypertension and or diabetes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>The study was performed in subjects representative of the general population from an area with a low rate of external admission. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>In this population, the prevalence of microalbuminuria was in agreement with other population-based studies [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Microalbuminuria, was associated to the presence of diabetes and/or hypertension. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>In the present population and independent of these clinical conditions, the increment of UAE was weakly associated to genotypes of SNPs located in the chromosomes 11, 12 and 16, replicating previous studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>These SNPs were located in genes such as G protein beta polypeptide 3, ACEI and RPH3A, associated previously to UAE [7] and to metabolic pathways not previously associated with UAE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>However, the degree of association was not high enough to be considered as a positive association per se. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Then we used the data from the metabolomic study to gain further insight into the potential relationship between genotypes and microalbuminuria. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>A characteristic metabolomic profile associated to microalbuminuria was identified by using a multivariate model, which allows for discrimination between normoalbuminuric and microalbuminuric individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>The good match between the results in training and cross-validation datasets provides further support to the model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Whereas previous studies reported correlations between metabolic profile and different CVD risk factors and disease states such as insulin resistance, diabetes, obesity [22], the present study represents the first description of metabolic profiles of microalbuminuria in a general population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>The differential metabolic profiles show that branched amino acids (BCAA) are reduced in microalbuminuria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>The statistical significance of different spectral regions containing resonances of BCAA and related metabolites, like 3-OH-isovalerate, supports the association. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>BCAA can act as signaling molecules in many processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Although many studies report increased BCAA levels in diabetes and insulin resistance, the association with microalbuminuria has not been previously explored. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Early studies showed that idiopathic portal hypertension correlates to decreased levels of leucine, isoleucine and valine [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Diet-induced insulin resistant obese mice also display a depletion of BCAA serum levels [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>The interpretation of these findings is complex because fasting status, diet, exercise and basal metabolism affect BCAA levels in diverse ways [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>The combined effect of lipids and BCAA seems pivotal in a complex network of interactions involving muscle, adipose, liver and brain metabolisms [26]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>The microalbuminuric pattern, mainly in hypertension and/or diabetes, was also associated to alterations in glucose metabolism, lipid β-oxidation and the tricarboxilic acid (TCA) cycle [27], [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>These are central metabolic cores for all eukaryotic cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>We report changes in lipids, glucose, pyruvate, lactate, alanine and glutamine which suggest important shifts in energy metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>However, the interpretation of these changes in relation to develop microalbuminuria is unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Different studies reported changes in different directions for these metabolites in obesity and related complications [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>In the present study, glutamine, the most abundant amino acid in plasma, is also associated to microalbuminuria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Glutamine can be produced in the TCA cycle via 2-oxoglutarate and glutamate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>It is also an important precursor of urea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, glutamine plays a pivotal metabolic role, which can be affected by alterations in both TCA cycle and urea metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Finally, choline, containing compound resonances associated to microalbuminuria, was also observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Although choline is involved in multiple metabolic pathways, it has a predominant role in cell membrane integrity, methyl metabolism and lipid-cholesterol transport [30]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Although the correlation between rs10492025 and rs4359, and microalbuminuria is only suggestive in our study, the fact that patients with genotypes associated to an increase in UAE shared a similar metabolomic profile in the normoalbuminuric and in those with microalbuminuria, points to the presence of similar underlying mechanisms that predispose to develop an increase of UAE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>The metabolomic profile characteristic of the subjects with microalbuminuria was observed also in normoalbuminuric subjects with the allele of risk or protection, in two of the polymorphism analyzed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>These two polymorphisms are linked to the ACE-I and the RPH3A (rabphilin 3A homolog) genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>While the ACE-I gene has been very well characterized for many years and associated to UAE [31] and to progression of renal diseases [32], the role of the RPH3A has not been clarified until recently [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>RPH3A is a RAB3A effector, small G protein that is thought to act at late stages of exocytosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>This small protein, present in neurons and in podocytes, confers specificity to vesicles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>It is noteworthy that podocytes possess Rab3A and their specific effector rabphilin-3A, which is expressed only in cells capable of highly regulated exocytosis [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>It is well known that podocytes are involved in many glomerular functions and apart from the maintenance of the filtration barrier they are responsible for the turnover of glomerular basement membrane components and for the ability to produce a variety of cytokines and growth factors [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in human proteinuric conditions, the expression of these molecules can increase, supporting the concept that the Rab3A-rabphilin-3A complex can play a role not only in normal but also in damaged podocytes, and consequently filtering albumin. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>The study should be considered within its limitations since it is a cross-sectional study, in which associations can result from chance, and no cause-effect can be assured. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>The sample size is small for a genetic association study in complex trait genetics and some of the reported associations may be by chance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Concerning the correction for multiple testing, it reduces the significance of the association, but considering: a) each measurement has been independently inquired through both unbiased high-throughput genomics and metabolomics; thus, the integrative strategy of both techniques allows combination of the strength and compensates for the limitations on each of the methods; b) the SNP selection was from previous studies with a positive association with UAE, and therefore the present can be considered as a replication study; c) the two polymorphisms, in the genes ACE-I and the RPH3A, have a similar “metabolomic microalbuminuric profile” we consider that all of this reduce the possibility that the association was by chance. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>While the TT genotype of the rs10492025 polymorphism of the RPH3A increases the risk, the CC genotype of the rs4359 polymorphism of the ACE-I gene reduces it. </plain></SENT>
