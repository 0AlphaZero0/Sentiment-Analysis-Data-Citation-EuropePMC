</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Genomic characteristics associated with the emergence or reemergence of pathogens in livestock operations can be subdivided into two categories; (i) genomic features that increase the adaptation to a host, or facilitate the jump to a new host species, or (ii) genomic features that provide increased adaptation to environmental factors in the livestock environment, such as antibiotic resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Comparative and population genomic studies are particularly suited to determine which features are responsible for the emergence of certain pathogens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>For instance, Price et al. [1] showed that a putative host jump, from humans to livestock, in a clonal complex in Staphylococcus aureus was associated with the loss of phage-carried human virulence genes and with the acquisition of tetracycline and methicillin resistance. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Salmonella enterica is one of the most frequent causes of bacterial foodborne illness and death in the United States [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In Salmonella, examples of emergent clones include S. Typhimurium DT 104, a multidrug resistant clone, which has seen a global epidemic spread from 1990 [3], and S. enterica serovar 4,5,12:i:–, a monophasic variant of S. Typhimurium, which showed a global increase in the mid-1990s [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In this study, we present comparative and population genomic research on S. enterica subsp. enterica serovar Cerro (S. Cerro). S. Cerro is rarely associated with human disease, with only one outbreak reported in the US so far that could be solely attributed to this serovar [5]; an additional outbreak was recently reported and it was linked to multiple serovars, including S. Cerro [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>However, this Salmonella serovar has emerged over the last decade as one of the most abundant Salmonella serovars in cattle operations in the northeastern US [7], including one of the most common serovars among subclinical dairy cattle and in the dairy farm environment [8] in the northeastern United States. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Cerro isolated from cattle and farms represent one pulsed field electrophoresis (PFGE) type, indicating that a single clonal lineage is involved in this emergence [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>It is unknown what causes S. Cerro to be associated with cattle and why it is rarely involved in human disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we hypothesize that S. Cerro has distinct genomic characteristics that explain its association with cattle and limited association with human disease. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>This strain belongs to ST1291 and displays a different allelic type at each of the seven MLST loci. S. Cerro therefore is very likely to be polyphyletic, which makes interpretation of historical references without genomic or MLST sequence data difficult. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Because all isolates sequenced in this study belong to ST367, we will refer to these isolates as S. Cerro ST367 from here on. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Timme et al. [18] recently published sequence data for another S.

<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>This analysis showed a correlation (Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient 0.80, R2 = 0.645) between the time of isolation of the individual isolates and the root-to-tip divergence, indicating a temporal signal for this dataset and justifying a molecular clock based phylogenetic analysis. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>This may indicate that, although isolates of S.

<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The time of the emergence of the most recent ancestor (MRCA) of the NY bovine clade is estimated to be 1998 (95% HPD 1991–2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The NY bovine clade is further split up into two clades: (i) a clade with two isolates from northeastern New York (Figure 1: clade 1) and (ii) a clade with 15 bovine associated isolates from western NY state (Figure 1: clade 2). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Comparative genomic analyses of 27 Salmonella Cerro isolates indicate that this serovar lacks several genes that have previously been shown to be involved in the ability of Salmonella serovars to cause intestinal infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Reduced invasion of human intestinal epithelial cells, as compared to other serovars, further supports the reduced ability of this serovar to cause intestinal infection, however, further experiments are necessary to determine which genes are responsible for this phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Altogether, these results suggest that the emergence of S. Cerro ST367 among livestock operations in the northeastern United States may not be due to increased adaptation to the bovine host, nor to increased antibiotic resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Instead, the frequent isolation of this serovar on cattle farms [8] may reflect that this serovar was able to disperse rapidly as no efforts were undertaken to control its spread (possibly due to a lack of clinical signs, which left infections undetected). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, or in addition, S. Cerro (or some subtypes within S. Cerro) may have unique phenotypic characteristics that were not discovered through the comparative genomic analyses conducted here, but that facilitate environmental survival or dispersal. </plain></SENT>
