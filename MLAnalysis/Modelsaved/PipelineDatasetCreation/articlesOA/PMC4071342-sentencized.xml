<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A shared characteristic among rust fungi is obligate biotrophy, the inability to complete a lifecycle without a host. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This dependence on a host species likely affects patterns of gene expansion, contraction, and innovation within rust pathogen genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The establishment of disease by biotrophic pathogens is reliant upon effector proteins that are encoded in the fungal genome and secreted from the pathogen into the host's cell apoplast or within the cells. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Rust fungi are plant infecting filamentous fungi in the order Pucciniales (Basidiomycota) that are unified by obligate biotrophy (Voegele and Mendgen, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This form of pathogenicity requires a live host to establish a parasitic relationship. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This is accomplished through the establishment of a molecularly intimate interaction at the host-pathogen interface characterized by the secretion of an arsenal of proteins from the pathogen that suppress host defense mechanisms and promote the acquisition of essential nutrients by the pathogen (Dodds et al., 2009; Stergiopoulos and de Wit, 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Such proteins, termed effectors, are thought to establish and maintain a compatible interaction between the pathogen and host. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The processes that drive evolution of effector diversity are of great interest because pathogen's effector genes and host resistance genes are the interacting “gene-for-gene” pairs that drive coevolution in these pathosystems (Jones and Dangl, 2006; Stergiopoulos and de Wit, 2009). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Secreted proteins can be identified from whole genome sequences through the utilization of bioinformatic tools to isolate proteins with N-terminal secretion signals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Bioinformatic pipelines can then be used to narrow predicted secreted protein sets to putative effectors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>These proteins contain features of known effectors such as elevated cysteine content (greater than 2%), that would enable the formation of stabilizing disulfide bridges (Stergiopoulos and de Wit, 2009), and protein domains associated with pathogenicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Length is a criteria used to identify small secreted proteins (SSPs) from within putative effector protein sets, as SSPs are effector-like proteins with lengths less than 300 amino acids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Sequence comparisons alone do not provide a reliable means to identify putative effectors since some known effectors are lineage-specific while others are conserved across taxa (Rep, 2005; Saunders et al., 2012; Giraldo and Valent, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Candidate effectors, a further distinction, are putative effectors that have additional support for roles in pathogenicity (i.e., induced transcription or elevated expression in planta). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Genetic evidence for functional redundancy of effectors, presumably due to multigene families of effector proteins, whose members share similar functions, has been reported in several pathogens (Kamper et al., 2006; Rafiqi et al., 2012; Saitoh et al., 2012; Giraldo and Valent, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>This suggests it would be useful to characterize families of proteins with effector-like characteristics so as to identify families that have expanded during evolution in association with the acquisition of pathogenic life history characteristics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Examining the evolutionary history of protein families across a set of diverse fungal taxa should help identify lineage-specific, putative effector protein families, families that may have evolved similar functions in more distantly related taxa, and families that may exhibit functional redundancy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Cronartium quercuum f. sp. fusiforme (Cqf) is a rust pathogen that has a complex life cycle with five spore types and exhibits alternation between two hosts, oak (Quercus spp.) and southern pines (Pinus spp.). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The fungus incites fusiform rust disease on southern pines, leading to significant economic losses to the forest products industry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The impact of the disease on pine production has motivated extensive research on the genetic interaction between Cqf and pine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study is to identify putative effector gene families in the Cqf genome through comparative genomic analyses between Cqf and 15 other fungal taxa, including two other rust pathogens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>We have identified families that have expanded in Cqf that we hypothesize are involved in conditioning stem gall phenotypes observed on the pine host. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Our analyses provide a more thorough perspective on Cqf and rust pathogen evolution and also highlight the evolutionary patterns of putative effector families that Cqf employs to establish disease on two taxonomically diverse host species. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>We suggest this is a reasonable approach to identifying putative effectors that complements more conventional methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Previous studies searched for effectors within other systems based on the presence of a signal peptide, cysteine richness, and short protein lengths (&lt;300 aa) (Joly et al., 2010; Cantu et al., 2011; Duplessis et al., 2011b; Hacquard et al., 2012; Saunders et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>This study highlights the usefulness of comparative genomic analyses to examine the evolutionary history of each secretome member, and that this approach can also be complemented with structural characteristics of predicted secreted proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>The rationale behind these comparisons is that effector families conserved in rust fungi and unique to Cqf are candidates for conditioning rust pathogen and Cqf infection strategies, respectively. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>We observed species-specific proteomic gene family gains/duplications in the Cqf lineage, a subset of which represents putative effectors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>The paralogous nature (i.e., multi-copy) of their protein family members indicates functional redundancy, which is consistent with other pathogenic fungi (Kamper et al., 2006; Saitoh et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>We have identified two lines of evidence that point toward neo- and sub-functionalization in Cqf putative effector families. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>First, differential subcellular localization predictions have been observed within putative effector families. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>In about 34% of Cqf-specific families, only a subset of proteins are secreted from the fungal cell, while remaining family members are not predicted for secretion, thus remaining within the fungal cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>This pattern suggests that secreted proteins with effector function may have evolved from non-secreted proteins without an effector function or vice versa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Second, changes in domain architecture of proteins within putative effector families also points to neo- or subfunctionalization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>For example family 5485 contains MCO laccase-like enzymes and a single clade of three Cqf proteins that have acquired a MCO copper binding site in the evolution of this family. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>It is possible that these proteins have novel or distinct functions within Cqf than their paralogs within the genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>This family is a strong putative effector family because all Cqf members belong to the predicted secretome and it has undergone Cqf-specific family duplications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Protein members within this family co-localize in the genome, possibly resulting from tandem duplication from non-equal crossing over. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Various functions have been ascribed to previously identified fungal MCOs including lignin degradation (Leonowicz et al., 2001; Lundell et al., 2010), melanin synthesis (Langfelder et al., 2003), fruiting body formation (Kues and Liu, 2000), and pathogenicity on hosts (Zhu and Williamson, 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>This family has expanded in Cqf, the first sequenced rust pathogen that forms stem galls in woody tissues, and we hypothesize that these enzymes play a role in gall formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>The most common function for laccases/MCOs in basidiomycete fungi is lignin metabolism (Thurston, 1994; Kües and Rühl, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>However, this gene family exhibits a lack of conservation with known MCOs of lignin-degrading wood rots (P. chrysosporium and S. lacrymans), which points to the possibility that these enzymes may be involved in pathogenicity or may metabolize a plant substrate other than lignin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>On both hosts, Cqf infects primary tissue that lacks high levels of lignification such as spongy mesophyll cells of oak leaves (Mims et al., 1996) and vascular cambium of pine (Gray et al., 1982). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>If the Family 5485 enzymes are involved in lignin degradation, the enzymatic activity may occur late in gall development on the pine host, where the tissues are more heavily lignified due to secondary wall formation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Predicted functions of proteins harboring CFEM domains include critical roles in appressorial development (Choi and Dean, 1997; DeZwaan et al., 1999), signal transducers, adhesion and cell-surface receptors (Kulkarni et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Patterns of gene family loss and gain for rust fungi highlight major shifts in their proteomes, possibly associated with the rust pathogen's obligate biotrophic lifestyle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>The origin of the rust pathogen clade is associated with nearly five times more losses, or family contractions, than duplications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>There are many possible mechanisms for gene loss in rust fungi. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>For this reason, further investigations are required to both identify specific mechanisms and quantify their levels of effects on gene family evolution in rust fungi. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>However, we hypothesize that the since obligate biotrophy has evolved multiple times in fungi (Spanu, 2012), the skew toward gene loss in the rust pathogen lineage might be associated with the shift from the life history of its ancestral state to that of the obligate biotrophic pathogens we observe today. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>These lost and/or contracted families exhibit broad taxonomic conservation and may have been constituents of the ancestral “core” fungal gene set, suggesting that they are unnecessary for obligate biotrophic but may be necessary for free-living and symbiotic species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>For example, enzymes integral to the sulfur and nitrogen assimilation pathways are missing in Cqf (unpublished, jgi.doe.gov/Cronartium), Mlp, and Pgt (Duplessis et al., 2011b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>This also suggests that evolution for obligate biotrophy drives toward an irreversible life history shift (Spanu, 2012). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Although the rusts have undergone considerable gene family losses and contractions, they exhibit some of the largest proteomes in fungi. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Much of their proteome size appears to be due to species-specific duplications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Nearly one-third (32.1%) of all observed duplications across all of the sampled basidiomycete fungi are rust taxon-specific duplications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>The high levels of species-specific duplication yield disproportionately greater numbers of newly-evolved genes in the rust pathogen genomes compared to ancient or conserved genes (genes shared with older lineages) in each proteome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>The presence of so many species-specific duplications suggests that the rusts have highly labile genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the large (&gt;10%) genomic size variation detected in progeny from a single Cqf cross relative to parental isolates (Anderson et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Such rapid changes, occurring in the span of a single generation, could facilitate the gene gains and losses observed in our analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>The close association with hosts may foster a labile and diverse genome, enabling the parasites to rapidly adapt to the continually evolving host resistance pathways. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Comparative analysis and genetic mapping to validate putative effectors </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>Further characterization of putative effectors in Cqf could be accomplished with analysis of selection potentially arising from host resistance mechanisms (Allen et al., 2004; Aguileta et al., 2009; Barrett et al., 2009; Thrall et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>In addition, expression analysis can be informative, since secreted proteins with specific expression profiles during infection are stronger effector candidates (Ellis et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Time-course experiments have been successful in other rust pathogen systems to elucidate the effector-like proteins involved in multiple or highly specific stages during infection (Joly et al., 2010; Duplessis et al., 2011a; Bruce et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Also, resequencing of closely related rust pathogens such as Cronartium ribicola, C. flaccidum, and Peridermium harknessii (Vogler and Bruns, 1998) would improve precision of gene family delineations and identification of true singleton Cqf effectors, which are likely to be more newly evolved than effectors in families, and may therefore be products of highly-specific host-Cqf coevolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Finally, a subset of the predicted effectors are avirulence proteins and are, by definition, involved in genotype-specific “gene-for-gene” interactions with hosts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>These putative avirulence effectors can be validated through genetic mapping to their corresponding host resistance genes, an approach that has previously been successful in identifying the first avirulence protein locus in Cqf (Kubisiak et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Altogether, these validation approaches will yield true members of the Cqf secretome and provide additional insight into the biological functions for effectors infecting oak and pine. </plain></SENT>
