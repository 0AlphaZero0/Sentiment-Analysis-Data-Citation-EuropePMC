The linear ubiquitination assembly complex (LUBAC), consisting of HOIL-1L, HOIP, and Sharpin, has been reported to activate NF-&#954;B&#8211;mediated transcription in response to receptor signaling by ligating linear ubiquitin chains to Nemo and Rip1. Despite recent advances, the detailed roles of LUBAC in immune cells remain elusive. We demonstrate a novel HOIL-1L function as an essential regulator of the activation of the NLRP3/ASC inflammasome in primary bone marrow&#8211;derived macrophages (BMDMs) independently of NF-&#954;B activation. Mechanistically, HOIL-1L is required for assembly of the NLRP3/ASC inflammasome and the linear ubiquitination of ASC, which we identify as a novel LUBAC substrate. Consequently, we find that HOIL-1L<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> mice have reduced IL-1&#946; secretion in response to in vivo NLRP3 stimulation and survive lethal challenge with LPS. Together, these data demonstrate that linear ubiquitination is required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation, defining the molecular events of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and expanding the role of LUBAC as an innate immune regulator. Furthermore, our observation is clinically relevant because patients lacking HOIL-1L expression suffer from pyogenic bacterial immunodeficiency, providing a potential new therapeutic target for enhancing inflammation in immunodeficient patients.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The innate immune response is precisely gated by regulatory mechanisms during both detection of a threat to the host and also the resulting responses. Such control is essential for preventing inappropriate or prolonged innate immune responses, which may damage the host as much as the pathogen or damaging signal itself. Specifically, posttranslational modification of substrate proteins by ubiquitination has been reported for many targets in innate immune signaling pathways as a mechanism of regulating their functions. The diversity of effects on target protein degradation, binding partner affinity, or localization resulting from ubiquitination modification is dependent on the lysine linkage position and length of the ubiquitin chain attached by a ubiquitin ligase enzyme. As a central pathway downstream from many innate and adaptive immune receptors, the NF-&#954;B signaling pathway is highly regulated by lysine 48 (K48), K63, and linear ubiquitination modifications that are required for the ultimate release of the p50/p65 NF-&#954;B transcription factor to the nucleus where it can turn on the expression of proinflammatory genes (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Iwai and Tokunaga, 2009</xref>). After receptor stimulation by CD40 ligand, TNF, or IL-1&#946;, the cIAP-mediated K63 ubiquitination of Rip1 or TRAF6 leads to recruitment of the linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC), consisting of HOIP and HOIL-1L or Sharpin, or both (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Haas et al., 2009</xref>). LUBAC is required for the linear ubiquitination of Rip1 and Nemo, resulting in the activation of the IKK kinase (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Iwai and Tokunaga, 2009</xref>). Phosphorylation of I&#954;B&#945; by IKK is required for the K48 ubiquitination of I&#954;B&#945;, which leads to proteasomal degradation of I&#954;B&#945; and release of the p50/p65 NF-&#954;B transcription factor for translocation to the nucleus (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Iwai and Tokunaga, 2009</xref>). Although many protein substrates have been described for K48 and K63 ubiquitination, few have been described for linear ubiquitination, with only Rip1 and Nemo being the best characterized. Negative regulators of linear ubiquitination-dependent NF-&#954;B activation have recently been reported, including the FAM105B (otulin) and CYLD linear ubiquitin-specific deubiquitinases (DUBs) and A20, which specifically binds the linear ubiquitin moiety and edits Rip1 ubiquitination to inhibit its activation (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Wertz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Tokunaga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Verhelst et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Keusekotten et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Rivkin et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Because many receptor signaling pathways converge on Nemo activation, linear ubiquitination is expected to be required for the NF-&#954;B&#8211;dependent gene expression of various pattern recognition receptor (PRR) pathways. Indeed, TLRs, such as TLR2, 3, 4, 7/8, and 9, have been shown to require LUBAC for NF-&#954;B&#8211;dependent gene expression due to the linear ubiquitination of Nemo (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Zak et al., 2011</xref>). The NOD2 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2)-dependent activation of NF-&#954;B in response to muramyl dipeptide (MDP) also requires LUBAC, which is recruited by the XIAP-mediated K63 ubiquitination of RIPK2 (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Damgaard et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, the HOIL-1L subunit of LUBAC is a negative regulator of the RIG-I intracellular virus-sensing PRR that competitively binds RIG-I and targets TRIM25 for degradation, thus stopping the TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination and activation of RIG-I as a potential feedback inhibitory pathway (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Inn et al., 2011</xref>). These findings indicate that LUBAC plays important roles in various surface and intracellular PPR pathways as a positive and negative factor.</p><p>The inflammasome family of PRRs detects cytosolic pathogens and danger signals, such as potassium efflux and mitochondrial damage, in myeloid-lineage cells and responds by forming an oligomer signaling complex that includes an adapter protein, such as ASC or Naip5, which can bind to pro&#8211;caspase-1 (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Franchi et al., 2012</xref>). The inflammasome complex subsequently potentiates the autocatalytic cleavage of pro&#8211;caspase-1 to its active p10 and p20 subunits, which enzymatically cleaves pro&#8211;IL-1&#946; and pro&#8211;IL-18 to active cytokines for immediate secretion and inflammatory action (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Schroder and Tschopp, 2010</xref>). Expression of the <italic>pro&#8211;IL-1&#946;</italic> gene is NF-&#954;B&#8211;dependent, and is triggered by a second PRR stimulation, such as TLRs, in macrophage cells (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Schroder and Tschopp, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Franchi et al., 2012</xref>). Regulation of inflammasomes by ubiquitination has previously been shown for the NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes, which both use the ASC adapter protein (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Franchi et al., 2012</xref>). The deubiquitination of NLRP3 by the BRCC3 complex is required for NLRP3 activation (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Juliana et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Lopez-Castejon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Py et al., 2013</xref>), and the K63-linked ubiquitination of ASC targets the AIM2&#8211;ASC inflammasome complex for destruction in autophagosomes (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Shimada et al., 2012</xref>). However, given the complexity of the regulation of the NF-&#954;B pathway by a combination of K63, K48, and linear ubiquitination, further analysis of ubiquitination-mediated regulation is necessary to fully understand inflammasome-induced innate immune pathways.</p><p>Besides its role in TLR-induced NF-&#954;B activation, LUBAC-mediated linear ubiquitination may also participate in the inflammasome activation pathway for caspase-1 activation and IL-1&#946; secretion. However, the roles of LUBAC have so far been defined through the study of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), B cells and keratinocytes of HOIL-1L<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> and Sharpin<italic><sup>cpdm</sup></italic> (null point mutant) mice, or human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) reporter cells with gene overexpression of knockdown conditions (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Tokunaga et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gerlach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Ikeda et al., 2011</xref>) that do not express all of the subunits of the inflammasome family of PRRs, thus making the role of LUBAC in inflammasome pathways elusive. In this study, we thus examined the role of the HOIL-1L subunit of LUBAC in NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in primary BM-derived macrophages (BMDMs). We demonstrate that HOIL-1L is essential for NLRP3 inflammasome activation independently of NF-&#954;B activation. Specifically, HOIL-1L is required for ASC linear ubiquitination and NLRP3 inflammasome assembly, thus expanding the role of LUBAC as an innate immune regulator.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Cell type&#8211;specific roles of HOIL-1L in NF-&#954;B activation</title><p>To test whether NF-&#954;B is regulated by LUBAC in macrophage cells, we first examined NF-&#954;B activation in WT and HOIL-1L<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> BMDMs and MEFs upon stimulation with LPS or TNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>).

These transcripts might be directly regulated by HOIL-1L because HOIL-1L was originally identified as a DNA-binding protein, although the transcripts regulated by HOIL-1L were not previously identified (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Tatematsu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Tokunaga et al., 1998</xref>). Specific comparison of the selected NF-&#954;B&#8211;regulated transcripts further revealed equivalent or higher levels of their expression in HOIL-1L<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> BMDMs than in WT BMDMs, and pathway analysis confirmed that the NF-&#954;B pathway was regulated in a similar manner in WT and HOIL-1L<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 b</xref>).

Thus, these results indicate that HOIL-1L may specifically be required for ASC-dependent inflammasome activation. Although the IL-1&#946; secretion induced by both NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes were affected in HOIL-1L<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> BMDMs, the effect was much more pronounced for NLRP3 stimulation than for AIM2 stimulation, leading us to further characterize the mechanism of HOIL-1L&#8211;mediated regulation of NLRP3&#8211;ASC inflammasome activation. Although WT BMDMs had NLRP3 stimulation-dependent caspase-1 activity, as measured by pro&#8211;caspase-1 cleavage to the p10 subunit, HOIL-1L<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> BMDMs showed a defect in pro&#8211;caspase-1 cleavage under the same stimulation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 b</xref>).

Together, these data indicate that nearly all the functional components of HOIL-1L, including the N-terminal HOIP interaction, the central ubiquitin interaction, and the C-terminal ubiquitination ligase activity, are critical for pro&#8211;caspase-1 cleavage and enzymatic activity in NLRP3-inflammasome activation.</p></sec><sec><title>HOIL-1L is required for NLRP3/ASC inflammasome assembly</title><p>We next examined whether linear ubiquitination was important for inflammasome activation events occurring upstream of caspase-1 cleavage, namely, ASC cytoplasmic foci formation and NLRP3&#8211;ASC complex assembly.

First, we used a linear ubiquitin-specific antibody to immunoprecipitate linear ubiquitin from 293T cells transfected with the LUBAC subunits HOIL-1L and HOIP, along with a C-terminal Flag-tagged ASC (ASC-Flag) in 5M urea denaturation buffer conditions as optimized (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20132486/DC1" id="supp4">Fig. S1</ext-link>) and as previously described (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Matsumoto et al., 2012</xref>). Linear ubiquitin-specific immunoblotting indicated that high levels of linear ubiquitinated proteins were produced upon LUBAC expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 a</xref>) and that ASC was detected as multi-laddered and high molecular weight bands in the linear ubiquitin immunoprecipitations (IPs), suggesting that ASC is a LUBAC substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 a</xref>). In addition, NEMO was also detected in the linear ubiquitin IP (Fig. S1) consistent with previous results (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Tokunaga et al., 2009</xref>), whereas AIM2 and NLRP3 showed no linear ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 a</xref>), demonstrating the substrate selectivity of LUBAC-mediated linear ubiquitination in 293T cells.

Specifically, expression of the HOIL-1L cs mutant markedly reduced levels of ASC linear ubiquitination, and expression of the HOIP cs mutant led to undetectable levels of ASC linear ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 b</xref>). Linear ubiquitination does not appear to lead to the degradation of ASC by the proteasome because inhibition of the proteasome with MG132 did not affect levels of total or linear ubiquitinated ASC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 c</xref>).

In parallel, a GST-CoZi mutant fusion containing the R309A, R312A, E313A (rre) mutant, which cannot bind to linear ubiquitin chains but is capable of binding to K63-linked ubiquitin chains in vitro (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Komander et al., 2009</xref>), was included as a control. Consistent with the linear ubiquitin IPs, the GST-CoZi purification pulled down ASC-Flag with multi-laddered high molecular weights in a LUBAC expression dependent manner, whereas the GST-CoZi rre mutant did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 d</xref>), further supporting the LUBAC-mediated linear ubiquitination of ASC. Moreover, ASC linear ubiquitination was exclusively detected when HOIL-1L and HOIP were coexpressed, indicating that the linear ubiquitination of ASC is LUBAC-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 d</xref>). In a third method, an in vitro ubiquitination assay also showed that HOIP-HOIL-1L co-purified from a bacterial expression system specifically ubiquitinated ASC-Flag protein to levels that were comparable to the previously identified Nemo substrate (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Tokunaga et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 e</xref>), indicating that the LUBAC, E1, and E2 enzymes are sufficient for the linear ubiquitination of ASC. When NLRP3-Flag was included as a control, no detectable in vitro linear ubiquitination of NLRP3 was observed under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 e</xref>). In a fourth assay, linear ubiquitin immunoprecipitates were treated with the linear linkage-specific deubiquitinase Otulin, or the K63 linkage-specific deubiquitinase AMSH, to determine whether the ubiquitin chains on ASC were simply linear linkage or a mixture of K63 and linear linkages, which has previously been reported for other LUBAC substrates (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Emmerich et al., 2013</xref>). Only the Otulin treatment reduced high molecular weight ASC, whereas the AMSH treatment had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 f</xref>). Lastly, in a fifth assay, the linear ubiquitin IP of BMDM lysates indicated that overall linear ubiquitin levels increased in WT BMDMs upon NLRP3 stimulation but were reduced in HOIL-1L<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> BMDMs, whereas total ubiquitin levels remained the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, a&#8211;d</xref>). Linear ubiquitin IP from WT BMDMs in 5M urea buffer precipitated the high molecular weight ASC protein, which was enhanced by NLRP3 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 a</xref>), indicating that endogenous ASC is linear ubiquitinated. Furthermore, levels of total linear ubiquitin and the linear ubiquitinated ASC were considerably reduced in HOIL-1L<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> BMDMs under NLRP3 stimulation conditions when compared with those in WT BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 b</xref>).

Mechanistically, the assembly of the NLRP3/ASC inflammasome and linear ubiquitination of the novel LUBAC substrate, ASC, both require HOIL-1L expression. The loss of these functions in HOIL-1L<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> mice results in resistance to MDP-induced peritonitis and contributes to survival upon LPS-induced systemic inflammation. This is the first demonstration that linear ubiquitination is required for NLRP3/ASC-dependent inflammasome activation, thus expanding the role of LUBAC as an innate immune regulator. This work is also the first to compare the role of HOIL-1L in MEF and macrophage cells. Our data indicate that HOIL-1L is critical for NF-&#954;B activation in MEF cells, consistent with the literature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Tokunaga et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gerlach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Ikeda et al., 2011</xref>). However, this activity is cell type specific because HOIL-1L is not required for NF-&#954;B activation or NF-&#954;B&#8211;dependent gene expression in BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). These observations are likely clinically relevant because patients lacking functional HOIL-1L expression had an IL-6 response to LPS that was equivalent to control patient levels when whole blood cells were stimulated (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Boisson et al., 2012</xref>), which is similar to our results in BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, b and c</xref>). However, IL-6 production was attenuated in fibroblast cells of HOIL-1L&#8211;deficient patients (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Boisson et al., 2012</xref>) similarly to our results with HOIL-1L<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 c</xref>), indicating that the tissue-specific functions for HOIL-1L also exist in humans. Because HOIL-1L&#8211;deficient patients were prone to pyogenic bacterial infections (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Boisson et al., 2012</xref>), we predict that a defect likely exists in NLRP3 inflammasome assembly in these patients, similar to what we have observed in BMDMs from HOIL-1L<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> mice, leading to ineffective innate immunity upon exposure to bacterial pathogens. In addition to cell type&#8211;specific functions for HOIL-1L, the LUBAC subunit Sharpin may also have tissue-specific roles.

In contrast to our observation that IL-6 secretion is not impaired in HOIL-1L<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> mice in response to MDP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>), a previous study reported that Sharpin<italic><sup>cpdm</sup></italic> BMDMs have a defect in MDP-dependent IL-6 secretion, although an in vivo peritonitis model was not used in this study (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Damgaard et al., 2012</xref>). This difference could also be due to the use of lipid modified MDP (L18-MDP) in the previous study, or it could indicate that HOIL-1L and Sharpin may have different roles in NOD2 stimulation. Additional reports that LUBAC is recruited to the NOD2 receptor complex in response to MDP suggest that this recruitment requires XIAP. However, the role of LUBAC was not directly tested in these studies. In addition, the defects in XIAP-deficient cells and Otulin-expressing cells could be due to LUBAC-independent functions of XIAP or difference of nonmacrophage cell types used in these studies (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Damgaard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Keusekotten et al., 2013</xref>). Further study is necessary to resolve the detailed roles of LUBAC in gene expression regulation.</p><p>Ubiquitination is a posttranslational modification that creates versatility in intracellular signaling. Specifically, K63 linkage is exclusively responsible for ubiquitin-mediated nondegradative signaling functions and linear linkage is crucial in various receptor and PRR pathways. Our discovery of ASC as a LUBAC substrate is related to a previous report that ASC is ubiquitinated upon AIM2 stimulation (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2012</xref>), although K63-linked ubiquitination was reported. Because K63 antibodies can cross-detect linear ubiquitination (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Matsumoto et al., 2012</xref>) and the K63 E3 ligase or ASC lysine targets were not identified, it may be possible that the ubiquitination in this previous study was actually linear ubiquitination. Ubiquitination of NLRP3 has also been reported (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Lopez-Castejon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Py et al., 2013</xref>); however, this ubiquitination is not likely to be linear because the N-terminal His-tagging of ubiquitin used in this study would eliminate the possibility of a linear methionine-to-glycine linkage (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gerlach et al., 2011</xref>). Previous characterization of Nemo as a LUBAC substrate used 293T overexpression systems, reporter assays, and in vitro assays (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Tokunaga et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gerlach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Ikeda et al., 2011</xref>). Our results demonstrate that ASC is a LUBAC substrate using similar assays, with additional endogenous evidence in BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figs. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Previous mapping of the Nemo protein led to the identification of two lysine targets for LUBAC, which were functionally required for NF-&#954;B activation in MEF cells (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Tokunaga et al., 2009</xref>). We also expect that two linear ubiquitination sites may exist on ASC based on the results from our deubiquitination assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 f</xref>). Because Otulin can more efficiently cleave linear ubiquitin linkages than ubiquitin-substrate linkages, the two higher molecular weight ASC bands that remained after Otulin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 f</xref>) may correspond to two direct ubiquitination sites on ASC. However, our attempts to map the ubiquitinated residues of ASC indicate that mutagenesis of the lysines in ASC affects protein&#8211;protein interactions independently of linear ubiquitination, making finer evaluation of the role of ASC linear ubiquitination for inflammasome activation difficult. Furthermore, as shown in the Nemo linear ubiquitination studies (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Tokunaga et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gerlach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Ikeda et al., 2011</xref>), the levels of endogenous linear ubiquitination of Nemo seem to be very low. Thus, additional technical advances are necessary to define the specific roles of linear ubiquitination in intracellular signaling pathways.</p><p>Our data supports the hypothesis that each type of inflammasome has unique regulatory mechanisms, although the detailed mechanisms for these events have not been completely described. In particular, the NLRP3 inflammasome is distinct from other inflammasome sensors because it responds to a wide variety of triggers instead of one or two specific ligands like AIM2 or NLRC4 (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Schroder and Tschopp, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Franchi et al., 2012</xref>). Although mitochondrial damage is a common source for the potential NLRP3 stimulating signals, including mitochondrial ROS, oxidized mitochondrial DNA, and mitochondrial cardiolipin (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Nakahira et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Shimada et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Iyer et al., 2013</xref>), the molecular events preceding the NLRP3/ASC interaction are not well characterized. Thus, it remains unknown what triggers HOIL-1L&#8211;containing LUBAC to linear ubiquitinated ASC upon NLRP3 stimulation. A recent report identified the phosphorylation of ASC as a trigger for the NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes, although it is not clear whether this phosphorylation event affects the ubiquitination of ASC (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Hara et al., 2013</xref>). Because the molecular events triggering caspase-1 cleavage are also unclear, the mechanisms of NLRP3 activation must be further defined to characterize which events happen first. Nevertheless, our work has added linear ubiquitination to the sequence of events that precede NLRP3/ASC inflammasome assembly.</p><p>The resistance of HOIL-1L<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> mice to lethal inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>) emphasizes the role of HOIL-1L as a critical regulator of inflammation in vivo despite the absence of dermatitis phenotype that is observed in the Sharpin<italic><sup>cpdm</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gerlach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Ikeda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Tokunaga et al., 2011</xref>). Given that the accurate mechanisms responsible for the symptoms of lethal inflammation in mouse models are not fully understood (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kayagaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Seok et al., 2013</xref>), it is likely that HOIL-1L<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> mice are resistant to death because of complex multifaceted roles of HOIL-1L in inflammation, but not due to its action in a single pathway. Thus, the overall survival of the HOIL-1L<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> mice is likely due to a combination of various roles of HOIL-1L in different pathways, including NLRP3 activation, NF-&#954;B&#8211;dependent TNF, IL-1&#946;, CD40, and NOD2 receptor signaling (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Haas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Iwai and Tokunaga, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Tokunaga et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Zak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Damgaard et al., 2012</xref>), protein kinase C activity (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura et al., 2006</xref>), RIG-I activation (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Inn et al., 2011</xref>), and transcriptional regulation as a DNA-binding protein (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Tatematsu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Tokunaga et al., 1998</xref>). Interestingly, the HOIL-1L<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> mice never displayed any behavioral symptoms of LPS-induced lethal inflammation (lethargy or shivering) even though they had considerably more weight loss as WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 b</xref>), which suggests that perhaps these two sets of symptoms have independent mechanisms, with lethargy and fever caused by HOIL-1L&#8211;dependent inflammation and weight loss being due to an as yet unidentified factor. The HOIL-1L&#8211;dependent assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome and linear ubiquitination of ASC likely contribute to the resistance of the HOIL-1L<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> mice upon LPS challenge because mice lacking functional NLRP3 inflammasomes or ASC are also resistant to LPS challenge (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Mariathasan et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Furthermore, the MDP-induced peritonitis model confirmed that HOIL-1L is indeed important for NLRP3 inflammasome activation in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). Altogether, our data indicates that the regulation of inflammasome activation is achieved through complex ubiquitin linkage codes that in turn may have distinct consequences in response to stimuli. Our work has identified new members of a growing network of ubiquitin-mediated regulation, which is an increasingly appreciated mechanism for PRR signaling pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Mice.</title><p>WT C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River.
