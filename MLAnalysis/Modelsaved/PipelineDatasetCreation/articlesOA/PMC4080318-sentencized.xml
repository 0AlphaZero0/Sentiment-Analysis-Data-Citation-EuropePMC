</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Research has consistently implicated the joint contribution of genetic and environmental risk factors in the pathogenesis of major depression.1 The most prominent example refers to the debate on whether a 43-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) in the serotonin transporter gene2 moderates the association of life stress and depression.3, 4, 5 Whereas numerous studies observed increased disease vulnerability in carriers of the 5-HTTLPR short (S) variant upon exposure to environmental adversity,4,6 recent meta-analyses have triggered an active controversy about whether this finding holds up.7,8 Therefore, exploring systemic and molecular mechanisms underlying gene–environment (GxE) interactions seems to be of major importance to further advance this debate.1,9 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>On a systemic level, experimental studies investigating biological quantitative traits strongly support the hypothesis of elevated stress sensitivity in S allele carriers.4 Among other biological alterations, the S allele has repeatedly been associated with elevated amygdala activity10,11 and increased cortisol secretion in response to a variety of aversive/stressful stimuli.12,13 However, little is known about the molecular pathways mediating disease vulnerability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>One hypothesis is that GxE interaction already takes place at the very early level of gene expression, in a way that 5-HTTLPR and life stress jointly convey stable changes in serotonin transporter (SERT) expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In line with this, altered SERT expression profiles may constitute a putative mediator of GxE interaction as they have been commonly observed in depressed patients14, 15, 16 and stress-sensitive Rhesus macaques.17,18 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The functional effects of 5-HTTLPR have been widely documented by in vitro studies, indicating that the S allele is associated with reduced SERT gene (SLC6A4) transcription in lymphoblast cell lines2,19 and decreased serotonin uptake in platelets.20,21 In addition, transcriptional efficiency of the SERT gene was found to be influenced by an A/G single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs25531) located upstream of the 5-HTTLPR promoter variant within the greater repeat structure.19 This has led to the distinction between the variants S, LA and LG, (tri-allelic classification of 5-HTTLPR) with the latter one being functionally similar to the S allele.19 In contrast to in vitro studies, results obtained in vivo appear to be less conclusive regarding allele-specific SERT mRNA expression in peripheral cells22,23 and SERT availability in the human brain.24, 25, 26 Environmentally-induced changes in SERT expression may partly account for the observed inconsistencies27 but have been sparsely addressed in humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Animal studies in various species provide first evidence that exposure to early adversity correlates with decreased SERT mRNA levels in the brain28,29 (but also see Gardner et al.30) and in peripheral cells.31 These long-term changes in SERT expression patterns may result from stable epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation.32 Recent studies using peripheral blood cells found that increased methylation levels within a 799-bp promoter-associated CpG island in SLC6A4 associate with both lower SERT mRNA levels23,33, 34, 35 and exposure to childhood trauma,23,36, 37, 38, 39 in some studies dependent on 5-HTTLPR genotype.40 Such peripheral measures of gene expression and DNA methylation profiles have been increasingly recognized as informative biomarkers in psychiatric research.41, 42, 43 Most important for the present study, epigenetic and transcriptional changes in response to environmental adversity appear to be system-wide44,45 and can thus potentially be tracked in easily obtainable blood cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to investigate joint effects of 5-HTTLPR and environmental adversity across different developmental stages (prenatal, early, recent trauma/stressors) on peripheral SERT mRNA expression and DNA methylation within the promoter-associated SERT CpG island. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>As a potential molecular pathway of GxE-mediated disease vulnerability, we expected to find lowest SERT mRNA and highest SERT methylation levels in individuals carrying both the genetic (S allele) and environmental (stress/trauma) risk factor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Studies investigating long-term transcriptional signatures of early adversity implicitly assume that gene expression profiles are characterized by a trait-like component with substantial differences between individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Prior studies have generally confirmed a considerable intraindividual stability of genome-wide gene expression patterns over hours and months; however, they have also highlighted that stability varies across individual transcripts.46,47 As intra- and interindividual variation in human SERT mRNA expression has, to the best of our knowledge, not explicitly been evaluated yet, we further conducted a small pilot study investigating respective patterns. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>In the light of overall conflicting findings on whether the 5-HTTLPR S allele conveys disease vulnerability upon environmental adversity,7,8 this study aimed to explore molecular modifications, which possibly mediate GxE interaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that both the S allele and prenatal/early adversity associate with decreased peripheral SERT mRNA levels in an additive manner and, remarkably, account for a comparable amount of variance in SERT expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>These effects appeared to be largely independent of methylation profiles within the SLC6A4 promoter-associated CpG island. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Our finding of lower SERT mRNA levels in S allele carriers closely parallels previous data from in vitro research2,19, 20, 21 but stands at variance with several brain imaging studies reporting mixed results regarding allele-specific SERT availability.24, 25, 26 Besides inconsistencies related to methodological aspects (see Willeit et al.62), SERT mRNA may simply reflect a more proximate measure of transcriptional activity than SERT availability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Indeed, research across different species has shown SERT mRNA to be subjected to complex post-transcriptional regulation, such as translational repression by miRNA.63, 64, 65 In addition, our findings implicate that differential exposure to early adversity may either overshadow or pronounce allele-specific effects on in vivo SERT mRNA expression (Figure 2) and may thus have contributed to previously observed discrepancies.22,23 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>To date, the link between environmental adversity and persistent changes in SERT mRNA profiles has almost exclusively been addressed in non-human research. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Specifically, maternal separation has been associated with lower raphé SERT mRNA levels in rodents28,29 and decreased SERT availability in non-human primates.66 Likewise, Rhesus macaques exposed to maternal aggression were found to have reduced SERT mRNA levels in peripheral blood cells, indicating that stress-induced changes of SERT expression are not limited to the brain.31 Our study complements and extends previous animal research by demonstrating long-term signatures of early adversity using easily accessible markers of human SERT expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Here, we provide first evidence for reduced SERT mRNA levels in individuals exposed to maternal prenatal stress or child maltreatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>This observation is strengthened by an inverse correlation between SERT mRNA levels and the magnitude of prenatal/early adversity within the overall sample. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, we observed no such effect for adult stressors/trauma, hinting towards a sensitive period in early development.67 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>Epigenetic modifications are considered a promising pathway mediating sustained changes of gene expression in response to early adversity.32 Methylation profiles within a 799-bp CpG island in SLC6A4 have recently been associated with SERT transcription and are further responsive to environmental influences.68 Several in vivo and in vitro studies found site-specific SERT methylation to promote gene silencing in transformed lymphoblast cell lines,23,33 peripheral blood mononucleated cells35 and buccal cells,34 in some studies depending on 5-HTTLPR.40 Our results tentatively concur with previous observations by demonstrating negative correlations of SERT methylation and mRNA expression for 10 out of 83 CpG sites investigated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>Although this association remained significant only for CpG9 after Bonferroni correction, the finding of 12% of CpG sites being functionally relevant on an uncorrected level is unlikely to result from chance (B(i⩾10|α=0.05, n=83) &lt;1%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Despite its putative role in transcriptional regulation, we found very limited evidence for SERT methylation mediating associations between environmental adversity and SERT mRNA expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Regarding childhood trauma, our study conflicts with previous reports linking site-specific SERT methylation to a history of sexual abuse,23,36,37 childhood trauma39 and bullying victimization.38 However, it is of note that no specific CpG site has yet been consistently associated with early adversity across previous studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Variable findings may result from diversity of used cell populations, examined subregions, methylation detection methods (for example, quantitative mass spectroscopy, Sequenom EpiTYPER platform, pyrosequencing), type of trauma and lack of correction for multiple testing. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Regarding prenatal stress, initial evidence has suggested a positive association between maternal depressed mood during the second trimester and the mean methylation within a subregion of the SERT CpG island (10 CpG sites).69 Whereas we observed no effect on the mean SERT methylation, individuals exposed to maternal prenatal stress were characterized by increased methylation levels at four CpG sites (Bonferroni-corrected at CpG30 and CpG9, at trend level). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Although it is tempting to suggest CpG9 methylation as a putative mediator of lower SERT mRNA levels in response to prenatal adversity, caution is advised when interpreting this finding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>A closer inspection of CpG9 (Figure 3b), but also of some relevant sites identified by previous studies, revealed that absolute methylation appears to be marginal, falling below the detection limit for the majority of individuals, and is thus unlikely to constitute a valid candidate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Against this background, candidate SERT CpG sites should be carefully selected in consideration of previously observed absolute methylation levels in future studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Elucidating the precise mechanism of CpG site-specific methylation mediating gene silencing, such as altered transcription factor binding, might further advance this selection process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>The lack of robust findings does not rule out the possibility that methylation patterns outside of the investigated region or epigenetic modifications other than methylation may have mediated effects of early adversity on SERT expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, genome-wide analyses have suggested the possibility that methylation patterns associated with gene expression are more likely to be located outside CpG islands.70 Supporting this notion, a recent study reports that methylation in the shore of the SERT CpG island upstream from exon 1A predicts SERT expression, thus identifying this region as a potential target for future studies.23 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Several limitations of the present study should be acknowledged. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>First, our findings rely on retrospective self-report measures of environmental adversity, which could be subject to bias. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>However, the finding of reduced SERT mRNA expression being a correlate of early adversity appears to be consistent across different sources of self-report. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, larger studies are needed to evaluate differential effects of specific types of stressors/trauma on SERT expression levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Second, findings of the present study that were obtained in a homogeneous sample of healthy young Caucasian individuals may not generalize to other ethnic groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Third, it remains to be elucidated whether findings obtained with peripheral markers of SERT expression and methylation profiles generalize to brain tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Despite being tissue-specific, post-mortem studies have revealed substantial correlations across peripheral and neural cells for both gene expression71 and DNA methylation patterns.72 Regarding SERT in particular, a recent brain imaging study73 indicates that peripheral SERT methylation is indeed an informative marker for in vivo serotonin synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Even more importantly, environmentally induced modifications in gene expression and methylation patterns appear to be system-wide44,45 supporting the usefulness of peripheral markers for the present study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Lastly, the choice of analyzing whole blood was motivated by the fact that it is readily available, allows to stabilize RNA at the time of blood draw and, importantly, does not require transformation known to modify methylation profiles.74 Despite these advantages, the heterogeneous mixture of cell types may constitute a potential confound, although expression levels of very few mRNA transcripts were found to depend on cell composition.47 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our findings raise the assumption of lower SERT mRNA expression being a correlate of both the 5-HTTLPR S allele and prenatal/early adversity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, individuals carrying both the genetic and one of the environmental risk factors were found to have 32.8% (maternal prenatal stress) and 56.3% (child maltreatment) lower SERT mRNA levels compared with those without any risk factor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Sustained alterations in SERT expression profiles may in turn relate to changes in serotonergic functioning and thus constitute a possible molecular pathway mediating disease vulnerability as a function of GxE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>In accordance with genome-wide transcriptomics analyses,46,47 preliminary evidence from our pilot study suggests that interindividual variability in SERT expression is substantially higher compared with intraindividual variation, thus highlighting the potential usefulness of this specific transcript as a biomarker. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Although not without inconsistencies,75, 76, 77 numerous studies indeed suggest that lower SERT expression in the brain and periphery associates with major depression,14, 15, 16 treatment efficacy14,78,79 and increased stress sensitivity.17,18 Since the mean age of onset for depression80 is slightly higher compared with the mean age of our sample, altered SERT expression levels could be discussed in terms of a premorbid risk factor for the development of stress-related psychopathology later in life. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Future evaluation of such putative biomarkers of disease vulnerability in longitudinal designs may not only shed light on the pathogenesis of stress-related psychopathology but may also bear important implications for predictive testing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>In line with this assumption, peripheral blood gene expression profiles measured in the third trimester of pregnancy have been found to reliably predict subsequent postpartum depression within a high-risk cohort.43 Moreover, peripheral markers of gene expression may help to identify unique disease-related transcriptional signatures associated with specific genetic and environmental risk factors as shown for post-traumatic stress disorder.42 </plain></SENT>
