</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Many human cancers display abnormal post-translational modifications of histones, including acetylation [1–4], and histone deacetylases (HDACs) are known to be aberrantly expressed in a variety of cancer cells [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that changes in histone modifications and histone deacetylase expression levels may be useful prognostic indicators of survival and recurrence in a variety of cancers [2–4, 6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Mammalian HDACs can be subdivided into two families: the classical HDAC family and the sirtuins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The classical HDACs are Zn2+ dependent enzymes: class I HDACs (HDACs 1, 2, 3, and 8) share homology to the yeast HDAC Rpd3 and are localized to the nucleus; class II HDACs are related to yeast Hda1 and shuttle between the cytosol and nucleus (HDAC 4, 5, 7, 9) or reside in the cytosol (HDAC 6, 10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>HDAC 11 (class IV), homologous to Hos3, resides in the cytosol and nucleus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Over the last 10–15 years a variety of natural and synthetic HDAC inhibitors have been developed, including hydroxamic acid derivatives, benzamides, short chain fatty acids, cyclic tetrapeptides, and electrophilic ketones. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Hydroxamic acid derivatives, including Trichostatin A (TSA), suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and CG-1521 (7-phenyl-2,4,6-hepta-trienoic hydroxamic acid), inhibit the classical family of HDACs by coordinating the catalytic site Zn2+, stabilizing the acetylation of histones and non-histone proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>This induces a variety of responses including cell cycle arrest, cell death, differentiation and senescence, depending on the cell lines and inhibitors used [7, 8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>HDACis are attractive agents because therapeutically active concentrations are minimally toxic to the host and transformed cells are more sensitive to HDACi-induced cell death than normal cells [9–12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>To date, two HDACis, SAHA and Romidepsin, a cyclic tetrapeptide, have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma [13, 14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Previous studies from our laboratory and others have demonstrated that hydroxamic acid-based HDACis have profound impacts on the biology of prostate and breast cancer cell lines, inducing growth arrest and apoptosis [15–19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The aim of the research reported here was to identify transcription factors that may be useful for novel therapeutic approaches in combination with HDAC inhibitors for hard-to-treat-cancers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>We have taken a systems biology approach, screening a Saccharomyces cerevisiae haploid single gene deletion library, to identify gene products that modulate the response to HDAC inhibition. S. cerevisiae is a valuable model organism for which there is a wide array of information available (including transcriptional profiling, interaction studies and synthetic genetic analysis) to use in analyzing new high throughput data sets [20–23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, histones and histone modifying enzymes show a high degree of sequence and functional conservation among eukaryotes [24–27]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Gene products of several other biological processes, including vacuolar acidification, vacuolar protein sorting, vesicle-mediated transport, DNA repair and cell cycle regulation (Figure 2, Additional file 2) predominantly decrease the sensitivity to CG-1521. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>The ability of HDACis to induce death in a variety of cell lines is well documented, however the mechanisms by which they exert their effects are incompletely understood [34–36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Since many biological processes are regulated by acetylation [37], we have used a yeast deletion library screen to gain insights into the cell growth inhibition mechanisms of HDAC inhibitors and to identify novel targets for combination treatments with the HDACi CG-1521. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>Choosing S. cerevisiae as a model organism decreases the complexity, however the high degree of functional homology among eukaryotes enables the identification of pathways that are important in the response to CG-1521. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>For example, mitotic analysis after exposure to TSA shows disruption of centromeric heterochromatin, mitotic delay and chromosome segregation defects in both fission yeast [38, 39] and mammalian cells [40, 41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Eukaryotic cells have varied responses to HDACis, which in mammalian cells is partially dictated by the p53 status of the cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>For example, treatment of LNCaP prostate cancer cells, which express wild-type p53, with CG-1521 induces G2/M arrest and apoptosis [15]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Deletion of additional genes associated with vacuolar acidification, the vacuolar proton-transporting V-type ATPase complex and vacuolar transport also renders yeast cells sensitive to CG-1521. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Strains lacking components of the Gcn5 HAT complexes are very sensitive to CG-1521. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Deletion of any of the four components of the histone acetyltransferase module (Sgf29, Ngg1, Ada2 or Gcn5) renders S. cerevisiae sensitive to CG-1521 and deletion of components of the SPT module (Spt3, Spt7, Spt8, Spt20, Hfi1) also results in increased sensitivity to CG-1521. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>As the Taf module components (Taf5, Taf6, Taf9, Taf10 and Taf12) and Tra1 are essential for cell survival, it is not possible to determine whether deletion of these proteins also confers sensitivity to CG-1521. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Ubp8 and Sgf11 are part of a discrete functional module within the SAGA complex as suggested by genetic interaction and microarray analysis [43] and Ubp8 is dispensable at promoters of several SAGA-dependent genes [44]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Since Rtg2 is required for SLIK integrity [53], this suggests that the SLIK complex is not necessary for eliciting a response to CG-1521. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>In addition, deletion of ADA (Ahc1, Ahc2) specific components does not sensitize cells to CG-1521, indicating that it is the SAGA complex, rather than ADA or SLIK complexes, that reduces the growth-inhibitory effects of CG-1521. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>The SAGA complex may also act as physical adapter independent of Gcn5 and recruit TBP through Spt3 and Spt8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>For example, it has been shown that H3 acetylation and HAT activity at the Gal1 promoter are not necessary for the formation of the pre-initiation complex, however pre-initiation complex assembly on the Pho84 promoter requires Gcn5 activity [44, 46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Gene expression analysis also demonstrates that expression of distinct sets of genes is dependent on individual SAGA subunits [54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Thus it appears that the requirement for Gcn5 activity is gene specific, suggesting that genes that require Gcn5 for their transcription are required to ameliorate the effect of CG-1521. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that other functions of Gcn5, besides the catalytic activity, influence the response to CG-1521 since catalytic site mutation does not confer the same extent of sensitivity as GCN5 deletion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>The bromodomain of Gcn5 may recruit the HAT complex to acetylated histones. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Studies in mice also indicate that there is a difference between gene deletion and catalytic site mutation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>These and results presented here indicate that Gcn5 has important functions that are independent of its HAT activity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which CG-1521 elicits its growth-inhibitory action is probably multifactorial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>As an HDAC inhibitor it differentially regulates gene expression and influences activity, stability, and assembly of protein complexes through protein acetylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Similarly, it is likely that the SAGA complex components, including Gcn5, regulate multiple pathways in response to CG-1521, which protect the cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Potential targets of CG-1521 that may account for the sensitivity of the gcn5Δ strain were analyzed through identification of negative genetic interactions with GCN5 deletion that display insensitivity to CG-1521. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Gene ontology analysis of deletion strains that are insensitive to CG-1521 and are synthetic lethal with GCN5 deletion shows an enrichment in processes like chromatin modification, transcriptional regulation, histone acetylation, DNA repair and response to stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Notably, deletion of components of the Rpd3 histone deacetylase complexes (Rpd3, Ash1, Pho23, Rxt2, Sap30, Sds3, Sin3 and Eaf3) results in negative genetic interactions with GCN5 deletion, suggesting that the inhibition of Rpd3 by CG-1521 may contribute to the sensitivity of the gcn5Δ strain to CG-1521. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>The CG-1521-sensitive SAGA deletion mutants ada2Δ, ngg1Δ, spt3Δ, spt7Δ, spt8Δ, spt20Δ and hfi1Δ show a severe fitness defect or lethality when combined with RPD3 deletion [43, 56–59]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>GCN5/PCAF also directly acetylate Myc resulting in increased protein stability [69], which may provide a positive feedback loop through GCN5 upregulation and further Myc stabilization. </plain></SENT>
