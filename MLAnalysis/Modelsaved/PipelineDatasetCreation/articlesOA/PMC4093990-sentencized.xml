</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>In assisted reproduction treatment (ART) an optimal response to controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) is of crucial importance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Both too low an ovarian response and too high an ovarian response are associated with increased cancellation rates and lower pregnancy rates, and previous literature suggests an optimal range of oocytes below and above which outcomes are compromised (van der Gaast et al., 2006; Sunkara et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>A high ovarian response may also increase the risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (Papanikolaou et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>For this reason it is clinically relevant to identify predictors of ovarian response that may enable clinicians to identify patients at risk of a too high or too low ovarian response and to individualize COS treatment for these patients (Fauser et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Moreover, such individualization could be more cost-effective as it could both increase the efficacy and reduce the costs of ART. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Many studies have been conducted in the field of ovarian response prediction during the last 10 years (Popovic-Todorovic et al., 2003) and various predictors for low ovarian response have been proposed (Hendriks et al., 2005; Verberg et al., 2007). Broekmans et al (2006) performed a systematic review of these tests and found that antral follicle count (AFC) and basal FSH had the best sensitivity and specificity for predicting low ovarian response, with the recent addition of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) as possibly the most reliable predictor (Broer et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>More recently, predictors for a high ovarian response have also been identified, with AMH and AFC demonstrating similar sensitivity and specificity (Broer et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>However, it should be noted that the majority of this research has been performed in the context of GnRH agonist protocols. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>The introduction of GnRH antagonists to prevent premature LH rises during COS and the gradual shift of current care from long GnRH agonist to short GnRH antagonist protocols (Kolibianakis et al., 2006; Al-Inany et al., 2011) have prompted the need for research on the predictability of ovarian response in GnRH antagonist cycles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>A recent prospective study including patients with and without oral contraceptive pretreatment indicated that AMH and basal FSH are statistically significant predictors of both the number of oocytes retrieved and the occurrence of an excessive ovarian response, whereas AMH alone was the main predictor for low ovarian response (Nyboe Andersen et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The aim of this paper is to identify prognostic factors for high and low ovarian responses in COS using the GnRH antagonist protocol. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>With the identified predictors, simple prognostic models for low and excessive response are constructed from which patient-specific probabilities for either outcome can be derived, as the basis for studies on FSH starting dose adjustment. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Data from the rFSH arm (750 subjects) of this study were used to construct the models for predicting high and low ovarian responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The data used in the current analyses reflect minor corrections to the previously published Engage trial data (Devroey et al., 2009) (see corrigendum Devroey et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Xpect [NCT00778999] was a multinational trial to identify prognostic factors for an ovarian response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Subjects were randomized to receive either OC pretreatment or no OC pretreatment prior to their COS cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>A treatment regimen of 200 IU rFSH and 0.25 mg GnRH antagonist was applied during the COS cycle (i.e. the same as in the daily rFSH arm of the Engage study). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>The intention-to-treat population consisted of 408 subjects of similar age and body weight as in Engage (mean, 31.7 years and 64.8 kg, respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Data from the non-OC arm (199 subjects) were used to validate the models for high and low ovarian responses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>The two studies had similar inclusion and exclusion criteria which allowed only patients with regular menstrual cycles to be included and were conducted in the same time frame (2006–2007 for Engage and 2006–2008 for Xpect). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Ethnicity was also similar in Engage (86.7% White, 3.6% Black, 2.8% Asian; 6.8% ‘Other’) and Xpect (91.5% White, 2.0% Black, 5.0% Asian; 1.5% ‘Other’). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Finally, both studies included subjects from Europe (n = 347 and n = 101 in the relevant arms of Engage and Xpect, respectively) as well as North America (n = 403 and n = 98 in Engage and Xpect, respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Validated immunoassays were performed at a central laboratory to measure serum levels of FSH, LH, inhibin B, estradiol (E2) and progesterone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Levels of FSH, LH, E2 and progesterone were determined by time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (AutoDelfia® immunofluorometric assay, PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Brussels, Belgium) with a coefficient of variation of 10%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Detection limits were 0.25 IU/l, 0.6 IU/l, 49.9 pmol/l and 0.38 ng/ml for FSH, LH, E2 and progesterone, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Serum inhibin B levels were determined by using a validated immunoassay by Diagnostic Systems Laboratories (DSL; Webster, TX, USA) with a coefficient of variation of 10% and a detection limit of 10.0 pg/ml. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Since prognostic factors for a high ovarian response may be different from those for a low ovarian response, separate logistic regression models were constructed for these two end-points. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Age was included in both models by default. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Other candidate prognostic factors or covariates were as follows: Age at menarche (years).Average menstrual cycle length (days).Duration of infertility (years).Alcohol use (self-reported; yes/no).Smoking status (self-reported; yes/no).BMI at baseline (kg/m2).FSH at Day 1 of stimulation (IU/l).LH at Day 1 of stimulation (IU/l).E2 at Day 1 of stimulation (pmol/l).Progesterone at Day 1 of stimulation (nmol/l).Inhibin B at Day 1 of stimulation (pg/ml).AFC at Day 1 of stimulation (number of follicles &lt;11 mm).Total ovarian volume (ml).Study region (North America versus Europe).Previous IVF/ICSI (yes/no).For each candidate prognosticator, the association with a high or low ovarian response was assessed using the χ2 test (i.e. the score test in a logistic regression model). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>After the inclusion of age, covariates were selected using forward selection (P &lt; 0.15 for entry). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Backward elimination (P &gt; 0.15 for removal) confirmed the covariate selection for the final model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>The number of subjects with missing values for the covariates selected in the final models was limited: 66 in Engage and 26 in Xpect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Missing data were mainly for hormones (54 and 26 subjects in Engage and Xpect, respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>The fact of whether data were missing or not was not associated with a high or low ovarian response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>All subjects were included in the final models with missing covariate values imputed using linear regression (with covariates for age and region), if applicable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>No other imputation of missing data was performed, except for setting hormone levels below the lower limit of detection to 0.5 times than the lower limit (as is common practice). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>First-order interaction terms and quadratic terms were tested, but not found to be statistically significant. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>For the final logistic regression model for a high or low ovarian response the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted and the area under the curve (AUC, or c-statistic) was calculated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>The ‘optimal’ point on the ROC curve is the one that provides the best trade-off between sensitivity and specificity (i.e. the point that is closest in distance to the upper left-hand corner where sensitivity and specificity are equal to 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Associated with this point is the ‘optimal’ probability cut-off that provides the best balance between false positives and false negatives for a high (or low) ovarian response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>If the predicted probability for a given patient exceeded this optimal cut-off the patient was predicted to become a high (or low) ovarian responder, otherwise not. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value at the optimal cut-off were calculated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>These characteristics are data driven and presumably too optimistic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>For this reason the calculated values were denoted as ‘apparent’ AUC, sensitivity, etc. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Optimism-corrected values were calculated using leave-one-out cross-validation, i.e. the regression coefficients associated with the ‘final model’ were re-estimated with each subject left out in turn. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>We then combined the ‘leave-one-out’ regression coefficient with the subject's covariate values in order to mimic the prediction of the outcome for each subject. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Finally, a logistic regression model was fitted with the resulting ‘leave-one-out’ prognostic index (PI) as the only covariate in order to obtain the optimism-corrected AUC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Histograms displaying the distribution of the predicted probabilities were plotted separately for high or low ovarian responders and non-high (non-low) responders. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Score charts (Hunault et al., 2004) were constructed for easier application of the two models. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>A vital aspect of prediction is that a model derived from one data set can be transported to another. ‘The idea of validating a prognostic model is generally taken to mean establishing that it works satisfactorily for patients other than those from whose data the model was derived’ (Altman and Royston, 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>External model validation was based on the non-OC arm of the Xpect study (Nyboe Andersen et al., 2011) and focused on two aspects: discrimination and calibration (Leushuis et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Discrimination is the ability of the model to distinguish between subjects with and without the event of interest, in this case between patients with a high or low ovarian response and patients without a high or low response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Discrimination was measured by the area under the ROC curve, the c-statistic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>This statistic ranges from 0.5 (no discrimination) to 1 (perfect discrimination) and can be interpreted as the probability that for any discordant pair of subjects (i.e. one subject with the event and one without), the subject with the event has a higher predicted probability than the subject without the event (Harrell et al., 1996). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Calibration refers to correspondence between the predicted probabilities for a high or low ovarian response and the observed proportions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Calibration was assessed visually by comparing predicted probabilities and observed proportions after dividing patients in 10 groups based on their predicted probability and, more formally, by fitting a logistic regression model with a single covariate for the so-called PI, a linear combination of the subject's covariate values and the associated regression coefficients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Ideally, the regression coefficient of the PI is close to 1 and the intercept is close to 0. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Usually the regression coefficient is &lt;1, indicating that the impact of the prognostic factors is less strong in new data: the well-known shrinkage phenomenon (Copas, 1983). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>The present study confirms the ability of prior prediction of high and low responders to COS using a GnRH antagonist for LH rise prevention. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>The common prognostic factors for high and low ovarian responses were female age, AFC and basal serum FSH and LH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>In conjunction, these factors provide sufficiently accurate response prediction models for studies on individualized tailoring of the FSH stimulation dosage. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>The importance of AFC and basal FSH, as well as female age, is in line with data from long GnRH agonist protocols (Broekmans et al., 2006; Fauser et al., 2008; Broer et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Although AFC and basal FSH may both relate to the quantity of FSH-sensitive follicles, their independent contribution to at least the prediction of low response has been demonstrated in several studies (Verhagen et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>The estimate of overall sensitivity and specificity of published prediction models for a low ovarian response, based on the summary ROC curve in a published meta-analysis (Verhagen et al., 2008), clearly matched the findings for the currently presented model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>For exaggerated response prediction, formal multifactor prediction models have not been published, as most of the attention has focused on single-test predictors, such as AMH and AFC (Broer et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>The association between LH and ovarian hypo- and hyper-response has not been identified previously. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>A limited number of studies have included LH levels in an LH/FSH ratio, with the purpose of assessing its value for outcome prediction (Mukherjee et al., 1996; Shrim et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>However, a formal meta-analysis of these studies is lacking, and its value seems limited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>The association between elevated LH levels and polycystic ovary syndrome may explain the current findings, although a more linear relation with the number of antral follicles is clearly absent for this factor. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>The inclusion of study region in the model for a high ovarian response improves predictions, but lacks any biological rationale, other than a possible imbalance in predictive factors between European and North American populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated whether the region effect could be explained by other factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>It appeared that there were differences between regions, but only for covariates that were not included in the model: smoking status (Europe versus North America: 13.6 versus 4.8%), serum progesterone at Day 1 of stimulation (median 1.6 versus 1.8 nmol/l) and total ovarian volume (median 9.5 versus 13.7 ml). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Forced inclusion of these factors in the model did not eliminate the effect of study region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>The only remaining explanation is that study region captures differences in variables that have not been specifically recorded, for example the oocyte retrieval procedure. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>The fact that the present findings and those of a previous report (Nyboe Andersen et al., 2011) clearly confirms the predictability of ovarian response categories in antagonist co-treatment cycles is an important finding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>In view of the differences in the way the ovaries are exposed to exogenous FSH, the possibility was expressed that submaximal stimulation could undermine the predictability by factors such as AMH and AFC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Assuming that these factors would correctly indicate the number of FSH-sensitive follicles, increased variation in the proportion of follicles that will indeed grow and deliver an oocyte in antagonist cycles could create a possible source for inaccuracy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Apparently, the proportional relation between cohort size at initiation of stimulation and the oocyte yield at the end of the track is not different when agonist and antagonist cycles are compared, though a systematic difference in oocyte yield has been firmly demonstrated for these two treatment approaches (Al-Inany et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>No uniform definitions were available for excessive and a low ovarian response at the time of writing of this paper. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>We have used &gt;18 and &lt;6 oocytes for high and low ovarian responses, respectively (Ferraretti et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Alternative definitions for high ovarian (&gt;15 rather than &gt;18 oocytes) and low ovarian responses (&lt;5 rather than &lt;6 oocytes) were explored, but the same variables were selected with similar regression coefficients (results not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>The best operative definition for either response type ultimately depends on the way a diagnostic category (for example ‘low responder’) will lead to a certain change in management. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Current understanding points towards the range of 6–14 oocytes as the range of optimal response associated with the highest probability of a live birth (Sunkara et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Certainly, the optimal limits may further be affected by the risk of complications, such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, and the likelihood that, in cases with a predicted response outside of this range, adjusted management can alter the outcome to a response in the normal range. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Expectations here may be more optimistic regarding prevention of an excessive response than for a low response (Klinkert et al., 2005; Lekamge et al., 2008; Olivennes, 2010; Jayaprakasan et al., 2012; Nelson et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>The strength of the prediction models presented here is that both were validated in an independent study, showing good discrimination and calibration in a cohort of comparable patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>The prediction model included both FSH and LH, which were both consistently measured by a central laboratory using the same immunoassays. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Due to the well-known differences between commercial gonadotrophin immunoassays, the external value of the model may become slightly different if other commercial FSH and LH assays are applied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>A weakness is the absence in the models of AMH, a factor that had a high prognostic value in agonist cycles (Broer et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>When modelling high and low response based on the Xpect study, where AMH was collected, this parameter turned out to be predictive for both high and low ovarian responses, replacing AFC in the models (Nyboe Andersen et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Although AMH has appeared to be a solid biomarker of ovarian reserve with a considerable degree of intra- and inter-cycle consistency (Hehenkamp et al., 2006; van Disseldorp et al., 2010), the AMH assay suffers from a certain degree of variability that may hamper reliable predictions of ovarian response (Rustamov et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>One of the sources of this variation is the between-sample variation during one or subsequent menstrual cycles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>This variation has appeared to be quite substantial, specifically in younger women (Overbeek et al., 2012; Rustamov et al., 2012) and is believed to represent biological fluctuation parallel to fluctuation in antral follicle numbers (van Disseldorp et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Moreover, nomograms or prognostic models should be based on studies where the samples have been measured by the same AMH immunoassay to ensure accurate predictions (Nelson and La Marca, 2011). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Based on the present findings and studies in agonist cycles, AMH and AFC may serve as highly overlapping predictors, with currently no definite conclusion as to the factor with the highest performance (Broer et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>The lack of AMH as a factor in the model may not be permanent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Prognostic models may be updated when new predictors or tests become available and techniques for quick updating (as opposed to extensive model revisions) exist (Steyerberg et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Another large trial in patients undergoing COS using a GnRH antagonist protocol has been completed recently [Pursue (NCT01144416)]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Since this trial is similar to Engage in design and sample size and includes AMH assessments, an update of the presented models may be indicated in due course. </plain></SENT>
