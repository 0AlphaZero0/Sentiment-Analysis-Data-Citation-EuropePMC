[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The estuarine tapertail anchovy (<italic>Coilia nasus</italic>, junior synonym <italic>C. ectenes</italic>) is widely distributed in the Yangtze River, the coastal waters of China, Korea, and the Ariake Sound of Japan
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It is a commercially important species owing to its nutritional value and delicate flavor. However, <italic>Coilia nasus</italic> is strongly responsive to stress, this often results in death, which causes huge losses. Currently, little is known of the mechanism by which loading stress causes death in fish. In this study, we used next-generation sequencing technologies to study gene expression changes in response to loading stress and the mechanism of death caused by loading stress in <italic>Coilia nasus</italic>.</p><p>Recently, several species-specific cDNA microarrays have been developed for teleosts, and they are being used increasingly to reveal global gene expression patterns in response to stressor exposure and/or hormone treatment
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These studies in fish have revealed that the majority of changes, inspite of the use of different arrays and different types of acute stressor, can be broadly categorized functionally into genes encoding proteins involved in metabolism, immune function and reproduction. Although these studies have identified several genes that were previously not known to be stress responsive, the significance of these observed transcript changes to overall stress adaptation is far from clear.</p><p>While the previous studies that used various microarray platforms in fish were limited by large representation of expressed sequence tags (EST), which made gene-specific interpretation of the data difficult, the advent of next-generation sequencing methods, including pyrosequencing, has effectively overcome this limitation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Rapid progress in next-generation sequencing technologies has allowed large-scale efficient and economical production of ESTs.

One of the evolutionarily conserved stress responses is the rapid elevation in plasma cortisol and plasma glucose levels in response to stressor challenges
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In teleosts, the production of cortisol is under the control of the hypothalamus&#8211;pituitary&#8211;adrenal (HPA) axis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Cortisol is released from the adrenal tissue, resulting in up-regulation of the plasma glucose level. Therefore, plasma cortisol and plasma glucose can be used as indicators of the stress response. In our experiment, these parameters were significantly elevated in the stressed fish when compared with the control fish (Figure&#160;
<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), this suggested that our sample could be used for transcriptome sequencing.</p><p>We found that 2,990 genes were significantly up-regulated, while 3,416 genes were significantly down-regulated in response to loading stress (Figure&#160;
<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). On pathway enrichment analysis, &#8220;metabolism&#8221; and &#8220;immunity&#8221; were the two most frequently represented categories. In the &#8220;metabolism&#8221; category, &#8220;carbohydrate metabolism&#8221; and &#8220;lipid metabolism&#8221; were major subclasses, and included the &#8220;glycolysis/gluconeogenesis&#8221;, &#8220;starch and sucrose metabolism&#8221;, &#8220;glycerophospholipid metabolism&#8221; and &#8220;fat digestion and absorption&#8221; pathways. These carbohydrate metabolic pathways are mainly involved in blood glucose elevation (gluconeogenesis) and glucose utilization (glycolysis). The transcriptional expression of the rate-limiting enzymes (glucose-6-phosphatase and glucokinase) in this process was detected by RT-qPCR, both enzymes were significantly increased following stress (Figure&#160;
<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In addition, plasma glucose levels were significantly elevated after stress (Figure&#160;
<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B), which provided further confirmation of the findings. These results are in agreement with studies that have reported higher activities of glycolytic enzymes after exposure to an acute stressor in fish, this may be necessary to cope with the increased energy demand of the liver, including enhanced gluconeogenesis, that is required to re-establish homeostasis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Those two lipid metabolism pathways are involved mainly in fat digestion, absorption and oxidation. Transcript levels for the rate-limiting enzymes (hormone-sensitive lipase and carnitine actyltransferase I) in adipokinetic activity and the fatty acid beta-oxidation process were also significantly increased after stress.</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that molecular regulation of enzymes critical for energy substrate mobilization and utilization is a key mechanism involved in acute stress adaptation in fish. However, problems may be associated with these processes, for example, the fatty acid beta-oxidation process may produce lipid peroxides (LPO)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. High levels of LPO or plasma glucose may induce an increase in TNF-&#945;
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. It is now well accepted that trimerization of the respective receptor by TNF leads to the assembly of the death-initiating signaling complex (disc)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The disc consists of the death domain of the receptor, one or several associated proteins, and procaspase-8. Upon assembly of the disc, procaspase-8 is autocatalytically cleaved and activated
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The active caspase-8 can either process downstream effector caspases such as caspase-3, -6, and -7 directly
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] or activate mitochondria as an amplification mechanism
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. If mitochondria are involved, caspase-8 cleaves bid, a protein of the Bcl-2 family
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The C-terminal portion of the bid molecule inserts into the outer mitochondrial membrane and induces the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Cytochrome c, together with dATP, apoptosis activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) and procaspase-9, forms the apoptosome, which leads to the activation of caspase-9 and subsequently caspase-3
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Caspase-3 and other effector caspases cleave death substrates, leading to apoptosis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In our study, the levels of TNF-&#945;, caspase 9, cytochrome c and caspase 3 in the liver were significantly elevated in the stressed fish compared with the control fish (Table&#160;
<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). ALT and AST are important indicators of liver injury, and were also significantly elevated (Figure&#160;
<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). These lines of evidence suggested that loading stress induces liver cell apoptosis mediated by TNF-&#945;, which causes liver injury.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In the present study, using Illumina sequencing and bioinformatics analysis we analyzed the liver transcriptome of <italic>Coilia nasus</italic> that were stressed by loading. The main objective of this study was to annotate genes from this transcriptome analysis and identify potential stress gene and signaling pathways. On the basis of the transcriptome date, we explored the mechanism by which loading stress causes death in <italic>Coilia nasus</italic>. A total of 65,129 unigenes were generated, the mean unigene size and N50 were 607&#160;bp and 813&#160;bp, respectively. Of the assembled unigenes, we identified 2,990 genes that were significantly up-regulated, while 3,416 genes were significantly down-regulated in response to loading stress. Pathway enrichment analysis based on loading stress-responsive unigenes identified significantly stress-related pathways. &#8220;Metabolism&#8221; and &#8220;immunity&#8221; were the two most frequently represented categories. In the &#8220;metabolism&#8221; category, &#8220;glucose metabolism&#8221; and &#8220;lipid metabolism&#8221; were the major subclasses. The transcriptional expression of rate-limiting enzymes in &#8220;glucose metabolism&#8221; and &#8220;lipid metabolism&#8221; was investigated by RT-qPCR, all were significantly increased following stress. Apoptosis-associated proteins TNF-&#945;, caspase 9, cytochrome c and caspase 3 were significantly elevated in the stressed group, indicators of liver injury (ALT and AST) were also significantly elevated, which indicates that loading stress induces liver injury in this fish.</p><sec id="Sec20"><title>Availability of supporting data</title><p>Raw sequencing data is available through the NCBI Sequence Read Archive under Project Accession SRP034828 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>).
