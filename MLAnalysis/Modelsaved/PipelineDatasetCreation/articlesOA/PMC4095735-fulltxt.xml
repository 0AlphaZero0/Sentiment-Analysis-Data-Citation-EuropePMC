Introduction</title><p>Transcription factors can bind to specific<italic> cis</italic>-elements in gene promoter regions. Through the activation or inhibition effects on gene expression, they play important roles in regulation of plant growth and development and morphogenesis, as well as responses to environment stimuli [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. To date, the database of rice transcription factors (DRTF) contains 2,025 putative transcription factors (TF) in<italic> Oryza sativa</italic> L. ssp.<italic> indica</italic> and 2,384 in<italic> Oryza sativa</italic> L. ssp.<italic> japonica</italic>, distributed in 63 families [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The main transcription factor families among them (over 100 family members in<italic> indica/japonica</italic>) are AP2/EREBP (174/182), bHLH (157/184), bZIP (88/109), C2H2 (94/113), HB (84/103), MYB (136/138), NAC (157/149), and WRKY (111/113).</p><p>The Homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) genes have diverse functions in plant development and have often been implicated in stress adaptation [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The HD-Zip genes are the most abundant group of homeobox (HB) genes in plants and do not exist in other eukaryotes [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A typical DNA binding domain of homeobox proteins contains 60 amino acids, known as homeodomain. The homeodomain folds into a characteristic 3D structure containing three alpha-helices, of which the second and third forma helix-turn-helix motif recognize and interact with specific DNA sequences as homodimers [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Agalou et al. identified 33 HD-Zip genes in rice and classified them into family I (14 genes), family II (14 genes), and family III (5 genes) [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The HD-Zip IV family in other higher plants has been previously described [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>S&#246;derman et al. first identified an HD protein ATHB-7 from<italic> Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, which was highly induced by salt, osmotic stress, and ABA treatment [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Later, Leeand Chun identified Athb-12, which shares over 80% identity with ATHB-7 in their homeodomain and Zip motifs [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Expression of<italic> Athb-12</italic> was induced by water stress and exogenous abscisic acid (ABA). Another HD-Zip gene,<italic> ATHB6, </italic>was expressed constitutively in seedlings but significantly upregulated in seedlings subjected to water deficit, osmotic stress, or exogenous treatment with ABA [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Athb-12 was also isolated by functional complementation of the NaCl-sensitive phenotype of a calcineurin (CaN-) deficient yeast mutant and it could increase NaCl tolerance but not osmotic stress tolerance of these mutant cells if expressed [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Zhu et al. isolated an<italic> Arabidopsis mutant hos9-1</italic> and suggested that HOS9 mediates cold tolerance through a CBF-independent pathway [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Beside the model plant<italic> Arabidopsis</italic>, a number of HD-Zip proteins involved in abiotic stress response were also identified in the last decade from diverse crop plants. An HD-Zip protein was identified closely related to low temperature stress in hot pepper (<italic>Capsicum annuum L.</italic>) [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. HAHB4 belongs to the sunflower HD-Zip proteins subfamily I and is involved in drought response and ethylene-mediated senescence [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In cotton, the GhHB1 was isolated from a cotton root cDNA library. The expression level of the GhHB1 gene was dramatically increased in roots under treatment with 1% NaCl and exogenous abscisic acid [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Expression of<italic> Nicotiana attenuata </italic>NaHD20 was induced by multiple stress-associated stimuli including drought and wounding. It was predicted to be involved in leaf ABA accumulation during water stress, benzylacetone emission from flowers, and the timing of bolting and flower transitions [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Several drought-related members of the HD-Zip gene family were also characterized [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Rice is one of the most important food crops in the world, feeding half of the world's population. Salt and drought are two major abiotic stresses for agricultural production [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. With a relatively small genome size, rice is an ideal model plant for molecular and genetic research. It is critical to identify the roles of stress-induced genes in order to develop transgenic crops that have enhanced tolerance to unfavorable growth conditions or help breeding programs by molecular assistant selection [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>In the present study,<italic> OsSLI1</italic> encoding a member of HD-Zip I subfamily was analyzed. Expression of<italic> OsSLI1</italic> was regulated by panicle development and dramatically induced by salt, drought, and ABA treatment.

Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec3.1"><title>3.1. OsSLI1 Belongs to HD-Zip Family</title><p>Through a microarray approach (data not shown), an EST probe (ID: Os.49245.1.S1_at) was found with high induction levels in two-week-old rice seedlings by 100&#8201;mM NaCl (227-fold induction), 50&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>M ABA (174-fold induction), and 20% (w/v) PEG6000 (134.5-fold induction). This EST was chosen for further research due to its dramatic expression increase under abiotic stress treatments. Database searching showed that this EST sequence encodes a putative homeodomain containing protein. Here, we named this gene<italic> OsSLI1 stress largely induced 1</italic> as its expression is largely induced by multiple abiotic stresses and ABA treatment.</p><p>To elucidate the function of<italic> OsSLI1</italic>, the full-length<italic> OsSLI1</italic> cDNA was amplified from rice by RT-PCR.<italic> OsSLI1 </italic>is located on chromosome 2. The 783&#8201;bp ORF was predicted to produce a 261 amino acids protein with the calculated molecular mass of 28.54&#8201;kDa and the PI of 4.61. Putative conserved domains were detected through BLAST program of NCBI, including a 56-AA HD domain (65&#8211;121) for DNA binding and a 43-AA Zip domain (122&#8211;164) for protein-protein interactions. Previously, Agalou et al. investigated HD-Zip gene family in rice, confirmed 31 expressed genes of the total 33 family members, and assigned 14 of them, including<italic> OsSLI1 </italic>into HD-Zip I subfamily [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Multiple stress-related HD-Zip protein sequences were collected to perform multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Sequence alignment showed that HD domain and Zip domain are highly conserved among all the 12 proteins. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that OsSLI1 was highly close to MtHB2 and Oshox22. Previous study suggests that MtHB2, which were identified from<italic> Medicago truncatula</italic>, may play a negative role in regulation of abiotic stress response in<italic> Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, Oshox22 affects ABA biosynthesis and regulates drought and salt responses through ABA-mediated signal transduction pathways with a positive role [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These results indicate that HD-ZIP proteins may play different roles in stress responses in plants.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>3.2. Expression of OsSLI1 in Different Rice Tissues</title><p>For tissue specific expression analysis, root and shoot tissues from two-week-old seedlings were collected. Booting stage leaves (Leaf), leave sheath (LS), and panicles with the lengths of 3&#8201;cm (P1), 8&#8201;cm (P2), and 12&#8201;cm (P3) were also collected from unstressed field grown plants. Quantitative RT-PCR result showed that, in the seedlings,<italic> OsSLI1</italic> expression was mainly in root. The root tissue accumulates 7 times of<italic> OsSLI1</italic> transcripts than in shoot tissue. In panicles, the expression changes in different development stages, from relative low in 3&#8201;cm young panicles to a 33-fold increase in 8&#8201;cm panicles, and the 12&#8201;cm panicles still accumulate 8-fold<italic> OsSLI1</italic> transcripts compared to 3&#8201;cm young panicles tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>It is interesting that<italic> OsSLI1</italic> transcript accumulates much more in reproduction organs compared to other tissues in rice.

The production of the first opened buds was delayed in NaHD20-silenced plants; the number was also significantly reduced [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

Coexpression Analysis</title><p>A total of 96 positively coexpressed genes and one negatively coexpressed gene were selected with Pearson's correlation coefficient higher than 0.6 from the<italic> OsSLI1 </italic>coexpression gene data by rice array database. Coexpression analysis by Genevestigator discovered 35 genes positively coexpressed with<italic> OsSLI1</italic>. Six genes were found in both results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>). Five of the six genes showed upregulated response to all three abiotic stresses. Only LOC_Os06g41360, a phosphoribosyltransferase, was slightly induced by drought and salt treatments and inhibited by cold stress. For the other five genes, one gene (LOC_Os07g05940) encodes NCED, a key enzyme in ABA biosynthesis pathway showed upregulation by cold. The top 2 genes with a higher PCC value encode protein phosphatase 2C, which negatively regulate ABA signaling at an early step in the pathway [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The result of coexpression analysis suggests the potential function of<italic> OsSLI1</italic> in ABA related stress response in rice.</p><p>To investigate whether those coexpressed genes are the targets of OsSL1, we analyzed the existences of putative HD-ZIP binding sites (CAATNATTG) in promoter regions of 96 coexpressed genes. We only found that one gene (LOC_Os02g54254) may contain the putative HD-ZIP binding site in its promoter region. Therefore, most of the coexpressed genes may not be the direct targets of OsSL1.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Conclusion</title><p>The plant-specific homeodomain-leucine zipper type I (HD-Zip I) proteins play important roles in plant development and stress responses. In this research,<italic> OsSLI1</italic> encoding an HD-ZIP I protein was isolated from rice. Time-course expression analysis indicated that<italic> OsSLI1 </italic>expression was induced very quickly and dramatically by various abiotic stresses including salt, drought, osmotic treatment, and exogenous abscisic acid. The promoter sequence of<italic> OsSLI1</italic> harbors several<italic> cis</italic>-elements including high density of ABA-responsive elements, but the well-known CRT/DREB element is much less. Further, it was found that<italic> OsSLI1 </italic>expression was enhanced in an ABI5-Like1 (ABL1) deficiency mutant<italic> abl1</italic> under both normal and stress conditions, suggesting that ABL1 probably negatively regulates<italic> OsSLI1</italic> gene expression. It was found that<italic> OsSLI1</italic> was also regulated in panicle development. The OsSLI1-GFP fusion protein was localized in the nucleus of rice protoplast cell. Yeast hybrid assays revealed that OsSLI1 had transcription activation activity, indicating that OsSLI1 functions as a transcription activator. Taken together,<italic> OsSLI1 </italic>may be a transcriptional activator regulating stress-responsive gene expression and panicle development in rice. Further studies with<italic> OsSLI1</italic> transgenic plants will be necessary to elucidate the roles of OsSLI1 in stress responses and panicle development in rice.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the National Science Foundation of China (31071069 and 91335106), the State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology (no. 110101), the 111 Project, and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central University (no.
