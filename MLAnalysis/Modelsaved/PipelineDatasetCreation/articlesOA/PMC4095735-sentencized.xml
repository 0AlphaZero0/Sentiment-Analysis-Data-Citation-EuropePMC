<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>To date, the database of rice transcription factors (DRTF) contains 2,025 putative transcription factors (TF) in Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica and 2,384 in Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica, distributed in 63 families [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The main transcription factor families among them (over 100 family members in indica/japonica) are AP2/EREBP (174/182), bHLH (157/184), bZIP (88/109), C2H2 (94/113), HB (84/103), MYB (136/138), NAC (157/149), and WRKY (111/113). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The HD-Zip genes are the most abundant group of homeobox (HB) genes in plants and do not exist in other eukaryotes [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A typical DNA binding domain of homeobox proteins contains 60 amino acids, known as homeodomain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The homeodomain folds into a characteristic 3D structure containing three alpha-helices, of which the second and third forma helix-turn-helix motif recognize and interact with specific DNA sequences as homodimers [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Agalou et al. identified 33 HD-Zip genes in rice and classified them into family I (14 genes), family II (14 genes), and family III (5 genes) [6]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Through a microarray approach (data not shown), an EST probe (ID: Os.49245.1.S1_at) was found with high induction levels in two-week-old rice seedlings by 100 mM NaCl (227-fold induction), 50 μM ABA (174-fold induction), and 20% (w/v) PEG6000 (134.5-fold induction). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>This EST was chosen for further research due to its dramatic expression increase under abiotic stress treatments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Database searching showed that this EST sequence encodes a putative homeodomain containing protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Here, we named this gene OsSLI1 stress largely induced 1 as its expression is largely induced by multiple abiotic stresses and ABA treatment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the function of OsSLI1, the full-length OsSLI1 cDNA was amplified from rice by RT-PCR. OsSLI1 is located on chromosome 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>The 783 bp ORF was predicted to produce a 261 amino acids protein with the calculated molecular mass of 28.54 kDa and the PI of 4.61. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Putative conserved domains were detected through BLAST program of NCBI, including a 56-AA HD domain (65–121) for DNA binding and a 43-AA Zip domain (122–164) for protein-protein interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Previously, Agalou et al. investigated HD-Zip gene family in rice, confirmed 31 expressed genes of the total 33 family members, and assigned 14 of them, including OsSLI1 into HD-Zip I subfamily [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Multiple stress-related HD-Zip protein sequences were collected to perform multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis (Figures 1 and 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Sequence alignment showed that HD domain and Zip domain are highly conserved among all the 12 proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>The phylogenetic analysis revealed that OsSLI1 was highly close to MtHB2 and Oshox22. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Previous study suggests that MtHB2, which were identified from Medicago truncatula, may play a negative role in regulation of abiotic stress response in Arabidopsis [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>However, Oshox22 affects ABA biosynthesis and regulates drought and salt responses through ABA-mediated signal transduction pathways with a positive role [25]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>In this research, OsSLI1 encoding an HD-ZIP I protein was isolated from rice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Time-course expression analysis indicated that OsSLI1 expression was induced very quickly and dramatically by various abiotic stresses including salt, drought, osmotic treatment, and exogenous abscisic acid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>The promoter sequence of OsSLI1 harbors several cis-elements including high density of ABA-responsive elements, but the well-known CRT/DREB element is much less. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Further, it was found that OsSLI1 expression was enhanced in an ABI5-Like1 (ABL1) deficiency mutant abl1 under both normal and stress conditions, suggesting that ABL1 probably negatively regulates OsSLI1 gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>It was found that OsSLI1 was also regulated in panicle development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>The OsSLI1-GFP fusion protein was localized in the nucleus of rice protoplast cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Yeast hybrid assays revealed that OsSLI1 had transcription activation activity, indicating that OsSLI1 functions as a transcription activator. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Taken together, OsSLI1 may be a transcriptional activator regulating stress-responsive gene expression and panicle development in rice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Further studies with OsSLI1 transgenic plants will be necessary to elucidate the roles of OsSLI1 in stress responses and panicle development in rice. </plain></SENT>
