</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Soft Tissue Sarcomas (STS) comprise a heterogeneous group of mesenchymal tumors that represent around 1% of all neoplasms [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of these tumors poses a challenge to the pathologist due to their rarity, pleomorphic nature and histologic overlap with numerous sarcoma subtypes [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The majority of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas (UPS) demonstrate similar morphology to undifferentiated and pleomorphic tumor subtypes, particularly leiomyosarcoma (LMS) and liposarcoma [1]–[3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>UPS, previously known as malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH), represents 17% of STS and has an extremely aggressive pattern of behavior [4], [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Leiomyosarcoma accounts for 24% of all STS [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In general, Immunohistochemical (IHC) assays for well-differentiated LMS show positivity for actin, desmin, h-caldesmon, transgelin and sirtuin [6]–[8], however, none of these markers specifically differentiate smooth muscle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>High-grade LMS shows histological similarities to UPS, which can cause difficulties in the distinction between these neoplasms [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The morphological and histopathological similarities between high-grade LMS and UPS are also observed at molecular level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Although copy number alterations have been described as similar in both tumors [9], [10], gains of 1q21.3 have been reported as an independent prognostic marker for shorter survival in patients with LMS [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Hierarchical clustering analysis of transcriptomic data for a large series of STS failed to discriminate LMS and UPS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>However, tumor subgroups with similar gene expression profiles have been reported [12]–[14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Studies that combine gene-expression and DNA copy number alterations have also failed to differentiate between these neoplasms [15], however, three novel molecular subtypes of LMS have been described [6], [16], in addition to a genetic signature capable of predicting metastasis in UPS and LMS [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>More recently, retroperitoneal LMS (LMS-R) has been described as different from LMS of extremities at the molecular level, demonstrating a distinct clinical outcome [18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>In this study, gene expression profiles were evaluated in 44 STS samples obtained from untreated patients prior to surgery, aiming to identify molecular biomarkers. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Large-scale gene expression studies in STS have many limitations, including evaluation of only a small number of fresh-frozen samples, a large number of histological subtypes included within the same report, a small number with the same histological subtype and the inclusion of cases treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy prior to sample collection [3], [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Overall, these limitations reduce the probability of identifying recurrent genetic alterations with clinical significance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>In this study, 22 UPS and 22 LMS samples were collected prior to treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, with their diagnosis confirmed using the markers recommended in the literature. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Although the UHCL analysis was not able to accurately discriminate LMS from UPS, a distinct molecular profile for LMS-R was established, independent of histological grade (cluster I). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Cluster II was divided in two subgroups and included the high-grade LMS-NR and UPS from different anatomical sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>It is important to highlight that one patient developed two UPS (UPS8 and UPS18), which clustered together and demonstrated a similar gene expression profile, suggesting that these samples were not two primary tumors as previously diagnosed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the clusters with the clinicopathological findings and overall survival revealed no significant difference, probably due to the fact that most of the tumors presented with a high histological grade and similar prognosis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Several reports have shown a strong similarity between UPS and LMS, suggesting that they share common oncogenic pathways and may correspond to different stages of the same tumor entity [9], [14], [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>However, this study has demonstrated that LMS-R clusters separately. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Both UHCL and SHCL analysis suggested that high-grade LMS-NR demonstrates a gene expression profile with a closer proximity to UPS than to LMS-R. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Almost all genes that distinguished LMS-R from other sarcomas were over-expressed (580 of 587 genes). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>The function and interaction network analysis revealed a large number of genes associated with muscle structure and function, including ACTG2, CALD1, DMD, MYOCD, MYLK, SRF and TAGLN. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis with datasets from five studies supported these findings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>In all studies, 193 of the 316 genes evaluated were over-expressed in LMS compared to UPS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>A considerable number of genes related to muscle function were found to be over-expressed in all studies, including ACTC1, ACTA2, ACTN1, CALD1, CNN1, MYLK, MYL9, DMD, SGCA, TAGLN, TPM1, TPM2 and SMTN. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>In LMS, over-expression of genes associated with muscle structure has been previously reported in the literature [12], [14], [16], [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Recently, Italiano et al. [18] used genomic and transcriptomic analysis for 73 LMS and described a distinct clinical and molecular profile for LMS-R compared to LMS of the extremities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>This finding was based mainly on over-expression of genes associated to muscle differentiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>MYOCD, a transcriptional cofactor of SRF, was found to be associated with muscular differentiation in well-differentiated retroperitoneal LMS [14], [18], [32]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>In this study, overexpression of MYOCD, SRF, BAD and SRC in LMS was found, predominantly in LMS-R. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>These genes were tested for their potential as diagnostic markers to distinguish LMS from UPS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Combined accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were calculated for these genes, and SRC was identified as the most valuable discriminator. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>In addition, a higher level of SRC protein expression was detected in both LMS-R and LMS-NR when compared with UPS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Despite the use of SRC as a unique marker not being highly sensitive (&lt;50%), its high specificity and positive predictive value (&gt;90%) supports its potential use when in combination with other conventional muscular markers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>It is important to highlight that in silico analysis of protein-protein interaction using the genes obtained in the meta-analysis showed a large number of interactions involving SRC, therefore suggesting its important role in the pathogenesis of LMS. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>A distinct molecular profile was demonstrated for LMS-R, mediated by over-expression of genes involved in muscular development and function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Both well-differentiated LMS-R [14], [20] and high grade LMS-R presented over-expression of MYOCD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis confirmed the involvement of 193 differentially expressed genes in the comparison between LMS and UPS. </plain></SENT>
