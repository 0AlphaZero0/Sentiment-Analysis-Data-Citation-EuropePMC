</text></SecTag></p></abstract><abstract><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Leaf senescence is an active process with a pivotal impact on plant productivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It results from extensive signalling cross-talk coordinating environmental factors with intrinsic age-related mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although many studies have shown that leaf senescence is affected by a range of external parameters, knowledge about the regulatory systems that govern the interplay between developmental programmes and environmental stress is still vague. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Salinity is one of the most important environmental stresses that promote leaf senescence and thus affect crop yield. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Improving salt tolerance by avoiding or delaying senescence under stress will therefore play an important role in maintaining high agricultural productivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Experimental evidence suggests that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) functions as a common signalling molecule in both developmental and salt-induced leaf senescence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this study, microarray-based gene expression profiling on Arabidopsis thaliana plants subjected to long-term salinity stress to induce leaf senescence was performed, together with co-expression network analysis for H2O2-responsive genes that are mutually up-regulated by salt induced- and developmental leaf senescence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Promoter analysis of tightly co-expressed genes led to the identification of seven cis-regulatory motifs, three of which were known previously, namely CACGTGT and AAGTCAA, which are associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive genes, and CCGCGT, described as a stress-responsive regulatory motif, while the others, namely ACGCGGT, AGCMGNC, GMCACGT, and TCSTYGACG were not characterized previously. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These motifs are proposed to be novel elements involved in the H2O2-mediated control of gene expression during salinity stress-triggered and developmental senescence, acting through upstream transcription factors that bind to these sites. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>During the course of senescence, nutrients accumulated in the growing and maturing leaves are exported to actively growing organs such as young leaves, developing fruits, or flowers and storage organs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This mobilization is continued until most of the nutrients are removed from the senescing leaves (Hörtensteiner and Feller, 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Therefore, leaf senescence is a critical developmental process for plant fitness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Global transcriptome studies of senescent Arabidopsis thaliana leaves indicated that differential gene expression plays an important role in the regulation of this process (Buchanan-Wollaston et al., 2005; van der Graaff et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Identifying and understanding the functions of the genes that initiate and carry out senescence are essential to manipulate senescence for economic purposes (e.g. to increase biomass and crop yield, and modify production traits). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p content-type="indent"><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Developmental senescence is a highly regulated genetically controlled degenerative process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>As senescence can normally not be induced easily in young leaves of Arabidopsis, it was proposed that age-related changes (ARCs) are needed to allow the execution of senescence at a later developmental stage of a leaf (Jibran et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Although the molecular or cellular nature of age-related factors that manifest ARCs are not well defined at present, the termination of cell division or the end of leaf cell expansion may represent such factors (discussed in Jibran et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Also, ARCs occurring at the level of various phytohormones (i.e. ethylene, cytokinins, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid), metabolites (such as sugars), and active forms of oxygen [reactive oxygen species (ROS)] may contribute to establish a senescence-competent status of the leaf (Guo and Gan, 2005). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p content-type="indent"><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Of the various possible inducers of the senescence programme, ROS have attracted a lot of attention during the past few years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In addition to their harmful effect on cellular components, ROS are now recognized as an essential component of many developmental and physiological processes including flowering, senescence, and root development (Mittler et al., 2004; Zimmermann and Zentgraf, 2005; Zimmermann et al., 2006; Tsukagoshi et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>As by-products of aerobic metabolism, ROS are continuously produced in different cellular compartments and their endogenous levels are controlled in a finely tuned manner by a series of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>It is becoming increasingly evident that the loss of certain antioxidant activities and the subsequent accumulation of ROS [superoxide, singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radical, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)] with age are signals for the initiation of leaf senescence (Leshem, 1988; Navabpour et al., 2003; Mittler et al., 2004; Zimmermann and Zentgraf, 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>However, currently their specific roles in the regulation of the senescence process are far from being understood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Transcript profiling experiments revealed massive changes in gene expression in response to various ROS-generating conditions, including to H2O2 treatment itself (Vandenabeele et al., 2003; Vanderauwera et al., 2005; Balazadeh et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>This includes expression changes of a large number of senescence-associated transcription factors, further supporting the involvement of ROS in the genetically controlled process of ageing. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p content-type="indent"><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Although leaf senescence is largely governed by a genetic programme, abiotic stresses including nutrient (e.g. nitrogen) deprivation, extended darkness, drought, cold, high temperature, salt stress, or wounding are well known to affect the initiation and progression of senescence (Whitehead et al., 1984; Becker and Apel, 1993; Lutts et al., 1996; Yoshida, 2003; Munné-Bosch and Alegre, 2004; Buchanan-Wollaston et al., 2005; Munns, 2005; Parlitz et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Under natural conditions, plants are continuously exposed to multiple stresses, and as non-motile organisms they must adjust their physiology to an ever-changing surrounding environment for survival. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>An example for such an adjustment is the acceleration of vegetative growth, combined with the promotion of leaf senescence, to enter rapidly into the reproductive phase and reach the next generation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Such stress-modulated developmental changes require a sophisticated integration of regulatory networks of abiotic stress responses with the developmental senescence programme. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p content-type="indent"><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Data from large-scale expression profiling experiments obtained from plants undergoing developmental or abiotic stress-induced senescence (Buchanan-Wollaston et al., 2005; van der Graaff et al., 2006; Parlitz et al., 2011) indicate an overlap in the expression changes and suggest the existence of signalling cross-talk linking the different types of senescence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In addition, various late-flowering and/or stay-green mutants in Arabidopsis such as gigantea (gi), oresara1 (ore1), ore3, and ore9 indicate a possible link between longevity and stress tolerance (Koornneef et al., 1991; Oh et al., 1997; Kurepa et al., 1998; Park et al., 1999; Woo et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In Arabidopsis, the anac092-1 stay-green mutant retained chlorophyll at a higher level than the wild type when salt stressed for several days (150mM NaCl), indicating a role for the NAC transcription factor ANAC092/ORE1 not only in developmental senescence (Kim et al., 2009), but also in the regulation of salt-promoted senescence (Balazadeh et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of JUB1, a further member of the NAC transcription factor gene family, in transgenic Arabidopsis extends plant longevity and confers abiotic stress tolerance through a tight regulation of the cellular H2O2 level (Wu et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>OsTZF1, a member of the CCCH-type zinc-finger gene family in rice (Oryza sativa), is a negative regulator of developmental and abiotic stress-induced senescence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Transgenic plants overexpressing OsTZF1 exhibit delayed senescence under various abiotic stress conditions including high salinity, darkness, and dehydration, indicating that both tolerance to oxidative stress and retarded senescence are based on the same cellular factor(s) (Jan et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>These and other reports support the model that stress-induced and senescence regulatory pathways share common elements. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p content-type="indent"><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Salinity stress is a major abiotic stress limiting plant growth and productivity worldwide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>By triggering a wide range of cellular events, salinity, like other abiotic stresses, superimposes its downstream effects on the existing developmental signalling processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>This leads to the activation of whole-plant responses, such as growth reduction, changes in biomass allocation, leaf senescence, and death of plants (Volkmar et al., 1998; Munns, 2002; Pic et al., 2002; Munné-Bosch and Alegre, 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that many salt stress-triggered processes, such as a decline in photosynthetic activity or an increase in membrane damage, reflect a hastening of the naturally occurring senescence process (Dwidedi et al., 1979; Dhindsa et al., 1981). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>In sweet potato, treatment of detached mature leaves with NaCl (140mM and 210mM) accelerated leaf senescence in a dose-dependent manner on days 6 and 9 after treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The early leaf senescence induced by salt was accompanied by a decrease in chlorophyll content, reduction of photosynthetic efficiency (F v/F m), and an elevation of H2O2 level (Chen et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The fact that ROS, especially H2O2, accumulate during both salinity stress (Gomez et al., 2004; Rubio et al., 2009; Hanqing et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2012) and developmental senescence (Zimmermann and Zentgraf, 2005; Bieker et al., 2012) suggests the existence of ROS-mediated cross-talk between the two processes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p content-type="indent"><text><SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Although salinity triggers leaf senescence in different plant species, the regulatory mechanisms integrating salt stress signalling with senescence are incompletely known at present. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>With respect to agriculture, however, a better understanding of such processes is expected to aid in the breeding of crops with improved salt tolerance by avoiding or delaying senescence during salinity stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Although in Arabidopsis various transcriptome studies were performed in the past to characterize the global expressional responses to salt stress (Kreps et al., 2002; Seki et al., 2002; Taji et al., 2004; Gong et al., 2005; Matsui et al., 2008; Zeller et al., 2009), little attention has so far been paid to studying the regulation of gene expression during senescence in salt-stressed plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Here, the transcriptomes of Arabidopsis leaves during salt-induced senescence were therefore analysed and compared with transcriptomes from leaves during developmental senescence (Buchanan-Wollaston et al., 2005; Balazadeh et al., 2008; Breeze et al., 2011) and plants subjected to H2O2 treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>By integrating co-expression data with promoter analyses, candidate cis-regulatory elements (CREs) governing gene expression under the three conditions examined could be identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The results thus provide novel information relevant for studies on the transcriptional programmes that control H2O2-mediated salt-induced senescence and shed light on the complex signal transduction pathways that regulate leaf senescence under salt stress. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Although growth conditions and treatments in the time series experiments were different from those in the present experiment, as many as 85% of the genes identified as differentially expressed in the original data sets exhibit similar changes in the time series experiments (the same sign of the change and a P-value ≤0.01). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>The remaining 15% of the genes exhibited changes which were noisy and mostly of low magnitude in the time series experiments, and thus could not be classified statistically. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>This result shows that the response specificity in the time series experiments adequately resembles the present data despite the fact that, for example, methyl viologen instead of H2O2 was used to induce oxidative stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>The data were therefore used to reconstruct three co-expression networks (one each for developmental senescence, salinity-induced senescence, and oxidative stress) of 350 genes up-regulated in all three conditions (from cluster 26). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Using a correlation coefficient threshold of 0.6, an intersection network was identified. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>Leaf senescence is triggered prematurely by various environmental cues such as, for example, salinity (Volkmar et al., 1998; Munns, 2002; Munné-Bosch and Alegre, 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Although several studies have been conducted in the past to profile the transcriptomes of salt-stressed Arabidopsis plants and during developmental senescence, to the authors’ knowledge, so far no attempt has been undertaken to identify regulatory components allowing cross-talk between salt-induced and developmental senescence. Table 3 represents a brief summary of Arabidopsis salinity stress gene expression profiling experiments reported so far. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>As indicated, most of the earlier studies were performed under experimental conditions that limited the investigation of leaf senescence induced by salinity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>For example, a short duration of salinity stress (a few hours) is a condition in which leaves do not display typical senescence characteristics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Similarly, transcript analyses of whole seedlings including roots are not appropriate to study molecular processes relevant for leaf senescence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>In this study, an experimental condition was therefore employed under which salinity stress induces symptoms characteristic for developmental senescence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>It was shown that long-term (4 d), moderate (150mM) NaCl treatment of hydroponically grown, 28-day-old Arabidopsis plants induces leaf senescence as measured by chlorophyll content, photosynthetic activity, and the expression level of developmental senescence marker genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Microarray-based expression profiling revealed that 797 out of 1051 salinity-up-regulated genes (~76%), and 380 out of 551 down-regulated genes (~69%) are known SAGs, strongly suggesting that salt-induced senescence and developmental senescence share signalling pathways in Arabidopsis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the transcript levels of 138 ROS-responsive genes were up-regulated upon 4 d of NaCl treatment, indicating an elevated accumulation of ROS after long-term salt stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>ROS are proposed as major candidate signalling molecules involved in salt stress signal transduction (Gomez et al., 2004; Munns and Tester, 2008; Rubio et al., 2009; Hanqing et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Although an excess accumulation of cellular ROS which are finally converted to H2O2 leads to an oxidative burst or cell death, maintaining their appropriate level is critical for mediating the acquisition of tolerance to stress as well as signal transduction of plant growth and development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that an increased level of H2O2 is one of the earliest events in plants during senescence (Bhattacharjee, 2005; Zimmermann et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>Timing and progression of senescence is tightly regulated through synergistic or antagonistic interactions between various signalling molecules such as sugars, nitrogen, hormones, and ROS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that the coordinated interplay between the H2O2-scavenging enzymes catalase 2 (CAT2) and ascorbate peroxidase 1 (APX1) leads to a distinct increase in H2O2 at the time plants start to bolt and enter senescence (Ye et al., 2000; Zimmermann et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Various delayed or accelerated leaf senescence mutants (such as ore1, ore3, ore9, jub1, vitc, and crp5/old1) exhibit an altered antioxidant status, further suggesting ROS (H2O2) as promising candidates acting as nodes for the cross-talk between developmental senescence and stress signalling pathways (Woo et al., 2004; Pavet et al., 2005; Jing et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>The transition from the response to stress to the induction of senescence may occur as a result of a tight interaction between ROS and hormonal signalling networks, thereby allowing plants to regulate senescence under unfavourable environmental conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>However, the regulatory role of ROS for the control of stress-induced senescence is currently not particularly clear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>The identification of elements regulating SAGs through an involvement of ROS will therefore lead to significant progress in the understanding of stress-induced senescence. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p content-type="indent"><text><SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Genes whose expression is regulated by a common upstream transcription factor generally exhibit significant co-expression in conditions where the transcription factor is active. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>This has been shown for multiple regulons, such as those involved in the response to changing environments, nutrient availability, or being active during morphogenesis (Stuart et al., 2003; Ma and Bohnert, 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>This general characteristic allowed study of the properties of regulatory networks in A. thaliana at the genome scale; for example, by integrating data of 963 microarray chips from a wide range of experimental conditions, Mentzen and Wurtele (2008) estimated 998 regulons for Arabidopsis, ranging in size from one to 1623 genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>More importantly, however, besides giving a general overview of the regulatory network organization, the co-expression analysis was successfully applied to uncover regulatory modules having specific molecular functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Examples include the co-expression analysis of enzymatic genes involved in indole, flavonoid, and phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathways (Gachon et al., 2005), the identification of new genes involved in the biosynthesis of cellulose and cell wall components (Brown et al., 2005; Persson et al., 2005), uncovering of a clade of brassinosteroid-related genes (Lisso et al., 2005), and many others (reviewed by Usadel et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Co-regulation of multiple genes by a common upstream TF is related to the presence of a common CRE in their promoters (Dare et al., 2008; Spitz and Furlong, 2012; Ma et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the integration of efficient motif search algorithms (reviewed by Das and Dai, 2007) allowed the successful use of co-expression analysis in revealing the functions of certain transcription factors or regulatory elements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>Examples of such approaches include Myb transcription factors regulating glucosinolate metabolism in Arabidopsis (Hirai et al., 2007), the identification of targets of the OBP1 transcription factor in drought stress (Vandepoele et al., 2009), the characterization of regulatory networks of WRKY (Berri et al., 2009) and bZIP proteins (Wei et al., 2012), transcriptional regulators involved in phytohormone signal transduction (van Verk et al., 2011), and many others (computational methods reviewed by Stifanelli et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>All these studies showed that a combination of carefully designed co-expression analyses (including proper choice of experiments, data type, and computational strategy) with a potent motif search algorithm is a powerful approach for the identification of new condition-specific regulons and new transcription factor targets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>In this study, the transcript profiles of salt-induced senescence, developmental senescence, and H2O2-treated samples were compared. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>Clustering of microarray expression profiles for all genes differentially expressed during developmental senescence, salt-induced senescence, and treatment with H2O2 resulted in 26 possible patterns of expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>Promoter CRE analysis was performed only on clusters containing genes with similar expression behaviour among all three experimental conditions (i.e. clusters 1 and 26). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>The present data suggest that long-term moderate salt stress, H2O2 signalling, and senescence trigger a common transcriptional programme, characterized by several tightly co-regulated gene clusters sharing specific CREs (Fig. 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>Co-expression-based analysis of the cis-elements involved in the H2O2 response as well as salt-induced and developmental senescence resulted in the identification of three previously characterized CREs involved in stress signalling (CACGTGT, AAGTCAA, and CCGCGT), indicating the reliability of the computational analysis pipeline. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>Additionally, four new putative CREs, namely ACGCGGT, AGCMGNC, GMCACGT, and TCSTYGACG, were identified, one of which (GMCACGT) was enriched in promoters of genes involved in specific biological processes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/eru173/-/DC1">Supplementary Table S6</ext-link> at JXB online), thus probably playing a role in shaping the transcriptional response to the applied conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>The CACGTGT is an extended CACGTG motif, one of the most common palindromic G-boxes/ABREs (abscisic acid response elements), also known as a bZIP-binding motif (Jakoby et al., 2002; Toledo-Ortiz et al., 2003; Chintalapati and Rajendra, 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>The bZIP transcription factors interact as dimers with ABREs, which are ACGT-containing ‘G-boxes’ in promoters (Hattori et al., 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>G-boxes are involved in the response to abiotic stress (anaerobiosis, cold, ultraviolet light irradiation) and hormone signalling, especially ABA (Menkens et al., 1995; Shinozaki and Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, 1997; Gilmour et al., 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>ABA is a key hormone for the regulation of plant growth, development, and stress adaptation (Davies and Jones, 1991; Giraudat et al., 1994; Finkelstein et al., 2002; Chaves et al., 2009; Ashraf, 2010; Xue-Xuan et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>ABA is also known as a hormone triggering senescence, and some Arabidopsis mutants with deficiencies in ABA biosynthesis or signalling have been reported to exhibit a changed senescence programme (Pourtau et al., 2004; Lim and Nam, 2005; Passioura, 2007; Yang et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Various studies suggest interplay between ROS and ABA signalling, implicating ROS as second messengers in ABA signal transduction pathways (Pei et al., 2000; Joo et al., 2001; Murata et al., 2001; Torres et al., 2002, 2005; reviewed by Cho et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>For example, cellular ROS levels are enhanced by ABA treatment in Arabidopsis guard cells (Pei et al., 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ABA increases H2O2 levels in maize embryos and seedlings, and in Vicia faba guard cells, a process that precedes stomatal closure (Guan et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2001; Jiang and Zhang, 2002, 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>The enrichment of CACGTGT in cluster 26 genes suggests it as a core stress-specific CRE linking salt and oxidative stress responses with senescence. </plain></SENT>
