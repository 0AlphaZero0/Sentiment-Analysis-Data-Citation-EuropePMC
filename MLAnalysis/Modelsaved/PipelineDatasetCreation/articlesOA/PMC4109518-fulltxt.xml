Triapine inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for DNA-building deoxyribonucleotides, and thereby, enhances radiochemosensitivity by prolonging DNA repair time. Here, we report 3-year efficacy endpoints of pelvic locoregional relapse rate, disease-free, and overall survivals.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Eligible patients with bulky IB&#8211;IIIB cervical cancer underwent three-times weekly triapine (25 or 50&#8201;mg/m<sup>2</sup>), once-weekly cisplatin (40&#8201;mg/m<sup>2</sup>), and conventional daily pelvic radiation followed by brachytherapy. A cumulative incidence method estimated pelvic locoregional relapse rates. Disease-free survival was measured from radiochemotherapy start date to the date of first relapse or cancer-related death. Overall survival was measured from radiochemotherapy start date to the date of any-cause death. The Kaplan&#8211;Meier method estimated survivals.</p><p><bold>Findings:</bold> Between 2006 and 2011, 24 untreated patients with cervical cancer met criteria for reporting in this study. A median 3.4&#8201;years of follow-up time (range, 0.3&#8211;7.6&#8201;years) has been observed. All had squamous cancers and the majority had either node-positive stage IB&#8211;IIA (33%) or stage IIIB (42%) disease. The 3-year pelvic locoregional relapse rate, disease-free survival, and overall survival were 4% [95% confidence interval (CI), 0&#8211;20%], 80% (95% CI: 71&#8211;89%), and 82% (95% CI: 74&#8211;90%), respectively.</p><p><bold>Interpretation:</bold> Triapine radiochemotherapy was safe, active, and effective in patients with untreated advanced-stage cervical cancer, worthy of randomized clinical trial study.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>triapine</kwd><kwd>cervical cancer</kwd><kwd>ribonucleotide reductase</kwd><kwd>radiation</kwd><kwd>cisplatin</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="18"/><page-count count="5"/><word-count count="3576"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Incomplete radiochemotherapeutic treatment responses and poorer cancer-related survivals occur if human papilloma virus (HPV) and abnormal p53 signaling overactivates ribonucleotide reductase in cancers of the uterine cervix (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).

Thirty-seven patients were recruited to these two protocols from a single institution; 33 patients had squamous, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous cancers of the uterine cervix of which 24 comprise this analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

These two important clinical trials demonstrate how the supply and demand economics of deoxyribonucleotides affect the degree to which cervical cancers respond to conventional treatment. The majority of cervical cancers have (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) HPVs that hijack ribonucleotide reductase to mint deoxyribonucleotides for replication of viral DNA, or (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) mutations in p53 that abrogate cell cycle restriction checkpoints, free-up ribonucleotide reductase to increase deoxyribonucleotide payout, and replicate DNA unchecked (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). As a consequence of either biologic phenomenon, ribonucleotide reductase subunits M2 and M2b are abundant in cervical cancer cells (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In this biologic state, ribonucleotide reductase M2 and M2b subunits saturate its catalytic M1 subunit (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), which leads to overproduction of deoxyribonucleotides (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Because cervical cancers are rich in active ribonucleotide reductase, which can facilitate DNA damage repair (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), patients with (over)active ribonucleotide reductase might have a less than ideal radiochemotherapy treatment response. And yet when ribonucleotide reductase activity is blocked, radiochemotherapy-induced DNA damage persists, cancer cell death occurs, and cervical cancer disease becomes better controlled. Perhaps these concepts are best demonstrated by the 4% rate of pelvic locoregional treatment failure among previously untreated patients enrolled on these two radiochemotherapy trials using triapine to inhibit cervical cancer cell ribonucleotide reductase. Because of these intriguing findings, a National Cancer Institute Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program randomized phase II trial currently tests triapine radiochemotherapy versus cisplatin radiochemotherapy in untreated patients with locally advanced-stage cervical cancer (NCT01835171).</p><p>The antitumor consequence of ribonucleotide reductase inhibition has not been the only advancement in cervical cancer treatment. Angiogenesis inhibition has emerged as an effective alternative anticancer treatment strategy for patients with cancers of the uterine cervix and may serve to frame the triapine radiochemotherapy results reported herein. Inactivation of angiogenesis effectors reduces small blood vessel growth, blocks new blood vessel formation, and restores tumor blood nutrient and oxygen supply so that treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation are more deadly to cancer cells (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Gynecologic Oncology Group protocol #227C studied single-agent bevacizumab (15&#8201;mg/kg every 21&#8201;days) as an angiogenesis inhibitor in women with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer and found a 24% rate of disease-free survival at 6&#8201;months (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Phase III testing involved adding bevacizumab (15&#8201;mg/kg every 21&#8201;days) to cisplatin&#8211;paclitaxel or cisplatin&#8211;topotecan chemotherapy in patients with metastatic, persistent, or recurrent cervical cancer on Gynecologic Oncology Group protocol #240 (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Bevacizumab was administered until disease progression or manifestation of unacceptable toxicity. On this trial, a noteworthy 3.7-month improvement in median overall survival (17 vs. 13.3&#8201;months) was observed. Also, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group embarked upon protocol #0417 to evaluate the addition of three bevacizumab doses (10&#8201;mg/kg) to weekly cisplatin radiochemotherapy in 49 patients with bulky stage IB2&#8211;IIIB cervical cancer (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). No maintenance bevacizumab was administered. The trial showed a 3-year overall survival of 81% (95% CI: 67&#8211;90%), disease-free survival of 69% (95% CI: 54&#8211;80%), and cumulative incidence of locoregional relapse of 23% (95% CI: 11&#8211;35%). The bevacizumab and cisplatin radiochemotherapy grade 3 and grade 4 worst overall toxicity rates were 27 and 10%, respectively.</p><p>Because of the exciting clinical outcomes for these two ribonucleotide reductase inhibition clinical trials, a randomized phase II trial of cisplatin radiochemotherapy alone or with co-administered triapine has been put forward for consideration in the National Cancer Institute National Clinical Trials Network program.</p><sec id="S4-9"><title>Research in context</title><sec id="S4-9-1"><title>Systematic review</title><p>Our manuscript reports new 3-year safety and efficacy data from clinical trials conducted with triapine radiochemotherapy in untreated patients with advanced-stage IB2&#8211;IIIB cancers of the uterine cervix.
