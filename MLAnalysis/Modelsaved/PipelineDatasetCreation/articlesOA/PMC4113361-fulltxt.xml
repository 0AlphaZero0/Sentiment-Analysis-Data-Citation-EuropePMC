Expressing this complex AChR is difficult, but has been achieved using subunit concatamers. In order to determine what limits expression of &#945;6* AChRs and to efficiently express &#945;6* AChRs using free subunits, we investigated expression of the simpler (&#945;6&#946;2)<sub>2</sub>&#946;3 AChR. The concatameric form of this AChR assembles well, but is transported to the cell surface inefficiently. Various chimeras of &#945;6 with the closely related &#945;3 subunit increased expression efficiency with free subunits and produced pharmacologically equivalent functional AChRs. A chimera in which the large cytoplasmic domain of &#945;6 was replaced with that of &#945;3 increased assembly with &#946;2 subunits and transport of AChRs to the oocyte surface. Another chimera replacing the unique methionine 211 of &#945;6 with leucine found at this position in transmembrane domain 1 of &#945;3 and other &#945; subunits increased assembly of mature subunits containing &#946;3 subunits within oocytes. Combining both &#945;3 sequences in an &#945;6 chimera increased expression of functional (&#945;6&#946;2)<sub>2</sub>&#946;3 AChRs to 12-fold more than with concatamers. This is pragmatically useful, and provides insights on features of &#945;6 subunit structure that limit its expression in transfected cells.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [Grant NS11323].

A pentameric concatamer of (&#945;6&#946;2)(&#945;4&#946;2)&#946;3 AChRs is efficiently transported to the surface <xref rid="pone.0103244-Kuryatov2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, transport of concatameric (&#945;6&#946;2)<sub>2</sub>&#946;3 AChRs to the surface membrane is inefficient. It is important to determine what limits expression of these subtypes and to express them efficiently.</p><p>Chimeras reveal &#945;6 sequences that limit expression of transfected &#945;6* AChRs. Chimeras with the extracellular domain of &#945;6 and the remainder of &#945;3 or &#945;4 expressed in combination with &#946;2 are efficiently transported to the surface <xref rid="pone.0103244-Kuryatov1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The large cytoplasmic domain of some AChR subunits promotes assembly and transport of AChRs <xref rid="pone.0103244-Kracun1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. This suggests that the large cytoplasmic domain of &#945;3 or &#945;4 might provide efficient transport to the surface that &#945;6 does not. The cytoplasmic domain of &#945;3 is smaller than that of &#945;4 and more closely resembles the sequence of &#945;6.</p><p>Analysis of chimeras of &#945;6 and &#945;3 identified &#945;3 sequences that permitted expression of &#945;6* AChRs and sequences of &#945;6 that inhibited expression of &#945;3 AChRs <xref rid="pone.0103244-Kuryatov2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. A region of &#945;6 in the first half of transmembrane domain 1 inhibited expression of &#945;3 AChRs <xref rid="pone.0103244-Kuryatov2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. This region contains a unique methionine at position 211 which is occupied by leucine in &#945;3 and other &#945; subunits. M211 is in a sequence that in &#945;1 subunits governs stability, assembly, and transport to the cell surface <xref rid="pone.0103244-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. This sequence is on the side of the &#945;1 subunit that assembles with the accessory subunit (e.g. &#946;1 in &#945;1* AChRs or &#946;3 in &#945;6* AChRS) <xref rid="pone.0103244-Unwin1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. This suggests that the &#945;6 sequence containing M211 might be important for associating with &#946;3 accessory subunits. &#945;6&#946;2&#946;3* AChRs are usually expressed in aminergic neurons at presynaptic locations <xref rid="pone.0103244-Gotti1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103244-Champtiaux1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103244-Champtiaux2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

We explored the effects of incorporating M211L and &#945;3 cytoplasmic domain alone, and together, into chimeras with &#945;6. M211L increased assembly with &#946;3, and &#945;3 cytoplasmic domain increased assembly with &#946;2 and transport to the surface. Together, these two modifications synergistically permitted expression of high levels of (&#945;6&#946;2)<sub>2</sub>&#946;3 AChRs from free subunits.

Thus, including &#945;3 transmembrane domain 4 and C-terminal domain impaired assembly and transport. Subsequent experiments will show that pharmacological function was also altered. Construct <bold>7</bold> (&#946;3&#8722;&#945;6+&#945;6<sub>&#945;3cyt</sub>+&#946;2) was intended to test whether the &#946;3&#8722;&#945;6 concatamer equaled or exceeded the effect of the &#945;6<sub>211L</sub> chimera in promoting assembly with &#946;3 and whether a single &#945;3 cytoplasmic domain was sufficient for enhanced assembly and transport. Construct <bold>7</bold> assembled fewer ACh binding sites than construct <bold>4</bold> with two &#945;3 cytoplasmic domains, and was equally expressed on the surface. This is consistent with the ideas that assembly of &#946;2 with &#945;6 in the concatamers was reduced due to the absence of an &#945;3 cytoplasmic domain in this &#945;6 and that one &#945;3 cytoplasmic domain per AChR is sufficient for transport to the surface.

Construct <bold>8</bold> (&#946;3&#8722;&#945;6+&#945;6<sub>211L,&#945;3cyt</sub>+&#946;2) had no better surface expression or function than <bold>7</bold> and lower assembly of ACh binding sites. Thus, the &#946;3&#8722;&#945;6 concatamer with a single or double &#945;6 chimera provided no benefit.

This is consistent with the idea that this concatamer did not promote assembly of &#946;3 with &#945;6 and prevented M211 from promoting this assembly which does occur with free subunits. The &#946;3&#8722;&#945;6 concatamer used a QAP linker rather than the (AGS)<sub>n</sub> linkers used in construct <bold>1</bold>.

The response persists after the ACh application period due to design of our electrophysiology testing apparatus, permitting washout to be slower than wash in. This effect might also result from calcium-activated chloride channels that remain open longer than the AChRs channels. Theoretically this effect could be avoided by omitting Ca<sup>++</sup> from outside solution or clamping at a lower voltage. However, Ca<sup>++</sup> may potentiate activation of AChRs by agonists and &#945;6* AChR evoked peak current is strongly influenced by extracellular Ca<sup>++</sup>
