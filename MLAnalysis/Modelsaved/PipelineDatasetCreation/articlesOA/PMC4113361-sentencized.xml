</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Human α6β2β3* nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) on dopaminergic neurons are important targets for drugs to treat nicotine addiction and Parkinson’s disease [1]–[5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>These AChRs are critical brain subtypes in processes involving movement, memory, reward, and learning [6], [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Self-administration of nicotine is inhibited by knockout of α6, β2, or α4 subunits, implying that (α6β2)(α4β2)β3 AChRs are necessary for presynaptically modulating dopamine release associated with reward and induction of nicotine-dependence [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Antagonists of α6β2β3* AChRs inhibit nicotine self-administration by reducing nicotine-induced release of dopamine [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Smoking-relevant concentrations of nicotine sustain smoldering activation of dopaminergic neurons through (α6β2)(α4β2)β3 AChRs [5], [9], [10]. α6β2β3* AChRs are more abundant in dopaminergic neurons in primates than in rodents, thus probably even more important in humans than in rodents [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is critical to be able to express functional human α6β2β3* AChRs to develop better drugs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>However, efficiently expressing the complex (α6β2)(α4β2)β3 subtype or the simpler (α6β2)2β3 subtype has been difficult [12]–[15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Mixtures of free α6 and β2 subunits efficiently assemble (α6β2) binding sites, but not mature AChRs [12]. β3 subunits promote expression and nicotine-induced upregulation of human α6* AChRs expressed in transfected cell lines, but the amount of AChRs expressed is too small for detecting AChR function [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Use of subunit concatamers enabled expression in Xenopus oocytes of both human α6β2β3* AChR subtypes [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Linking subunits in pentameric concatamers results in efficient assembly of α6β2β3* AChRs [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>A pentameric concatamer of (α6β2)(α4β2)β3 AChRs is efficiently transported to the surface [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>However, transport of concatameric (α6β2)2β3 AChRs to the surface membrane is inefficient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>It is important to determine what limits expression of these subtypes and to express them efficiently. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Chimeras reveal α6 sequences that limit expression of transfected α6* AChRs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Chimeras with the extracellular domain of α6 and the remainder of α3 or α4 expressed in combination with β2 are efficiently transported to the surface [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The large cytoplasmic domain of some AChR subunits promotes assembly and transport of AChRs [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the large cytoplasmic domain of α3 or α4 might provide efficient transport to the surface that α6 does not. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The cytoplasmic domain of α3 is smaller than that of α4 and more closely resembles the sequence of α6. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Analysis of chimeras of α6 and α3 identified α3 sequences that permitted expression of α6* AChRs and sequences of α6 that inhibited expression of α3 AChRs [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>A region of α6 in the first half of transmembrane domain 1 inhibited expression of α3 AChRs [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>This region contains a unique methionine at position 211 which is occupied by leucine in α3 and other α subunits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>M211 is in a sequence that in α1 subunits governs stability, assembly, and transport to the cell surface [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>This sequence is on the side of the α1 subunit that assembles with the accessory subunit (e.g. β1 in α1* AChRs or β3 in α6* AChRS) [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the α6 sequence containing M211 might be important for associating with β3 accessory subunits. α6β2β3* AChRs are usually expressed in aminergic neurons at presynaptic locations [1], [20], [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>These neurons may express a chaperone for assembly of β3 subunits with α6 that is missing in other cell types such as Xenopus oocytes or human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>These cells efficiently assemble β3 with other α subunits to form AChRs such as (α4β2)2β3 [22]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Here we report efficient expression of (α6β2)2β3 AChRs in Xenopus oocytes using free subunits with only small changes in α6 subunits, while not altering AChR pharmacology or channel structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>We explored the effects of incorporating M211L and α3 cytoplasmic domain alone, and together, into chimeras with α6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>M211L increased assembly with β3, and α3 cytoplasmic domain increased assembly with β2 and transport to the surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Together, these two modifications synergistically permitted expression of high levels of (α6β2)2β3 AChRs from free subunits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>These AChRs exhibited the same pharmacological properties as concatameric AChRs, but were expressed on the oocyte surface in much greater amounts. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>It is hard to study a single AChR subtype in vivo because various subtypes often co-express together in brain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Establishing in vitro model systems expressing α6-containing AChRs is challenging. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>By changing a single unique amino acid in transmembrane domain 1 of α6 and the cytoplasmic domain of α6 to that of α3, we succeeded in efficiently expressing in Xenopus oocytes large amounts of human (α6β2)2β3 AChRs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>This will be very useful for characterizing functional properties of these AChRs and drugs directed at them. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>These AChRs have the pharmacological properties of (α6β2)2β3 AChRs formed from wild type subunits linked in a concatamer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>As discussed in our previous study, concatameric (α6β2)2β3 AChRs showed the pharmacology expected from measuring dopamine release in the brain tissue [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>EC50 values for nicotine obtained in vivo ranged from 0.1 µM to 1 µM for activation of α6* AChRs not containing α4 [5], [21], [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Such variation may be due to technical variations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>The pentameric concatamer and AChRs expressed from the free subunits of our highest expressing free subunit construct 5 have very similar pharmacological properties, (e.g. EC50 for nicotine = 0.239 or 0.203 µM) but most of the constructs exhibit similar properties. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>Expression from these modified free subunits is much more efficient than expression from (α6β2)2β3 concatamers [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Concatamers will still be required to ensure efficient expression and subunit order of the more complex (α6β2)(α4β2)β3 AChR subtype [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Dopaminergic neurons which uniquely express α6β2β3* AChRs may have chaperones for efficiently assembling β3 accessory subunits with α6 and ensuring efficient assembly of (α6β2) ACh binding sites in AChRs with (α4β2) ACh binding sites [12], [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>In cells expressing free α4, α6, and β2 subunits, α6 and β2 do not effectively assemble to form (α6β2)(α4β2)* AChRs, instead α4β2 AChRs predominate (Kuryatov unpublished). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Chimeras of α6 subunits with α3 subunits have revealed sequences of α6 that inhibit expression of α3β2 AChRs and sequences of α3 that permit expression of α6β2 AChRs [12], [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Studies reported here build on this foundation to achieve efficient expression of (α6β2)2β3 AChRs and further explain structural limits to α6* AChR expression. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>The unique methionine 211 in the first transmembrane domain of α6, when exchanged for the leucine present in most other α subunits, promotes efficient assembly with β3 and formation of a high proportion of mature AChRs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>This suggests that a unique chaperone in dopaminergic neurons might bind to this region of α6 to promote assembly with β3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>No chaperone is needed to get efficient assembly of β3 with α4 subunits that have a leucine at this position [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Replacing leucine 211 of α3 with methionine inhibits assembly of α3β2 AChRs [16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>The concatameric construct 1 (β3−α6−β2−α6−β2) efficiently assembles into mature AChRs, but these are not efficiently transported to the cell surface, as are the concatamers β3−α6−β2−α4−β2 or β3−α4−β2−α6−β2 [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the large cytoplasmic domain of α4 may contribute to transport to the cell surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>The cytoplasmic domain of α4 is uniquely large. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Here we show the normal sized cytoplasmic domain of α3, a subunit closely related to α6 in sequence, when substituted for that of α6 can promote both transport to the cell surface and increase assembly with β2 subunits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>It is known that large cytoplasmic domain chimeras can increase the assembly and transport of AChRs [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Incorporation of shorter sequences of α3 cytoplasmic domain will be required to determine the minimum sequences required to promote assembly with β2 or surface transport. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Use of shorter α3 cytoplasmic domain sequences might avoid incorporation of the α3 amphipathic α helix which could alter cation selectivity [17], [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>Identification of these shorter sequences may further suggest their mechanisms of action in transport and assembly and help to explain their collaboration with the single amino acid change M211L to promote expression of human (α6β2)2β3 AChRs from free subunits in Xenopus oocytes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>The synergism of these two chimeras appears to result from 211L promoting a high proportion (but low amount) of assembly of β3 combined with the cytoplasmic domain of α3 promoting extensive assembly with β2, and to a lesser extent β3, and facilitating transport of assembled AChRs to the oocyte surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Linking β3 to α6 in a concatamer can force their assembly [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>However, the dimeric concatamer used here did not exceed the effect of combining 211L and α3 cytoplasmic domain in generating functional (α6β2)2β3 AChRs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>The α6 chimeras with 211L and the α3 large cytoplasmic domain (construct 5) effectively expressed functional (α6β2)2β3 AChRs without altering their pharmacological properties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Transfection of HEK 293 cells with a 2∶1∶10 ratio of a chimera with the extracellular domain of α6 and the rest of α3, β2, and β3 with and a V9’S gain of function mutation resulted in functional (α6β2)2β3 AChRs [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>Despite the extensive modifications necessary in those studies to assemble β3 and get α6 to the surface of the cell line, some of the pharmacological properties of its AChRs were similar to constructs 1 and 5, while others were divergent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>On the cell line, EC50 values for ACh (0.23 µM), nicotine (0.15 µM), cytisine (0.072 µM), and varenicline (0.022 µM) were lower than we observed by 1.4 to 5.9 fold, as might be expected as a result of their using a hyperactive mutant β3 subunit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the efficacy for nicotine they observed was two fold greater than we observed for constructs 1 and 5. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we simplified and improved expression of (α6β2)2β3 AChRs in Xenopus oocytes while maintaining their pharmacological properties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>The critical structural features that we identified as important for assembly and transport to the surface will be beneficial for understanding what happens in vivo and in developing α6* cell lines for drug screening. </plain></SENT>
