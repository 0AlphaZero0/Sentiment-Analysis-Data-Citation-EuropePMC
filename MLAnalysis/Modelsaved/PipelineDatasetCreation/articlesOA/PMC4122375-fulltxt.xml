Globally there are around 250 million people chronically infected with this virus. Despite 16% of the cases of liver disease in Central America are caused by HBV, the information regarding its genetic diversity, genotypes and circulation is scarce. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the genetic variability of the HBV genotypes from HBV-DNA positive samples obtained from screening blood donors at the Social Security System of Panama and to estimate its possible origin. From 59,696 blood donors tested for HBV infection during 2010&#8211;2012, there were 74 HBV-DNA positive subjects. Analysis of the partial PreS2-S region of 27 sequences shows that 21% of the infections were caused by genotype A, 3% by genotype D and 76% by genotype F. In addition, we were able to confirm circulation of six sub-genotypes A1, A2, A3, D4, F3, F1 and a proposed new sub-genotype denominated F5pan. We found a confinement of sub-genotypes F1 and F5pan to the western area of Panama. The tMRCA analysis suggests a simultaneous circulation of previously described sub-genotypes rather than recent introductions of the Panamanian sub-genotypes in the country. Moreover, these results highlight the need of more intensive research of the HBV strains circulating in the region at the molecular level. In conclusion, Panama has a high HBV genotype diversity that includes a new proposed sub-genotype, an elevated number of PreCore-Core mutations, and confinement of these variants in a specific geographical location.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by the Secretaria Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog&#237;a (SENACYT)PANAMA, grant FID09-050.

Globally there are around 250 million people chronically infected with this virus <xref rid="pone.0103545-Ott1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, in Latin America, the HBV prevalence levels go from low (&lt;2%) to intermediate (2% to 8%) depending on the population analyzed <xref rid="pone.0103545-RebelloPinho1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In this region, the virus is also the etiologic agent of around 14% of the cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) <xref rid="pone.0103545-Fassio1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. HBV can be classified in nine genotypes (5&#8211;9), according to a nucleotide intergroup divergence greater than 8% of the whole genome, and in twenty sub-genotypes, if a nucleotide intergroup divergence of 4% to 7.5% is considered <xref rid="pone.0103545-Kramvis1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103545-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The study of the HBV in several clinical settings showed important differences between genotypes in the observed clinical outcomes <xref rid="pone.0103545-Shi2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Besides, the study of sub-genotypes allowed a more accurate determination of HBV geographical distribution patterns, an example, is the recent estimation of the migration path of the HBV genotype A1 in and out of Africa <xref rid="pone.0103545-Kramvis2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Information regarding the genetic diversity of the HBV in Central America is scarce.

Moreover, previous studies describing the HBV diversity were done using partial, discrete regions of the HBV genome <xref rid="pone.0103545-Len1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Another evidence of the scarce number of studies of HBV in the region is the small number of whole genome sequences of Central American origin, deposited in international databases (n&lt;100) <xref rid="pone.0103545-Hayer1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>In Panama, HBV diversity was first described in the Chinese population residing in the metropolitan area. This study showed that only genotypes from Asia (Genotypes B and C) are circulating in this group <xref rid="pone.0103545-Martinez1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Still, there is a lack in the knowledge regarding the diversity and molecular characteristics of this virus in the country. Since 2010, a centralized continuous screening of blood donors by molecular techniques: Nucleic Acid Test (NAT) has been implemented in Panama. The use of this technique created a great opportunity to evaluate the circulating HBV genotypes in blood donors from different regions of the country. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the genetic diversity of the HBV genotypes from HBV-DNA positive samples obtained from screening blood donors at the Social Security System of Panama from 2010 to 2012. In addition, we estimated the possible regional origin of these genotypes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The study cohort included positive samples analyzed anonymously from selected blood donors who were screened from the Social Security Health System of Panama.

We determined circulation of three major genotypes (A, D, F), and at least five previously described sub-genotypes (A1, A2, A3, F1pan, F3). Interestingly, a new diversification of genotype F cluster was also observed in the phylogenetic tree analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103545-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, bottom). This new cluster is entirely composed by strains isolated from Panama. Since this new cluster has a significantly high statistical support by the values of &#945;LRT and bootstrap obtained, we propose a new sub-genotype, F5pan. This result overrides previous reports, which indicated only the circulation of genotype F3 in the Panamanian population <xref rid="pone.0103545-Torres1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103545-Kato1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>The results of the study are also in agreement with the observed migration of distinct genotypes across the globe. For example, genotype A1 was recently traced in the Americas <xref rid="pone.0103545-Kramvis2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, it was reported in an Afro-descendant population of Colombia <xref rid="pone.0103545-AlvaradoMoraM1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and in several regions of Brazil <xref rid="pone.0103545-MottaCastro1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0103545-S1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Sub-genotype A2 has been recently linked to high-risk groups: in Argentina to drug users <xref rid="pone.0103545-Trinks1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and men that have sex with men (MSM) <xref rid="pone.0103545-Laufer1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, and in Japan to MSM groups <xref rid="pone.0103545-Fujisaki1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Because of the experimental design of this study, we did not have the opportunity to evaluate risk behaviors of HBV infected blood donors. More studies are needed to address this important issue. In addition, studies intended to evaluate the HBV prevalence and genotypes circulation in specific groups: female sex workers (FSW), MSM and others are missing. Additionally, the only sub-genotype A3 sample circulating in blood donors was closely related to sequences of Haitian origin.</p><p>The genotype F was the most diverse HBV genotype in Panama. This genotype includes a monophyletic clade (F1c?), which is separated from the previous reported F1a and F1b clades, and that has a relative high divergence among members (p-distance &#8202;=&#8202;2.50&#177;0.19). This diversity most likely results from a long circulation history of these sub-genotypes (F1c) in Panama. Interestingly, the fact that almost all the F1c samples came from the northwestern region of Panama (Chiriqui province and Changuinola district) indicates a probable historical presence of this virus in Panama.</p><p>Additionally, we have observed that a group of four genotype F sequences forms a monophyletic cluster with a high support value (&#945;LTR &#8202;=&#8202;1.0, bootstrap &#8202;=&#8202;100%), separated from the rest of HBV sub-genotype F sequences. The molecular analysis of the complete genome of these sequences evidences a nucleotide divergence greater than 4 percent, when compared with the rest of available HBV-F sub-genotypes sequences. Furthermore, the four sequences have specific amino acids changes in preS2-S, X and polymerase proteins. These results fulfill the requirements for the designation of this group of sequences as a novel HBV sub-genotype F (F5) <xref rid="pone.0103545-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Sequences of sub-genotype F5 and F1c were located in the same geographical area of Panama, despite the existence of a great genetic distance between them (p-distance &#8202;=&#8202;7.41&#177;0.40). This probably suggests different introductions of these variants in the region.</p><p>A Bayesian approach was used to estimate the population history of the Panamanian HBV-F sub-genotypes (F1pan, F5pan). These sub-genotypes have an estimated time of most common ancestor similar to the rest of the HBV-F sub-genotypes (F1&#8211;F4). The high variability of the HBV genotypes and its distinctive distribution across the continent, imply a long history of migration and isolation of the common ancestors of the sub-genotypes currently circulating in the Americas. The results of this study suggest that the common ancestors of the Panamanian sub-genotypes (F1pan, F5pan) were part of the diversification history of the genotype F in the Americas, regardless of the tree priors used (fixed substitution rate or time-stamped data) or the genome region employed (whole genome, polymerase gene) to perform the analysis.</p><p>Another important result is the evidence of the confinement of these genotypes (F1pan, F5pan) in the most western region of Panama. This region is characterized by a high incidence of HBV infection among adults.</p><p>It has been hypothesized that the HBV sub-genotypes F sequences described thus far, do not represent the complete history of HBV genotypes in the Americas. The tMRCA estimated for sub-genotype F Panamanian sequences confirm this hypothesis. The results of this study suggest a simultaneous circulation of the Panamanian samples with previously described sub-genotypes, rather than a recent origin of the Panamanian sub-genotypes in the country.</p><p>In conclusion, Panama has a high HBV genotype diversity that includes a new proposed sub-genotype, an elevated number of PreCore-Core mutations, and confinement of these variants to a specific geographical region. These results emphasize the importance to study the molecular epidemiology of HBV in Central America.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0103545.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
