The Chinese tree shrew is considered to be a realistic candidate model. To assess the potential of the Chinese tree shrew for pharmacological testing, we performed drug target prediction and analysis on genomic and transcriptomic scales. Using our pipeline, 3,482 proteins were predicted to be drug targets. Of these predicted targets, 446 and 1,049 proteins with the highest rank and total scores, respectively, included homologs of targets for cancer chemotherapy, depression, age-related decline and cardiovascular disease. Based on comparative analyses, more than half of drug target proteins identified from the tree shrew genome were shown to be higher similarity to human targets than in the mouse. Target validation also demonstrated that the constitutive expression of the proteinase-activated receptors of tree shrew platelets is similar to that of human platelets but differs from that of mouse platelets. We developed an effective pipeline and search strategy for drug target prediction and the evaluation of model-based target identification for drug testing. This work provides useful information for future studies of the Chinese tree shrew as a source of novel targets for drug discovery research.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (KSCX2-EW-R-11 and KSCX2-EW-J-23), the National 863 project of China (No. 2012AA021801, 2012AA022402 ), and the Key Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (KJZD-EW-L03).

Our previous phylogenomic analyses revealed that this animal is closely related to primates, with both shared and unique features useful for characterizing nervous and immune system signaling pathways<xref rid="pone.0104191-Fan1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Until now, Many attempts have been made to use the tree shrew as an animal model for hepatitis C virus infection <xref rid="pone.0104191-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, hepatitis B virus infection <xref rid="pone.0104191-Yan1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104191-Yan2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, myopia <xref rid="pone.0104191-Norton1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, social stress and depression <xref rid="pone.0104191-Fuchs1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and bacterial infection <xref rid="pone.0104191-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Despite recent progress, various obstacles continue to hinder the establishment of the tree shrew as an animal model, including a lack of detailed knowledge, such as its genetic background, drug targets.</p><p>However, because of the high quality of the tree shrew genome and the need for better animal models for <italic>in vivo</italic> pharmacological testing, we nevertheless believe that the tree shrew is a promising model for drug target discovery. Drug targets and their products is the core elements required to develop better animal models for drug discovery. The interaction of these targets with ligands can modulate the function of many classes of pharmaceutically useful proteins, including enzymes, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channel proteins and nuclear receptors <xref rid="pone.0104191-Ward1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104191-Tsai1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.

However, these studies primarily focused on searches for new drugs or targets, and approaches appropriate for high-throughput genomic or transcriptomic screening of drug targets have not been developed. In this present study, we addressed the important problem of drug target identification in drug discovery. Then, we developed a useful pipeline and stringent search strategy for large-scale genomic and transcriptomic screening of candidate proteins. In addition, we optimized this strategy for drug target identification.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Transcriptome assembly and annotation</title><p>We developed a pipeline for the global annotation of transcripts from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Because we focused on drug target proteins or domains, our information retrieval system was biased toward predicted protein-coding transcripts (such as homologs of known genes or those with coding potential). Transcriptome assembly was performed using both <italic>ab initio</italic> and <italic>de novo</italic> methods. Using the <italic>ab initio</italic> assembly programs Tophat and Cufflinks, 173,454 transcripts were obtained from seven different tree shrew tissues (brain, heart, liver, kidney, pancreas, ovary and testis). Transcriptome <italic>de novo</italic> assembly was performed using the SOAPdenovo-trans program to identify 121,817 transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104191-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). To maximize the detection of protein-coding transcripts, we used a less stringent but broadly adopted definition that considers a sequence to be protein-coding if it contains the complete coding DNA sequence (CDS) <xref rid="pone.0104191-Coppe1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. As a result, 53.2% of the 173,454 transcripts assembled <italic>ab initio</italic> from 107,429 loci included regions annotated as CDSs. A total of 50.6% of the 121,817 transcripts assembled <italic>de novo</italic> were annotated as CDSs and aligned with 100% identity to the transcripts assembled by Cufflinks. A comparison of the transcriptomes generated by the two assembly methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104191-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) revealed that 106,773 transcripts could be assembled using either method, although thousands of novel transcripts were identified separately.

Three classes of immune-related proteins, as well as neuropeptides, proteases and inhibitors, were also predicted as candidate drug targets. As described below, 9,756 transcripts were identified as candidate drug targets for further analysis.</p><p>Based on Pfam domain annotation, 2,614 coding transcripts with kinase domains were extracted from the tree shrew transcriptome gene sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104191-g002">Figure 2A</xref>; Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104191.s001">File S1</xref>). OrthoMCL was used to cluster these domains into 129 groups based on a reference dataset (KINBASE) combined with phylogenetic analysis. Tree shrew GPCRs were identified using HMMTOP and GPCRDB searching, resulting in 1,439 tree shrew GPCRs that coded transcripts classified and annotated into four families: the rhodopsin family (<italic>n</italic> &#8202;=&#8202; 1,244), the secretin receptor family (<italic>n</italic> &#8202;=&#8202; 115), the metabotropic glutamate receptor family (<italic>n</italic> &#8202;=&#8202; 47) and others (<italic>n</italic> &#8202;=&#8202; 33) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104191-g002">Figure 2B</xref>; Table S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104191.s001">File S1</xref>). Similar to results from other species, 47.6% of the GPCR transcripts were annotated as olfactory receptors. To search for ion channel proteins, vertebrate ligand-gated ion channel (LGIC) subunits were used in BLAST queries against the tree shrew transcriptome. After ranking the resulting hits based on <italic>E</italic>-values (1e-10 cutoff) and removing redundant sequences, 337 ion channel-coding transcripts were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104191-g002">Figure 2C</xref>; Table S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104191.s001">File S1</xref>). To identify genes of the immune system, we performed a database query of the tree shrew transcriptome against the Immunome database. Using a cutoff <italic>E</italic>-value of 1e-10, 1,986 immune-coding protein transcripts were identified in the transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104191-g002">Figure 2D</xref>; Table S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104191.s001">File S1</xref>). Scanning for neuropeptides was performed using a stringent search against NeuroPedia followed by manual comparison to similar species.

Unlike the total scores, expression patterns were considered when calculating the drug score of each drug target. Our comparative analysis revealed that half of the drug targets with high drug scores were expressed at low levels in tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104191-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Total scores accurately reflected the quality of all potential drug targets, indicating that target drug expression is an important predictor of drug quality.

In addition, as expected, several targets (NR3C1, GSK3B, EGM_09788) with high scores were related to depression and age-related decline.

The roles of these receptors in cancer as well as in cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, respiratory and central nervous system disorders have recently been discovered. PAR expression was detected in the tree shrew, in tree shrews platelets, PAR1 and PAR4 are exclusively detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104191-g005">Figures 5A and 5D</xref>).

Furthermore, PAR1, 2, 3 and 4 were found to be highly expressed in tree shrew brain, muscle, stomach and small intestine tissues, at least at the mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104191-g005">Figure 5D</xref>).

Platelet activation and aggregation assays were therefore performed to elicit this function using human PAR activated peptides (PAR-APs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104191-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104191-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, tree shrew platelets could be activated by human PAR1-AP and PAR4-AP, whereas mouse platelets were activated only by human PAR4-AP. In particular, when 30 &#181;M PAR1-AP was added, human platelets displayed robust activation with a steep aggregation curve; in mouse and tree shrew platelets, there was no obvious activation and the curve was smooth. When 90 &#181;M PAR1-AP was added, tree shrew platelets exhibited slight activation and a gradually rising curve, whereas no activation was observed in mouse platelets. Both mouse and tree shrew platelets were activated with the addition of PAR4-AP at 150 and 300 &#181;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104191-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). This surprising difference between the tree shrew and mouse platelet response can be attributed to the extracellular N-terminal end of PAR4 that acts as a tethered ligand. Moreover, a significant difference between mouse and Chinese tree shrew was observed on the histogram maked according to the max aggregation rate of human, mouse and Chinese tree shrew platelets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104191-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). The aggregation rate of mouse platelets stimulated with PAR1-AP(90 &#181;M) was significant decreased (79.43%) compared to Chinese tree shrew platelets stimulated with PAR1-AP(90 &#181;M). Meanwhile, using the synthesized PAR-APs of Chinese tree shrews, according to alignment results of &#8220;tethered ligand region&#8221; of PAR1 and PAR4 from humans and Chinese tree shrews (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104191-g007">Figure 7A</xref>), we observed Chinese tree shrews' platelets had a greater aggregation with tPAR1-AP (90 &#181;M) or tPAR4-AP (300 &#181;M) than stimulated with human PAR1-AP or PAR4-AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104191-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Under 0.08U thrombin-induced human platelet aggregation assay, a very significant inhibition (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) was observed after platelets pretreated with 33 nM human PAR1 antagonist vorapaxar for 5 min at 37&#176;C, while in Chinese tree shrews a little weak inhibition ( <italic>p</italic> &#8202;=&#8202; 0.1019 ) was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104191-g007">Figure 7C</xref> ). These findings shown PAR1 was expressed on the platelet of Chinese tree shrew and was similar with humans, though some differences was also existed between human and Chinese tree shrew PAR1, especially the tethered ligand region and extracellular loop II ligand binding region of PAR1 likely led to the aggregation diversities, some drug testing in platelet could be drawn on the the tree shrews, but not on mice.</p><fig id="pone-0104191-g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0104191.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Tree shrew platelets are activated and aggregated by human PAR1-AP and PAR4-AP, whereas mouse platelets are only activated by Human PAR4-AP.</title><p>(A) Activated peptide (AP) sequences of human PARs with the PAR extracellular N-terminal tethered ligand for the platelet activation assay.

The choice of a suitable animal model for drug testing is thus critical for drug discovery. Because of its genetic characteristics, the tree shrew is a promising biomedical model and ideal for drug testing and drug target analysis. Previous drug target and network analyses have frequently focused on four common drug target families: enzymes, GPCRs, ion channel proteins and nuclear receptors. In addition, immune pathway components are increasingly popular key drug targets for disease therapy <xref rid="pone.0104191-Ward1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. It is well established that high-throughput genome screening can identify potent drug targets. Our large-scale approach, as described in the Results section, was based on the screening of genomic and transcriptomic data of seven candidate drug target families. Based on the ranking of total scores used in our drug target identification approach, more than 90% of the candidate proteins were finally identified as potential drug targets in the tree shrew. Combined with genomic and transcriptomic data, the expression of each drug target is an important criterion during drug evaluation and pharmacological testing. In previous studies, expression profiling of drug targets has been used to compare characteristic cell responses to genetic and chemical perturbations and analyze associations between genes and drugs <xref rid="pone.0104191-Chua1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The results of our drug target expression analysis reconfirmed the correlation between expression patterns and the results of pharmacological testing and evaluation.</p><p>Our drug target analysis identified additional drug targets in the tree shrew that may warrant further drug testing and functional research. The highest-ranked targets were mainly related to cancer, mental disorders and metabolic diseases. Notably, the association with mental disorders may be relevant to the considerable progress that has been achieved in studies of social stress and depression using the tree shrew as a model <xref rid="pone.0104191-Fuchs1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In addition, the most impressive drug targets, which were related to various cancers, had the highest scores and most significant expression profiles. Finally, comparison with mouse and human orthologs revealed that more than half of tree shrew drug targets were more comparable to human target proteins than were those in mice. And, most of human drug target proteins are present in the Chinese tree shrew genome. These results encourage us to continue our development of the tree shrew for drug discovery as a potential drug testing model.</p><p>To test the applicability of our approach, predicted drug targets of PARs, i.e., subsets of GPCRs, were experimentally validated in the tree shrew. PARs have become attractive targets for the development of novel therapeutics for several diseases <xref rid="pone.0104191-Ramachandran1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In the treatment of cardiovascular diseases using antiplatelet therapies, PARs are also important targets that bind inhibitors of thrombin-induced platelet activation <xref rid="pone.0104191-Michelson1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Based on our previous studies of PARs and their mediation of platelet aggregation <xref rid="pone.0104191-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, tree shrew PARs were promising targets for platelet aggregation. Importantly, PAR distributions in tree shrew platelets are similar to those of humans but differ from those of mice. In addition, the N-terminal tethered ligand of human PAR-APs can induce the aggregation of tree shrew platelets; in contrast, this tethered ligand does not induce the activation of any mouse PARs except for PAR4. Furthermore, synthesized tree shrew PAR1-AP and PAR4-AP was used to further study the PARs expression on Chinese tree shrews' platelet, at last we found that there was a greater activation than platelets stimulated with human PAR1-AP or PAR4-AP. On the other hand, vorapaxar&#8212;an irreversible antagonist of human PAR1, was used in the anti thrombin-induced platelet aggregation assays, our findings shown that vorapaxar had a inhibitory effect on thrombin-induced human or tree shrew platelet aggregation, but human platelets was more sensitive to vorapaxar compared to tree shrew platelets. This result is likely from the difference in PAR1 key site between human and tree shrew, or other unclear factors, such as platelet osmotic pressure. These results collectively validate our prediction that the tree shrew is likely used as a potential research model for drug testing for cardiovascular and other related diseases.</p><p>Our approach may be successfully used to predict target proteins for drug testing in animal models. In contrast to network discovery strategies <xref rid="pone.0104191-Yamanishi1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104191-Zhao2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104191-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, the majority of candidate proteins in our study were predicted as drug targets with a high similarity to human orthologs for further pharmacological testing. If a protein is a new drug target, however, insufficient information exists for further prediction. Nevertheless, our approach is an efficient strategy for large-scale screening of drug targets using genomic or transcriptomic data. In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of our strategy for large-scale drug target prediction and the evaluation of model-based target identification for drug testing. The Chinese tree shrew is likely useful resource of novel targets for future pharmacological research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All animal studies were reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Kunming Institute of Zoology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Data resources</title><p>Chinese tree shrew genomic data were downloaded from the NCBI Nucleotide database (KB320374.1&#8211;KB371123.1).

We used four default criteria. The first criterion involved expression in seven tissues (heart, brain, liver, kidney, ovary, testis and pancreas). Candidate proteins represented by FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads) values &#8805; 10 were assigned a score of 0.1 from each tissues. The second criterion, the essentiality of genes, indicated that the protein was homologous to mouse orthologs of knockout or lethal phenotypes (mouse phenotype data were retrieved from the Mouse Genome Informatics database). Third, a lead compound score was assigned if a candidate protein had hits in the ChEMBL, DrugBank or TTD (Therapeutic Target Database) drug target databases.
