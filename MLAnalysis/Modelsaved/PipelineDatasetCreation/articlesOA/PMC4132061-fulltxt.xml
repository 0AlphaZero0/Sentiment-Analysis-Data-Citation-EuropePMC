Several genes predicted to encode glycosyltransferases are required for the synthesis of the xylan backbone even though it is a homopolymer consisting entirely of &#946;-1,4-linked xylose residues. The putative glycosyltransferases IRX9, IRX14, and IRX10 (or the paralogs IRX9L, IRX14L, and IRX10L) are required for xylan backbone synthesis in Arabidopsis. To investigate the function of IRX9, IRX9L, and IRX14, we identified amino acid residues known to be essential for catalytic function in homologous mammalian proteins and generated modified cDNA clones encoding proteins where these residues would be mutated. The mutated gene constructs were used to transform wild-type Arabidopsis plants and the <italic>irx9</italic> and <italic>irx14</italic> mutants, which are deficient in xylan synthesis. The ability of the mutated proteins to complement the mutants was investigated by measuring growth, determining cell wall composition, and microscopic analysis of stem cross-sections of the transgenic plants. The six different mutated versions of IRX9 and IRX9-L were all able to complement the <italic>irx9</italic> mutant phenotype, indicating that residues known to be essential for glycosyltransferases function in homologous proteins are not essential for the biological function of IRX9/IRX9L. Two out of three mutated IRX14 complemented the <italic>irx14</italic> mutant, including a mutant in the predicted catalytic amino acid. A IRX14 protein mutated in the substrate-binding DxD motif did not complement the <italic>irx14</italic> mutant. Thus, substrate binding is important for IRX14 function but catalytic activity may not be essential for the function of the protein. The data indicate that IRX9/IRX9L have an essential structural function, most likely by interacting with the IRX10/IRX10L proteins, but do not have an essential catalytic function. Most likely IRX14 also has primarily a structural role, but it cannot be excluded that the protein has an important enzymatic activity.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science (science.energy.gov), Office of Biological and Environmental Research, through contract DE-AC02-05CH11231 with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

The structure of xylan is a &#946;-1,4-linked backbone of <sc>d</sc>-xylose residues, decorated with various substituents. Glucuronic acid residues and arabinose substitutions are the most common monosaccharide substituents. The glucuronic acid residues are often 4-<italic>O</italic>-methylated and acetylation of the xylose residues at C-2 or C-3 positions is also a common modification <xref rid="pone.0105014-Rennie1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Because of the importance of xylan, many studies have addressed genes and proteins involved in the biosynthesis, but it has turned out to be unexpectedly challenging and progress has been very slow. Identification of enzymes required for adding the substitutions has been more successful, and several glucuronosyltransferases, arabinosyltransferases, xylosyltransferases and actetyltransferases have now been reported <xref rid="pone.0105014-Rennie1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0105014-Yuan1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>The backbone synthesis has been more difficult to elucidate. Mutations in the Arabidopsis genes <italic>Irregular Xylem</italic> (<italic>IRX)7</italic> (and the homolog <italic>IRX7L</italic>), <italic>IRX8</italic> and <italic>PARVUS</italic> lead to decreased xylan content, but those plants still make xylan with extended backbones and it is suggested that this set of genes might be involved in synthesizing a primer or the reducing end oligosaccharide structure found in many plants <xref rid="pone.0105014-York1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In contrast, mutations in the genes <italic>IRX9</italic> and <italic>IRX14</italic>, which are members of Glycosyltransferase family (GT)43, or <italic>IRX10</italic> belonging to GT47 result in decreased xylan synthase activity, reduced xylan content, and xylan with short backbones <xref rid="pone.0105014-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0105014-Wu2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>In Arabidopsis all three genes have close homologs (<italic>IRX9L</italic>, <italic>IRX14L</italic>, <italic>IRX10L</italic>) that are partially functionally redundant with IRX9, IRX14 and IRX10, respectively <xref rid="pone.0105014-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105014-Wu2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The homologs IRX9/IRX9L, IRX14/IRX14L and IRX10/IRX10L appear to differ mostly in their organ specific expression patterns. Still, the proteins may not be completely redundant as e.g. overexpression lines of <italic>IRX9L</italic> in the <italic>irx9</italic> mutant background complemented the morphological phenotype but showed less xylosyltransferase activity than the wild type and varied in stem breaking strength <xref rid="pone.0105014-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0105014-Chiniquy2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. However, it is difficult to conclude if this is due to too low expression in important target cells or to a difference in biochemical function of the two proteins. The double mutants <italic>irx9</italic>/<italic>irx9L</italic> and <italic>irx14</italic>/<italic>irx14L</italic> show an almost lethal phenotype with severe growth inhibition <xref rid="pone.0105014-Wu2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. IRX9 and IRX14 are not redundant, as <italic>irx9</italic> mutants cannot be complemented by overexpression of IRX14 or IRX14L and vice versa <xref rid="pone.0105014-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105014-Wu2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. That three glycosyltransferases are required to catalyze the formation of a homopolymer consisting entirely of &#946;-1,4-linked xylose residues is surprising. Since no in vitro activity has been reported for the individual proteins it is unclear if one protein possesses the main activity with the other proteins having an accessory or structural role, or if all proteins are active at the same time. Overexpression of IRX9 leads to increased xylan synthase activity in Arabidopsis plants <xref rid="pone.0105014-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, and other reports have shown a synergistic effect of IRX9 and IRX14 overexpression on xylan synthase activity <xref rid="pone.0105014-Lee3" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. However, these studies do not prove that IRX9 and/or IRX14 are the actual glycosyltransferases responsible for the activity as their overexpression could also stimulate other proteins. For example one may hypothesize that IRX9, IRX14 and IRX10 function together in a complex and overexpression of IRX9 alone or together with IRX14 could stabilize the complex and lead to more activity of IRX10 and IRX10L. This outcome could be expected if IRX10/IRX10L were the catalytic subunits but the amount of IRX9 and IRX14 were limiting for formation of the complex. The idea that the proteins are somehow interacting in a complex has been proposed many times, but unambiguous evidence has been hard to obtain <xref rid="pone.0105014-Rennie1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105014-Zeng1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>An essential anchoring rather than catalytic function of IRX9/IRX9L and IRX14/IRX14L is in agreement with a transcriptomic study of psyllium seeds (<italic>Plantago ovata</italic>), which are very rich in xylan <xref rid="pone.0105014-Jensen1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Several <italic>IRX10</italic> homologs are expressed in the seeds, while <italic>IRX9</italic> and <italic>IRX14</italic> homologs have very low expression <xref rid="pone.0105014-Jensen2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Interestingly, the most highly expressed <italic>IRX10</italic> homolog in psyllium (GenBank accession AGQ53953) encodes a protein with a strongly predicted N-terminal membrane anchor as in typical Type 2 membrane proteins. In contrast, the IRX10 and IRX10L proteins in Arabidopsis are not predicted to have any transmembrane helices, suggesting that they need to interact with other Golgi-resident proteins to be retained in the Golgi apparatus. Thus, these studies have led to the suggestion that IRX10 orthologs are the main or only catalytic proteins for xylan backbone biosynthesis, while IRX9 and IRX14 orthologs have accessory functions. Obviously, even if this is the case in psyllium seed mucilage formation, it need to be the case for other tissues in psyllium where <italic>IRX9</italic> and <italic>IRX14</italic> homologs are expressed or in other plant species.</p><p>We noted two peculiar properties of IRX9. Firstly, the <italic>irx9-2</italic> T-DNA mutant has a much milder phenotype than the <italic>irx9-1</italic> mutant. The <italic>irx9-1</italic> insertion is in the first intron and the mutant is likely a true knock-out. The <italic>irx9-2</italic> insertion is in the second exon in the first half of the protein, and if a protein is made in the mutant it would only contain the transmembrane domain and the linker region, whereas almost the entire domain predicted to contain catalytic activity would be missing. Secondly, IRX9 has an unusual amino acid sequence where the DxD motif that is found in most glycosyltransferases with a GT-A fold is not conserved. Instead in IRX9 the corresponding amino acid sequence is &#8216;GLN&#8217; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0105014.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). In contrast, in IRX9L and in IRX14/IRX14L the DxD motif is conserved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0105014.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). These observations led us to suspect that IRX9 may not have an essential catalytic function and instead have a primary role in organizing and assembling a xylan synthase complex.</p><p>To probe the function of IRX9, IRX9L and IRX14 we mutagenized the proteins in specific amino acid residues known to be required for glycosyltransferase activity in mammalian GT43 homologs and determined if the mutated proteins could complement <italic>irx9</italic> and <italic>irx14</italic> mutants in Arabidopsis. Our results show that none of the mutations in regions that would be required for catalytic activity had any effect on the ability of IRX9 and IRX9L to complement the <italic>irx9</italic> mutant phenotype. In contrast, some but not all mutations in IRX14 did affect the complementation of <italic>irx14</italic> mutants. Thus, we conclude that IRX9 and IRX9L are not catalytically active and their main function is primarily or exclusively structural. For IRX14 our results demonstrate the importance of the DxD motif, which has been found to mainly interact with the phosphate groups of nucleotide sugar donors, but other residues presumed to be involved in catalysis are poorly conserved and seem not to be required for IRX14 function. Thus, the nucleotide sugar binding function of IRX14 is important but the protein is unlikely to have an essential catalytic role.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Plant Lines and Plant Growth Conditions</title><p>

Our sequence alignment showed the residue Trp151 of IRX9, to be 100% conserved in all the proteins analyzed. Since tryptophan has unique features in terms of chemistry and size, the conserved position could indicate its function to be important. A construct replacing tryptophan with alanine (W151A) in the IRX9 sequence was made and designated &#8216;IRX9-1&#8217; (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0105014-t001">Table 1</xref>).

A &#8216;DDS&#8217; motif in IRX14 and IRX14L was found in all species aligned, except for one rice homolog comprising a &#8216;DEN&#8217; instead. However the DxD motif is known to be able to vary to some degree, e.g., comprising a glutamic acid residue instead of the aspartic acid creating motifs as &#8216;DxE&#8217; or &#8216;ExD&#8217;. In <italic>Selaginella</italic>, which does not have an IRX9 ortholog, the motif is conserved as &#8216;DDD&#8217; and &#8216;DDS&#8217; as in the Arabidopsis IRX9L and IRX14 orthologs, respectively. Surprisingly, in the Arabidopsis and poplar IRX9 the alignment shows a conserved &#8220;GLx&#8217; motif instead, where x is N, S or A.

All mutated versions of the proteins showed complementation of the <italic>irx9</italic> phenotype. This result is in agreement with the partial function of a truncated IRX9 protein in the <italic>irx9-2</italic> mutant, which is clearly too short to have catalytic glycosyltransferase function, but still plays a significant role as the growth phenotype is much milder than in <italic>irx9</italic> knock-out plants. Our observations and the phenotype of <italic>irx9-2</italic> strongly indicate that IRX9 and IRX9L have important non-catalytic functions. The absence of the DxD motif in IRX9 is surprising but also suggests that the protein is not catalytically active. Nevertheless, in the absence of an in vitro assay to test the activity of these proteins it is not possible to exclude that they possess glycosyltransferase activity. For IRX14 the results are more ambiguous since the DxD motif is clearly important for complementation, whereas the Gln residue in the predicted acceptor-binding and catalytic site is not. In the well-characterized human proteins the corresponding catalytic residue is actually Glu and not Gln. However, whether Gln and Glu could have the same function is not clear. Hence, we speculate that the UDP-xylose binding of IRX14 is important for xylan synthesis but that it does not essentially have to participate in xylosyl transfer. A conceivable scenario is that IRX14 passes the UDP-xylose substrate on to another protein, most likely IRX10 and IRX10L. However that raises the question, what is the role of IRX9 and IRX9L? We think our data indicate that IRX9 and IRX9L have a structural role, most likely helping to organize and/or assemble a protein complex, which is necessary for proper xylosyltransferase function in Arabidopsis. IRX10 and IRX10L are the likely catalytic subunits in such a complex. This is reminiscent of GAUT7, which is known to be catalytically inactive, despite being a member of the GAUT family of galacturonosyltransferases. The role of GAUT7 is instead the anchoring of GAUT1 in the Golgi, and thus GAUT7 is essential for the catalytical function of GAUT1 and ultimately for homogalacturonan synthesis despite not being a galacturonosyltransferase itself <xref rid="pone.0105014-Atmodjo1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The interactions between IRX9, IRX14 and IRX10 have been difficult to show but can also not be excluded. Presumably interactions between these proteins are not very strong, which makes it difficult to prove them. Also protein tags that have been used to investigate interactions might interfere and thereby prohibit interactions. A study in wheat showed coimmunoprecipitation of IRX14 and IRX10, but IRX9 homologs were missing from the preparation and a direct interaction between the IRX14 and IRX10 homologs was not demonstrated <xref rid="pone.0105014-Zeng1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Expression of the non-functional IRX14-1 protein in the wild-type background had no effect. In many cases, non-functional proteins that are part of a protein complex have a dominant negative effect on enzyme activity because the non-functional subunit interacts with the other subunits in the complex and prevent their normal function. However, we did not observe such an effect, perhaps because the normal IRX14 protein interacts more strongly or because the expression level of IRX14-1 was insufficient to bind a large proportion of the IRX10/IRX10L proteins. This could suggest that loss-of-function mutations in IRX10 or IRX10L would be more likely to have a dominant negative effect on xylan synthesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0105014.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
