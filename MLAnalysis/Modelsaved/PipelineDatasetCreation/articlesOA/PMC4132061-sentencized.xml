</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Xylan is the most abundant non-cellulosic polysaccharide in plants, comprising around 30% of the biomass. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The structure of xylan is a β-1,4-linked backbone of d-xylose residues, decorated with various substituents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Glucuronic acid residues and arabinose substitutions are the most common monosaccharide substituents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The glucuronic acid residues are often 4-O-methylated and acetylation of the xylose residues at C-2 or C-3 positions is also a common modification [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Because of the importance of xylan, many studies have addressed genes and proteins involved in the biosynthesis, but it has turned out to be unexpectedly challenging and progress has been very slow. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Identification of enzymes required for adding the substitutions has been more successful, and several glucuronosyltransferases, arabinosyltransferases, xylosyltransferases and actetyltransferases have now been reported [1]–[7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The backbone synthesis has been more difficult to elucidate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the Arabidopsis genes Irregular Xylem (IRX)7 (and the homolog IRX7L), IRX8 and PARVUS lead to decreased xylan content, but those plants still make xylan with extended backbones and it is suggested that this set of genes might be involved in synthesizing a primer or the reducing end oligosaccharide structure found in many plants [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In contrast, mutations in the genes IRX9 and IRX14, which are members of Glycosyltransferase family (GT)43, or IRX10 belonging to GT47 result in decreased xylan synthase activity, reduced xylan content, and xylan with short backbones [9]–[12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In Arabidopsis all three genes have close homologs (IRX9L, IRX14L, IRX10L) that are partially functionally redundant with IRX9, IRX14 and IRX10, respectively [9], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The homologs IRX9/IRX9L, IRX14/IRX14L and IRX10/IRX10L appear to differ mostly in their organ specific expression patterns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Still, the proteins may not be completely redundant as e.g. overexpression lines of IRX9L in the irx9 mutant background complemented the morphological phenotype but showed less xylosyltransferase activity than the wild type and varied in stem breaking strength [11]–[13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>However, it is difficult to conclude if this is due to too low expression in important target cells or to a difference in biochemical function of the two proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The double mutants irx9/irx9L and irx14/irx14L show an almost lethal phenotype with severe growth inhibition [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>IRX9 and IRX14 are not redundant, as irx9 mutants cannot be complemented by overexpression of IRX14 or IRX14L and vice versa [11], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>That three glycosyltransferases are required to catalyze the formation of a homopolymer consisting entirely of β-1,4-linked xylose residues is surprising. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Since no in vitro activity has been reported for the individual proteins it is unclear if one protein possesses the main activity with the other proteins having an accessory or structural role, or if all proteins are active at the same time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of IRX9 leads to increased xylan synthase activity in Arabidopsis plants [11], and other reports have shown a synergistic effect of IRX9 and IRX14 overexpression on xylan synthase activity [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>However, these studies do not prove that IRX9 and/or IRX14 are the actual glycosyltransferases responsible for the activity as their overexpression could also stimulate other proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>For example one may hypothesize that IRX9, IRX14 and IRX10 function together in a complex and overexpression of IRX9 alone or together with IRX14 could stabilize the complex and lead to more activity of IRX10 and IRX10L. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>This outcome could be expected if IRX10/IRX10L were the catalytic subunits but the amount of IRX9 and IRX14 were limiting for formation of the complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The idea that the proteins are somehow interacting in a complex has been proposed many times, but unambiguous evidence has been hard to obtain [1], [16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>An essential anchoring rather than catalytic function of IRX9/IRX9L and IRX14/IRX14L is in agreement with a transcriptomic study of psyllium seeds (Plantago ovata), which are very rich in xylan [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Several IRX10 homologs are expressed in the seeds, while IRX9 and IRX14 homologs have very low expression [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the most highly expressed IRX10 homolog in psyllium (GenBank accession AGQ53953) encodes a protein with a strongly predicted N-terminal membrane anchor as in typical Type 2 membrane proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the IRX10 and IRX10L proteins in Arabidopsis are not predicted to have any transmembrane helices, suggesting that they need to interact with other Golgi-resident proteins to be retained in the Golgi apparatus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Thus, these studies have led to the suggestion that IRX10 orthologs are the main or only catalytic proteins for xylan backbone biosynthesis, while IRX9 and IRX14 orthologs have accessory functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Obviously, even if this is the case in psyllium seed mucilage formation, it need to be the case for other tissues in psyllium where IRX9 and IRX14 homologs are expressed or in other plant species. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>We noted two peculiar properties of IRX9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Firstly, the irx9-2 T-DNA mutant has a much milder phenotype than the irx9-1 mutant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The irx9-1 insertion is in the first intron and the mutant is likely a true knock-out. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>The irx9-2 insertion is in the second exon in the first half of the protein, and if a protein is made in the mutant it would only contain the transmembrane domain and the linker region, whereas almost the entire domain predicted to contain catalytic activity would be missing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Secondly, IRX9 has an unusual amino acid sequence where the DxD motif that is found in most glycosyltransferases with a GT-A fold is not conserved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Instead in IRX9 the corresponding amino acid sequence is ‘GLN’ (Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in IRX9L and in IRX14/IRX14L the DxD motif is conserved (Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>These observations led us to suspect that IRX9 may not have an essential catalytic function and instead have a primary role in organizing and assembling a xylan synthase complex. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>To probe the function of IRX9, IRX9L and IRX14 we mutagenized the proteins in specific amino acid residues known to be required for glycosyltransferase activity in mammalian GT43 homologs and determined if the mutated proteins could complement irx9 and irx14 mutants in Arabidopsis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Our results show that none of the mutations in regions that would be required for catalytic activity had any effect on the ability of IRX9 and IRX9L to complement the irx9 mutant phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>In contrast, some but not all mutations in IRX14 did affect the complementation of irx14 mutants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Thus, we conclude that IRX9 and IRX9L are not catalytically active and their main function is primarily or exclusively structural. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>For IRX14 our results demonstrate the importance of the DxD motif, which has been found to mainly interact with the phosphate groups of nucleotide sugar donors, but other residues presumed to be involved in catalysis are poorly conserved and seem not to be required for IRX14 function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Thus, the nucleotide sugar binding function of IRX14 is important but the protein is unlikely to have an essential catalytic role. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>This study shows that amino acid residues that have been shown to be essential in mammalian GT43 proteins are not important for the biological function of the Arabidopsis IRX9 and IRX9L proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>All mutated versions of the proteins showed complementation of the irx9 phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>This result is in agreement with the partial function of a truncated IRX9 protein in the irx9-2 mutant, which is clearly too short to have catalytic glycosyltransferase function, but still plays a significant role as the growth phenotype is much milder than in irx9 knock-out plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Our observations and the phenotype of irx9-2 strongly indicate that IRX9 and IRX9L have important non-catalytic functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>The absence of the DxD motif in IRX9 is surprising but also suggests that the protein is not catalytically active. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, in the absence of an in vitro assay to test the activity of these proteins it is not possible to exclude that they possess glycosyltransferase activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>For IRX14 the results are more ambiguous since the DxD motif is clearly important for complementation, whereas the Gln residue in the predicted acceptor-binding and catalytic site is not. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>In the well-characterized human proteins the corresponding catalytic residue is actually Glu and not Gln. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>However, whether Gln and Glu could have the same function is not clear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Hence, we speculate that the UDP-xylose binding of IRX14 is important for xylan synthesis but that it does not essentially have to participate in xylosyl transfer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>A conceivable scenario is that IRX14 passes the UDP-xylose substrate on to another protein, most likely IRX10 and IRX10L. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="?"><plain>However that raises the question, what is the role of IRX9 and IRX9L? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>We think our data indicate that IRX9 and IRX9L have a structural role, most likely helping to organize and/or assemble a protein complex, which is necessary for proper xylosyltransferase function in Arabidopsis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>IRX10 and IRX10L are the likely catalytic subunits in such a complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>This is reminiscent of GAUT7, which is known to be catalytically inactive, despite being a member of the GAUT family of galacturonosyltransferases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>The role of GAUT7 is instead the anchoring of GAUT1 in the Golgi, and thus GAUT7 is essential for the catalytical function of GAUT1 and ultimately for homogalacturonan synthesis despite not being a galacturonosyltransferase itself [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>The interactions between IRX9, IRX14 and IRX10 have been difficult to show but can also not be excluded. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Presumably interactions between these proteins are not very strong, which makes it difficult to prove them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>Also protein tags that have been used to investigate interactions might interfere and thereby prohibit interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>A study in wheat showed coimmunoprecipitation of IRX14 and IRX10, but IRX9 homologs were missing from the preparation and a direct interaction between the IRX14 and IRX10 homologs was not demonstrated [16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Expression of the non-functional IRX14-1 protein in the wild-type background had no effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>In many cases, non-functional proteins that are part of a protein complex have a dominant negative effect on enzyme activity because the non-functional subunit interacts with the other subunits in the complex and prevent their normal function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>However, we did not observe such an effect, perhaps because the normal IRX14 protein interacts more strongly or because the expression level of IRX14-1 was insufficient to bind a large proportion of the IRX10/IRX10L proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>This could suggest that loss-of-function mutations in IRX10 or IRX10L would be more likely to have a dominant negative effect on xylan synthesis. </plain></SENT>
