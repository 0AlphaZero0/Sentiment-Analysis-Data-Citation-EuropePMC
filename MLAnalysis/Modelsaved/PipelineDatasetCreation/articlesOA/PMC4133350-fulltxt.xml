Ecologically, the American oyster provides biogenic habitat and filters large quantities of plankton, having a great impact on the coastal ecosystems it inhabits <xref rid="pone.0105097-Newell1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105097-Gutirrez1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Several oyster diseases, both protozoan and bacterial, have expanded in range and increased in severity during the latter half of the twentieth century, often causing staggering losses <xref rid="pone.0105097-Ford1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Juvenile or Roseovarius Oyster Disease (ROD), an emerging disease caused by the gram-negative bacterium <italic>Roseovarius crassostreae</italic>, was first reported in 1988 and presently affects oysters from the Long Island Sound north to Maine <xref rid="pone.0105097-Ford2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105097-Bricelj1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. As high as 90&#8211;100% of oyster juveniles in a farm may succumb to this disease during mortality events that often coincide with peak summer water temperatures. Gross clinical signs include uneven shell margins, soft tissue emaciation, and conchiolin depositions (a mix of shell material and organic molecules) on the inner shell surfaces <xref rid="pone.0105097-Ford2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0105097-Boettcher1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>The host-pathogen interactions between <italic>C. virginica</italic> and <italic>R. crassostreae</italic> are poorly understood. This extracellular bacterial pathogen colonizes the oyster&#8217;s inner shell surface before lesions develop in the epithelial mantle. Colonization of the inner side of the oyster shell by <italic>R. crassostreae</italic> likely stimulates oysters to deposit conchiolin <xref rid="pone.0105097-Boardman1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. It has been hypothesized that smaller juvenile oysters (&lt;25 mm in shell length) are most susceptible to ROD because they lack adequate metabolic resources to fuel immune responses, including conchiolin deposition, leading to emaciation <xref rid="pone.0105097-Ford2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105097-Bricelj1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105097-Boardman1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. <italic>Roseovarius crassostreae</italic> may produce a toxin with ciliostatic activity <xref rid="pone.0105097-Boettcher2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and extracellular products from <italic>R. crassostreae</italic> have a cytotoxic effect on oyster hemocytes that cannot be solely attributed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of the membrane of gram-negative bacteria <xref rid="pone.0105097-GmezLen1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Traditional selective breeding practices have led to the production of ROD-resistant oysters <xref rid="pone.0105097-Davis1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105097-Barber1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, but the genetic basis of resistance is presently unknown.

While the susceptible oysters experienced constant levels of mortality due to ROD throughout the length of the challenge, oysters from the resistant family showed levels of mortality equal to the non-challenged oysters, even if they were continuously exposed to the pathogen through cohabitation with the susceptible oysters. We exploited these differences in mortality patterns, and ultimately differences in gene expression, to mine for genes and processes potentially involved in: 1) host-pathogen interactions in juvenile American oysters, and 2) disease resistance or susceptibility to ROD. Our analysis of the gene ontology terms most commonly represented (enriched) amongst the genes differentially expressed in challenged resistant and susceptible oysters relative to non-challenged oysters provides a broad view of the most conserved genes and processes involved in host responses of juvenile American oysters to <italic>R. crassostreae</italic>. We found that transcripts related to pathogen recognition, immune signaling and effector molecules, apoptosis, and detoxification were involved in the responses of the American oyster to bacterial challenge. In addition, we have identified several genes showing differential patterns of gene expression in either susceptible or resistant oysters in response to challenge, providing a useful foundation for the future identification of genes involved in disease resistance or susceptibility to ROD.</p><p>There are several limitations to this study that should be considered in the interpretation of the results.

Furthermore, due to the limitations of the experimental design (differential gene expression in challenged F3L and GX was determined relative to that in unchallenged CGX oysters collected on days 15 and 30 after the start of the challenge), patterns of gene expression observed in this study could be due to either: a) true differences in gene expression between groups (for the most conserved genes); b) genetic differences between the families (transcripts corresponding to the same gene being identified as different genes in the assembly); and/or c) variability in gene expression between early and late time points (for the F3L_early and GX_early comparisons). Therefore, further work should be done in the future to validate the role of these genes in disease resistance/susceptibility to ROD and identify potential mechanisms of disease resistance.

Genes and processes activated in susceptible oysters in response to bacterial challenge and absent or present to a much lesser degree in resistant oysters may be used as indicators of an unsuccessful defense response and provide further insights on the molecular basis of disease susceptibility. Enrichment of transcripts corresponding to metabolic processes in susceptible oysters supports the hypothesis that a failed immune response against ROD places a large metabolic demand on these oysters, leading to mortality events <xref rid="pone.0105097-Ford2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105097-Bricelj1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105097-Boardman1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Moreover, the unique enrichment in transcripts involved in detoxification (monooxygenase and oxidoreductase activities) in susceptible oysters could also be a reflection of the impact of ongoing acute infections in susceptible oysters, leading to upregulation of genes involved in minimizing the damage produced by the bacterial pathogen.</p><p>Other top genes differentially expressed in susceptible oysters but not in resistant oysters in our study that may warrant further investigation include epididymal secretory protein E1, cadherin, legumain, vdg3, dermatopontin 2, and apextrin. Epididymal secretory protein E1, also known as Niemann-Pick type C-2, facilitates cholesterol transport from lysosomes <xref rid="pone.0105097-Infante1" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>. The up-regulation of epididymal secretory protein e1 uniquely in susceptible oysters at days 5 and 15 may represent lysomal turnover as an aspect of a continuous response to bacteria <xref rid="pone.0105097-Mohandas1" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>. Cadherin is involved in cell adhesion <xref rid="pone.0105097-Shimoyama1" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref>, and legumain is a cysteine protease associated with response to bacteria <xref rid="pone.0105097-Matussek1" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref>, antigen processing <xref rid="pone.0105097-Manoury1" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref>, and ECM remodeling <xref rid="pone.0105097-Morita1" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref> in mammals. Transcripts annotating as dermatopontin-2, a shell matrix protein involved in cell adhesion and shell formation <xref rid="pone.0105097-Marxen1" ref-type="bibr">[91]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105097-Sarashina1" ref-type="bibr">[92]</xref> may be involved in bacterial encapsulation and conchiolin production (a hallmark clinical sign of ROD). Dermatopontin is strongly induced in amphioxus following bacterial challenge by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria <xref rid="pone.0105097-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[93]</xref>. In the same bacterial challenge of amphioxus, another highly up-regulated gene was apextrin. Known primarily for its role in embryonal development <xref rid="pone.0105097-Haag1" ref-type="bibr">[94]</xref>, apextrin is a member of the membrane attack complex/perforin domain protein family <xref rid="pone.0105097-Rosado1" ref-type="bibr">[95]</xref> and is involved in innate antibacterial responses, possibly by sequestering or inactivating bacteria <xref rid="pone.0105097-Dheilly1" ref-type="bibr">[96]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Potential genes involved in resistance to Roseovarius oyster disease</title><p>Oysters from the resistant family did not show clinical signs of infection and suffered mortalities comparable to non-challenged oysters, suggesting that these oysters were able to eliminate the pathogen rapidly. ROD-resistant oysters responded to the bacterial pathogen <italic>R. crassostreae</italic> mainly by the differential expression of transcripts annotating to proteins that modify the extracellular matrix (ECM) (e.g. ADAMTS8), proteins that bind self or non-self ligands including pathogens (e.g. scavenger receptor cysteine-rich), stress proteins (e.g. HSP20, 60, and 70), and proteins involved in signaling (e.g. IL-17, cubilin, rapunzel). The up-regulation in resistant oysters of furin suggests the possible involvement of neuroendocrine signaling and/or host defense-relevant protein processing. Furin is involved in the processing of von Willebrand Factor, antimicrobial peptides in invertebrates, and certain matrix metalloproteinases; which in turn affect cell migration, differentiation, inflammation control, and the restructuring of the ECM <xref rid="pone.0105097-Khokha1" ref-type="bibr">[97]</xref>. The importance of ECM restructuring in the response of resistant oysters to bacterial challenge is corroborated by the up-regulation of a transcript annotating as ADAMTS8, a matrix metalloproteinase that is activated through cleavage by furin and likely participates in ECM proteolysis <xref rid="pone.0105097-Dunn1" ref-type="bibr">[98]</xref>, as well as the differential expression of transcripts coding for tenascin-xb, an anti-adhesive glycoprotein involved in wound healing and matrix maturation <xref rid="pone.0105097-Egging1" ref-type="bibr">[99]</xref>.</p><p>The early response in resistant oysters also involved the pro-inflammatory mediator, interleukin 17 (IL-17), and the nitric oxide modulator, arginase. Members of the IL-17 family of cytokines induce the expression of antimicrobial proteins <xref rid="pone.0105097-Gaffen1" ref-type="bibr">[100]</xref>, and previous research suggests that IL-17 is an important mediator of the pro-inflammatory response in oysters <xref rid="pone.0105097-Roberts1" ref-type="bibr">[101]</xref>. Our results are consistent with the role of IL-17 in the immune response of oysters against bacterial infection and suggest a potential role in disease resistance to ROD. Arginases have been shown in macrophages to modulate the production of nitric oxide <xref rid="pone.0105097-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[102]</xref>, which is an immune effector in the American oyster <xref rid="pone.0105097-Villamil1" ref-type="bibr">[103]</xref>.

<xref rid="pone.0105097-Lang1" ref-type="bibr">[104]</xref>. The down-regulation of arginase in resistant oysters on day 5 may signal a down-regulation of the inflammation and stress response following a successful defense response.</p><p>In conclusion, this study shows that transcripts involved in processes such as pathogen recognition, extracellular matrix remodeling, detoxification, apoptosis, and regulation of the inflammatory (i.e. hemocytic infiltration) response may have an important role in the immune defenses of American oysters against <italic>Roseovarius crassostreae,</italic> the causative agent of Roseovarius Oyster Disease. This work represents the first deep characterization of the transcriptome of American oysters in response to a bacterial pathogen, providing many candidates genes and processes that should be targeted in the future characterization of mechanisms of resistance and susceptibility to this important bacterial disease of juvenile American oysters. The present study has also generated a pool of genes to be considered for further evaluation as candidate markers for advanced genotypic selection regimes for disease resistance in oysters.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0105097.s001"><label>Text S1</label><caption><p>
