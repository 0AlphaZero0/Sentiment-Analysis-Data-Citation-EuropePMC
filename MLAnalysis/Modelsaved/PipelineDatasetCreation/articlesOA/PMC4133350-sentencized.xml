</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The American or eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica is an estuarine molluscan bivalve species fished and cultured from Texas, USA to New Brunswick, Canada. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Oyster production is an important sector of United States agriculture and the American oyster was estimated in 2012 to have a farm gate value of $104 million in the United States [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Ecologically, the American oyster provides biogenic habitat and filters large quantities of plankton, having a great impact on the coastal ecosystems it inhabits [2], [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Several oyster diseases, both protozoan and bacterial, have expanded in range and increased in severity during the latter half of the twentieth century, often causing staggering losses [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Juvenile or Roseovarius Oyster Disease (ROD), an emerging disease caused by the gram-negative bacterium Roseovarius crassostreae, was first reported in 1988 and presently affects oysters from the Long Island Sound north to Maine [5], [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>As high as 90â100% of oyster juveniles in a farm may succumb to this disease during mortality events that often coincide with peak summer water temperatures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Gross clinical signs include uneven shell margins, soft tissue emaciation, and conchiolin depositions (a mix of shell material and organic molecules) on the inner shell surfaces [5]â[7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The host-pathogen interactions between C. virginica and R. crassostreae are poorly understood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>This extracellular bacterial pathogen colonizes the oysterâs inner shell surface before lesions develop in the epithelial mantle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Colonization of the inner side of the oyster shell by R. crassostreae likely stimulates oysters to deposit conchiolin [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>It has been hypothesized that smaller juvenile oysters (&lt;25 mm in shell length) are most susceptible to ROD because they lack adequate metabolic resources to fuel immune responses, including conchiolin deposition, leading to emaciation [5], [6], [8]. Roseovarius crassostreae may produce a toxin with ciliostatic activity [9] and extracellular products from R. crassostreae have a cytotoxic effect on oyster hemocytes that cannot be solely attributed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of the membrane of gram-negative bacteria [10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Traditional selective breeding practices have led to the production of ROD-resistant oysters [11], [12], but the genetic basis of resistance is presently unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The identification of potential genes and pathways responsible for an effective host defense response in the American oyster to R. crassostreae is important not only to provide a basis for enhanced breeding techniques [13]â[15], but also advances the understanding of immunity in a member of Lophotrochozoa, a superphylum that has been poorly represented among genomic and transcriptomic datasets until recently e.g. [16]â[19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Invertebrate hosts lack the classical adaptive immune system, yet they successfully combat widely varied types of microbes and parasites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>To mount effective and flexible defense responses to diverse pathogens, invertebrate hosts have developed diversified repertoires of receptors, regulators, and/or effectors including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), fibrinogen-related proteins (FREPs), scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCRs), and antimicrobial proteins, as well as many other molecules involved in the key processes of agglutination, phagocytosis, and encapsulation [20]â[22]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In order to identify genes and processes potentially involved in: 1) the responses of American oysters to challenge with the bacterial pathogen R. crassostreae, and 2) potential mechanisms of resistance or susceptibility to ROD, cDNA sequences from ROD-resistant and susceptible families of oysters exposed to the bacterial pathogen Roseovarius crassostreae were assembled into a reference transcriptome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>A targeted differential gene expression analysis, followed by evaluation of functional categories enriched among differentially expressed genes, were used to identify genes and processes involved in the response of oysters exposured to R. crassostreae. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, due to the limitations of the experimental design (differential gene expression in challenged F3L and GX was determined relative to that in unchallenged CGX oysters collected on days 15 and 30 after the start of the challenge), patterns of gene expression observed in this study could be due to either: a) true differences in gene expression between groups (for the most conserved genes); b) genetic differences between the families (transcripts corresponding to the same gene being identified as different genes in the assembly); and/or c) variability in gene expression between early and late time points (for the F3L_early and GX_early comparisons). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Enrichment of transcripts corresponding to metabolic processes in susceptible oysters supports the hypothesis that a failed immune response against ROD places a large metabolic demand on these oysters, leading to mortality events [5], [6], [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the unique enrichment in transcripts involved in detoxification (monooxygenase and oxidoreductase activities) in susceptible oysters could also be a reflection of the impact of ongoing acute infections in susceptible oysters, leading to upregulation of genes involved in minimizing the damage produced by the bacterial pathogen. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>ROD-resistant oysters responded to the bacterial pathogen R. crassostreae mainly by the differential expression of transcripts annotating to proteins that modify the extracellular matrix (ECM) (e.g. ADAMTS8), proteins that bind self or non-self ligands including pathogens (e.g. scavenger receptor cysteine-rich), stress proteins (e.g. HSP20, 60, and 70), and proteins involved in signaling (e.g. IL-17, cubilin, rapunzel). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Furin is involved in the processing of von Willebrand Factor, antimicrobial peptides in invertebrates, and certain matrix metalloproteinases; which in turn affect cell migration, differentiation, inflammation control, and the restructuring of the ECM [97]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>The importance of ECM restructuring in the response of resistant oysters to bacterial challenge is corroborated by the up-regulation of a transcript annotating as ADAMTS8, a matrix metalloproteinase that is activated through cleavage by furin and likely participates in ECM proteolysis [98], as well as the differential expression of transcripts coding for tenascin-xb, an anti-adhesive glycoprotein involved in wound healing and matrix maturation [99]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>The early response in resistant oysters also involved the pro-inflammatory mediator, interleukin 17 (IL-17), and the nitric oxide modulator, arginase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Members of the IL-17 family of cytokines induce the expression of antimicrobial proteins [100], and previous research suggests that IL-17 is an important mediator of the pro-inflammatory response in oysters [101]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Our results are consistent with the role of IL-17 in the immune response of oysters against bacterial infection and suggest a potential role in disease resistance to ROD. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>The down-regulation of arginase in resistant oysters on day 5 may signal a down-regulation of the inflammation and stress response following a successful defense response. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study shows that transcripts involved in processes such as pathogen recognition, extracellular matrix remodeling, detoxification, apoptosis, and regulation of the inflammatory (i.e. hemocytic infiltration) response may have an important role in the immune defenses of American oysters against Roseovarius crassostreae, the causative agent of Roseovarius Oyster Disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>This work represents the first deep characterization of the transcriptome of American oysters in response to a bacterial pathogen, providing many candidates genes and processes that should be targeted in the future characterization of mechanisms of resistance and susceptibility to this important bacterial disease of juvenile American oysters. </plain></SENT>
