</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a leading cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The World Health Organization estimates an annual increase in the global burden by 3–4 million new infections [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Encouragingly for patients, advances in in vitro and in vivo HCV infection systems and increased understanding of HCV virology have led to the development of many promising HCV-specific direct acting antivirals (DAA) [2]–[6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>However, the high costs of DAA will limit their access to the large majority of HCV infected patients living in countries with limited resources. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>There is clearly a need for a preventive HCV vaccine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Humoral immunity is the primary correlate of protection for most preventive vaccines, as shown for smallpox and other DNA viruses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>For HCV, cumulative evidence supports the importance of virus neutralizing antibodies to facilitate clearance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Chimpanzee studies showed that protection from an infectious HCV inoculum is correlated with HCV-specific antibody titers blocking infection of target cells with pseudotyped retroviral particles expressing HCV E1E2 glycoproteins (HCVpp) [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Neutralizing antibody response measured via HCVpp has been associated with control of infection in single source outbreaks of acute HCV infections [8], [9], and in a study of active injection drug users (IDUs) [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>While only 25% of IDUs in this study cleared primary HCV infection, 83% cleared subsequent re-infection episodes, and clearance was associated with cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In addition, antibodies to HCV E2 prevent infection in a human liver-mouse chimeric model [11], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Finally, an immunocompetent humanized mouse model for HCV exhibited a robust antibody response to a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing HCV proteins that protected against an infectious HCV challenge in some animals that correlated with the serum level of E2 antibodies [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>A key challenge for vaccine design is to overcome the genetic diversity of the virus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>This will require information on conserved epitopes mediating virus neutralization and on the mechanisms of HCV escape from the humoral immune response. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>HCV is a positive-strand RNA virus encoding a polyprotein that undergoes proteolytic cleavage to 10 polypeptides, each with distinct functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The two envelope glycoproteins, E1 and E2, form a heterodimer that mediates viral entry [14]–[16] through interactions with cellular receptors (reviewed in [17]), and are the natural targets for neutralizing antibodies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Both proteins are highly glycosylated that partly shields the virus from neutralizing antibodies [18]–[21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The genes encoding E1 and E2 are the most variable in the HCV genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The hypervariable region one (HVR1) in E2 is immunodominant and infected individuals develop isolate-specific neutralizing antibodies against this region throughout the course of their infections [22], [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>These antibodies provide little protection since the HVR1 sequence continuously evolves in response to pressure exerted by HVR1-specific neutralizing antibodies leading to viral escape [23], [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>An effective HCV vaccine will need to include conserved epitopes that are able to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Much effort has been devoted to the identification of conserved regions mediating virus neutralization through the isolation and characterization of human monoclonal antibodies (HMAbs) from the B cells of HCV-infected individuals and of murine monoclonal antibodies from recombinant E2 glycoprotein immunized mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>The focus has been primarily on E2 since this viral structure interacts with HCV co-receptors and is more immunogenic than E1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Studies with HMAbs to E2 have led to the delineation of at least six distinct clusters of overlapping linear and nonlinear epitopes, designated as antigenic domains A-E [25]–[28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Many of these HMAbs from different laboratories are to overlapping epitopes, which can be grouped in one cluster, antigenic domain B. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Of concern, some domain B antibodies do not neutralize all HCV genotypes, which is indicative of escape [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Single amino acid substitutions also can lead to viral escape with other domain B antibodies [30], [31], similar to escape from antibodies against the HVR1 [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>There are three patterns of viral escape that are observed when infectious cell culture virions (HCVcc) are grown in the presence of neutralizing domain B antibodies [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Of the three tested domain B HMAbs, one led to escape mutant viruses without affecting in vitro viral fitness; a second led to escape but with compromised viral fitness; and a third led to complete virus elimination at a critical antibody concentration without escape mutants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of escape mutants revealed a conserved region, amino acid (aa) 529–535, and a region, aa 425–443, on E2 that appears to be associated with escape mutations [32]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Immediately downstream of HVR1 is a cluster of overlapping linear epitopes that are highly conserved across all HCV genotypes and subtypes, encompassing aa 412–423, but are of low immunogenicity in population studies [33], [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>A number of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies targeting this region have been isolated from experimentally immunized mice [16], [35]–[37] and a human monoclonal antibody, designated as HCV1, in a transgenic mouse [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Their precise contact residues have been resolved by direct crystal structure of E2 peptides in complex with two of these antibodies, AP33 and HCV1 [39]–[41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Other studies have also established that this region is involved in virus binding to the HCV co-receptor, CD81 [37], [42], which explains why this region is highly conserved in order to preserve essential viral functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Thus, antibodies to this region have held great promise for immunotherapy and vaccine development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>However, the Asn at 417 is an N-linked glycosylation site that shields this conserved region from being fully exposed to neutralizing antibodies by reducing epitope access [18]–[21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>An adaptive mutation N417S that leads to a glycan shift upstream to N415 blocks virus neutralization by AP33 and HCV1 [43]–[45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>The N-glycan shift at N417 occurs frequently in passaged HCVcc. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>The shift occurs in the absence of selection by neutralizing antibodies targeting this region, in the presence of neutralizing antibodies targeting different regions or in the presence of a non-HCV HMAb [28], [32]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>We recently isolated a panel of HMAbs to aa 412–423 [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, cell culture adapted 2a JFH1 HCVcc, containing mostly glycan shifted HCVcc at N417S and a minor population of wild-type (wt) HCVcc, displayed an increased sensitivity to neutralization by these HMAbs, in contrast to the lack of neutralization by a murine monoclonal antibody. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>This raised questions whether and how HCV can escape from human antibodies directed against aa 412–423, particularly because the mutation leading to an N-glycan shift from 417 to 415 does not lead to viral escape, but to an increase in sensitivity to these antibodies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>This report addresses these questions by assessing viral evolution in the presence of a HMAb against aa 412–423, designated as HC33.1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Sequence analyses of variants obtained at different time points when 2a HCVcc was co-cultured with HC33.1, from low to high antibody concentrations, revealed multiple patterns of mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>At low antibody concentrations, mutations occurred outside of aa 412–423 in combination with an N-glycan shift mutation at N417T. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>These variants exhibited improved viral fitness and reduced sensitivity to HC33.1 binding and neutralization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>At moderate antibody concentrations, a mutation was observed within the conserved aa 412–423 region at residue 419 in escape variants having compromised fitness and greater reduction in sensitivity to HC33.1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, when HC33.1 was removed, the 419 mutation-associated variants rapidly disappeared and the variants that emerged contained the wild-type residue at this position. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>At high antibody concentrations, a mutation at 413 was observed in variants that were completely resistant to HC33.1 neutralization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Taken together, multiple pathways are involved in viral escape from a single antibody that appear to be concentration dependent, and associated with and without compromised in vitro viral fitness in escape variants. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Employing AP33 as the prototype antibody to this region [16], [35]–[37], [43], epitope mapping of this and three HMAbs to aa 412–423, HC33.1, HC33.4 and HC33.8 (designated as antigenic domain E), revealed shared contact residues at L413, G418 and W420, as determined by &lt;20% binding to a panel of alanine substitution H77C E1E2 mutants (Fig. 1A) [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>No contact residues were identified between aa 425–443 with the HC33 HMAbs (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>They differed at residue 415, in which a N415A mutation led to AP33 binding reduction of 73% and the HC33 HMAbs having no binding reduction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>To define the different neutralization profiles of AP33 and HC33 HMAbs against glycan shifted HCVcc variants, JFH1 E1E2 plasmids were constructed to contain N417S or N417T. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>The N417S mutation has been shown to be an adaptive mutation [45] and the N417T change was observed in the HC33.1 selection studies (see below). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Both substitutions resulted in an N-glycan shift from residue 417 to N415. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Wild type and variant HCVcc bearing N417S or N417T were produced, and dose-dependent neutralization was measured with AP33 and the three antigenic domain E HMAbs (Fig. 1B–1D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>AP33 and HC33.1 neutralized wt HCVcc, which was poorly neutralized by HC33.4 and HC33.8 (Fig. 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>AP33 had a higher potency (IC50 at 3.5 µg/ml) than HC33.1 (IC50 at 12.5 µg/ml) (Fig. 1F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>The data is consistent with previous findings of AP33 having high neutralizing potencies against different HCV genotypes [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>In contrast, AP33 (up to 50 µg/ml) failed to neutralize the N417S and N417T HCVcc variants (Fig. 1C, 1D and 1F); whereas these variants remained sensitive to HC33.1, HC33.4 and HC33.8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>The neutralization potencies of the three domain E antibodies significantly improved and their IC50 values ranged 0.9 to 21.2 µg/ml. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>HC33.1 IC50 improved by over tenfold against both N417S/T variants compared to wt HCVcc. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Of note is that the contact residues for the HCV1 HMAb, isolated from a transgenic mouse that was challenged with recombinant E2 proteins, are similar to the HC33 antibodies, involving 413 and 420 but with a 20 percent reduction at 418 [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Yet escape variants for HCV1 have been documented to include N417T/S mutations [44], [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate the difference between previously isolated antibodies to aa 412–423 and the HC33 HMAbs that are elicited in response to viral infection undergoing an N-glycan shift from 417 to 415. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the increased potencies of the antigenic domain E HMAbs to glycan shifted virions confirm the importance of the N-glycan at 417 in shielding aa 412–423 from neutralizing human antibodies [18]–[21]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>In contrast, mutations within the region encompassing the epitope, aa 412–423, had different effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>The N-glycan shift associated mutation at S419N reverted to wt residue at this position when antibody selection pressure was lowered or withdrawn. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>The S419N associated variants, having compromised in vitro viral fitness, highlight the constraints on molecular evolution within the epitope because of the essential role of this region in HCV entry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>A third mutation at a contact residue, L413I, occurred at higher HC33.1 selection pressure that resulted in variants completely escaping virus neutralization by this antibody. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>These variants were stable and had in vitro viral fitness similar to wt HCVcc. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>Although the L413I mutation was elicited in these studies, the Leu in this position is highly conserved in patient sequences [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Only 11 of 2108 curated E2 sequences of &gt;100 bases length in the LANL Hepatitis C Virus Database, varied from Leu at this position [48], [49]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>Only one of the 1311 sequences contained Trp to Arg change at 420 and this is more likely due to PCR error since the W420R mutation is not tolerated in JFH1 HCVcc (unpublished data). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>The observed conservation of Leu at 413 raises a question why the L413I mutation has not been documented more frequently in light of our studies and because the L413I associated variants are stable, and without compromised fitness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>One possible explanation is that HC33-like antibodies are of low frequency [33], [34] and when present are of low titers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>The low immunogenicity of aa 413–423 is possibly due to the masking effect of HVR1 [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the L413I mutation is not necessary for HCV infection to persist in the majority of HCV infected individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>Another possibility is that this mutation is strictly an in vitro virus-antibody co-culture phenomenon. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>In previous studies with antigenic domain B antibodies, epitope mapping by alanine scanning revealed that their cognate epitopes were located in two discontinuous segments on E2, encompassing aa 425–443 and aa 529–535 [32], [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>The region at 529–535 is highly conserved and under functional constraints, because these residues participate in E2 interaction with CD81 [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>The 425–443 region located immediately downstream of the 412–423 region is a more variable region and five of these residues at positions 431, 434, 435, 438 and 439 are sites of escape mutations from domain B antibody-mediated neutralization [28], [31], [32]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>In the current studies, partial escape from HC33.1 at low antibody concentrations also involved the 434 residue, although this antibody is against a linear epitope upstream of this location. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>A mutation at 434 reduced antibody binding and neutralization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>These observations taken together outline a functional sequence organization at the N-terminal end of E2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>It consists of a conserved region at aa 412–423 that is flanked by two variable regions, the HVR1 located at aa 383–411 and a second variable region located at 425–443. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>While mutations within HVR1 are mostly in response to antibodies directed at linear epitopes within HVR1, the 425–443 variable region is responsible for escape from antigenic domain B antibodies and now, antigenic domain E antibodies (as represented by HC33.1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>It is possible that the K610R mutation is indicative of a different variable region on E2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>In other studies, we found that the C-terminal end of this 425–443 variable region, encompassing 441–443, is actually quite conserved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>These three residues form a critical binding pocket of a cluster of overlapping epitopes, designated as antigenic domain D [28], [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>HMAbs directed at domain D are not likely to be associated with viral escape. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>Taking this into consideration, the variable region is more restricted to the region encompassing aa 425–440. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>The second pathway of escape involves mutations associated with a glycan shift. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>Asparagine (N-) linked protein glycosylation plays crucial roles in viral protein folding and in regulation of protein functions that include epitope accessibility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>The most commonly used glycosylation sequon was first defined as Asn-X aa-Ser/Thr (Xaa Pro) [53], and since this first observation, more variable sequons have been reported (review in [54]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>In the aa 412–423 sequence on E2, there are three residues, N415, N417 and S419, perfectly placed for a “glycosylation sequon” that allows a glycan shift either forward (+2) or backward (−2) [55]–[57] with the N417 as the key residue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>Through the studies of HCV evolution in the presence of HC33.1, at least four escape strategies are linked to these three residues that impact antibody access to its epitope and affecting the neutralization potency of the antibody. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>However, some of these escape mechanisms are associated with a cost in fitness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>First, Asn at the 417 position, designated as the first N-glycan among twelve in the highly glycosylated HCV E2 glycoprotein, is highly conserved among HCV genotype and subtype isolates [18]–[21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>The position of this N1 glycan appears to have a greater negative modulating effect on HC33.1 than AP33, with both directed at aa 412–423 (Fig. 1B–1D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>This is supported by the observed shift in viral population from predominantly N417S in the virus stock (P0) back to a more uniform wt population, as soon as the virus was exposed to HC33.1, albeit at a low concentration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>The reappearance of wt JFH1 HCVcc was the first step in viral escape because wt virus is more resistant to HC33.1 neutralization than the N417S variant (Fig. 1B and 1C). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>Second, the glycan shift associated with the N417S mutation occurs spontaneously, as observed in natural infection [44], [46] and in passaged cell culture HCVcc [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>The N417S change is an adaptive mutation that leads to a variant with greater in vitro viral fitness (Fig. 2E) and is able to completely escape from AP33, but not the HC33 antibodies to aa 412–423 (Fig. 1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>The implication is that AP33 and the HMAb HCV1 [44]–[46] targeting the same region as HC33.1 are more glycan-dependent. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="343" pm="."><plain>Third, both Ser and Thr are believed to be equal alternative amino acids in glycosylation sequon (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>However, the selection of Thr substitution (Asn-Xaa-Thr) is associated with HC33.1 immune pressure and not Ser substitution (Asn-Xaa-Ser) (Fig. 2B and 2C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>The finding that N417S associated variants began to be detected after withdrawal of HC33.1 from passaged virus supports our analysis of a Thr substitution specifically induced by this antibody (Fig. 4B and 4C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>The reason why Asn-Xaa-Thr was preferentially selected in the presence of antibody is not entirely clear because N417T HCVcc and N417S HCVcc have similar fitness and sensitivity to HC33.1 (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>Some studies noted that glycosylation of Asn-Xaa-Thr sequons is approximately 40 times more efficient than that of Asn-Xaa-Ser sequons [58], [59]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>In addition, the selection of Asn-Xaa-Thr over Asn-Xaa-Ser occurred in response to an antibody directed at the aa 412–423 region but not by neutralizing antibodies directed at other antigenic regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>When escape studies were performed with antigenic domain B antibodies, the N417T mutation has not been observed [28], [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>Importantly, during viral evolution in the presence of HC33.1, the N434D, K610R and S419N escape mutations occurred in the context of N417T and not N417S. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the N417T change is a specific response to HC33.1 and not an adaptive mutation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="352" pm="."><plain>The identification of the N417T mutation provides additional support that the virus-antibody co-culture studies with 2a HCVcc is applicable to escape studies with other HCV genotypes/isolates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="353" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies with HMAb HCV1 in liver transplant recipients infected with genotype 1a led to escape variants having the N417T or N417S mutations [44]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="354" pm="."><plain>Fourth, it is possible that the S419N mutation generated a new glycan at 419 using −2 glycosylation sequon (Thr-Xaa-Asn) [55]–[57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="355" pm="."><plain>A shared element between N1 and S419N-associated glycans is that the middle residue in both sequons is G418, a contact residue for HC33.1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="356" pm="."><plain>Antibody access to this residue will be blocked by either glycans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="357" pm="."><plain>The S419N glycan is more efficient than the N1 glycan in shielding the HC33.1 and resulting in a significant drop in antibody binding and neutralization (Fig. 3A–3C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="358" pm="."><plain>However, the formation of the S419N glycan is associated with compromised in vitro viral fitness, which can be attributed to this glycan being in closer proximity to W420, a contact residue for virus binding to CD81 [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="359" pm="."><plain>The effect of S419N glycan shift in reducing HC33.1 binding explains the persistence of variants with compromised fitness over the course of multiple passages (P20–P29) under continuous immune selection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="360" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the cost in viral fitness associated with S419N explains why the N434D mutation occurred first in the context of N417T because the fitness of these variants was not significantly compromised. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="361" pm="."><plain>But the ability of this mutation to reduce HC33.1 binding was not as significant as S419N. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="362" pm="."><plain>The transition from nearly uniform wt virions (P6–P9) to variants that were more able to co-exist with low levels of HC33.1 in phase II (P18) (Fig. 2B) appears to be a non-random process during viral evolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="363" pm="."><plain>There were a restricted number of mutations at a limited number of sites during sequence space expansion (P10) and contraction (P13–P14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="364" pm="."><plain>All four variants had a combination of N417T, N434D and K610R mutations at P13–14 that were the same mutations in the dominant variantN417T/N434D/K610R at P18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="365" pm="."><plain>In this phase of viral escape, a mutation occurred in a region that is more variable, e.g., 425–440, and not under functional constraints. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="366" pm="."><plain>Mutations in this variable region are more likely to be in stable variants that persist regardless of continuous presence of neutralizing antibody (Fig. 4A) or absence of antibody (Fig. 4C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="367" pm="."><plain>The development of stable variants or quasispecies that are more resistant to virus neutralization partly explains why HCV co-exists with neutralizing antibodies during chronic infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="368" pm="."><plain>While this balance between variants having robust fitness and antibody can be maintained in repeated passages (Fig. 4A), it can be disrupted by a slight increase in antibody concentration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="369" pm="."><plain>When HC33.1 reached 5 µg/ml at P20 (Fig. 2C), a quadruple mutation emerged precisely by the addition of the S419N mutation onto the existed triple mutation variant, without undergoing a sequence space expansion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="370" pm="."><plain>The quadruple mutation variant preferentially replicated over the triple mutation variant (from P20 to P27). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="371" pm="."><plain>Although the quadruple mutation variantN417T/S419N/N434D/K610R can co-exist at higher levels of HC33.1 (5.0–6.0 µg/ml), viral escape is still incomplete since the virus can be neutralized at a higher percentage at higher antibody concentrations (Fig. 3A and 3B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="372" pm="."><plain>This suggests that incomplete escape is sufficient for the virus to co-exist with HC33.1. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="373" pm="."><plain>The antibody concentration-dependent stepwise escape pattern is suggestive of low affinity or low antibody concentration facilitating the formation of escape variants or quasispecies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="374" pm="."><plain>This could be the scenario during acute HCV infection when a wide range of lower affinity neutralizing antibodies is more likely to be elicited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="375" pm="."><plain>As acute infection progresses to persistent infection, a more robust neutralizing antibody response provides immune pressure that leads to the selection of escape variants with compromised fitness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="376" pm="."><plain>This in turn will contribute to a transient reduction in viral load resulting in a reduced B cell response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="377" pm="."><plain>The lowering of a neutralizing antibody response leads to the release of virions with greater fitness but potentially greater sensitivity to virus neutralization, as observed when the S419N mutation changed back to wt when the neutralizing antibody was removed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="378" pm="."><plain>This cycle may explain in part persistent viremia during chronic HCV infection in the presence of serum neutralizing antibodies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="379" pm="."><plain>At the same time, our findings pose a different challenge to vaccine development beyond the identification of highly conserved epitopes mediating virus neutralization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="380" pm="."><plain>It will be necessary to induce high potency neutralizing antibodies to multiple epitopes within 412–423 that prevent the formation of escape variants, which can co-exist with lower potency or levels of neutralizing activities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="381" pm="."><plain>The fact that the aa 412–423 segment on E2 is the target of both AP33-like and HC33.1-like antibodies increases the importance of this region in an effective HCV vaccine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="382" pm="."><plain>It will be more difficult for the virus to escape simultaneously from both sets of these antibodies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="383" pm="."><plain>The isolation and characterization of neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies to HCV will further our understanding of viral neutralization escape mechanisms that will be necessary for vaccine design. </plain></SENT>
