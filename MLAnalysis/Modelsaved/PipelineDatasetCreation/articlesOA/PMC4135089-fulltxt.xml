Here, we demonstrated that the reduced susceptibility of astrocytes to WNV-MAD78 is due to a combination of both cellular activities as well as viral determinants. Analyses of the viral particle indicated that astrocyte-derived WNV-MAD78 particles were less infectious than those of WNV-NY. Additionally, inhibition of cellular furin-like proteases increased WNV-MAD78 infectious particle production in astrocytes, suggesting that high levels of furin-like protease activity within these cells acted in a cell- and strain-specific manner to inhibit WNV-MAD78 replication. Moreover, analysis of recombinant viruses indicated that the structural proteins of WNV-MAD78 were responsible for decreased particle infectivity and the corresponding reduction in infectious particle production compared with WNV-NY. Thus, the composition of the WNV virion was also a major determinant for viral fitness within astrocytes and may contribute to WNV propagation within the central nervous system. Whether the WNV-MAD78 structural genes reduce virus replication and particle infectivity through the same mechanism as the cellular furin-like protease activity or whether these two determinants function through distinct pathways remains to be determined.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="sp1">National Institutes of Health</funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">AI083397</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="sp2">National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program</funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>OpenAccessEmbargo</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>West Nile virus (WNV) is a neurotropic member of the genus <italic>Flavivirus</italic> that has emerged recently as a significant threat to human health. Historically, most WNV infections have been asymptomatic or associated with a mild febrile illness known as West Nile fever. However, recent outbreaks in the Western hemisphere have been characterized by a marked increase in the percentage of neurological infections. Since 1999, infections have resulted in &gt;17&#8202;000 cases of severe neurological disease in the USA alone (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/westnile/statsMaps/">http://www.cdc.gov/westnile/statsMaps/</ext-link>), making WNV the leading cause of arboviral encephalitis in North America. The viral factors responsible for the increased incidence of neurological disease associated with these recent outbreaks remain poorly understood.</p><p>The WNV life cycle begins with attachment of the virus to the cell surface. Whilst attachment in some cell types is mediated by interactions between the viral envelope (E) protein and integrin &#945;<sub>V</sub>&#946;<sub>3</sub> (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">Davis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006a</xref>), binding of <italic>N</italic>-linked glycans present on the viral glycoproteins to the lectin-binding proteins DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR contributes to attachment in other cells (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">Davis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006b</xref>; <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">Martina <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Following attachment, virus particles are internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis and transported to endosomes (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">Brinton, 2002</xref>). Exposure to the low pH of the endosome triggers fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane, thereby releasing the viral genome into the cytoplasm. The incoming viral genome serves as a template for both translation of viral proteins and replication. Once sufficient levels of viral proteins and nascent RNA genomes accumulate, immature particles, which consist of the viral genome surrounded by the capsid (C), precursor membrane (prM) and E proteins, assemble at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. During egress through the secretory pathway, cleavage of prM by furin-like proteases promotes conformational changes to the global structure of the virion, which leads to the formation of the mature virus particle. As the virion is released into the extracellular milieu, the cleaved precursor portion dissociates, completing the maturation process.</p><p>In many cell types, cleavage of prM is inefficient, resulting in the production of particles with maturation states ranging from fully immature to fully mature (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">Nelson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">Pierson &amp; Diamond, 2012</xref>). Early studies suggested that complete maturation is necessary to render flavivirus particles infectious (<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">Stadler <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). However, recent studies have demonstrated that not only are virions retaining uncleaved prM infectious (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">Colpitts <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">Mukherjee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">Nelson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">Zybert <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), but that complete maturation may be detrimental to WNV replication under certain circumstances (<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">Zybert <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Whilst most strains of WNV contain a glycosylation site in both E and the precursor portion of prM, some non-pathogenic strains lack the E glycosylation site. For these non-pathogenic strains, maturation removes all <italic>N</italic>-linked glycans from the virion, abrogating attachment to the cell via C-type lectins and reducing infectivity on cells expressing DC-SIGN or DC-SIGNR (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">Davis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006b</xref>). Thus, virus maturation status and the presence of <italic>N</italic>-linked glycans on the virion may influence WNV pathogenesis. Indeed, several studies have demonstrated that the glycosylation state of the viral particle contributes to the pathogenicity of WNV (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">Beasley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">Botha <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">Hanna <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">Hobson-Peters <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">Scherret <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>).</p><p>WNV primarily enters the central nervous system (CNS) by crossing the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">Cho &amp; Diamond, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">Hussmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">Roe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">Verma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). The BBB is a highly restrictive barrier that protects the CNS from aberrant immune responses and pathogens in the periphery (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">Abbott, 2002</xref>). Interactions between WNV and components of the BBB therefore have the potential to impact neuropathogenesis significantly. The BBB comprises endothelial cells, which line the cerebral vasculature, and astrocytes, which are in direct contact with the endothelial cells. Astrocytes play a central role in maintaining homeostasis within the CNS by regulating the integrity of the BBB as well as the uptake of excess neurotransmitters and other extracellular factors that may perturb neurotransmission (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">Abbott, 2002</xref>). Moreover, evidence suggests that WNV replication in astrocytes may influence the physiological outcome of viral infections of the CNS (<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">Roe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">Verma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>In astrocytes, replication of an avirulent lineage 2 African isolate, WNV-MAD78, is delayed and reduced compared with that of a highly virulent lineage 1 isolate, WNV-NY (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">Hussmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Here, we examined the viral and cellular factors responsible for this differential replication. We observed that within astrocytes, WNV-MAD78 infectious particle production was reduced by the high activity of furin-like proteases. As maturation enhances WNV infectious particle production in other cell lines (<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">Stadler <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>), this finding suggests that furin-dependent restriction of WNV-MAD78 replication is an astrocyte-specific mechanism. Astrocyte-derived WNV-MAD78 particles were also significantly less infectious than those of WNV-NY. Characterization of a series of WNV-NY and WNV-MAD78 chimeric viruses suggested that the structural proteins were the primary viral components that dictated particle infectivity and infectious particle production. Thus, WNV structural proteins were principal determinants of viral propagation within astrocytes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>WNV-MAD78 replication in astrocytes is not restricted by a secreted host factor</title><p>In astrocytes, the reduction in WNV-MAD78 replication compared with that of WNV-NY is due in part to IFN-independent programmes (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">Hussmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). To determine if another secreted factor contributes to the reduction in WNV-MAD78 replication, we assessed the inhibitory potential of supernatant collected from WNV-infected astrocytes. Human brain cortical astrocytes (HBCAs) were treated with UV-inactivated supernatants recovered from mock-, WNV-NY- or WNV-MAD78-infected HBCAs. Whilst treatment of HBCAs with supernatants from mock-infected cells had no effect on viral titres, supernatants recovered from WNV-infected cells significantly reduced WNV-NY replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). However, neutralizing antibodies to IFN-&#945; and IFN-&#946; completely abrogated the inhibitory capacity of the WNV supernatants, indicating that the effect was due to type I IFN and not another secreted factor. Unlike WNV-NY, WNV-MAD78 infectious particle production was not affected by treatment with supernatants from WNV-infected cultures in either the presence or absence of antibodies to type I IFN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). These results were consistent with the finding that in astrocytes, IFN plays a role in restricting the replication of WNV-NY but not WNV-MAD78 (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">Hussmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, our findings indicated that the lower level of WNV-MAD78 replication compared with that of WNV-NY in HBCAs was not due to the antiviral effects of a secreted factor.</p><fig id="f1" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Fig. 1. </label><caption><p>Examination of the role of a secreted factor in limiting WNV infection in astrocytes. HBCAs were pretreated (6 h) with UV-inactivated supernatants recovered from mock- or WNV-infected HBCAs (with or without antibodies to type I IFN or corresponding isotype control) and infected with (a) WNV-NY or (b) WNV-MAD78 (m.o.i. 0.01). After 1 h at 37 &#176;C, the viral inoculum was replaced with UV-inactivated supernatants (with or without antibodies to type I IFN or corresponding isotype control).

Therefore, we compared WNV-NY and WNV-MAD78 particle production using a virus counter, which utilized two dyes in a flow-cytometry-based system to detect nucleic acid and protein simultaneously, thereby excluding empty particles and cellular debris from analysis. Using this approach, we found that similar levels of total viral particles were present in supernatants from WNV-NY- and WNV-MAD78-infected astrocytes at 24 and 48 h post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Furthermore, when the total number of cells infected with each virus was determined by flow cytometry, we found that WNV-MAD78-infected HBCAs produced more particles per infected cell than HBCAs infected with WNV-NY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Comparison of the physical counts of total virus particles obtained from the virus counter and the biological counts of infectious particles determined by plaque assay on Vero cells indicated that the particle/p.f.u. ratio was higher for WNV-MAD78 than WNV-NY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Thus, WNV-MAD78 particles produced by HBCAs were less infectious than WNV-NY particles produced by HBCAs. To determine if the differential infectivity was specific to astrocyte-derived virus particles, we examined viral particles produced by human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) &#8211; a cell line in which WNV-MAD78 and WNV-NY replicate at similar rates and to similar levels (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">Hussmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). The particle/p.f.u. ratios for WNV-NY and WNV-MAD78 were similar in HBMECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). To confirm these results, we also determined the level of genome equivalents per p.f.u. in the supernatants recovered from WNV-infected HBCAs and HBMECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e, f</xref>). Consistent with our findings using the virus counter, HBCA-derived WNV-MAD78 exhibited lower infectivity compared with HBCA-derived WNV-NY, whilst particles produced by HBMECs had similar levels of infectivity. Together, our findings suggested that the reduction in WNV-MAD78 replication in HBCAs was due in part to a decrease in particle infectivity.</p><fig id="f2" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Fig. 2. </label><caption><p>Infectivity of HBCA-derived particles.

To test this, we assessed HBMEC- and HBCA-derived WNV-MAD78 and WNV-NY particle stability at 37 &#176;C. The infectivity of WNV-NY and WNV-MAD78 particles produced by HBMECs decreased ~100-fold over 72 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). In contrast, the infectivity of both WNV-NY and WNV-MAD78 particles produced by HBCAs was reduced nearly 10<sup>6</sup>-fold under the same conditions. Thus, WNV particles produced by HBCAs were significantly less stable than WNV particles produced by HBMECs. Nevertheless, the rate at which WNV-MAD78 particles lost infectivity over time was not significantly different from that of WNV-NY particles in either cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>), suggesting that the differential replication of these viruses in HBCAs was not due to the enhanced stability of WNV-NY particles compared with that of WNV-MAD78 particles.</p><fig id="f3" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Fig. 3. </label><caption><p>Stability of HBCA- and HBMEC-derived WNV particles.

For WNV, maturation efficiency is mediated by cellular furin-like serine proteases. We hypothesized that the degree of furin activity within a cell may impact WNV-MAD78 infectious particle production more than WNV-NY infectious particle production. Thus, we predicted that furin activity in cell types exhibiting similar levels of WNV-NY and WNV-MAD78 infectious particle production would be higher than in cells where WNV-MAD78 infectious particle production was impaired. However, when we compared HBCAs and HBMECs, the level of furin activity was approximately fourfold higher in HBCAs than in HBMECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Therefore, furin activity correlated inversely with WNV-MAD78 infectious particle production. To assess directly if furin activity in astrocytes affected WNV-MAD78 replication, we compared WNV-NY and WNV-MAD78 particle to p.f.u. ratio in the presence and absence of furin inhibitors. Addition of furin inhibitors had no effect on WNV-NY particle to p.f.u. ratio in HBCAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). In contrast, WNV-MAD78 particle to p.f.u. ratio increased in the presence of the furin inhibitors, suggesting that the high level of furin-like protease activity in astrocytes contributed to the decrease in WNV-MAD78 infectious particle production compared with that of WNV-NY.</p><fig id="f4" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Fig. 4. </label><caption><p>Effect of furin-like protease activity on infectious particle production in astrocytes.

Thus, driving viral particle maturation to completion may impair WNV-MAD78&#8217;s ability to bind and infect astrocytes, which express DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR (data not shown and <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">Davis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006b</xref>; <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">Martina <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). WNV-NY, in contrast, may retain its ability to bind DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR after maturation due to the second glycosylation site within E. Variations in glycosylation may therefore account for the differential effects of furin-like protease activity on WNV-NY and WNV-MAD78 in HBCAs. To assess the effect of glycosylation of the E protein on WNV replication in astrocytes, we generated recombinant viruses in which the glycosylation sites within the E proteins of WNV-MAD78 and WNV-NY were exchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). The glycosylation status of the recombinant viruses was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Neither introduction of a glycosylation site into the E protein of WNV-MAD78 (WNV-MAD78<sup>P156S</sup>) nor removal of the glycosylation site from WNV-NY (WNV-NY<sup>S156P</sup>) altered viral replication rates or peak viral levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c, d</xref>).

Moreover, both viral and cellular factors contribute to this lower infectivity. Characterization of chimeras of WNV-MAD78 and WNV-NY indicated that the infectivity of astrocyte-derived WNV particles corresponds to the cognate structural proteins. Examination of the cellular factors involved in the astrocyte-specific restriction to WNV-MAD78 replication indicated that high levels of furin-like protease inhibited WNV-MAD78, but not WNV-NY, infectious particle production. In contrast, the classical innate antiviral pathways did not contribute to the reduced level of WNV-MAD78 replication.</p><p>Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type within the CNS and play a key role in regulating CNS homeostasis (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">Abbott, 2002</xref>).

Various secreted factors, such as the chemokine ligand CCL5, IFN, nitrous oxide, reactive nitrogen species and exosomes, play a role in restricting infection of astrocytes by several neurotropic viruses including herpes virus, human immunodeficiency virus and Junin virus (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">G&#243;mez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">Hu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Although WNV-infected astrocytes express IFN-&#946;, CCL5 and additional chemokines (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">Hussmann &amp; Fredericksen, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">Hussmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">Kumar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), our analyses indicated that secreted factors are not involved in inhibiting WNV-MAD78 infectious particle production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>) (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">Hussmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). However, IFN-&#946; is responsible for limiting WNV-NY replication in astrocytes (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">Hussmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Thus, although WNV infection triggers many of the same antiviral programmes as other neurotropic viruses, the effect of these responses in controlling infection is both virus and strain specific.</p><p>As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses utilize various cellular components throughout their life cycle. As a result, differential interactions with basic cellular functions may account for strain-to-strain variations in infectivity. One cellular factor that modulates WNV infectivity is furin-like protease activity, which mediates maturation of the virus particle. In cell types representative of a peripheral infection, increased levels of furin-like protease activity enhance WNV particle maturation and infectivity (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">Davis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006b</xref>; <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">Mukherjee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">Pierson &amp; Diamond, 2012</xref>). However, we found that furin activity inversely correlated with the susceptibility of cell types comprising the neurovascular unit to WNV infection, as more permissive HBMECs (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">Hussmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) contained lower levels of furin activity than the more restrictive astrocytes. Moreover, inhibition of furin enhanced infectious particle production of WNV-MAD78 in astrocytes, demonstrating that furin is one of the factors responsible for the increased resistance of this cell type to WNV-MAD78. For many viruses, maturation of viral structural proteins is mediated by furin-like proteases. As such, inhibitors of furin have been proposed as a novel class of broad-spectrum antiviral compounds (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">Becker <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). However, our findings suggest that in the case of WNV, furin&#8217;s role in mediating particle infectivity may be more complex. The effectiveness of furin inhibitors as antiviral compounds against WNV is therefore likely to be cell type dependent and may in fact augment WNV infections in the CNS.</p><p>One result of furin processing of WNV particles is a decrease in the level of <italic>N</italic>-linked glycans on the virion surface. As glycosylated proteins on viral particles can facilitate binding to the host cell through attachment factors such as DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">Davis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006b</xref>; <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">Martina <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), a decrease in glycosylated proteins may reduce infectivity. We found that the presence or absence of an <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation site in the E protein of WNV-MAD78 or WNV-NY had no effect on the growth of either strain in astrocytes. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of furin is independent of glycosylation status. Moreover, this finding suggests that attachment of WNV to astrocytes is largely carbohydrate independent. Indeed, although astrocytes express DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">Deiva <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref> and data not shown), blocking antibodies to these receptors had no effect on infectious particle production (data not shown). Several studies have shown that the glycosylation state of the viral particle contributes to the pathogenicity of WNV (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">Beasley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">Hanna <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">Hobson-Peters <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">Scherret <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). However, the basis for this difference in pathogenicity remains unclear. As both WNV-MAD78 and WNV-NY replicate in other cells of the CNS (i.e. neurons and endothelial cells) at equivalent rates (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">Hussmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) and glycosylation did not affect WNV replication within astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>), the glycosylation site on E may not play a role in regulating infection of the primary cell types within the CNS. Instead, within the CNS, the pathogenic effect of the glycosylation state may be due to alteration of infection and/or stimulation of immune cells.</p><p>Analysis of chimeric viruses of WNV-NY and WNV-MAD78 indicated that infectious particle production and particle infectivity corresponded primarily to the structural, not non-structural, components of the viruses. However, the slightly higher levels of WNV-MAD78/NY compared with WT WNV-MAD78 at 48 h post-infection suggest that the non-structural proteins may influence infectious particle production later during infection. In addition, viral fitness was not dependent on a single structural component, as further analyses indicated that WNV-NY chimeras containing either C and prM or the E protein of WNV-MAD78 exhibited decreased infectious particle production and infectivity. Whilst the precise defect in astrocyte-derived WNV-MAD78 particles is not known, the involvement of the viral structural proteins suggests that these virions are inefficient at one or more steps in the entry process. The structural proteins define the composition of the virion, and therefore are major determinants for permissiveness and proliferation. Furthermore, as the main proteins exposed to the host, the structure proteins induce strong antibody and cellular-mediated immune responses (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">Diamond <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Therefore, determination of the specific moieties or regions of the structural proteins that determine virulence and are necessary for efficient replication in the CNS could lead to development of improved subunit vaccines.</p><p>The variation in viral fitness of particles produced by astrocytes, the most abundant cell type within the CNS, may have several consequences for WNV-mediated neuropathology. For WNV-NY, the higher infectivity of particles produced by astrocytes may permit the rapid spread to more permissive cells within the CNS, such as neurons and endothelial cells, as well as infiltrating immune cells. Conversely, the less infectious nature of astrocyte-derived WNV-MAD78 may limit this strain&#8217;s ability to infect neighbouring non-astrocyte cell types. Furthermore, the production of high levels of non-infectious particles by WNV-MAD78 may provide optimal material for stimulation of the innate antiviral response within surrounding cells and the rapid activation of antigen-presenting cells. These combined effects may facilitate the rapid clearance of non-pathogenic strains, such as WNV-MAD78, from the CNS prior to widespread destruction of neurons.</p><p>Overall, our data suggest that both viral and cellular factors contribute to WNV-MAD78&#8217;s decreased infectivity and replication in astrocytes. Indeed, the differential effect of furin-like proteases on viral structural proteins may be responsible for this strain- and cell-type-specific restriction to WNV replication. Thus, the quality of viral particles produced in astrocytes, and not just the quantity, may be a determining factor in WNV replication within the CNS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2-7"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Cells and viruses.</title><p>Primary HBCAs (ABRI371) derived from normal human tissue were purchased from CellSystems and maintained according to the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions.
