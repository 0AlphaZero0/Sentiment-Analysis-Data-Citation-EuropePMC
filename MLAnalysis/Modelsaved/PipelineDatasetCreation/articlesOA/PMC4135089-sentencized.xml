</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>West Nile virus (WNV) is a neurotropic member of the genus Flavivirus that has emerged recently as a significant threat to human health. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Historically, most WNV infections have been asymptomatic or associated with a mild febrile illness known as West Nile fever. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, recent outbreaks in the Western hemisphere have been characterized by a marked increase in the percentage of neurological infections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Since 1999, infections have resulted in &gt;17 000 cases of severe neurological disease in the USA alone (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/westnile/statsMaps/">http://www.cdc.gov/westnile/statsMaps/</ext-link>), making WNV the leading cause of arboviral encephalitis in North America. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The viral factors responsible for the increased incidence of neurological disease associated with these recent outbreaks remain poorly understood. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The WNV life cycle begins with attachment of the virus to the cell surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Whilst attachment in some cell types is mediated by interactions between the viral envelope (E) protein and integrin αVβ3 (Davis et al., 2006a), binding of N-linked glycans present on the viral glycoproteins to the lectin-binding proteins DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR contributes to attachment in other cells (Davis et al., 2006b; Martina et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Following attachment, virus particles are internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis and transported to endosomes (Brinton, 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Exposure to the low pH of the endosome triggers fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane, thereby releasing the viral genome into the cytoplasm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The incoming viral genome serves as a template for both translation of viral proteins and replication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Once sufficient levels of viral proteins and nascent RNA genomes accumulate, immature particles, which consist of the viral genome surrounded by the capsid (C), precursor membrane (prM) and E proteins, assemble at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>During egress through the secretory pathway, cleavage of prM by furin-like proteases promotes conformational changes to the global structure of the virion, which leads to the formation of the mature virus particle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>As the virion is released into the extracellular milieu, the cleaved precursor portion dissociates, completing the maturation process. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In many cell types, cleavage of prM is inefficient, resulting in the production of particles with maturation states ranging from fully immature to fully mature (Nelson et al., 2008; Pierson &amp; Diamond, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Early studies suggested that complete maturation is necessary to render flavivirus particles infectious (Stadler et al., 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>However, recent studies have demonstrated that not only are virions retaining uncleaved prM infectious (Colpitts et al., 2011; Mukherjee et al., 2011; Nelson et al., 2008; Zybert et al., 2008), but that complete maturation may be detrimental to WNV replication under certain circumstances (Zybert et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Whilst most strains of WNV contain a glycosylation site in both E and the precursor portion of prM, some non-pathogenic strains lack the E glycosylation site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>For these non-pathogenic strains, maturation removes all N-linked glycans from the virion, abrogating attachment to the cell via C-type lectins and reducing infectivity on cells expressing DC-SIGN or DC-SIGNR (Davis et al., 2006b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Thus, virus maturation status and the presence of N-linked glycans on the virion may influence WNV pathogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Indeed, several studies have demonstrated that the glycosylation state of the viral particle contributes to the pathogenicity of WNV (Beasley et al., 2005; Botha et al., 2008; Hanna et al., 2005; Hobson-Peters et al., 2008; Scherret et al., 2001). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>WNV primarily enters the central nervous system (CNS) by crossing the blood–brain barrier (BBB) (Cho &amp; Diamond, 2012; Hussmann et al., 2013; Roe et al., 2012; Verma et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The BBB is a highly restrictive barrier that protects the CNS from aberrant immune responses and pathogens in the periphery (Abbott, 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Interactions between WNV and components of the BBB therefore have the potential to impact neuropathogenesis significantly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The BBB comprises endothelial cells, which line the cerebral vasculature, and astrocytes, which are in direct contact with the endothelial cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Astrocytes play a central role in maintaining homeostasis within the CNS by regulating the integrity of the BBB as well as the uptake of excess neurotransmitters and other extracellular factors that may perturb neurotransmission (Abbott, 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Moreover, evidence suggests that WNV replication in astrocytes may influence the physiological outcome of viral infections of the CNS (Roe et al., 2012; Verma et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>In astrocytes, replication of an avirulent lineage 2 African isolate, WNV-MAD78, is delayed and reduced compared with that of a highly virulent lineage 1 isolate, WNV-NY (Hussmann et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Here, we examined the viral and cellular factors responsible for this differential replication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>We observed that within astrocytes, WNV-MAD78 infectious particle production was reduced by the high activity of furin-like proteases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>As maturation enhances WNV infectious particle production in other cell lines (Stadler et al., 1997), this finding suggests that furin-dependent restriction of WNV-MAD78 replication is an astrocyte-specific mechanism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Astrocyte-derived WNV-MAD78 particles were also significantly less infectious than those of WNV-NY. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Characterization of a series of WNV-NY and WNV-MAD78 chimeric viruses suggested that the structural proteins were the primary viral components that dictated particle infectivity and infectious particle production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Thus, WNV structural proteins were principal determinants of viral propagation within astrocytes. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>In astrocytes, the reduction in WNV-MAD78 replication compared with that of WNV-NY is due in part to IFN-independent programmes (Hussmann et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>To determine if another secreted factor contributes to the reduction in WNV-MAD78 replication, we assessed the inhibitory potential of supernatant collected from WNV-infected astrocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Human brain cortical astrocytes (HBCAs) were treated with UV-inactivated supernatants recovered from mock-, WNV-NY- or WNV-MAD78-infected HBCAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Whilst treatment of HBCAs with supernatants from mock-infected cells had no effect on viral titres, supernatants recovered from WNV-infected cells significantly reduced WNV-NY replication (Fig. 1a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>However, neutralizing antibodies to IFN-α and IFN-β completely abrogated the inhibitory capacity of the WNV supernatants, indicating that the effect was due to type I IFN and not another secreted factor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Unlike WNV-NY, WNV-MAD78 infectious particle production was not affected by treatment with supernatants from WNV-infected cultures in either the presence or absence of antibodies to type I IFN (Fig. 1b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>These results were consistent with the finding that in astrocytes, IFN plays a role in restricting the replication of WNV-NY but not WNV-MAD78 (Hussmann et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our findings indicated that the lower level of WNV-MAD78 replication compared with that of WNV-NY in HBCAs was not due to the antiviral effects of a secreted factor. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>As WNV-MAD78’s decreased replication compared with that of WNV-NY was not due to a secreted host factor, we hypothesized that it may be a result of impaired WNV-MAD78 particle production or infectivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we compared WNV-NY and WNV-MAD78 particle production using a virus counter, which utilized two dyes in a flow-cytometry-based system to detect nucleic acid and protein simultaneously, thereby excluding empty particles and cellular debris from analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Using this approach, we found that similar levels of total viral particles were present in supernatants from WNV-NY- and WNV-MAD78-infected astrocytes at 24 and 48 h post-infection (Fig. 2a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, when the total number of cells infected with each virus was determined by flow cytometry, we found that WNV-MAD78-infected HBCAs produced more particles per infected cell than HBCAs infected with WNV-NY (Fig. 2b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the physical counts of total virus particles obtained from the virus counter and the biological counts of infectious particles determined by plaque assay on Vero cells indicated that the particle/p.f.u. ratio was higher for WNV-MAD78 than WNV-NY (Fig. 2c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Thus, WNV-MAD78 particles produced by HBCAs were less infectious than WNV-NY particles produced by HBCAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>To determine if the differential infectivity was specific to astrocyte-derived virus particles, we examined viral particles produced by human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) – a cell line in which WNV-MAD78 and WNV-NY replicate at similar rates and to similar levels (Hussmann et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>The particle/p.f.u. ratios for WNV-NY and WNV-MAD78 were similar in HBMECs (Fig. 2d). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>A key factor influencing flavivirus particle infectivity is the maturation state of the exocytosed particles (Pierson &amp; Diamond, 2012; Stadler et al., 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>For WNV, maturation efficiency is mediated by cellular furin-like serine proteases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the degree of furin activity within a cell may impact WNV-MAD78 infectious particle production more than WNV-NY infectious particle production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Thus, we predicted that furin activity in cell types exhibiting similar levels of WNV-NY and WNV-MAD78 infectious particle production would be higher than in cells where WNV-MAD78 infectious particle production was impaired. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Characterization of chimeras of WNV-MAD78 and WNV-NY indicated that the infectivity of astrocyte-derived WNV particles corresponds to the cognate structural proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Examination of the cellular factors involved in the astrocyte-specific restriction to WNV-MAD78 replication indicated that high levels of furin-like protease inhibited WNV-MAD78, but not WNV-NY, infectious particle production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the classical innate antiviral pathways did not contribute to the reduced level of WNV-MAD78 replication. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type within the CNS and play a key role in regulating CNS homeostasis (Abbott, 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Infected astrocytes have been detected in fatal human cases of WNV encephalitis, suggesting that these cells are also targeted by WNV in vivo (van Marle et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Various secreted factors, such as the chemokine ligand CCL5, IFN, nitrous oxide, reactive nitrogen species and exosomes, play a role in restricting infection of astrocytes by several neurotropic viruses including herpes virus, human immunodeficiency virus and Junin virus (Gómez et al., 2003; Hu et al., 2012; Li et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Although WNV-infected astrocytes express IFN-β, CCL5 and additional chemokines (Hussmann &amp; Fredericksen, 2014; Hussmann et al., 2013; Kumar et al., 2010), our analyses indicated that secreted factors are not involved in inhibiting WNV-MAD78 infectious particle production (Fig. 1) (Hussmann et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>However, IFN-β is responsible for limiting WNV-NY replication in astrocytes (Hussmann et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Thus, although WNV infection triggers many of the same antiviral programmes as other neurotropic viruses, the effect of these responses in controlling infection is both virus and strain specific. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses utilize various cellular components throughout their life cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>As a result, differential interactions with basic cellular functions may account for strain-to-strain variations in infectivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>One cellular factor that modulates WNV infectivity is furin-like protease activity, which mediates maturation of the virus particle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>In cell types representative of a peripheral infection, increased levels of furin-like protease activity enhance WNV particle maturation and infectivity (Davis et al., 2006b; Mukherjee et al., 2011; Pierson &amp; Diamond, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>However, we found that furin activity inversely correlated with the susceptibility of cell types comprising the neurovascular unit to WNV infection, as more permissive HBMECs (Hussmann et al., 2013) contained lower levels of furin activity than the more restrictive astrocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Moreover, inhibition of furin enhanced infectious particle production of WNV-MAD78 in astrocytes, demonstrating that furin is one of the factors responsible for the increased resistance of this cell type to WNV-MAD78. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>For many viruses, maturation of viral structural proteins is mediated by furin-like proteases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>As such, inhibitors of furin have been proposed as a novel class of broad-spectrum antiviral compounds (Becker et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>However, our findings suggest that in the case of WNV, furin’s role in mediating particle infectivity may be more complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of furin inhibitors as antiviral compounds against WNV is therefore likely to be cell type dependent and may in fact augment WNV infections in the CNS. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>One result of furin processing of WNV particles is a decrease in the level of N-linked glycans on the virion surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>As glycosylated proteins on viral particles can facilitate binding to the host cell through attachment factors such as DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR (Davis et al., 2006b; Martina et al., 2008), a decrease in glycosylated proteins may reduce infectivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>We found that the presence or absence of an N-linked glycosylation site in the E protein of WNV-MAD78 or WNV-NY had no effect on the growth of either strain in astrocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the inhibitory effect of furin is independent of glycosylation status. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this finding suggests that attachment of WNV to astrocytes is largely carbohydrate independent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Indeed, although astrocytes express DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR (Deiva et al., 2006 and data not shown), blocking antibodies to these receptors had no effect on infectious particle production (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Several studies have shown that the glycosylation state of the viral particle contributes to the pathogenicity of WNV (Beasley et al., 2004, 2005; Hanna et al., 2005; Hobson-Peters et al., 2008; Scherret et al., 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>However, the basis for this difference in pathogenicity remains unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>As both WNV-MAD78 and WNV-NY replicate in other cells of the CNS (i.e. neurons and endothelial cells) at equivalent rates (Hussmann et al., 2013) and glycosylation did not affect WNV replication within astrocytes (Fig. 5), the glycosylation site on E may not play a role in regulating infection of the primary cell types within the CNS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Instead, within the CNS, the pathogenic effect of the glycosylation state may be due to alteration of infection and/or stimulation of immune cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Analysis of chimeric viruses of WNV-NY and WNV-MAD78 indicated that infectious particle production and particle infectivity corresponded primarily to the structural, not non-structural, components of the viruses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>However, the slightly higher levels of WNV-MAD78/NY compared with WT WNV-MAD78 at 48 h post-infection suggest that the non-structural proteins may influence infectious particle production later during infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>In addition, viral fitness was not dependent on a single structural component, as further analyses indicated that WNV-NY chimeras containing either C and prM or the E protein of WNV-MAD78 exhibited decreased infectious particle production and infectivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Whilst the precise defect in astrocyte-derived WNV-MAD78 particles is not known, the involvement of the viral structural proteins suggests that these virions are inefficient at one or more steps in the entry process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>The structural proteins define the composition of the virion, and therefore are major determinants for permissiveness and proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, as the main proteins exposed to the host, the structure proteins induce strong antibody and cellular-mediated immune responses (Diamond et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Therefore, determination of the specific moieties or regions of the structural proteins that determine virulence and are necessary for efficient replication in the CNS could lead to development of improved subunit vaccines. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>The variation in viral fitness of particles produced by astrocytes, the most abundant cell type within the CNS, may have several consequences for WNV-mediated neuropathology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>For WNV-NY, the higher infectivity of particles produced by astrocytes may permit the rapid spread to more permissive cells within the CNS, such as neurons and endothelial cells, as well as infiltrating immune cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the less infectious nature of astrocyte-derived WNV-MAD78 may limit this strain’s ability to infect neighbouring non-astrocyte cell types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the production of high levels of non-infectious particles by WNV-MAD78 may provide optimal material for stimulation of the innate antiviral response within surrounding cells and the rapid activation of antigen-presenting cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>These combined effects may facilitate the rapid clearance of non-pathogenic strains, such as WNV-MAD78, from the CNS prior to widespread destruction of neurons. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Overall, our data suggest that both viral and cellular factors contribute to WNV-MAD78’s decreased infectivity and replication in astrocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the differential effect of furin-like proteases on viral structural proteins may be responsible for this strain- and cell-type-specific restriction to WNV replication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Thus, the quality of viral particles produced in astrocytes, and not just the quantity, may be a determining factor in WNV replication within the CNS. </plain></SENT>
