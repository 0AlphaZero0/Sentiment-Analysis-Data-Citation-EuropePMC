Epithelial responses may include changes in chemokine expression, increased mucin production and antimicrobial peptide secretion, and changes in ion transport. We previously demonstrated that interleukin-17A (IL-17A), which is critical for lung host defense against extracellular bacteria, significantly raised airway surface pH in vitro, a finding that is common to a number of inflammatory diseases. Using microarray analysis of normal human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells treated with IL-17A, we identified the electroneutral chloride-bicarbonate exchanger Pendrin (SLC26A4) as a potential mediator of this effect. These data were verified by real-time, quantitative PCR that demonstrated a time-dependent increase in Pendrin mRNA expression in HBE cells treated with IL-17A up to 48 h. Using immunoblotting and immunofluorescence, we confirmed that Pendrin protein expression is increased in IL-17 treated HBE cells and that it is primarily localized to the mucosal surface of the cells. Functional studies using live-cell fluorescence to measure intracellular pH demonstrated that IL-17A induced chloride-bicarbonate exchange in HBE cells that was not present in the absence of IL-17A. Furthermore, HBE cells treated with short interfering RNA against Pendrin showed substantially reduced chloride-bicarbonate exchange. These data suggest that Pendrin is part of IL-17A-dependent epithelial changes and that Pendrin may therefore be a therapeutic target in IL-17A-dependent lung disease.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by National Institutes of Health K08 HL081080 and by funds from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

For example, in patients with Hyper-IgE syndrome, who lack ThIL-17 cells, <italic>Sa</italic> skin and lung infections are common <xref rid="pone.0103263-Minegishi1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In mice, loss of ThIL-17-mediated immunity after influenza infection predisposes to <italic>Sa</italic> pneumonia <xref rid="pone.0103263-Kudva1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Notably, ThIL-17 cells, the main producers of IL-17A, are found in airways submucosa early in the course of cystic fibrosis (CF) <xref rid="pone.0103263-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and IL-17A levels are increased in sputum during pulmonary exacerbations of CF and return to normal only after treatment <xref rid="pone.0103263-Aujla1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103263-McAllister1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In addition to a role in host defense, IL-17A and its related family members have a role in the pathophysiology of asthma. In particular, IL-17A is thought to contribute to the neutrophilic airways inflammation seen in severe asthmatics <xref rid="pone.0103263-Aujla2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Therefore, IL-17A-mediated immune functions are potential targets for therapeutic manipulation in a number of respiratory diseases.</p><p>Because of the importance of IL-17A in lung host defense, several studies have investigated its effects on airway epithelial cells. The IL-17 receptor is highly expressed on human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells <xref rid="pone.0103263-McAllister1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103263-Kuestner1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, in which IL-17A induces transcription of airway mucins <xref rid="pone.0103263-Fujisawa1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, antimicrobial peptides <xref rid="pone.0103263-Kao1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that favor production and influx of neutrophils into the lung <xref rid="pone.0103263-Hwang1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103263-Kao2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Epithelial ion transport is closely linked to mucin biology <xref rid="pone.0103263-Danahay1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103263-Garcia1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, antimicrobial peptide function <xref rid="pone.0103263-Dorschner1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and inflammation <xref rid="pone.0103263-Danahay2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103263-Gray1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Therefore, we hypothesized that IL-17A may alter epithelial ion transport properties. We previously found that IL-17A induced CFTR-dependent HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>&#8722;</sup> secretion in HBE cells <xref rid="pone.0103263-Kreindler1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. We also made the observation that IL-17A increased apical surface pH (pH<sub>ASL</sub>) in the absence of exogenous stimuli and without affecting baseline short-circuit current, suggesting that it promoted an electroneutral mechanism that changed surface pH <xref rid="pone.0103263-Kreindler1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>The simplest explanation for the observed increase in pH<sub>ASL</sub> in IL-17A-stimulated HBE cells would be either decreased H<sup>+</sup> secretion or increased HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>&#8722;</sup> secretion across the apical membrane of the cells. Microarray analysis had shown that IL-17A strongly upregulated Pendrin expression in HBE cells (data from this array were previously published <xref rid="pone.0103263-Aujla1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>). Pendrin (SLC26A4) is an electroneutral, HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>&#8722;</sup>-secreting protein, and, thus, a good candidate to mediate the observed effect on pH<sub>ASL</sub>. Pendrin is a member of the SLC26A family of Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup>-dependent anion transporters that are found at the apical plasma membrane of many epithelia. The SLC26A family of integral membrane proteins share common signal transduction and anti-sigma factor (STAS) domains that can interact with and regulate CFTR <xref rid="pone.0103263-Ko1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. SLC26A6 (PAT1) mediates CFTR-regulated HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>&#8722;</sup> secretion in the pancreas <xref rid="pone.0103263-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. SLC26A9 is expressed in human airways, but appears to primarily act as a Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup> channel rather than a Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>&#8722;</sup> exchanger <xref rid="pone.0103263-Bertrand1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. While SLC26A3, which we do identify in HBE cells at the mRNA level, is reported to mediate CFTR-dependent Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>&#8722;</sup> exchange in immortalized tracheal cells <xref rid="pone.0103263-Wheat1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, others did not detect SLC26A3 mRNA outside of the gastrointestinal tract in ribonuclease protection assays <xref rid="pone.0103263-Silberg1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Furthermore, our data suggest that IL-17A reduces SLC26A3 expression, which would be expected to cause a decrease in net HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>&#8722;</sup> transport. Therefore, SLC26A3 is not a good candidate to mediate the effects that we observed.</p><p>Pendrin is an electroneutral, Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup>/anion exchanger that can transport HCO<sub>3</sub>

Within the Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub>

Pendrin is expressed in many epithelia, including those from lung, thyroid, inner ear, and kidney. Genetic mutations in Pendrin cause Pendred syndrome (OMIM #274600), a disease characterized by congenital deafness, goiter, and thyroid hormone abnormalities <xref rid="pone.0103263-Scott1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The role of Pendrin in human lung physiology or pathophysiology is not yet known.

To test if this mechanism was necessary for IL-17A-mediated Pendrin expression we performed an experiment in which na&#239;ve HBE cells were treated with conditioned medium from cells treated with IL-17A for 48 h. Conditioned media were treated either with an IL-17A neutralizing antibody (317-ILB, R&amp;D Systems) or with an isotype control antibody. Na&#239;ve cells fed with conditioned medium treated with control (non-neutralizing) antibody demonstrated significant increases in Pendrin expression after 24 h. Conversely, cells treated with IL-17A neutralized conditioned medium did not show significant increases in Pendrin expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103263-g001">Figure 1c</xref>). Multiplex cytokine analysis of conditioned media confirmed that IL-17A induced G-CSF production <xref rid="pone.0103263-McAllister1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, but failed to show increased IL-6 production in IL-17A-treated HBE cells (data not shown). Together, these data support the conclusion that IL-17A alone is sufficient for increased Pendrin expression under our experimental conditions. Although IL-17A is sufficient to promote Pendrin expression in HBE cells, other cytokines including interferon-&#947; and IL-13 also appear to increase Pendrin RNA expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103263.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p><p>Pendrin is a member of the SLC26A family of anion exchangers <xref rid="pone.0103263-Mount1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Therefore, we wanted to investigate whether IL-17A increased the expression of other SLC26A Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>&#8722;</sup> exchangers that are expressed in HBE cells. In cells treated with IL-17A for 48 h there was a significant decrease in SLC26A3 (DRA) expression and no significant change in SLC26A6 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103263-g001">Figure 1d</xref>), suggesting that the effect of IL-17A on Pendrin expression is not a non-specific effect seen across SLC26A family members. Additionally, because some members of the SLC26 family interact with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), we measured changes in CFTR mRNA after 48 h of IL-17A stimulation (50 ng/ml). CFTR expression increased by an average of 1.8-fold (range 0.97&#8211;2.5) in IL-17A-treated cells relative to vehicle controls (n&#8202;=&#8202;7 inserts, representing 2 donors; data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>IL-17A induces Pendrin protein expression at the apical membrane of normal HBE cells</title><p>To demonstrate that the observed increases in Pendrin mRNA correlated with increased protein expression, we performed immunoblotting using a commercially available anti-Pendrin antibody.

This is best appreciated in the main XY image where Pendrin staining is present in the same 0.5 micron section as discreet cilia that are stained with Type IV Tubulin.

To accomplish this goal, we loaded HBE cells with the pH-sensitive dye SNARF-5/6 and mounted them in a specially-designed perfusion apparatus that allowed for differential perfusion of the mucosal and serosal surfaces of the cells. This apparatus was placed on the stage of an inverted fluorescence microscope for live-cell imaging. To probe the HCO<sub>3</sub>

As part of those studies, we measured resting airway surface pH (pH<sub>ASL</sub>) and observed that IL-17A increased pH<sub>ASL</sub> in an electroneutral, CFTR-independent fashion. The current studies were undertaken to explore the mechanism by which IL-17A might have this effect. We hypothesized that a rise in pH<sub>ASL</sub> would reflect a change in net ion transport rather than changes in other buffering systems. This hypothesis was consistent with microarray data comparing vehicle-treated HBE cells with cells that were stimulated with IL-17A, IL-22, or a combination of the two that suggested IL-17A-stimulated HBE cells expressed more Pendrin, a HCO<sub>3</sub>

These findings are in agreement with others who have found that Th2 cytokines induce Pendrin expression, but not other SLC26A family members <xref rid="pone.0103263-Pedemonte1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Associated with the increase in Pendrin mRNA that we observed, IL-17A stimulated HBE cells demonstrate a time-dependent increase in Pendrin protein expression. Moreover, Pendrin protein expression can be localized by immunofluorescence to the apical domain of the cells. Although the Pendrin antibody used was not monospecific and, therefore, immunofluorescence results may represent nonspecific binding, we do not favor this interpretation because the dominant band detected in immunoblots was of the anticipated molecular weight and because multiple Pendrin antibodies produced similar results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103263.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that IL-17A increased Pendrin expression at the apical membrane in normal HBE cells, and we undertook experiments to test the hypothesis that IL-17A would also increase Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>&#8722;</sup> exchange in these cells.</p><p>The experimental system we chose to investigate apical Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>&#8722;</sup> exchange was one in which Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup> is rapidly replaced in the mucosal solution by gluconate, an impermeant anion. Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup> removal from the mucosal bath creates a large concentration gradient for Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup> from serosal (120 mM Cl) to mucosal (0 mM Cl) across the epithelium. Therefore, in the presence of an apical membrane Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>&#8722;</sup> exchanger one will see a rise in pHi as HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>&#8722;</sup> enters the cell in exchange for Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup>. In the absence of a Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>&#8722;</sup> exchanger, one would expect to see little or no change in pHi with mucosal Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup> removal because there is no HCO<sub>3</sub>

<sup>&#8722;</sup> exchange mechanism at the apical membrane of normal HBE cells that is not present in untreated cells as IL-17A-treated cells but not controls respond to removal of mucosal Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup> with a rise in pHi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103263-g003">Figure 3b</xref>). As predicted, this change is reversible with replacement of mucosal Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup>.</p><p>To test the hypothesis that this pathway required HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>&#8722;</sup>, we performed the same experiment in the absence of CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>&#8722;</sup> with solutions buffered to pH 7.4 using HEPES. In these experiments, there was no rise in pHi with Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup> removal, suggesting that HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>&#8722;</sup> entry was responsible for the observed rise in pHi. Nonetheless, we observed a small decrease in pHi with Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup> replacement. One possible explanation for this change in pHi is that the IL-17A-induced Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>&#8722;</sup> exchange pathway can also exchange Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup> for OH<sup>&#8722;</sup>, as has been shown for Pendrin <xref rid="pone.0103263-Soleimani1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. We note that baseline pH in the CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>&#8722;</sup>-free conditions was higher than that in cells in the presence of CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>&#8722;</sup>, presumably because lack of CO<sub>2</sub> entry into the cells resulted in less H<sup>+</sup> generation from carbonic anhydrase. It is also possible, therefore, that we did not see a rise in pHi with Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup> removal from the mucosal solution because the resistance to HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>&#8722;</sup> entry in the presence of elevated pHi was greater than the driving force for Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup> exit from the cell. A second possibility is that the assay itself failed to detect a rise in pHi because the starting pHi was close to the top of the linear range of detection according to our calibration. However, we note that SNARF dyes demonstrate fluorescence changes at up to pH 9 according to the support material (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tools.lifetechnologies.com/content/sfs/manuals/mp01270.pdf">http://tools.lifetechnologies.com/content/sfs/manuals/mp01270.pdf</ext-link>).In either case above, our data would underestimate Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub>

It remains to be seen whether Th17 and Th2 cytokines have a synergistic effect on Pendrin expression. Our RNA sequencing data suggest little difference in the ability of IL-13 and IL-17 to promote Pendrin RNA expression in HBE cells. While such studies may provide further insight into the role of Pendrin under different inflammatory conditions, drawing conclusions with respect to relative potency may be quite difficult to control because of the multiple variables such as expression and density of receptors signaling machinery that would need to be accounted for, even while the system itself may be changing (see below).</p><p>Heterologous expression of Pendrin in fisher rat thyroid (FRT) cells confers cAMP-independent SCN<sup>&#8722;</sup> transport <xref rid="pone.0103263-Pedemonte1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.

Moreover, there appear to be fewer ciliated cells in IL-17A treated monolayers, though we did not undertake statistical analysis to determine if this is definitively the case. Such an effect has been demonstrated previously for IL-13 <xref rid="pone.0103263-Atherton1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.

And while differentiated epithelial cells are a good representation of the native epithelium, one must use caution when extending in vitro findings to whole tissue, organ, and animal physiology.</p><p>An example for why such caution is warranted is the apparent lack of lung disease in Pendred syndrome patients. This may reflect either relatively low levels of Pendrin in the lung in the absence of inflammation, or the ability of other HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>&#8722;</sup> transporters, such as CFTR or other SLC26A family members, to compensate for lack of Pendrin in the airways. This may also reflect that absence of Pendrin is protective against some forms of pulmonary disease, a suggestion for which there is evidence in the literature. For example, Pendrin null mice demonstrate attenuated inflammatory responses and reduced airways reactivity in an allergen-induced model of asthma <xref rid="pone.0103263-Nakagami1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. This response was attributable to increased ASL depth in response to IL-13 stimulation of Pendrin-deficient airway epithelial cells. The precise mechanism of Pendrin regulation of ASL remains unknown and may be directly related to Pendrin, indirectly related to Pendrin through other ion transporters, or to some other effect of Pendrin deficiency not yet identified <xref rid="pone.0103263-Nakagami1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Further investigation in physiologically relevant Pendrin null model systems is warranted to determine what role, if any, Pendrin has in airways physiology or pathophysiology and the mechanisms by which it affects cell biology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0103263.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
