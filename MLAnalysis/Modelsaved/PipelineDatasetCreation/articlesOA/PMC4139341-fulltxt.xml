The discovery of drug molecules capable of targeting multiple factors involved in AD pathogenesis would greatly facilitate in improving therapeutic strategies. The repositioning of existing non-toxic drugs could dramatically reduce the time and costs involved in developmental and clinical trial stages. In this study, preliminary screening of 140 FDA approved nervous system drugs by docking suggested the viability of the tricyclic group of antidepressants against three major AD targets, viz. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), &#946;-secretase (BACE-1), and amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) aggregation, with one member, protriptyline, showing highest inhibitory activity. Detailed biophysical assays, together with isothermal calorimetry, fluorescence quenching experiments, kinetic studies and atomic force microscopy established the strong inhibitory activity of protriptyline against all three major targets. The molecular basis of inhibition was supported with comprehensive molecular dynamics simulations. Further, the drug inhibited glycation induced amyloid aggregation, another important causal factor in AD progression. This study has led to the discovery of protriptyline as a potent multi target directed ligand and established its viability as a promising candidate for AD treatment.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by CSIR Network project, BSC0115.

According to World Alzheimer Report 2013, this number is expected to increase by two fold in 2030. AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to the irreversible loss of neurons, intellectual abilities and eventually to death within a decade of diagnosis. Although the molecular bases of AD pathogenesis remains incompletely elucidated, the disease has been recognized as a multifactorial syndrome involving various molecular and cellular processes such as protein aggregation, oxidative stress, cell cycle deregulation and neuroinflammation <xref rid="pone.0105196-Roberson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>There are currently several plausible hypotheses for AD pathogenesis. Cholinergic hypothesis states that the reduced cholinergic neurotransmission leads to the degeneration of cholinergic neurons and hence synaptic failure and cognitive dysfunction <xref rid="pone.0105196-Bartus1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Following this, Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was validated as a therapeutic target to reduce the degradation of acetylcholine in the synapse. AChE inhibitors (AChEIs) are effective in temporarily restoring cholinergic function, and constitute the majority of AD drugs currently available in the market <xref rid="pone.0105196-Alzheimers1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. However, they are incapable of delaying or preventing neurodegeneration <xref rid="pone.0105196-Small1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105196-Terry1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>A variety of biochemical, genetic and pathological studies describe pivotal roles of the Amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) peptide in the pathogenesis of AD. &#8220;Amyloid hypothesis,&#8221; describes the altered synthesis, aggregation and accumulation of A&#946; which results in amyloid plaque formation <xref rid="pone.0105196-Hardy1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. While extracellular deposits of amyloid plaques are highly neurotoxic, recent studies have also implicated soluble, oligomeric aggregates of A&#946; in neurotoxicity <xref rid="pone.0105196-Haass1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Therefore, a key therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD involves the development of drugs targeted at inhibiting A&#946; production, aggregation, destabilization and clearance of preformed fibrils <xref rid="pone.0105196-Golde1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. A crucial step in A&#946; production is the specific N-terminal enzymatic cleavage of the membrane embedded Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) by the transmembrane aspartyl protease, &#946;-secretase (BACE-1) <xref rid="pone.0105196-Selkoe1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0105196-Hills1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Therefore, inhibiting BACE-1 has been considered as another attractive approach to prevent A&#946; neurotoxicity. It is noteworthy that no inhibitors of A&#946; aggregation or BACE-1 activity have reached the market yet, despite strong evidence of the causative roles of A&#946; in AD.</p><p>We further point out that A&#946; is transported through a Receptor for Advanced Glycation End products (RAGE) and cause neuronal damage. Long-lived proteins are preferentially modified to form Advanced Glycation End products (AGE), and the stability of A&#946; makes it an ideal substrate for non-enzymatic glycation and formation of AGEs <xref rid="pone.0105196-Vitek1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In a recent study, it has been shown that A&#946;-AGE formation may intensify the neurotoxicity whereas inhibition of this process significantly rescued the early cognitive deficit in mice <xref rid="pone.0105196-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Therefore, glycated A&#946; has been considered as a more suitable ligand for RAGE, as it aggravates neuronal deterioration <xref rid="pone.0105196-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Hence inhibiting glycation of A&#946; may be a valuable therapeutic strategy for AD. However, there has been no concerted effort to explore the inhibition of A&#946; glycation as a therapeutic strategy.</p><p>Efforts to target AChE inhibition <xref rid="pone.0105196-Anand1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>; A&#946; production <xref rid="pone.0105196-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>; A&#946; aggregation <xref rid="pone.0105196-Schenk1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>; tau phosphorylation and aggregation <xref rid="pone.0105196-Gtz1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> have been investigated largely in isolation, despite the complex nature of AD etiology. Recently, drug discovery in AD has gradually inclined towards development of &#8220;multi-target-directed ligands&#8221; (MTDLs) <xref rid="pone.0105196-Youdim1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0105196-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> which are efficient in treating complex diseases because of their ability to target multiple modes of disease pathogenesis. Further, to evaluate MTDLs for the AD treatment, &#8220;drug repositioning&#8221; seems to be an appealing strategy, as this approach has several advantages, including reduced time and cost necessary for clinical trials<sup>23</sup>. Priority candidate drugs for hypertension, retinoid therapy, diabetes and antibiotics with sufficient supporting evidences have been considered for repositioning in AD <xref rid="pone.0105196-Corbett1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. However, to the best of our knowledge, repositioning drugs for multiple targets in AD is scarce. In this study, an <italic>in silico</italic> screening of 140 FDA approved drugs for neurological treatment was done against the primary targets of AD therapeutics, namely, acetylcholinesterase, BACE-1, and A&#946; aggregation. Further i<italic>n vitro</italic> studies showed that amongst selected molecules, the tricyclic antidepressant protriptyline exhibited significant inhibition of AChE, as well as inhibition of other targets of AD. In addition, protriptyline was also found to inhibit glycation mediated A&#946; aggregation. Mechanistic insights into protriptyline binding and inhibition of AChE, A&#946;, and BACE-1 activity were described in detail with molecular dynamics simulation studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Tricyclic Antidepressant Drugs Display Strong Binding against Various Targets of AD <italic>In silico</italic>

</xref>). The apparent K<sub>m</sub> for AChE was determined to be &#8764;0.025 mM by Lineweaver-Burk plot and it was found to be increased in the presence of protriptyline. The inhibition constant K<sub>i</sub> was determined from Cheng-Prusoff's equation and found to be &#8764;0.001 mM. Thermodynamic studies of protriptyline-AChE interaction was carried out using Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) as it is one of the most widely used quantitative technique for direct measurement of the enthalpy change when two species interact, allowing the determination of heat of association, stoichiometry, and binding affinity from a single experiment <xref rid="pone.0105196-Campoy1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105196-Shoemaker1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The raw data and corresponding thermogram of the binding experiment is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105196-g002">
<bold>Figure 2C</bold>
</xref>. Binding was strongly exothermic and showed 1&#8758;1 stoichiometry for AChE and protriptyline. The spontaneity of the process is evidenced by a negative change in the enthalpy, &#916;H, and a positive change in the entropy, &#916;S. Kinetic and ITC data demonstrated the binding of single molecule of protriptyline to the active site of AChE. The active site of AChE comprises two subsites; the anionic subsite (Trp82, Glu198, Tyr333) and the esteratic subsite (Ser199, Glu330 and His443) <xref rid="pone.0105196-Tai1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Strong binding propensity of protriptyline to both the subsites of AChE was evidenced via the MD studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105196-g002">

Breakup of the interactions into the non-bonded components showed that electrostatics plays a relatively stronger role than van der Waals interactions in protriptyline binding with active site.

</p><p>Protriptylline-AChE interaction was also studied by fluorescence spectrometry. A significant shift in the tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra was observed upon protriptyline binding suggested that the drug induces conformational change in AChE, thereby in its functional abilities. The fluorescence intensity of AChE exhibited an emission maximum at a wavelength, &#955;<sub>max</sub>, of 325 nm in the unbound state. However, titration of the native enzyme with increasing concentrations of inhibitor resulted in a concentration-dependent quenching of the tryptophanyl fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105196-g002">
<bold>Figure 2G</bold>
</xref>). A progressive red shift in the emission spectrum with increasing concentration of protriptyline suggested the conformation change in enzyme. Further, the conformational change was confirmed by CD analysis. CD analysis showed that the binding of protriptyline to AChE decreased the minima suggesting protriptyline induces conformational change in AChE. CDPro analysis revealed that binding of protriptyline increased &#946;-sheets and decreased &#945;-helices in AChE. These results are very well in accordance with the fluorescence quenching experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105196-g002">

<bold>Figure 2J</bold>
</xref>, we compare the backbone root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of the active site residues in the free and protriptyline bound state for a sample MD simulation trajectory. The higher RMSD in the latter is a distinct demonstration of the perturbative effect of the ligand on the active site structure. This structural distortion is supported by changes in the inter-residue distances of the active site residues (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0105196.s007">Table S2</xref></bold>). Distinct increases in several of the inter-residue distances are noted, especially in the distances involving Tyr333 and His443. The sharpest increase in the mean inter-residue distance is found for two residues belong to the esteratic subsite, namely Ser199 and His443 that play critical roles in the hydrolysis of acetylcholine. The increase from 7.8 &#197; in the free state to 11.5 &#197; in the bound state strongly suggests that protriptyline binding directly affects the catalytic ability of AChE. Further, we found protriptyline binding at the active site to be commensurate with an increase in its solvent accessibility. The solvent accessible surface area, or SASA, was calculated by running a spherical probe of 1.8 &#197; radius around the surface and calculating the area covered by the probe / calculated in the standard manner.
