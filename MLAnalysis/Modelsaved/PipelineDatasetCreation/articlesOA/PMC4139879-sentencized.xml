<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Preterm birth is defined as spontaneous labor occurring before 37 completed weeks of gestation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It is the leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity in newborns without congenital anomalies or chromosomal abnormalities [1,2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>According to 2012 statistics, the rate of preterm birth ranges between 5% and 18% of babies born across the world [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Preterm birth also has major socioeconomic implications with associated hospital stays [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Tocolytic drugs with a variety of mechanisms are being used to relax the uterus and suppress the uterine contractions to prevent preterm birth. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Ritodrine is a β2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) agonist, resulting in uterine smooth muscle relaxation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Although it has been widely used in several European and Asian countries, the efficacy of ritodrine was not consistent [4,5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Numerous factors are believed to contribute to the speed and outcome of delivery, but several studies implicated the importance of association between genetic predisposition and preterm birth [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Human ADRB2 gene is encoded on chromosome 5, and its genetic variability has been widely characterized with several single nucleotide sequence variations [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Especially, missense mutations encoding for amino acids 16 and 27 of the extracellular N-terminus of the β2-adrenergic receptor have been studied in many areas including β-blocker therapy in cardiovascular disorders and β2-agonist treatment in respiratory disorders [8,9,10,11,12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>However, not many studies have been conducted in the preterm labor treatment with β2-agonists, such as ritodrine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Since it is important to detect a correlation between drug phenotypes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) studied, in order to utilize this correlation to benefit patients, the purpose of this study was therefore to evaluate the association between efficacy of ritodrine and ADRB2 gene polymorphisms in patients with preterm labor. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Discussion </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Genetic contributions to preterm birth have been studied, recently focusing on genomic and proteomic approaches to diagnose and determine the mechanism of preterm labor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>The genes or proteins investigated are involved in inflammatory reactivity or uterine contractility [13,14]. ADRB2, which is expressed in smooth muscle cells of the myometrium, inhibits uterine contraction when it is activated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>The association between ADRB2 polymorphisms and preterm labor has been focused on codons 16 and 27. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>The results were not consistent depending on the outcomes measured and study populations and did not favor a major impact of ADRB2 polymorphisms at positions 16 and 27 to the risk of preterm labor [15,16,17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Studies of genetic polymorphisms suggest that it may account for 15%–30% of the variation in drug response [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>This study tried to approach from an aspect of different responses of tocolytic drugs due to genetic variances. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Ritodrine binds to β2 adrenergic receptors on outer membrane of myometrial cell, activating adenylyl cyclase to increase the level of cAMP, which decreases intracellular calcium and leads to uterine contraction reduction [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Genetic variation in the structure of ADRB2 is a potentially significant source of variability in the response to β2-agonist drugs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Most commonly studied SNPs of ADRB2 gene are Arg16Gly (c.46 G&gt;A) and Gln27Glu (c.79 C&gt;G), non-synonymous variants, resulting in amino acid substitutions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of the Gly16 and Glu27 allele were 49.6% and 9.7% in this study, which were consistent with the previous study [20]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>In terms of the effects of β2-agonist on preterm labor, the clinical outcomes after hexoprenaline administration to white women diagnosed with preterm labor were studied ADRB2 gene polymorphisms of Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu, which are two among five SNPs that we studied [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>The results showed that pregnant women with Arg16 had a strong trend toward greater pregnancy prolongation, compared to the other genotype groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>The result was consistent with our results; patients with Arg16 alleles showed relatively prolonged time to delivery compared to those with the other genotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Although, both studies narrowly missed to achieve statistical significance (p = 0.058 and 0.089, respectively). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>In this study, patients with Arg16 alleles showed relatively prolonged time to delivery compared to those with the other genotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Although Arg16 alleles did not show significant prolongation of time to delivery, significantly greater proportions of patients who remained undelivered at 10 days were found in the Arg16 allele carriers compared to those with Gly16 allele homozygotes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>This result was attributable to not only the protecting effect of the Arg16 allele but also the receptor downregulating effect of Gly16 allele. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>An in vitro study showed that the Gly16 allele resulted in enhanced agonist-promoted down-regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>The in vitro study also reported that the Glu27 allele was resistant to receptor down-regulation [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>However, significant association between the Gln27Glu polymorphism and time to delivery in preterm labor patients with ritodrine therapy was not found in this study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Gln27Glu is in high linkage disequilibrium with Arg16Gly [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Therefore, Gln27Glu could be considered as a cofactor of Arg16Gly effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>To obtain complementary information regarding the effectiveness of ritodrine therapy, the haplotype analysis of the two genotypes was carried out. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Although patients with both Gly16 and Gln27 homozygotes (median time: 215.7 h) showed shorter time to delivery than those with the other haplotypes (median time: 828.0 h), significant association was not found (p = 0.285). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Strong linkage disequilibrium between rs1042717 and rs1042718 was found in this study, consistent with earlier studies [24,25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Significantly longer time to delivery in GG allele carrier of rs1042719 was obtained after adjusting other covariates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Unlike rs1042713 and 1042714, rs1042717, 1042718, and 1042719 are synonymous polymorphisms, which were not expected to change the β2-adrenoreceptor activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>The effect of synonymous SNP in the ADRB2 gene on the ritodrine therapy in this study was possibly attributable to the linkage disequilibrium with other SNPs, which have functional activities [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>In addition, a recent study showed that synonymous coding SNPs can affect the translation rate of mRNA, resulting in the change of protein amount produced and the post-translational modification of the protein [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Another possibility is that it interferes with an exon-splicing enhancer to affect RNA processing [28]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Although SNP detection and genotyping studies have shown to explain and diagnose many diseases and to describe the variation in drug responses, most findings have not been replicated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>This is because clinical outcomes are affected by other factors as well as genetic predisposition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Especially, the long-term efficacy and therapeutic usefulness of β2-agonist drugs have been questioned in many studies, and the limitation of the therapeutic value of β2-agonist drugs was attributable to the desensitization of β-adrenergic receptors in the myometrium by agonist-stimulation [29,30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>In the animal study with preterm labor, ritodrine initially reduced labor contractions but the effects decreased within 16 h [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>The reduced effects were explained by a reduced cAMP response to β2-agonist drugs and by decreased number of β-adrenergic receptors [29,30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, studies showed that neither the Arg16Gly nor the Gln27Glu polymorphism affected the extent of agonist-induced desensitization, but the Glu27 homozygotes exhibited a slower desensitization compared to the other genotypes [32,33]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Another consideration for clinical application of genomic studies is that failure to achieve statistical significance does not necessarily mean clinical insignificance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>In this study, most SNPs shortened the time to delivery by more than 50% but statistical significance was not found. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>This was possibly due to the small sample size, resulting in underpowered study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Given the single-center and the relatively small sample size, our hypothesis requires further independent validation using multi-center and large sample size. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Given the burden of preterm labor, this pharmacogenomic study could have the potential to improve the management of this disorder by accounting for some of the inter-individual variability in pharmacologic response of ritodrine therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Since the study population is uni-ethnic, further study is required on other populations. </plain></SENT>
