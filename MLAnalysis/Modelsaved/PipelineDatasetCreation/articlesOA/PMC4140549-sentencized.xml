</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mitochondrial disorders include widely heterogeneous clinical syndromes, frequently presenting as encephalo- and/or cardiomyopathies, associated with a broad range of causative genes [Ghezzi and Zeviani, 2012]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Their biochemical signature is the presence of defective activity in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) complexes, resulting in faulty oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which can impair ATP production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Mutations in several genes associated with defects of mitochondrial protein synthesis, affecting either mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or nucleus-encoded genes, have been reported in a range of mitochondrial syndromes [Rotig, 2011]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Translation of the 13 mtDNA-encoded, OXPHOS-related proteins takes place within the mitochondrial matrix. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This complex process requires ribosomal and transfer RNAs (rRNAs and tRNAs), encoded by mtDNA, and more than 100 proteins, encoded by nuclear genes, translated by cytosolic ribosomes and imported into mitochondria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>These include aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), ribosomal proteins, ribosomal assembly factors, tRNA- and rRNA-modifying enzymes, initiation, elongation, and termination factors [Smits et al., 2010]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Mutations in any component of the mitochondrial translation machinery can in principle cause inherited mitochondrial disorders affecting the MRC complexes containing mtDNA-encoded subunits (cI, cIII, cIV, cV), with the preservation of complex II, the only complex which has no mtDNA-encoded proteins. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>An increasing number of mitochondrial translation disorders are caused by mutations in genes encoding mt-aaRSs [Konovalova and Tyynismaa, 2013], which catalyze the ligation of specific amino acids to their cognate tRNAs, a crucial process for faithful protein synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Mitochondrial and cytoplasmic aaRSs are encoded by distinct nuclear genes, with the exception of GARS and KARS, which are present in both cellular compartments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The term aaRS2 indicates the gene coding for the mitochondrial enzyme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Mutations in aaRS2 genes have been associated with diverse clinical presentations, usually characterized by early-onset and autosomal recessive transmission. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>A relatively tight genotype–phenotype correlation has been reported for most of these syndromes, although the basis of cell- or tissue-specific damage remains unclear, since all mt-aaRSs are ubiquitous enzymes operating in the same pathway [Rotig, 2011]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>We report here the identification by whole-exome sequencing (WES) of the first described mutations in VARS2 (MIM# 612802) and TARS2 (MIM# 612805) in patients with clinical presentations compatible with mitochondrial disorders and OXPHOS deficiency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>All identified variants were not present in SNPs databases, predicted to be deleterious, segregated within the families, and associated with decreased aminoacylation of the corresponding tRNAs in mutant immortalized fibroblasts; moreover, their pathogenic role was proven by using complementation assays on immortalized fibroblasts from patients and, for the VARS2 mutation, on a specific recombinant yeast model. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Mutations in genes coding for mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have been associated with diverse clinical presentations, usually inherited as early-onset autosomal recessive traits [Konovalova and Tyynismaa, 2013]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>We and others have reported a strict genotype–phenotype correlation for most of these conditions [Edvardson et al. 2007; Scheper et al., 2007; Sasarman et al. 2012; Steenweg et al., 2012]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Since these genetic defects involve ubiquitously expressed enzymes all engaged in the very same enzymatic step of mitochondrial translation, the mechanisms leading to such different cellular and tissue-specific phenotypes remain unexplained. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Different hypotheses have been proposed to elucidate the clinical variability associated with different aaRS2 mutations, but none seems to explain all aspects of this phenomenon that is probably the result of several mechanisms altered in aaRS2 mutant patients [Konovalova and Tyynismaa, 2013]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>However, and similar to our VARS2 and TARS2 mutations, most mutations in aaRS2 genes have been reported in single, or in just a few, cases, which hampers the establishment of definitive genotype to phenotype correlation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>For instance, AARS2 mutations were initially described as associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in two families, but were later found also in patients with leukoencephalopathy and no heart involvement [Dallabona et al., 2014]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, encephalopathy is the most common presentation in aaRS2 mutations, as in several other OXPHOS disorders, probably because of the high energy request by the central nervous system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>For instance, mutations in DARS2 (MIM# 610956) (mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase) have been identified as a recurrent cause of leukoencephalopathy with brainstem, spinal cord involvement, and lactate elevation, whereas EARS2 mutations (MIM# 612799) (mitochondrial glutamyl-tRNA synthetase) are associated with a leukoencephalopathy with thalamus and brainstem involvement and high lactate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Pontocerebellar hypoplasia 6, a severe infantile encephalopathy with cerebral atrophy and multiple OXPHOS deficiency, is associated with RARS2 (MIM# 611524) (mitochondrial arginyl-tRNA synthetase) mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Complex rearrangements in MARS2 (mitochondrial methionyl-tRNA synthetase) were described in a cohort of patients with autosomal recessive spastic ataxia with leukoencephalopathy, whereas mutations in FARS2 (MIM# 611592) (Phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase) were identified in three patients with fatal epileptic mitochondrial encephalopathy, consistent with Alpers’ syndrome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, specific MRI patterns seem to be associated with some aaRS2 (e.g., DARS2, EARS2, RARS2) mutant patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>In our cases, P1 MRI showed hyperintense lesions involving mainly the insulae and frontotemporal right cortex, whereas P2 MRI was reported to show thinning of corpus callosum (a neuroimaging finding common to several neurodegenerative disorders) and bilateral lesions of the globi pallidi. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>However, the MRI of P3, brother of P2, was normal, although this can be due to the very early age at which this exam was performed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Additional VARS2 and TARS2 cases will clarify whether these MRI patterns are specific or not. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Mutations in aaRS2, impairing the translation of the 13 mtDNA-encoded MRC subunits, should in principle be associated with a biochemical deficiency of all MRC complexes, except cII. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>This biochemical profile was indeed found in muscle samples from the two TARS2 mutant subjects (P2 and P3), whereas the VARS2 mutant muscle (P1) showed isolated cI deficiency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Complex I seems to be particularly prone to damage in mtDNA translation defects, as already reported for MARS2 in patients’ cells and in the corresponding mutant fly model [Bayat et al., 2012] or for mutations in other proteins involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis, such as mitochondrial methionyl-tRNA-formyltransferase [Haack et al., 2012]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>This propensity can partly be explained by the fact that seven of the 13 mtDNA-encoded proteins are subunits of cI, and by the complexity of its functional and structural interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>In patients’ fibroblasts, biochemical assays of individual MRC complexes showed inconsistent alterations, indicating partial preservation of functional proficiency of the mutant enzyme or reflecting the (partial) dispensability from OXPHOS of this cell type. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>The same biochemical discrepancy has also been reported for mutations in other mt-aaRSs [Gotz et al., 2011; Bayat et al., 2012; Sasarman et al., 2012]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>However, we observed a consistent biochemical phenotype in both naïve and immortalized mutant fibroblasts by measuring whole mitochondrial respiration, especially in culturing conditions that force cells to rely on OXPHOS to produce energy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>As already reported for EARS2 mutant fibroblasts, a diminished oxygen consumption rate is likely to depend on the cumulative impairment of the entire set of MRC complexes [Steenweg et al., 2012]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>We proved the pathogenic role of the mutations identified in VARS2 and TARS2 by showing decreased levels of aminoacylation of the cognate mitochondrial tRNAs and by complementing the biochemical defects in patients’ fibroblasts expressing the corresponding wt cDNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>This evidence was further corroborated for the VARS2 mutation by concordant results obtained in a recombinant yeast model. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we identified novel mutations in two genes encoding mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (VARS2 and TARS2), which have not been appreciated previously as causing mitochondrial disease, thus expanding the list of aaRS2-associated diseases. </plain></SENT>
