The component responsible for its rigidity is chitin, a product of chitin synthase (Chsp) enzymes. There are seven classes of chitin synthase genes (<italic>CHS</italic>) and the amount and type encoded in fungal genomes varies considerably from one species to another. Previous Chsp sequence analyses focused on their study as individual units, regardless of genomic context. The identification of blocks of conserved genes between genomes can provide important clues about the interactions and localization of chitin synthases. On the present study, we carried out an <italic>in silico</italic> search of all putative Chsp encoded in 54 full fungal genomes, encompassing 21 orders from five phyla. Phylogenetic studies of these Chsp were able to confidently classify 347 out of the 369 Chsp identified (94%). Patterns in the distribution of Chsp related to taxonomy were identified, the most prominent being related to the type of fungal growth. More importantly, a synteny analysis for genomic blocks centered on class IV Chsp (the most abundant and widely distributed Chsp class) identified a putative cell wall metabolism gene cluster in members of the genus Aspergillus, the first such association reported for any fungal genome.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by funds from Mexico National Science and Technology Council CONACYT grant CB-2008 107114 to JHR-P as well as a CONACYT Ph.D. scholarship to JRP-A.

It is typically composed of interconnected polysaccharides such as chitin, (1,3)-&#946;-glucan and (1,6)-&#946;-glucan, mannan, and proteins <xref rid="pone.0104920-Adams1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Chitin synthase enzymes (Chsp) manufacture large linear chains of &#946;-(1,4)-linked N-acetylglucosamine. Within most fungi chitin is the component that gives rigidity to the wall; mutations that eliminate the ability to synthesize chitin can be lethal to fungal cells <xref rid="pone.0104920-Shaw1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Chsp protein sequences can be very diverse and show varying combinations of domains, but several studies agree that all&#8212;from both yeast and filamentous fungi&#8212; contain three conserved motifs: QXXEY, EDRXL, and QXRRW <xref rid="pone.0104920-RuizHerrera1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0104920-Mandel1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. These conserved motifs in all Chsp are restricted to a short stretch of peptide called the Conserved Region 1 (CON1) <xref rid="pone.0104920-Nagahashi1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, which is the core of the Chitin synthase 2 domain CS2 (Chitin_synth_2; PF03142). The EDRXL motif is related to the catalytic base function; QXRRW (QXRRWXN in Nagahashi et al. <xref rid="pone.0104920-Nagahashi1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>) confers processivity to the enzyme; and QXXEY does not have a putative function assigned <xref rid="pone.0104920-Choquer1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>The various Chsp sequences have been classified phylogenetically into seven classes (I&#8211;VII) grouped in two divisions <xref rid="pone.0104920-Choquer1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0104920-Mandel1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Classes IV&#8211;VII contain the CS2 domain while Chsp from classes I&#8211;III have lost the first portion of CS2, replacing it with both a type 1 Chitin synthase domain CS1 (Chitin_synth_1; PF01644) as well as a Chitin synthase N-terminal domain CSN (Chitin_synth_N; PF08407), but preserving the CON1 region from CS2 <xref rid="pone.0104920-Mandel1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In addition to these domains, class I Chsp have conserved motifs present in the amino terminal portion; classes IV, V, and VII contain a binding domain similar to cytochrome b5 (cyt-b5; PF00173); and classes V and VII also contain a myosin motor domain (Myosin_head; PF00063) <xref rid="pone.0104920-Mandel1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The class VI Chsp domain structure is the simplest with only a CS2 domain and could be the ancestral state of Chsp <xref rid="pone.0104920-Mandel1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. For simplicity, hereafter the Chsp classes will be labeled as ChspI to ChspVII. The use of different methods of phylogenetic inference, among other factors, has caused multiple Chsp classifications, which becomes a problem when comparing results from independent studies. The two main classifications, from Choquer et al. <xref rid="pone.0104920-Choquer1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and Mandel et al. <xref rid="pone.0104920-Mandel1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, concur in grouping Chsp in two divisions in which ChspI-III belong to division 1, ChspIV, V, and VII belong to division 2, and ChspVI is on its own outside both divisions. However, their nomenclature for ChspVI and VII disagrees: Mandels's ChspVI is Choquer's ChspVII and vice versa. Mandel's ChspVI nomenclature is based on the description of <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> class VI AfChsD <xref rid="pone.0104920-Mellado1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, which precedes Choquer's and is the one used on this study. Another study, by Odenbach et al. <xref rid="pone.0104920-Odenbach1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, positions ChspVII (actually Mandel's ChspVI) inside division 1, as a sister clade of ChspI-III. In a more recent study Ruiz-Herrera and Ortiz-Castellanos <xref rid="pone.0104920-RuizHerrera2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> speculate that ChspIV is actually the common ancestor of all fungal CHS and that the other classes would have evolved by events of duplication and modification.</p><p>The availability of full fungal genome sequences allows us to look into the evolution of Chsp from a new perspective, not as individual gene units but as part of a genomic neighborhood or syntenic group. In bacterial genomes, the syntenic blocks are usually organized as operons <xref rid="pone.0104920-Jacob1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The syntenic blocks in eukaryotic genomes are much more complex; the evidence suggests that these may form different types of functional aggregations <xref rid="pone.0104920-Hurst1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and topological arrangements <xref rid="pone.0104920-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes, as the evolutionary distance between species increases, the syntenic blocks rearrange or break up. This can be seen, in a large scale, in the comparative study between chromosome 12 of <italic>Mycosphaerella graminicola</italic> and scaffold 7 of <italic>Stagonospora nodorum</italic>, both of the class Dothideomycetes <xref rid="pone.0104920-Hane1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. It was observed that the orientation of orthologous genes was arranged randomly, but in a genomic context there is not a random distribution. This would imply conservation in gene content between these genomic units during molecular evolution. Even in closely related species of the same genus when there is a strong pressure, as is the case in pathogenic systems, recent changes in synteny conservation can be observed. This was the case for the comparative genomics study of the whole genome of the highly pathogenic <italic>Candida albicans</italic> versus its closest relative, <italic>C. dublinensis</italic>, a significantly less virulent pathogen <xref rid="pone.0104920-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>The above evidence indicates that strong selection pressures act to maintain areas that retain genes in close order and that these may form several types of functional groups. We believe that the analysis, on a large scale, of the distribution of Chsp among diverse fungal species can provide important molecular evolution information. Due to its importance in cell-wall metabolism, some chitin synthases may be forming genetic clusters with functionally related genes as a manner of coordinated regulation. To test this hypothesis, we first systematically searched for all the putative Chsp present in 54 fungal genomes. The 369 Chsp identified were classified by five methods of phylogenetic inference. From this classification, an analysis of the qualitative and quantitative distribution of Chsp among the individual fungal species was derived as well as a general analysis of the distribution and organization of Chsp in all the species (a relationship is observed between the content of Chsp and the taxonomy and growth form of the fungus). This distribution analysis showed that ChspIV is the class with the largest presence in the fungal species, and as such it was selected to conduct synteny analysis searching for groups of genes functionally related to the biogenesis of the cell wall, revealing an association between at least six genes in members of the genus Aspergillus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Fungal genomes</title><p>For this study, a collection of the protein models for 54 fungal genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104920.s012">Table S1</xref>) was used.

The script identified 369 putative Chsp sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104920.s013">Table S2</xref>) from 54 fungal genomes representing 21 orders grouped in five phyla. An InterProScan search (against the PfamA database) identified a CS2 domain in 198 of these sequences while 152 sequences had a combination of the CS1 and CSN domains. The remaining 19 sequences contained the three domains CS1, CS2, and CSN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104920.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The identification of known CS domains in addition to the presence of the CON1S motifs suggest that most of these sequences are functional Chsp. Nagahashi et al. <xref rid="pone.0104920-Nagahashi1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> determined, by site-directed mutagenesis at the CON1 region, that even conserved changes of most of the amino acids in the three universal motifs resulted in complete or almost complete loss of its activity and that only a few conserved changes could maintain the function. To find plausible functional variants of the CON1S region, we used the 369 sequences as a training set for an HMM search. All 369 starting sequences were recovered, with e-values ranging from 1.7e-29 to 1.9e-76. With this approach, an additional 22 putative Chsp were found (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104920.s017">Table S6</xref>) with e-values ranging from 2.10e-26 to 1.90e-68, and chitin synthase domains for these sequences were detected by an InterProScan search (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104920.s002">Figure S2</xref>). However, 12 of these sequences completely lacked one of the three conserved domains: seven the QXXEY motif, one the EDRXL motif, and four the QXRRW motif. Another nine had non-conserved amino acid substitutions in one or more of the residues presumed to be critical for activity. Only one out of these additional 22 protein models, t_52578 of <italic>Fusarium solani</italic>, contains the complete three conserved motifs with plausible conserved amino acid substitutions in the EDRXL (DDRVI) motif.</p><p>The two observed changes are strongly conserved substitutions: E to D (both are acidic and polar charged; aspartic acid differs from glutamic acid only in that its side chain is shorter by one methylene group); and L to I (isoleucine being an isomer of leucine is also aliphatic, hydrophobic, and non-polar).

An InterProScan search detected a CS1 domain for this sequence.

All of the above suggests that it could be a functional Chsp with a variant CON1S region, making it an interesting candidate for future experimental confirmation. For the rest of this study only the 369 sequences retrieved by the RE were used to avoid adding complexity to the CON1S region. These results make a point that using only domain prediction to identify putative Chsp produces a high rate of false-positives if the presence of the three universal motifs is not also enforced: although the CON1S region is &#8220;the core&#8221; of the CS2 domain InterProScan reports a CS2 domain for 17 of the 21 sequences that have truncated versions of this region. Also, domain prediction alone can only determine at best the division to which the putative Chsp belongs since some classes share the same domain architecture (e.g., ChspI-III or ChsV and VII, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104920.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Phylogenetic inference I: canonical conserved Chsp motifs</title><p>As a way of massively assigning the most likely class to each of the 369 putative Chsp found, phylogenetic inferences of their CON1S region, including the guide Chsp sequences already classified, were constructed.

Division 2 contains classes IV and V, the latter formed by seven subclades: Basidio Va, Asco Va, Chytridio V, Basidio Vb, Asco Vb, Mucoro Va, and Mucoro Vb. The first three subclades correspond in our study with ChspVII three subclades, which group the same phyla (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104920.s005">Figure S5</xref>); the next three subclades correspond to ChspV.

Altogether, the variable sites (parsimony-informative) present in the CON1S region provide enough information (either as distance units or discrete characters) to confidently discern between the seven Chsp classes despite the lack of specific domains. The topology of individual classes/clades is better resolved by distance methods, but for the association of classes to their known divisions character methods are more reliable. For example, this is the case for ChspIV, which is assigned to division 1 by the ME and NJ methods when using only the CON1S region, and to division 2 on the trees inferred by the ML, MP, and Bayesian methods.</p><p>Due to the shared domain architecture for some of the classes, it is not feasible to design Hidden Markov Models capable of discerning between such classes. Classification by phylogeny, as we have shown, has a high degree of accuracy but can be computationally expensive. As a faster, simpler method of automatic classification, here we propose a series of &#8220;Chsp Regular Expressions&#8221; (ChspRE) specific for each class.

The use of the proposed ChspRE is made in an iterative fashion. Firstly, the original RE is used, retrieving Chsp sequences regardless of class but ensuring the CON1S region is present; secondly, the class-specific ChspRE is used to recover only Chsp sequences from that particular class. For some classes, more than one ChspRE can be used (e.g., eight for ChspIII). No ChspRE specific for ChspI or ChspV could be determined, but identification can be done by first recovering sequences from the appropriate division, followed by discarding the &#8220;sister classes.&#8221;</p><table-wrap id="pone-0104920-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0104920.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Chsp Class specific Regular Expressions.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0104920-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0104920.t001"/></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><label>a</label><p>ChspRE spanning multiple lines should be treated as a single string.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Distribution of putative Chsp in fungal genomes</title><p>The quantity and class of Chsp genes encoded in a particular fungal genome can vary greatly; from a single gene, multiple copies of just a couple of classes, to one (or more) copies of every single class.
