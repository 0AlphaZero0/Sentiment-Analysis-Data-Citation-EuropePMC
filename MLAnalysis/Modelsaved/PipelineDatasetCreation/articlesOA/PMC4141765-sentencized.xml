</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The fungal cell wall is a protective structural complex that controls permeability, protects the cell against osmotic changes, and shapes it. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>It is typically composed of interconnected polysaccharides such as chitin, (1,3)-β-glucan and (1,6)-β-glucan, mannan, and proteins [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Chitin synthase enzymes (Chsp) manufacture large linear chains of β-(1,4)-linked N-acetylglucosamine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Within most fungi chitin is the component that gives rigidity to the wall; mutations that eliminate the ability to synthesize chitin can be lethal to fungal cells [2]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Chsp protein sequences can be very diverse and show varying combinations of domains, but several studies agree that all—from both yeast and filamentous fungi— contain three conserved motifs: QXXEY, EDRXL, and QXRRW [3]–[6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>These conserved motifs in all Chsp are restricted to a short stretch of peptide called the Conserved Region 1 (CON1) [7], which is the core of the Chitin synthase 2 domain CS2 (Chitin_synth_2; PF03142). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The EDRXL motif is related to the catalytic base function; QXRRW (QXRRWXN in Nagahashi et al. [7]) confers processivity to the enzyme; and QXXEY does not have a putative function assigned [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The various Chsp sequences have been classified phylogenetically into seven classes (I–VII) grouped in two divisions [4]–[6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Classes IV–VII contain the CS2 domain while Chsp from classes I–III have lost the first portion of CS2, replacing it with both a type 1 Chitin synthase domain CS1 (Chitin_synth_1; PF01644) as well as a Chitin synthase N-terminal domain CSN (Chitin_synth_N; PF08407), but preserving the CON1 region from CS2 [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In addition to these domains, class I Chsp have conserved motifs present in the amino terminal portion; classes IV, V, and VII contain a binding domain similar to cytochrome b5 (cyt-b5; PF00173); and classes V and VII also contain a myosin motor domain (Myosin_head; PF00063) [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The class VI Chsp domain structure is the simplest with only a CS2 domain and could be the ancestral state of Chsp [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>For simplicity, hereafter the Chsp classes will be labeled as ChspI to ChspVII. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The use of different methods of phylogenetic inference, among other factors, has caused multiple Chsp classifications, which becomes a problem when comparing results from independent studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The two main classifications, from Choquer et al. [4] and Mandel et al. [6], concur in grouping Chsp in two divisions in which ChspI-III belong to division 1, ChspIV, V, and VII belong to division 2, and ChspVI is on its own outside both divisions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>However, their nomenclature for ChspVI and VII disagrees: Mandels's ChspVI is Choquer's ChspVII and vice versa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Mandel's ChspVI nomenclature is based on the description of Aspergillus fumigatus class VI AfChsD [8], which precedes Choquer's and is the one used on this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Another study, by Odenbach et al. [9], positions ChspVII (actually Mandel's ChspVI) inside division 1, as a sister clade of ChspI-III. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In a more recent study Ruiz-Herrera and Ortiz-Castellanos [10] speculate that ChspIV is actually the common ancestor of all fungal CHS and that the other classes would have evolved by events of duplication and modification. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The availability of full fungal genome sequences allows us to look into the evolution of Chsp from a new perspective, not as individual gene units but as part of a genomic neighborhood or syntenic group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In bacterial genomes, the syntenic blocks are usually organized as operons [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The syntenic blocks in eukaryotic genomes are much more complex; the evidence suggests that these may form different types of functional aggregations [12] and topological arrangements [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes, as the evolutionary distance between species increases, the syntenic blocks rearrange or break up. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>This can be seen, in a large scale, in the comparative study between chromosome 12 of Mycosphaerella graminicola and scaffold 7 of Stagonospora nodorum, both of the class Dothideomycetes [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>It was observed that the orientation of orthologous genes was arranged randomly, but in a genomic context there is not a random distribution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>This would imply conservation in gene content between these genomic units during molecular evolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Even in closely related species of the same genus when there is a strong pressure, as is the case in pathogenic systems, recent changes in synteny conservation can be observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>This was the case for the comparative genomics study of the whole genome of the highly pathogenic Candida albicans versus its closest relative, C. dublinensis, a significantly less virulent pathogen [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The above evidence indicates that strong selection pressures act to maintain areas that retain genes in close order and that these may form several types of functional groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>We believe that the analysis, on a large scale, of the distribution of Chsp among diverse fungal species can provide important molecular evolution information. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Due to its importance in cell-wall metabolism, some chitin synthases may be forming genetic clusters with functionally related genes as a manner of coordinated regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we first systematically searched for all the putative Chsp present in 54 fungal genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The 369 Chsp identified were classified by five methods of phylogenetic inference. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>From this classification, an analysis of the qualitative and quantitative distribution of Chsp among the individual fungal species was derived as well as a general analysis of the distribution and organization of Chsp in all the species (a relationship is observed between the content of Chsp and the taxonomy and growth form of the fungus). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>This distribution analysis showed that ChspIV is the class with the largest presence in the fungal species, and as such it was selected to conduct synteny analysis searching for groups of genes functionally related to the biogenesis of the cell wall, revealing an association between at least six genes in members of the genus Aspergillus. </plain></SENT>
