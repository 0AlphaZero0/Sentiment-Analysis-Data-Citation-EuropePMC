<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Plants are frequently exposed to a plethora of stress conditions such as low temperature, salt, drought, flooding, heat, oxidative stress, and heavy metal toxicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Abiotic stress often leads to plant growth inhibition and limits crop productivity [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It has been estimated that abiotic stresses were the principal cause of decreasing the average yield of major crops by more than 50% [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>To confront such environmental aggressions, plants develop adaptive responses at physiological and molecular levels, which are specified to each stress condition [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Indeed, plants activate a number of defense mechanisms that function to increase tolerance to the adverse conditions imposed by stresses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A major event in response to stresses is the perception and transduction of stress signals through signaling components, which results in the activation of numerous stress-related genes [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The products of these genes may participate in the generation of regulatory molecules like the plant hormones ethylene, abscisic acid (ABA), and salicylic acid (SA). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>These regulatory molecules can, in turn, initiate a second round of signaling that contribute in the final plant response to these abiotic stresses [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>One of the most important regulatory molecules that are related to environmental responses in plant species is ethylene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>As a gaseous plant hormone, ethylene is proved to be involved in plant stress responses, in addition to its roles in germination, fruit ripening, organ abscission, pathogen response and senescence, and so forth [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Several reports suggested that accumulation of ethylene or its precursor, the ACC (aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid) is exceedingly induced by abiotic stress stimuli such as salinity [7], water stress [8], and flooding [9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Ethylene function is exerted through modulation of gene expression that was operated in part at transcriptional level by ERF (ethylene response factor) considered as the effectors of ethylene signal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In Arabidopsis, a linear ethylene transduction pathway was proposed, which corresponds to a succession of components from ethylene receptor integrated in the endoplasmic reticulum [10] to transcription factors localized in the nucleus [11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>ERF transcription factors, a huge multigene family of transcription factors regulating the expression of ethylene dependent genes, are the most prominent components directing the specific and diversified plant responses to the ethylene signal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Members of the ERF transcription factor family play important roles in regulating gene expression in response to biotic and abiotic stresses [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Ethylene-responsive element-binding factors (ERFs) form a plant-specific transcriptional factor superfamily of 147 members in Arabidopsis [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, depending on the circumstances, ERFs can function as both activator and/or repressor elements [14, 15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>They can also act as an integrative node and common transcription factor of different signalling pathways [16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>ERF proteins are characterized by the presence of highly conserved sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>This sequence, named ERF domain, provides ERF affinity to the GCC box, comprised in promoter region of ethylene responsive gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Several studies suggested that ERF proteins have the capacity to specifically bind not only to GCC box, but also to the DRE/CRT motif (found in promoter region of stress responsive genes), known as a cis-acting element that responds to cold or osmotic stress [17, 18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Previous studies reported the involvement of many ERF genes in plant environmental stress responses in many plant species, especially in Arabidopsis [19–21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is one of the most important agricultural crops and increasing knowledge on their ERF genes involved in abiotic stress responses is a real challenge and can help in plant improvement programs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>However, the role of tomato ERFs in response to such stresses remains not enough elucidated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The present study is the first to examine the expression patterns of the transcription factor gene Sl-ERF.B.3 (formerly called LeERF4) in tomato to determine its regulation in response to a variety of abiotic stress conditions (salinity, drought, flooding, heat, and cold) based on wild type tomato plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Given that expression pattern of a gene under different conditions can unravel its functionality [22], we used real time RT-PCR approach to study the transcript abundance levels of the studied gene during several abiotic stress responses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>We further focused on Sl-ERF.B.3 role in vegetative growth regulation against salt stress by characterizing two Sl-ERF.B.3 antisense transgenic tomato lines compared to wild type, and we discussed the Sl-ERF.B.3 role in the layout of shoot and root growth changes related to adaptive responses to salinity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we investigated Sl-ERF.B.3 antisense lines tolerance against cold treatment and Sl-ERF.B.3 role on cell membrane injury occurred during low temperature stress responses. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>Expression of Tomato Sl-ERF.B.3 Gene under Different Abiotic Stress Treatments </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>In order to decipher the regulation of tomato Sl-ERF.B.3 gene expression, under the effect of various abiotic stresses, we have performed qRT-PCR approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>This molecular technique allowed us to assess the Sl-ERF.B.3 expression level in wild type (WT) tomato plants treated or not by five types of environmental stress: cold, heat, flooding, drought, and salinity.  Figure 1(a) shows characteristic phenotypes of plants which were used for RNA extraction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Compared with control, all treated plants displayed various stress symptoms such as wilting, cotyledon yellowing, and leaf curling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of the abiotic stress treatment was confirmed by the accumulation of the stress reference genes transcripts: Dehydrin CI7 in the salt, drought or cold-treated samples and Hsp21 and ACO in, respectively, heat and flooding treated samples (Figure 1(b)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Relative fold differences in the gene expression levels were calculated by comparing stress treated tomato plants and the corresponding control plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Our results revealed that Sl-ERF.B.3 transcripts were highly accumulated in shoots when plants were subjected to heat (20-fold difference), cold (18-fold difference), or flooding (1.9-fold difference). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>However, the Sl-ERF.B.3 mRNA accumulation was twofold lesser when plants were exposed to salinity or drought. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>This suggests that Sl-ERF.B.3 is really an abiotic-stress-responsive transcription factor, which is upregulated by flooding, cold, or heat, but downregulated by drought or salinity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>These environmental stresses contribute to the regulation of Sl-ERF.B.3 expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it is evident that physiological plant response is critically affected by environmental conditions, and this response is the result of molecular changes, including mostly transcriptional regulators. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Such regulators can be common to several environmental stimuli or specific to one kind of stress factor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>This leads to support the possibility that Sl-ERF.B.3 is a common regulator of the plant response to many abiotic stress conditions including extreme temperatures, drought, high salinity, and flooding and that it can be a key regulator of plant responses to abiotic stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>It is worth noting that Sl-ERF.B.3/LeERF4 had not previously been reported to be associated with any kind of the predicted abiotic stresses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>The similar trend of regulation of Sl-ERF.B.3, under separately high salinity and drought stress conditions (Figure 1(b)) indicates that Sl-ERF.B.3 seems to be involved in the cross-talk between the plant responses to these stresses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Probably because both salt and drought stresses lead to common constraints (the water deficit and osmotic stress) [27] and can have a similar stress adaptation mechanism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>The fact that different stress adaptation mechanisms share the same regulator suggests its prominent regulator role in the complex stress response network. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>It was previously shown that salt stress leads to disruption of normal metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>In tomato, most of the genes of metabolism were downregulated by salt stress, especially genes related to cell wall metabolism [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>In this respect, it was demonstrated that upon severe salt stress, this decrease of metabolism was due to water limitation that occurred during drought as well as salt stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>The osmotic stress was caused by the decrease of the soil water potential, which conduced to lowering water availability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>This dehydration constraint led to various stress injury at the origin of multiple cellular responses, including changes in membrane shape, solute concentration, denaturation of proteins, and production of active oxygen species [29, 30]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Given that our results indicate that cold, heat, and at a lesser extent flooding treatments, all separately trigger Sl-ERF.B.3 upregulation in tomato shoots; these three stresses should induce similar stress adaptation mechanisms. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>To study the role of Sl-ERF.B.3 gene in the regulation of tomato vegetative growth under NaCl stress, we evaluated several growth parameters (stem height, root length, and fresh weight) in Sl-ERF.B.3 antisense transgenic tomato plants and in untransformed WT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Under normal growth conditions, differences in stem growth level were noted between Sl-ERF.B.3 antisense transgenic plants and WT (Figure 2(a)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>These transgenic lines displayed slightly better height growth than the untransformed WT (Figure 2(b)), but statistic analysis revealed no significant differences between values. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the presence of antisense Sl-ERF.B.3 in transgenic plants could not have a significant role in their stem elongation, under normal growth conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>In tomato, epinasty which is induced by ethylene is a good indicator of salt-sensitivity [35], and ethylene biosynthesis is increased by salt stress [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Introducing antisense Sl-ERF.B.3 gene into tomato plants results in less pronounced epinastic phenotype (Figure 2(a)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>In transgenic plants, the mRNA of the introduced antisense Sl-ERF.B.3, highly likely binds to target sense mRNA and blocks protein synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Further, the two different antisense lines showed similar phenotype suggesting that it is likely due to the downregulation of Sl-ERF.B.3 gene by introducing its antisense shape. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Therefore, Sl-ERF.B.3, acting as activator in the ethylene signal transduction pathway, may be involved in the layout of the epinastic leaf curvature phenotype. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>After six weeks of salt stress treatment (200 mM NaCl), and as seen in Figures 2(b) and 2(c), both WT and transgenic plants exhibited salt related stem growth decrease, which is clearly higher in Sl-ERF.B.3 antisense transgenic lines (significant differences between AS25 and WT). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the salt stress dependent curved leaf aspect is more pronounced in WT plants (Figure 2(a)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, compared with that growing at control conditions, the relative decrease in stem expansion, observed in stressed plants (200 mM NaCl) is higher in transgenic lines than in WT (Figure 2(c)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Indeed, in response to 200 mM NaCl, more than 36% of relative stem height reduction was assessed in AS38 transgenic line for only 21.8% in WT plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Thus, the long time exposure to salt stress leads to a considerable NaCl stress dependent stem growth inhibition in tomato plants (whatever the line) (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)) and that the scale of such process is affected by the presence or absence of antisense Sl-ERF.B.3 gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>This inhibition is significantly more enhanced in the presence of antisense Sl-ERF.B.3 (antisense transgenic lines AS25 and AS38) than in its absence (untransformed WT lines) (Figure 2(c)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Considering stem height means, the Sl-ERF.B.3 antisense tomato plants exhibited higher salt stress sensitivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Consequently, we can emphasize that the presence of antisense Sl-ERF.B.3 and the underexpression of Sl-ERF.B.3 in transgenic plants contribute to the intensification of the NaCl negative effect on shoot elongation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Salt stress effect on plant growth inhibition is largely documented [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>One explanation is that salt stress causes unavailable soil water, which leads to water deficit that contributes to stomata closure to minimize water loss, causing CO2 assimilation restriction, which influences adversely plant growth. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>As regards to the roots, salt stress application interestingly led to their elongation inhibition in WT but contributed to their stimulation in Sl-ERF.B.3 antisense transgenic lines (Figures 2(d) and 2(e)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>This salt stress dependent root elongation improvement reached up to 22% in AS38 line (Figure 2(e)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Our results clearly emphasize that the presence of tomato antisense Sl-ERF.B.3 allows a significant stimulation of root elongation in response to salt stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Taking into account the stem growth results, we can emphasize that under salinity and with comparison to WT, transgenic plants exhibited a differentially regulated growth, which is reduced in shoots but stimulated in roots (Figures 2 and 3(a)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Decrease of root to shoot ratio under salt stress was shown in several species as an important adaptive response.  Figure 3(b) shows clearly that 200 mM NaCl slightly affected the WT root to shoot rate (about 0.01 of increase corresponding to 3.5%) but induced its increase in AS25 line (about 0.13 of increase corresponding to 35%) and, nearly, its multiplication by two in AS38 line (Figure 3(c)). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>WT as well as the two Sl-ERF.B.3 antisense transgenic lines displayed total fresh weight reduction, in response to salinity (Figure 4(a)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>However, antisense plants were more affected by salt treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>They displayed more pronounced total fresh weight reduction than that of WT (Figure 4(b)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Considering this growth parameter, salt stress-induced growth reduction is enhanced by the presence of antisense Sl-ERF.B.3 gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>However, the monitoring of NaCl effect on fresh weight of different plant organs shows a clear discrimination between the aerial parts and roots. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>In comparison with WT, transgenic lines present the highest salt stress dependent fresh biomass reduction in shoots but the lowest one in roots (Figures 4(c), 4(d), 4(e), and 4(f)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>The difference of relative fresh weight reduction values between transformed and untransformed plants reached up to more than 20% in root, especially for AS38 line (Figure 4(f)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Compared to WT plants, roots of transgenic plants were more protected from growth inhibition, generated by high NaCl concentration than shoots (Figures 4(d) and 4(f)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Plant growth is considered as coordinated biomass partitioning responses between shoots and roots. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Growth of the shoot is more sensitive to salt stress than root growth [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Given that salinity results in the establishment of water deficit stress, longer root system should facilitate water absorption from deeper soil horizons and biomass increase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>The differential response to salinity in both shoot and root is accompanied by differential changes in roots and shoots hormone concentrations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>In particular, the inhibition of shoot growth in favor of a shift in biomass allocation to the root may be explained by a differential auxin to cytokinin ratio [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Root to shoot ratio is usually increased under salinity [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Root is the first plant organ encountering soil salinity, so the early salt stress response is first triggered in roots. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>In particular, after only 15 min of treatment, alteration of gene expression can be noted in roots, in particular, early response genes including transcriptional activators [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>In this report we demonstrate that Sl-ERF.B.3 is involved in the regulation of this adaptive response to salinity, because, in Sl-ERF.B.3 antisense lines, shoots growth is much more sensitive to salt treatment than roots growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it has been shown recently that root ethylene production is inhibited by salt treatment [40], because ethylene has an inhibitor role in root growth [37, 41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>The ethylene decrease in roots may protect roots from its growth inhibitor effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>For a large variety of plants, root growth is often less sensitive to salt stress than is growth of the shoot [42], including tomato plants [35]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Response to cold stress was investigated in both WT and Sl-ERF.B.3 transgenic plants, which exhibited different degrees of stress injury (Figure 5(a)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Tomato, a plant native to warm habitats, displays symptoms of injury upon low temperature exposure [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Ion leakage was measured to reflect the level of cellular damages after 14 d of cold treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Statistic analysis showed no significant differences between electrolyte leakage values assessed on all nonstressed plant tissues, whatever the line (Figure 5(b)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>However, cold stress treatment data revealed significant differences between WT and transgenic lines (Figures 5(b) and 5(c)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Results, presented in Figure 5(b) showed that cold treatment leads to a strong increase in ion leakage in WT leaves tissue, reaching up 0.68, for only 0.28 and 0.39, respectively, in AS25 and AS38 Sl-ERF.B.3 antisense lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>This indicates that Sl-ERF.B.3 antisense transgenic lines are able to maintain significantly, low percentage of electrolyte leakage increase in their leaf tissues, compared with WT and they are clearly more tolerant to cold stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Thus, introducing antisense Sl-ERF.B.3 into tomato plants may confer reduced plasma membrane injury and enhanced tolerance against low temperature stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>This conclusion is supported by the improvement of cold tolerance in the two independent transgenic lines expressing antisense Sl-ERF.B.3, with statistically no significant differences between measurements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Therefore, Sl-ERF.B.3 is a cold stress related gene, which may act as component of the cold stress response pathway in tomato, playing a role in the layout of cold stress symptoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Recent study reported that the overexpression of an ERF transcription factor, TaPIE1 in wheat reduces the plasma membrane damages, contributing to enhanced resistance to freezing, by upregulating a range of stress-related genes, downstream the ethylene signaling pathway [44]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Data indicated that in addition to subclass B members (Sl-ERF.B.1, Sl-ERF.B.2), Sl-ERF.B.3 exhibited sequence similarities with others ERF proteins that previous reports highlighted their involvement in plant stress responses, CaEREBP-C4 and ERF5/NtERF4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>CaEREBP-C4 is a pepper transcription factor shown to be involved in cold stress responses [45], while ERF5/NtERF4 was reported to be a transcriptional activator [46], involved in the early plant responses to wounding [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Until now, Sl-ERF.B.3/LeERF4 has been only characterized as strongly induced against wounding stress [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>In this study we demonstrated its involvement in tomato response to other abiotic stresses, including heat and cold stresses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>At the perception level, both stresses affect the same site of temperature perception, the plasma membrane, but they trigger opposite changes in its fluidity, leading to the activation of different MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) cascades [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Results, in Figure 6 show that Sl-ERF.B.3 amino acid sequence lacks the putative MAP kinase phosphorylation site, found in C-terminal region of the two other members of subclass B and both of that of NtERF4 and CaEREBP-C4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>However, Sl-ERF.B.3 includes in its amino acid sequence an acidic domain [48], which had been shown in other species to act as activation domain [50]. </plain></SENT>
