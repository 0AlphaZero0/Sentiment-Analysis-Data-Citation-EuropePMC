</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prostate cancer remains the most common non-cutaneous cancer in the US. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 2014 alone, the projected incidence of prostate cancer is 233,000 cases with deaths occurring in 29,480 men,1 making metastatic prostate cancer therapy truly an unmet medical need. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With the increasing availability of new therapies that brought about a significant change in the treatment options for metastatic prostate cancer in the last 5 years alone, issues regarding the optimal sequencing or combination of these agents have arisen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Currently, several guidelines exist that help direct clinicians as to the best sequencing approach and most would evaluate presence or lack of symptoms, performance status, as well as burden of disease to help determine the best sequencing for these agents.2,3 However, therapy failure remains a significant challenge especially since cross-resistance from each agent is increasingly described.4–6 In addition, patients may lose the therapeutic window to gain substantial benefit from each drug that has been proven to provide overall survival gains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hence, better methods of identifying the target population who have the most potential to benefit remain an important though somewhat elusive goal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This review focuses on the landscape of systemic treatment for prostate cancer with specific attention to enzalutamide, its properties, as well as other current and selected emerging therapies. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The rapid evolution of drug therapies in prostate cancer has vastly improved upon the use of docetaxel since its pivotal US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 2004 and has brought about a new era where progress has been made beyond the use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with the addition of novel hormonal agents, immunotherapy, second-line chemotherapy as well as radiopharmaceuticals (see Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The choice of sequencing currently relies on patient profiles, whether symptoms of metastatic disease exist or not.7,8 Men who are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic may benefit from early use of Sipuleucel-T, while treatment using docetaxel is usually reserved for patients with pain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Radium is used predominantly for patients with bony metastases especially in those who are not candidates for aggressive chemotherapy and abiraterone acetate can be given for effects on pain palliation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Agents such as cabazitaxel, abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide or radium can all be offered after progression on docetaxel. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>While survival outcomes are undeniably improved with the use of these therapies, patients’ disease will ultimately progress on each regimen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The following section gives a brief discussion on recent drug approvals as commonly utilized in the clinic as well as selected emerging therapies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec><title><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Background on hormonal therapy </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Androgens in the form of testosterone or the more potent dihydrotestosterone (DHT) have been well-defined drivers of progression of prostate cancer and differentiation of the prostate gland. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>As such, the backbone of treatment for advanced prostate cancers was established decades ago when castration in the form of surgical orchiectomy achieved significant prostate tumor regression.9 Since then, substitution to chemical castration has been employed mostly due to patient preference.10 ADT has therefore become the standard systemic treatment for locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer.11 While ADT is almost always effective in most patients, disease progression to castration resistance inevitably occurs.12 It is now increasingly recognized that the androgen receptor (AR) remains overexpressed despite seemingly castrate levels of testosterone, since alternative receptors may activate the AR or other target genes may help perpetuate the castrate-resistant phenotype,13,14 hence the term “castration-resistance” has become widely adopted in the literature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The enhanced understanding of the role of these androgens in stimulating the growth of prostate cancer has led to the development and approval of both abiraterone and enzalutamide, the latter of which will be the main focus of this review. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Abiraterone acetate </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The ability to synthesize androgens at multiple sites and intratumorally brought about the discovery of steroidogenesis inhibition as a drug development approach to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).13 Abiraterone inhibits the microsomal enzyme cytochrome P450 isoform-17 (CYP17) that catalyzes two sequential reactions of 17-α-hydroxylase and 17,20 lyase.15 Abiraterone acetate was developed as a candidate oral small molecule inhibitor of CYP17.16–18 The loss of CYP17 as a result of abiraterone therapy results in augmented cortisol activity which interrupts negative feedback control of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), thereby resulting in increased upstream effectors with a syndrome of mineralocorticoid excess characterized by hypokalemia, hypertension and fluid retention,17 which can be mitigated by addition of low-dose steroids such as prednisone.19 The subsequent early phase clinical trials demonstrated feasibility and safety of the use of abiraterone.20–22 The phase III multicenter, randomized trial known as the COU-AA-30123 ultimately led to US FDA approval for abiraterone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>One thousand one hundred and ninety-five men with mCRPC who were previously treated and failed docetaxel were randomized 2:1 to either abiraterone plus prednisone versus prednisone with placebo.23 The primary end point of the trial was overall survival (OS), while secondary end points included time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression, progression-free survival (PFS), and PSA response rates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The results of the trial marked the first time in years that an oral, well-tolerated androgen-signaling inhibitor yielded promising survival benefit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The OS was superior in the abiraterone acetate arm compared with the prednisone/placebo arm (14.6 versus 10.9 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.65; P&lt;0.001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Similarly, all secondary end points were statistically significant in favor of abiraterone, including time to PSA progression, PFS, and PSA response rates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Further OS analysis showed maintained improvement in OS at the time of reporting (15.8 versus 11.2 months, P&lt;0.0001).24 In COU-AA-302, the role of abiraterone in the chemotherapy naive population was subsequently studied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>This phase III randomized, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 1,088 patients with mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic mCRPC and assigned to receive prednisone (5 mg twice daily) with 1,000 mg of abiraterone or placebo.25 The co-primary end points of this trial were radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and OS, which was met for rPFS, showing benefit in the abirater-one group (16.5 months versus 8.2 months, P&lt;0.0001) but not for OS, though a strong trend toward improved survival was seen, but did not cross the O’Brien-Fleming efficacy boundary for statistical significance or the pre-specified statistical efficacy boundary (alpha-level: 0.0035).26 Similar to the earlier study, unblinding was carried out after interim analysis and cross-over was allowed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>There was a notable delay in chemotherapy administration for the abiraterone arm at 25.2 months versus 16.2 months in the prednisone alone arm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>These favorable results led to ultimate approval by the FDA of abiraterone for pre-chemotherapy mCRPC patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Sipuleucel-T </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic advances for prostate cancer entered a new realm of treatment possibilities with the advent of immunotherapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Identification of certain tumor-associated antigens such as PSA and prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) that are overexpressed in prostate cancers provided an attractive target for immune-based therapies.27,28 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Sipuleucel-T is an activated autologous dendritic cellular vaccine designed to target PAP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The vaccine is manufactured through ex-vivo stimulation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) which in turn activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>It is an intensive process which entails harvesting a patient’s own peripheral cells via apheresis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The cells are then exposed to a fusion peptide consisting of PAP and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor which serves as an immune adjuvant to enhance immune activation,29 undergo quality assurance for a minimum of cluster of differentiation (CD)54 expression threshold for adequate cell collection, and are subsequently shipped back to an infusion facility where they can be administered intravenously to the patient every 2 weeks for three infusions.30 With the most common adverse reactions being transient fever and flu-like symptoms, early trials of sipuleucel-T demonstrated the safety of this form of therapy, with no increased risk of autoimmunity.31 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Two initial small phase III trials evaluated the ability of sipuleucel-T to treat minimally symptomatic mCRPC.32,33 By using the conventionally established time to progression (TTP) end points, the first of these trials failed to meet the primary end point and resulted in the premature discontinuation of the second small phase III trial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Ultimately, improvement in the secondary end point of OS was shown, leading to a second, larger phase III study, with OS as the end point, coined the IMPACT trial (NCT00065442), which definitively addressed the clinical benefit of sipuleucel-T in mCRPC.34 Five hundred and twelve patients with minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic mCRPC were enrolled, randomizing 2:1 in favor of sipuleucel-T relative to the placebo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>As noted in the previous studies, there was no significant difference in TTP based on objective parameters (3.7 months in the sipuleucel-T arm versus 3.6 months in the placebo arm; HR 0.95; P=0.63). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, the findings for OS showed a significant advantage for patients treated with sipuleucel-T at 25.8 versus 21.7 months for placebo, with a 3 year survival probability of 31.7% versus 23.0% (HR 0.77; P=0.02). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>These findings prompted FDA approval of sipuleucel-T for the treatment of minimally symptomatic mCRPC, ushering in a modern age of immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>An ongoing, phase III trial is evaluating the treatment of sipuleucel-T in patients with hormone sensitive prostate cancer (PROTECT), via NCT00779402. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Cabazitaxel </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Cabazitaxel is a semisynthetic taxane tested in taxane-resistant cell lines which inhibits microtubule depolymerization and cell division by binding to tubulin, resulting in cell cycle arrest.35 Despite 4 years since its original approval, cabazitaxel remains the first and only chemotherapy to have shown a survival benefit as second-line treatment for patients whose disease has progressed beyond docetaxel. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The approval was based on data from TROPIC,36 a Phase III trial (NCT00417079) conducted in 755 patients with mCRPC previously treated with docetaxel; participants were randomized to receive either cabazitaxel or mitoxantrone, both in combination with prednisone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The primary end point of the study was OS which was met with patients receiving cabazitaxel achieving a median OS of 15.1 months versus 12.7 months in the mitoxantrone plus prednisone arm; P=0.0001. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The median PFS was also significantly better with cabazitaxel at 2.8 months versus 1.4 months in the mitoxantrone arm (HR 0.74; P&lt;0.0001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Other secondary end points such as PSA response, time to PSA progression and tumor response were all superior in the cabazitaxel over mitoxantrone arms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>However, treatment-related deaths were more frequent in the 30 days after last treatment for cabazitaxel compared with mitoxantrone (4.9% versus 2.4%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Other hematologic toxicities, such as neutropenia (82% versus 58%) occurring as a grade 3 event or higher, were much more often seen in the cabazitaxel arm than mitoxantrone, as was the non-hematologic toxicity diarrhea (6% versus 1%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>In addition, febrile neutropenia occurred in 8% of patients in the cabazitaxel group compared with 1% in the mitoxantrone group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Based on the safety profile, the product label of cabazitaxel had clear safety warnings with regard to monitoring for neutropenia, and the product label recommended use of growth factors in high-risk patients, such as those who are &gt;65 years of age, with extensive prior radiation, or with serious comorbidities and poor nutritional status.37 Conversely, the rates of neuropathy were certainly favorable and the pain responses were comparable though not superior to mitoxantrone.38 The perceived hematologic toxicity of cabazitaxel has limited its clinical use in patients with progressive mCRPC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Given its place in sequencing in the “post-docetaxel” space, few patients are deemed fit enough for further chemotherapy after being heavily pre-treated. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Radiopharmaceuticals in the form of strontium and samarium have been available since their FDA approval in the 1990s, but while early clinical trials with Strontium-89 (Amersham Healthcare, Arlington Heights, IL, USA) and Samarium-153 (Bayer Healthcare, Berlin, Germany) have shown pain palliation from skeletal metastases,39–42 the absence of significant survival benefit and potential for myelosuppression has relegated their use for predominantly palliative end-of-life care.43–45 Alpharadin or radium-223 is a unique α-emitting radiation agent that served to improve upon the range of β emitters and was the first in its class of radiopharmaceuticals to exhibit OS in mCRPC patients with symptomatic bone metastases.46 Radium-223 emits high-energy alpha particles of short range (&lt;100 μm), inducing mainly double stranded DNA breaks that result in a potent and highly localized cytotoxic effect in the target areas.47,48 The shorter travel distance also means fewer toxic effects on adjacent tissue as well as less myelosuppression.49 Early clinical trials showed safety and feasibility in prostate cancer patients,50 eventually leading to the phase III ALSYMPCA study (NCT00699751) which evaluated 921 men with mCRPC and bone metastases, comparing radium-223 at 6 monthly injections with placebo, in addition to the best standard of care.46 The primary end point was met with a significant improvement in survival for patients treated with radium-223, with a median OS of 14.9 months versus 11.3 months for placebo, maintained through the updated analysis.46 All main secondary end points, including time to first skeletal-related events (SREs) and time to increase in PSA level showed a benefit of radium-223 as compared with placebo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>This trial ultimately led to the FDA approval of radium for clinical use in 2013 for predominantly symptomatic men with mCRPC who are post-docetaxel treatment or intolerant of or ineligible for docetaxel with no known visceral metastases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>The potential for myelosuppression was low (at 2%) but patients had to have adequate hematologic parameters prior to starting with radium-223. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Several novel agents and treatments have been shown to have promising effects in earlier phases of prostate cancer trials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>The challenge continues with how to sequence these current and emerging therapies,51 especially since many of the drug approvals have been tested against prior standards utilizing either placebo, prednisone or mitoxantrone. </plain></SENT>
