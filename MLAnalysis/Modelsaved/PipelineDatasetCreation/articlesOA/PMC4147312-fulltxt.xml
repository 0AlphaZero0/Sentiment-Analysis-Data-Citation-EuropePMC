Although many PCa are rather indolent tumors and remain clinically stable for many years or even decades and do not require any treatment, more aggressive PCa subtypes metastasize early and are associated with dismal outcome [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In 1986, introduction of prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing has significantly improved early diagnosis of PCa [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, although high serum PSA levels may correlate with PCa aggressiveness [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], PSA testing has caused a stage shift to less aggressive PCa. Over-detection and over-treatment are the main drawbacks of PSA-testing and unintentionally affect patients' quality of life [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Consequently, there is an urgent need for prognostic biomarkers to discriminate indolent from highly aggressive PCa in order to better guide an individual patient's treatment.</p><p>Recently, Erho et al. [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] developed and validated a PCa genomic classifier set with 22 markers that predicts metastatic progression better than clinicopathologic variables. The LIM and SH3 protein 1 (LASP1) is one of these markers.</p><p>LASP1 is a nucleo-cytosolic shuttling protein involved in migration, adhesion, proliferation and cell cycle progression of many cancers [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. LASP1 was initially identified from a cDNA library of breast cancer metastases and the corresponding protein is overexpressed in more than 50% of all breast cancers [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Besides its function as a structural scaffolding protein at sites of actin assembly such as invadopodia and membrane ruffles [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], LASP1 likely acts as a signaling molecule transducing information from the cytoplasm into the nucleus [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. LASP1 is expressed in virtually all normal tissues [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], but overexpressed in many cancer entities such as the aggressive pediatric brain tumor medulloblastoma [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] as well as breast [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], ovarian [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and colorectal carcinoma [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, LASP1 overexpression correlates with adverse outcome in these cancer entities suggesting an oncogenic function of LASP1 [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Expression of LASP1 is regulated i) by tumor suppressor p53 on the genomic level as shown for hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and ii) on the protein level by microRNA mir-203 as described for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], breast cancer [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and PCa [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Here, we investigated the LASP1 expression pattern in a large series of surgically treated high-risk PCa samples (n=161) and correlated LASP1 protein levels with mir-203 expression levels in a subset of the same tumors (n=138). In addition, we investigated the effect of RNA interference mediated LASP1 knockdown in a metastatic PCa cell line.</p><p>Our data demonstrate for the first time that LASP1 is overexpressed in a subset of high-risk PCa and that this expression correlates with PSA progression. qRT-PCR revealed a correlation between high LASP1 protein levels and reduced mir-203 expression in the PCa tissue samples. Cell culture experiments underline the more proliferative and migratory PCa phenotype in high LASP1 expressing cells.</p><p>These data might represent a first step toward characterizing LASP1 as a promising novel candidate biomarker to discriminate indolent from aggressive PCa.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>LASP1 mRNA expression is increased in prostate cancer metastases and is associated with pathways involved in cell migration</title><p>As LASP1 is overexpressed in several cancer entities [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], we assessed the LASP1 mRNA expression pattern in publicly available microarray datasets.

Interestingly, only PCa and LNM showed very high IRS values up to 12 while in BPH, the IRS maximum is 6. Accordingly, a low cytosolic LASP1 expression correlated with negative/low nuclear staining and a high cytosolic expression with high nuclear LASP1 immunoreactivity (p=0.0001, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).

This has contributed to a serious dilemma of overtreatment [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In the present study we identified LASP1 as a potential new prognostic PCa biomarker since the protein is significantly overexpressed in PCa compared with BPH (p=0.03) in our cohort. Moreover, analysis of 17 specimens of PCa and their corresponding LNM exhibited higher LASP1 levels in metastases, which points to a role of LASP1 in tumor progression. In addition, we analyzed LASP1 expression in high-risk PCa (Gleason score &gt;8 and PSA&gt;20 ng/ml) and correlated the immunoreactive LASP1 scores with clinicopathological data, which yielded a significant correlation between cytosolic and nuclear LASP1 levels and PSA progression. Similarly, a correlation between nuclear LASP1 localisation and poor overall survival is observed in breast cancer [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For colorectal cancer [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and medulloblastoma [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] no distinct differentiation between cytosolic and nuclear LASP1 positivity was performed but patient survival was again inversely correlated with global LASP1 expression. Unexpectedly, no correlation with clinical progression is observed in our study (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). However, on average it lasts 8 years from PSA progression to clinically overt metastasis [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Our median study follow up was 4 years, which might explain, at least in part, the lack of statistically association of LASP1 levels with clinical progression in our cohort.</p><p>In support of our observations in primary PCa, we found a functional role of LASP1 in LNCaP cells. Besides a moderate reduction of cell proliferation, we observed an impaired migration of LNCaP cells upon inducible shRNA-mediated LASP1 knockdown. These <italic>in vitro</italic> results correspond to the <italic>in silico</italic> predictions derived from our GSEA of microarrays of primary PCa, which showed an association of LASP1 expression with transcriptional signatures involved in locomotory pathways. In analogy, reduced cellular migration upon LASP1 knockdown was observed in medulloblastoma [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], breast cancer [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and colorectal cancer [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Consistently, in several cancer entities such as breast cancer [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], bladder cancer [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], squamous cell carcinoma [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and now PCa, increased LASP1 protein levels are connected to reduced mir-203 RNA levels and concomitant enhanced cell proliferation and migration.</p><p>Notably, in parallel to our experiments, Erho et al. identified LASP1 as one out of 22 marker in a PCa genomic classifier (GC) [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The study revealed that 60% of clinical high-risk patients would be reclassified as low-risk with a cumulative incidence of metastasis of only 2.4% at 5 years post radical prostatectomy. Conversely, patients with the highest GC score had nearly 10 times higher cumulative incidence of metastasis by 5 years. The value of this GC in routine clinical practice was assessed in two additional studies [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>In summary, our results suggest that LASP1 overexpression, most likely mediated by the loss of mir-203 expression, is involved in progression and metastasis of PCa.

Scoring of cytosolic LASP1 expression was carried out in analogy to the scoring of the hormone receptor Immune Reactive Score (IRS), ranging from 0-12 according to Remmele et al. and is described in detail for LASP1 in breast cancer [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. For better statistical discrimination, samples scored with cytosolic LASP1-IRS &lt;5 were classified as LASP1-negative and those with LASP1-IRS &gt;5 as LASP1-positive. Nuclear LASP1 positivity: Nuclear LASP1 positivity was scored by determining the percentage of positive nuclei regardless of cytosolic LASP1 immunoreactivity. Samples were considered as nuclear-positive if 10% or more cells showed nuclear LASP1 staining.</p></sec><sec id="s4_4"><title>Cell lines and culture conditions</title><p>PCa cell line LNCaP derived from a lymph node metastasis was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, USA). Cells were grown in plastic cell culture flasks at 37&#176;C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% non-essential amino acids and 1% pyruvate (all Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany).

The RNA concentration was determined with a Bioanalyser (Biorad, Munich, Germany). cDNA was synthesized according to the TaqMan miR Assay protocol (Life Technologies). Mature mir expression was quantified in tissue samples with TaqManR mir assay kits and an Applied Biosystems 7900 HT system. We followed the protocol provided in the manufacturer's instruction (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The expression of RNU6B was used for normalization. Relative mir expression was calculated with the &#916;<italic>C</italic>t-method (&#916;<italic>C</italic>t sample = <italic>C</italic>t RNU6B <italic>- C</italic>t sample).

Equal amounts of cells were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. After blotting on a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher&amp;Schuell, Dassel, Germany) the membrane was blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk (Biorad) in TBS-T buffer (10 mM TRIS, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) Tween, pH 7.5). Then the membrane was incubated with a self-generated primary antibody against LASP1 [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] diluted 1:8000 and anti-&#946;-Actin by Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) diluted 1:2000. Finally the membrane was washed with TBS-T and incubated with the secondary antibody goat-anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-coupled and diluted 1:5000 (Biorad). The amount of detected protein was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) and autoradiography. Quantification of autoradiography signals was carried out by densitometry using the ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4_8"><title>Proliferation assays</title><p>Non-transduced LNCaP cells and cells stable transduced with control shRNA or shRNA against LASP1 were seeded in 48-well plates.

Before the experiment, the lower surface of the filter membrane (8 &#956;M pore size) was coated for 15 min with 100 &#956;l fibronectin solution (5 &#956;g/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) as a chemo-attractant. The inner filter chambers were coated with 100 &#956;l 10% FBS in RPMI medium for 30 min. 100 &#956;l cell suspension was placed in the upper filter chambers. The chambers were placed in 24-well plates and cultured in 500 &#956;l RPMI medium with 10% FBS for 4 h at 37&#176;C to allow the cells to migrate through the porous membrane. Non-migrated cells from the top surface were removed using a cotton swab. Migrated cells at the lower surface of the membranes were stained in 200 &#956;l 1% (w/v) crystal violet in 2% ethanol in a 24-well plate for 30 sec and rinsed twice afterwards in distilled water. Cell-associated crystal violet was extracted by incubating the membrane in 200 &#956;l 10% acetic acid for 20 min and measured at 595 nm absorbance using a plate reader (Molecular Devices, Crawley, UK). Four independent experiments, each with 6 replicates, were performed</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx" xlink:href="oncotarget-05-4144-s001.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1001" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="con"><p>AH, EB and TGPG designed the study, drafted and wrote the paper, and designed the display items.
