</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequent cancer of men in the western world [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although many PCa are rather indolent tumors and remain clinically stable for many years or even decades and do not require any treatment, more aggressive PCa subtypes metastasize early and are associated with dismal outcome [2-4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In 1986, introduction of prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing has significantly improved early diagnosis of PCa [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, although high serum PSA levels may correlate with PCa aggressiveness [6], PSA testing has caused a stage shift to less aggressive PCa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Over-detection and over-treatment are the main drawbacks of PSA-testing and unintentionally affect patients' quality of life [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Consequently, there is an urgent need for prognostic biomarkers to discriminate indolent from highly aggressive PCa in order to better guide an individual patient's treatment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Recently, Erho et al. [8] developed and validated a PCa genomic classifier set with 22 markers that predicts metastatic progression better than clinicopathologic variables. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The LIM and SH3 protein 1 (LASP1) is one of these markers. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>LASP1 is a nucleo-cytosolic shuttling protein involved in migration, adhesion, proliferation and cell cycle progression of many cancers [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>LASP1 was initially identified from a cDNA library of breast cancer metastases and the corresponding protein is overexpressed in more than 50% of all breast cancers [10-12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Besides its function as a structural scaffolding protein at sites of actin assembly such as invadopodia and membrane ruffles [13], LASP1 likely acts as a signaling molecule transducing information from the cytoplasm into the nucleus [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>LASP1 is expressed in virtually all normal tissues [9], but overexpressed in many cancer entities such as the aggressive pediatric brain tumor medulloblastoma [15] as well as breast [12], ovarian [16] and colorectal carcinoma [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Moreover, LASP1 overexpression correlates with adverse outcome in these cancer entities suggesting an oncogenic function of LASP1 [12, 15, 17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Expression of LASP1 is regulated i) by tumor suppressor p53 on the genomic level as shown for hepatocellular carcinoma [18] and ii) on the protein level by microRNA mir-203 as described for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [19], breast cancer [20], and PCa [21, 22]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the LASP1 expression pattern in a large series of surgically treated high-risk PCa samples (n=161) and correlated LASP1 protein levels with mir-203 expression levels in a subset of the same tumors (n=138). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In addition, we investigated the effect of RNA interference mediated LASP1 knockdown in a metastatic PCa cell line. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate for the first time that LASP1 is overexpressed in a subset of high-risk PCa and that this expression correlates with PSA progression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>qRT-PCR revealed a correlation between high LASP1 protein levels and reduced mir-203 expression in the PCa tissue samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Cell culture experiments underline the more proliferative and migratory PCa phenotype in high LASP1 expressing cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>These data might represent a first step toward characterizing LASP1 as a promising novel candidate biomarker to discriminate indolent from aggressive PCa. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Current clinical staging is unable to accurately identify PCa subsets that are prone to progress to aggressive lethal disease, even if high Gleason scores and elevated PSA levels are used as combined prognostic markers [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>This has contributed to a serious dilemma of overtreatment [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>In the present study we identified LASP1 as a potential new prognostic PCa biomarker since the protein is significantly overexpressed in PCa compared with BPH (p=0.03) in our cohort. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Moreover, analysis of 17 specimens of PCa and their corresponding LNM exhibited higher LASP1 levels in metastases, which points to a role of LASP1 in tumor progression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>In addition, we analyzed LASP1 expression in high-risk PCa (Gleason score &gt;8 and PSA&gt;20 ng/ml) and correlated the immunoreactive LASP1 scores with clinicopathological data, which yielded a significant correlation between cytosolic and nuclear LASP1 levels and PSA progression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Similarly, a correlation between nuclear LASP1 localisation and poor overall survival is observed in breast cancer [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>For colorectal cancer [17] and medulloblastoma [15] no distinct differentiation between cytosolic and nuclear LASP1 positivity was performed but patient survival was again inversely correlated with global LASP1 expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, no correlation with clinical progression is observed in our study (Table 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>However, on average it lasts 8 years from PSA progression to clinically overt metastasis [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Our median study follow up was 4 years, which might explain, at least in part, the lack of statistically association of LASP1 levels with clinical progression in our cohort. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>In support of our observations in primary PCa, we found a functional role of LASP1 in LNCaP cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Besides a moderate reduction of cell proliferation, we observed an impaired migration of LNCaP cells upon inducible shRNA-mediated LASP1 knockdown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>These in vitro results correspond to the in silico predictions derived from our GSEA of microarrays of primary PCa, which showed an association of LASP1 expression with transcriptional signatures involved in locomotory pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>In analogy, reduced cellular migration upon LASP1 knockdown was observed in medulloblastoma [15], breast cancer [24], and colorectal cancer [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Consistently, in several cancer entities such as breast cancer [20], bladder cancer [28], squamous cell carcinoma [19] and now PCa, increased LASP1 protein levels are connected to reduced mir-203 RNA levels and concomitant enhanced cell proliferation and migration. </plain></SENT>
