The regulation of gene expression by microRNAs is a key event in muscle development and disease. To understand genome-wide changes in microRNAs and mRNAs during muscle aging, we sequenced microRNAs and mRNAs from mouse gastrocnemius muscles at two different ages (6 and 24 months). Thirty-four microRNAs (15 up-regulated and 19 down-regulated) were differentially expressed with age, including the microRNAs miR-206 and -434, which were differentially expressed in aged muscle in previous studies. Interestingly, eight microRNAs in a microRNA cluster at the imprinted <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> locus on chromosome 12 were coordinately down-regulated. In addition, sixteen novel microRNAs were identified. Integrative analysis of microRNA and mRNA expression revealed that microRNAs may contribute to muscle aging through the positive regulation of transcription, metabolic processes, and kinase activity. Many of the age-related microRNAs have been implicated in human muscular diseases. We suggest that genome-wide microRNA profiling will expand our knowledge of microRNA function in the muscle aging process.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Skeletal muscle</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>microRNA profiling</kwd><kwd>imprinted Dlk1-Dio3</kwd><kwd>microRNA cluster</kwd><kwd>novel microRNA</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass, strength, and quality, also known as sarcopenia, is a common characteristic of aging [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Decreased muscle mass and function accompany reduced physical activity and energy expenditure in the elderly. Consequently, sarcopenia results in muscle weakness, leading to disability and metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. Although, multiple factors contributing to sarcopenia are characterized by using transcriptome and proteome approaches [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], little is known about the molecular mechanisms of aging-related changes in skeletal muscle.</p><p>MicroRNAs(miRNAs) are endogenous, noncoding, short (20&#8211;22 nucleotides) RNAs that are involved in biological processes such as metabolism, development, cancer, and aging [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A long primary miRNA is initially transcribed by RNA polymerase II and processed in the nucleus by the endonuclease Drosha into precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA). The pre-miRNA is then exported into the cytoplasm and further cleaved by Dicer to generate mature miRNAs. MiRNAs recognize 3' untranslated regions, they are guided by RNA inducing silencing complex (RISC), and they silence the target's expression by either translational inhibition or degradation. The binding of miRNA to a target gene depends on the seed sequence (2&#8211;8 nucleotides) with imperfect base pairing. Therefore, a single miRNA can regulate multiple mRNAs, and vice versa, a single mRNA can be targeted by multiple miRNAs. MiRNA genes are distributed across diverse genomic locations; some are isolated, but approximately 50% of miRNAs are found in clusters transcribed as polycistronic miRNA transcripts [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Recently, several works have demonstrated that various miRNAs are differentially expressed during aging and participate in the aging processes in tissue- and cell-type specific manners [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For example, in the liver, age-regulated miRNAs such as miR-34, -93, and -214 target a gene important for oxidative stress defense and decrease its activity with aging [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the brain, nearly 39% of age-regulated miRNAs are predicted to target components that play a critical role in oxidative phosphorylation [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A few groups have reported the profiling of miRNA expression in skeletal muscle with aging using microarray analysis [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Let-7 family members were elevated in aged human skeletal muscle, contributing to reduced cellular proliferation and regenerative capacity in aged human muscle [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Aging altered the expression of 57 miRNAs in mouse quadriceps muscles and it was suggested that age-regulated miRNAs decreased proliferation and favored the terminal differentiation of myogenic precursor [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Furthermore, resistance exercise, caloric restriction, or nutrient-related hormones such as the adipokine leptin changed the expression of age-regulated miRNAs, suggesting that these outputs may reverse muscle atrophy or induce changes to a younger phenotype [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In addition to the normal muscle aging process, miRNAs participate in muscle pathologies such as muscular dystrophy and rhabdomyosarcoma. A total of 185 known miRNAs are deregulated in 10 major muscular disorders in humans and, of these deregulated miRNAs, five miRNAs, miR-146b, -221, -222, -155, and -214, were consistently regulated in almost all samples [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In rhabdomyosarcoma, which is a type of cancer originating from skeletal muscle progenitors, miR-1/206 and -29 directly targeted c-Met and YY1, respectively, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Here, we profiled both miRNA and mRNA expression in young and aged mouse gastrocnemius muscles to investigate the potential role of miRNAs in skeletal muscle aging through next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, which permits the precise identification of mature and novel miRNAs [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We found 34 age-related miRNAs in aged muscle and found that 57% of the down-regulated miRNAs are enriched as a cluster in the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> imprinted genomic region on mouse distal chromosome 12. In combination with mRNA expression, we found that the genes targeted by age-related miRNAs in skeletal muscle appear to contribute to muscle aging by regulating transcription.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>miRNA profiling using next-generation sequencing (NGS) in skeletal muscle</title><p>To study aging in skeletal muscle, we compared the muscle mass from young mice (6-month-old) to that of aged mice (24-month-old). Aged mice showed a significant loss of muscle mass in both the tibialis anterior (TA) and the gastrocnemius muscle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). We focused particularly on the gastrocnemius muscle, which is a large skeletal muscle that gradually declines in mass through the age of 32 months (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>).</p><p>To understand the molecular mechanisms of muscle aging, we analyzed the genome-wide miRNA expression of young and aged skeletal muscles by small-RNA sequencing. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, most sequences were 20~23 nucleotides in length with a peak at 22 nucleotides, representing mature miRNAs (96.9%). The remaining small RNAs (3.1%) included snRNA, scRNA, srpRNA, rRNA, tRNA, and piRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Interestingly, piRNA, mainly identified in germ cells, was up-regulated with aging (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, inset graph). The piwi-piRNA mechanism has a role in maintaining genome integrity and telomere protection in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which might be a novel modulator of muscle aging and longevity. To see the abundance of mature miRNAs in skeletal muscle, we identified the top 10 miRNAs in the sequence reads. In skeletal muscle, the 10 most highly expressed mature miRNAs comprised nearly 75% of the total miRNAs, showing a relatively even distribution in abundance (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Many of the top 10 miRNAs were previously reported for their roles in muscle. For example, two well-known miRNAs, miR-133 and miR-486, modulate skeletal muscle proliferation and differentiation [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. MiR-143 regulates smooth muscle fate by promoting differentiation and repressing the proliferation of smooth muscle cells [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Recently, miR-22 was identified as a cardiac- and skeletal muscle-enriched miRNA that is up-regulated during myocyte differentiation and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. MiR-30a promotes muscle differentiation by inhibiting Snai1/2 in primary myoblast [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Finally, myogenic factor MyoD negatively regulates myogenic repressor MyoR via miR-378 during myoblast differentiation [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, for the most abundant miR-10b, with over 6,000,000 reads per million (RPM), there were no previous reports concerning its role in either aging or muscle development.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Overview of next-generation sequencing of the small RNA transcriptome in skeletal muscle</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Size distribution of the preprocessed small RNA reads after trimming the adaptor sequence.

Recently, it was reported that age-regulated miRNAs identified in long-lived individuals were enriched on four chromosomes, 7, 9, 17, and X [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In addition, 11 miRNA clusters have been shown to be affected in the aged heart [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. To see whether the expression of miRNAs was affected individually or collectively during muscle aging, we examined the genomic locations of age-regulated miRNAs in skeletal muscle. Notably, 8 of the 14 down-regulated miRNAs (57%)were located in the imprinted <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> genomic region on distal mouse chromosome 12 (see details in Discussion). Among them, seven miRNAs were distributed broadly across <italic>Rtl1</italic> and the small nucleolar RNA <italic>Rian</italic> within the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>).

Initially, miRDeep2 predicted 93 novel miRNAs. We then evaluated the candidates according to two criteria: 1) No mapping to sno/miRNA or non-coding RNAs according to the UCSC annotation. 2) Expression of at least two reads either in young or aged muscles. By these two criteria, the 93 candidates were narrowed down to 16 novel miRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). The 16 novel miRNA precursor sequences folded well into a hairpin structure characteristic of <italic>bona fide</italic> miRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Six novel miRNAs shared homology with known miRNAs in their seed sequence (6&#8211;8 nucleotide long) as determined by the miRDeep2 algorithm, indicating that they may be new family members of those miRNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Interestingly, the mature sequences of two novel miRNAs (chr1_524 and chr13_816) were nearly identical to miR-143-3p, which regulates the fate of smooth muscle by promoting the differentiation and repressing the proliferation of smooth muscle cells [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Another novel miRNA, chr11_3738, shared homology with miR-185, which participates in 22q11DS and schizophrenia by dysregulating sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (SERCA2) [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. While 2 of the novel miRNAs (chr7_8267 and chr13_816) exhibited high expression (&gt;1,000 read counts), the remaining 14 novel miRNAs exhibited relatively low expression (&lt;300 read counts).

Young and aged samples were clearly separated into two distinct clusters by hierarchical clustering. Interestingly, 5 of the 123 up-regulated genes (4%) were over-expressed more than 7-fold. In contrast, all 13 down-regulated genes changed moderately. Several genes identified in RNA-Seq were previously reported to be associated with age-related diseases.

Other significantly enriched biological processes included the positive regulation of the transforming growth factor (TGF) beta signaling pathway and the negative regulation of the insulin pathway, apoptosis, and fat cell differentiation.

In the &#8216;Molecular Functions&#8217; category, up-regulated genes were significantly enriched for GO terms related to various enzyme activities such as kinase, peptidase, and endopeptidase.

We used the TargetScan program (version 6.2) to predict the biological targets of each miRNA and then selected genes that showed a negative correlation between mRNA (1.5-fold difference) and miRNA expression. A total of 94 mRNA-miRNA interactions were identified, including 37 up-regulated and 57 down-regulated genes targeted by 14 age-related miRNAs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

Of note, we found that the most enriched term in &#8216;biological process&#8217; category was the regulation of transcription, in which Egr2, Klf4, Klf6, and Rybp was involved. Consistent with our RNA-Seq data, we confirmed that mRNA levels of all four genes were increased in aged muscle by qRT-PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>).

To examine whether the 34 age-related miRNAs identified in skeletal muscle are implicated in human disease, we used a human miRNA-associated disease database (HMDD), which provides information on changes in miRNA regulation in various human diseases [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. As a result, human homologues corresponding to the 11 up-regulated and 8 down-regulated miRNAs were related to 58 and 40 human diseases, respectively (data not shown). Interestingly, 8 of the 19 miRNAs were related to human muscular diseases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tables S3 and S4</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). Notably, the changes in the miRNA expression level in those diseases were correlated with up-regulation rather than down-regulation. For example, the human homologues for five miRNAs that were up-regulated in aged muscle were also up-regulated in muscular diseases, except for miR-29b in DMD and RMS. In contrast, only one miRNA, hsa-miR-193, was down-regulated in DMD. In addition, 61 miRNAs related to 10 different groups of human muscle disorders are annotated in HMDD. We found that 8 miRNAs were significantly enriched in 8 muscular diseases, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), limb-girdle muscular dystrophies types 2A (LGMD2A) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). This analysis thus represents a meaningful relationship between the age-regulated miRNAs identified in mouse skeletal muscle and human muscular diseases.</p><fig id="F7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Association of age-related miRNAs identified in skeletal muscle with human diseases</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The human homologues of 19 of 34 age-related miRNAs (56%) were associated with diseases.

Here, we systematically profiled miRNA and mRNA gene expression from young and aged skeletal muscle. A total of 34 age-related miRNAs were identified. Of the down-regulated miRNAs, miR-148a-3p and -127-3p belonged to the 50 most abundant miRNAs in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>, Asterisk). MiR-127 was identified as a cardiac valve-enriched miRNA [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; however, there were no previous reports on its role in skeletal muscle development. MiR-148a, one of the down-regulated miRNAs, was identified as a myogenic miRNA that promotes myogenic differentiation through the ROCK1 gene. MiR-155, one of the up-regulated miRNAs, represses skeletal muscle differentiation by repressing MEF2A [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Thus, in accordance with their expression and role in myogenesis, miR-148a and miR-155 might be involved in the aging process through muscle differentiation or regeneration.</p><p>Several groups have reported genome-wide profiling of miRNA expression in skeletal muscle with aging. The expression of 57 miRNAs in mouse quadriceps muscles was altered by aging using a miRNA array [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In another study, 18 age-associated miRNAs were identified in aged human skeletal muscles by miRNA array [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Recently, age-associated miRNA alterations in the skeletal muscle were reported in rhesus monkeys based on small RNA sequencing [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The differentially expressed miRNAs in previous studies appeared consistently in mouse skeletal muscle from our study; for example, up-regulated miRNAs such as miR-29b, -34a, -206, -215, and -223 in aged muscle were also elevated, and the down-regulated miRNA miR-434 was decreased in aged mouse muscle; thus, our data reproduce previous findings.</p><p>The processing of pre-miRNA produces a miRNA duplex consisting of an miRNA (guide) and miRNA* (passenger) strand [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Although the miRNA* strand is generally considered to have no functional role due to its low abundance, some miRNA* have been detected with high abundance during large-scale small RNA sequencing. Furthermore, some miRNA* strands were shown to be incorporated into RISC-complex and to show inhibitory activity, suggesting the impact of miRNA* species on regulatory networks [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Of note, in our dataset, five miRNAs, miR-136, -337, -434, -3071, -3544, exhibited a high dominance in both the guide and passenger strands. These five miRNA/miRNA*s were preferentially down-regulated with aging (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). It remains unknown whether the down-regulated miRNA* strands, miR-136-3p, -337-3p, -434-5p, -3071-3p, and -3544-5p, have regulatory roles contributing to muscle aging.</p><p>Most mammalian miRNA genes are scattered individually in diverse genomic locations, but some miRNA genes are clustered in the genome [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. There are miRNA clusters that contain two to three miRNA genes or mega-clusters that contain &gt;50 miRNA genes. The clustered miRNAs are often oriented in the same direction and transcribed in a polycistronic manner with similar expression patterns. The imprinted <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> genomic region, which is located on human chromosome 14 (mouse chromosome 12), contains the paternally expressed genes <italic>Dlk1, Rtl1</italic>, and <italic>Dio3</italic> and the maternally expressed non-coding RNA genes <italic>Meg3</italic> (<italic>Gtl2</italic>) and <italic>Meg8</italic> (<italic>Rian</italic>) as well as the antisense <italic>Rtl1</italic> (<italic>anti-Rtl1</italic>) [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Furthermore, the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> region contains 54 miRNAs, the largest miRNA cluster found in the human genome [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Notably, 8 of the 14 down-regulated miRNAs (57%) identified in this work belonged to the miRNA cluster derived from the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> region on mouse distal chromosome 12 and changed in the same direction in muscle. The miRNA clusters within the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> region are organized in two groups; the smaller one between <italic>Gtl2</italic> and <italic>Rian</italic> and the larger one between <italic>Rian</italic> and <italic>Mirg</italic> (also known as the miR-379-410 cluster); seven miRNAs found in skeletal muscle were derived from the smaller cluster, <italic>Gtl2/Rian</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>).</p><p>The miRNA clusters and genes within the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> region are differentially regulated in various diseases such as cancer and schizophrenia as well as skeletal muscle development [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The expression of ovine <italic>Dlk1, Gtl2, Rtl1</italic>, and <italic>Meg8</italic> is enriched in skeletal muscle, and overexpression of <italic>Dlk1</italic> and <italic>Rtl1</italic> is strongly correlated to muscle hypertrophy in <italic>Callipyge</italic> sheep [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The <italic>Gtl2-Dio3</italic> miRNA cluster-mediated regulation of WNT signaling by MEF2A is required for skeletal muscle regeneration [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Of the eight miRNAs located in the imprinted <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> region, four miRNAs, miR-127, -136, -434, and -3071, are located within <italic>anti-Rtl1</italic>, which contains seven miRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>, based on miRbase). In this respect, these observations raise the questions of (1) if the miRNA cluster within the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> region is involved in muscle aging by participating in muscle regeneration or muscle atrophy; and (2) whether silencing of the miRNA cluster within the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> region with aging occurs in other tissues. By the integrated analysis of small RNA-Seq and mRNA-Seq data, we identified 94 mRNAs targeted by 14 age-regulated miRNAs using the TargetScan algorithm. Interestingly, GO functional clustering analyses revealed that genes targeted by down-regulated miRNAs, such as the Ccna2, Egr2, Klf4, Klf6, Mafb, Nfya, and Rybp genes, are mainly involved in the regulation of transcription, whereas genes targeted by up-regulated miRNAs are not enriched in any of the GO categories. Recently, it was reported that Ring1 and YY1-binding protein (Rybp) is down-regulated by miR-29 during myogenesis and acts as a negative regulator of skeletal myogenesis in injury-induced muscle regeneration [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These results suggested that Rybp and its putative regulatory miRNA, miR-136, could contribute to muscle aging process. Future investigations into precise regulatory mechanisms for Rybp and miR-136 are needed.</p><p>In summary, we have identified 34 age-related miRNAs in the skeletal muscle, and of those 34, over 50% of down-regulated miRNAs are enriched as a cluster in the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> imprinted genomic region. By analyzing miRNA-mRNA interactions, we have identified that the miRNA contributes to muscle aging primarily through the regulation of transcription. Therefore, our results provide a clue regarding the role of miRNA in skeletal muscle aging.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Sample collection</title><p>Six young (6-month-old) and six aged (24-month-old) male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Resource Center (Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology).

Each library was indexed with the Illumina adaptor (6-base barcode). The small RNA library was size fractionated on a 6% TBE urea polyacrylamide gel, and the 140-160 base pair fraction was excised from the gel. The purified miRNA library was quantified on the Agilent DNA 1000 chip. All indexed samples were pooled and sequenced in one lane of Illumina GAIIx (36 bp reads).

By comparing the mapping position and annotation information, all mapped reads were classified into the corresponding RNA types, and the relative abundance of expression of each RNA type was evaluated based on the assigned read counts.
