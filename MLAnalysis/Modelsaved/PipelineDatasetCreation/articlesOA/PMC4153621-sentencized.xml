</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass, strength, and quality, also known as sarcopenia, is a common characteristic of aging [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Decreased muscle mass and function accompany reduced physical activity and energy expenditure in the elderly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Consequently, sarcopenia results in muscle weakness, leading to disability and metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although, multiple factors contributing to sarcopenia are characterized by using transcriptome and proteome approaches [2], little is known about the molecular mechanisms of aging-related changes in skeletal muscle. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs(miRNAs) are endogenous, noncoding, short (20–22 nucleotides) RNAs that are involved in biological processes such as metabolism, development, cancer, and aging [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A long primary miRNA is initially transcribed by RNA polymerase II and processed in the nucleus by the endonuclease Drosha into precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The pre-miRNA is then exported into the cytoplasm and further cleaved by Dicer to generate mature miRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>MiRNAs recognize 3' untranslated regions, they are guided by RNA inducing silencing complex (RISC), and they silence the target's expression by either translational inhibition or degradation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The binding of miRNA to a target gene depends on the seed sequence (2–8 nucleotides) with imperfect base pairing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a single miRNA can regulate multiple mRNAs, and vice versa, a single mRNA can be targeted by multiple miRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>MiRNA genes are distributed across diverse genomic locations; some are isolated, but approximately 50% of miRNAs are found in clusters transcribed as polycistronic miRNA transcripts [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Recently, several works have demonstrated that various miRNAs are differentially expressed during aging and participate in the aging processes in tissue- and cell-type specific manners [5, 6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>For example, in the liver, age-regulated miRNAs such as miR-34, -93, and -214 target a gene important for oxidative stress defense and decrease its activity with aging [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In the brain, nearly 39% of age-regulated miRNAs are predicted to target components that play a critical role in oxidative phosphorylation [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>A few groups have reported the profiling of miRNA expression in skeletal muscle with aging using microarray analysis [9, 10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Let-7 family members were elevated in aged human skeletal muscle, contributing to reduced cellular proliferation and regenerative capacity in aged human muscle [9, 11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Aging altered the expression of 57 miRNAs in mouse quadriceps muscles and it was suggested that age-regulated miRNAs decreased proliferation and favored the terminal differentiation of myogenic precursor [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, resistance exercise, caloric restriction, or nutrient-related hormones such as the adipokine leptin changed the expression of age-regulated miRNAs, suggesting that these outputs may reverse muscle atrophy or induce changes to a younger phenotype [12, 13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In addition to the normal muscle aging process, miRNAs participate in muscle pathologies such as muscular dystrophy and rhabdomyosarcoma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>A total of 185 known miRNAs are deregulated in 10 major muscular disorders in humans and, of these deregulated miRNAs, five miRNAs, miR-146b, -221, -222, -155, and -214, were consistently regulated in almost all samples [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In rhabdomyosarcoma, which is a type of cancer originating from skeletal muscle progenitors, miR-1/206 and -29 directly targeted c-Met and YY1, respectively, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role [15, 16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Here, we profiled both miRNA and mRNA expression in young and aged mouse gastrocnemius muscles to investigate the potential role of miRNAs in skeletal muscle aging through next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, which permits the precise identification of mature and novel miRNAs [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>We found 34 age-related miRNAs in aged muscle and found that 57% of the down-regulated miRNAs are enriched as a cluster in the Dlk1-Dio3 imprinted genomic region on mouse distal chromosome 12. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In combination with mRNA expression, we found that the genes targeted by age-related miRNAs in skeletal muscle appear to contribute to muscle aging by regulating transcription. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>To understand the molecular mechanisms of muscle aging, we analyzed the genome-wide miRNA expression of young and aged skeletal muscles by small-RNA sequencing. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, piRNA, mainly identified in germ cells, was up-regulated with aging (Fig. 1C, inset graph). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The piwi-piRNA mechanism has a role in maintaining genome integrity and telomere protection in Drosophila [18], which might be a novel modulator of muscle aging and longevity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>To see the abundance of mature miRNAs in skeletal muscle, we identified the top 10 miRNAs in the sequence reads. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>In skeletal muscle, the 10 most highly expressed mature miRNAs comprised nearly 75% of the total miRNAs, showing a relatively even distribution in abundance (Fig. 1D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Many of the top 10 miRNAs were previously reported for their roles in muscle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>For example, two well-known miRNAs, miR-133 and miR-486, modulate skeletal muscle proliferation and differentiation [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>MiR-143 regulates smooth muscle fate by promoting differentiation and repressing the proliferation of smooth muscle cells [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Recently, miR-22 was identified as a cardiac- and skeletal muscle-enriched miRNA that is up-regulated during myocyte differentiation and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>MiR-30a promotes muscle differentiation by inhibiting Snai1/2 in primary myoblast [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Finally, myogenic factor MyoD negatively regulates myogenic repressor MyoR via miR-378 during myoblast differentiation [23]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Significant advances have been made regarding the roles of miRNAs in aging processes through massive analyses of miRNAs that are differentially expressed with aging in various tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Here, we systematically profiled miRNA and mRNA gene expression from young and aged skeletal muscle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>A total of 34 age-related miRNAs were identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Of the down-regulated miRNAs, miR-148a-3p and -127-3p belonged to the 50 most abundant miRNAs in skeletal muscle (Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>S4, Asterisk). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>MiR-127 was identified as a cardiac valve-enriched miRNA [34]; however, there were no previous reports on its role in skeletal muscle development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>MiR-148a, one of the down-regulated miRNAs, was identified as a myogenic miRNA that promotes myogenic differentiation through the ROCK1 gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>MiR-155, one of the up-regulated miRNAs, represses skeletal muscle differentiation by repressing MEF2A [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Thus, in accordance with their expression and role in myogenesis, miR-148a and miR-155 might be involved in the aging process through muscle differentiation or regeneration. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Several groups have reported genome-wide profiling of miRNA expression in skeletal muscle with aging. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>The expression of 57 miRNAs in mouse quadriceps muscles was altered by aging using a miRNA array [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>In another study, 18 age-associated miRNAs were identified in aged human skeletal muscles by miRNA array [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Recently, age-associated miRNA alterations in the skeletal muscle were reported in rhesus monkeys based on small RNA sequencing [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>The differentially expressed miRNAs in previous studies appeared consistently in mouse skeletal muscle from our study; for example, up-regulated miRNAs such as miR-29b, -34a, -206, -215, and -223 in aged muscle were also elevated, and the down-regulated miRNA miR-434 was decreased in aged mouse muscle; thus, our data reproduce previous findings. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>The processing of pre-miRNA produces a miRNA duplex consisting of an miRNA (guide) and miRNA* (passenger) strand [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Although the miRNA* strand is generally considered to have no functional role due to its low abundance, some miRNA* have been detected with high abundance during large-scale small RNA sequencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, some miRNA* strands were shown to be incorporated into RISC-complex and to show inhibitory activity, suggesting the impact of miRNA* species on regulatory networks [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Of note, in our dataset, five miRNAs, miR-136, -337, -434, -3071, -3544, exhibited a high dominance in both the guide and passenger strands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>These five miRNA/miRNA*s were preferentially down-regulated with aging (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>It remains unknown whether the down-regulated miRNA* strands, miR-136-3p, -337-3p, -434-5p, -3071-3p, and -3544-5p, have regulatory roles contributing to muscle aging. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Most mammalian miRNA genes are scattered individually in diverse genomic locations, but some miRNA genes are clustered in the genome [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>There are miRNA clusters that contain two to three miRNA genes or mega-clusters that contain &gt;50 miRNA genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>The clustered miRNAs are often oriented in the same direction and transcribed in a polycistronic manner with similar expression patterns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>The imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 genomic region, which is located on human chromosome 14 (mouse chromosome 12), contains the paternally expressed genes Dlk1, Rtl1, and Dio3 and the maternally expressed non-coding RNA genes Meg3 (Gtl2) and Meg8 (Rian) as well as the antisense Rtl1 (anti-Rtl1) [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the Dlk1-Dio3 region contains 54 miRNAs, the largest miRNA cluster found in the human genome [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Notably, 8 of the 14 down-regulated miRNAs (57%) identified in this work belonged to the miRNA cluster derived from the Dlk1-Dio3 region on mouse distal chromosome 12 and changed in the same direction in muscle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>The miRNA clusters within the Dlk1-Dio3 region are organized in two groups; the smaller one between Gtl2 and Rian and the larger one between Rian and Mirg (also known as the miR-379-410 cluster); seven miRNAs found in skeletal muscle were derived from the smaller cluster, Gtl2/Rian (Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>S3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>The miRNA clusters and genes within the Dlk1-Dio3 region are differentially regulated in various diseases such as cancer and schizophrenia as well as skeletal muscle development [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>The expression of ovine Dlk1, Gtl2, Rtl1, and Meg8 is enriched in skeletal muscle, and overexpression of Dlk1 and Rtl1 is strongly correlated to muscle hypertrophy in Callipyge sheep [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>The Gtl2-Dio3 miRNA cluster-mediated regulation of WNT signaling by MEF2A is required for skeletal muscle regeneration [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Of the eight miRNAs located in the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 region, four miRNAs, miR-127, -136, -434, and -3071, are located within anti-Rtl1, which contains seven miRNAs (Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>S3, based on miRbase). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>In this respect, these observations raise the questions of (1) if the miRNA cluster within the Dlk1-Dio3 region is involved in muscle aging by participating in muscle regeneration or muscle atrophy; and (2) whether silencing of the miRNA cluster within the Dlk1-Dio3 region with aging occurs in other tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>By the integrated analysis of small RNA-Seq and mRNA-Seq data, we identified 94 mRNAs targeted by 14 age-regulated miRNAs using the TargetScan algorithm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, GO functional clustering analyses revealed that genes targeted by down-regulated miRNAs, such as the Ccna2, Egr2, Klf4, Klf6, Mafb, Nfya, and Rybp genes, are mainly involved in the regulation of transcription, whereas genes targeted by up-regulated miRNAs are not enriched in any of the GO categories. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Recently, it was reported that Ring1 and YY1-binding protein (Rybp) is down-regulated by miR-29 during myogenesis and acts as a negative regulator of skeletal myogenesis in injury-induced muscle regeneration [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that Rybp and its putative regulatory miRNA, miR-136, could contribute to muscle aging process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Future investigations into precise regulatory mechanisms for Rybp and miR-136 are needed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>In summary, we have identified 34 age-related miRNAs in the skeletal muscle, and of those 34, over 50% of down-regulated miRNAs are enriched as a cluster in the Dlk1-Dio3 imprinted genomic region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>By analyzing miRNA-mRNA interactions, we have identified that the miRNA contributes to muscle aging primarily through the regulation of transcription. </plain></SENT>
