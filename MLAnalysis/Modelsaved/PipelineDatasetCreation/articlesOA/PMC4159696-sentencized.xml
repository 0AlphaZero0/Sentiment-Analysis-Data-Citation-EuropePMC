</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The facultative anaerobe and model bacterium Escherichia coli is capable of considerable respiratory flexibility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In the absence of oxygen it is able to use a range of terminal electron acceptors, the most energetically favourable of which is nitrate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>To maximize the availability of nitrate from the environment, E. coli produces three nitrate reductase enzymes 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>All three of these enzymes contain molybdenum at their active sites, which is bound to an inorganic cofactor as Mo‐bis‐molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide (MoCo). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Nitrate reductase‐A is the major nitrate reductase produced under anaerobic growth conditions in the presence of nitrate 4, while nitrate reductase‐Z is structurally related to nitrate reductase‐A but is produced at low levels until entry into stationary phase 5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Both nitrate reductase‐A and nitrate reductase‐Z are located at the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane 6. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The third E. coli nitrate reductase, Nap, is located in the periplasmic compartment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The catalytic subunit NapA is a 90 kDa protein that binds a [4Fe‐4S] cluster in addition to the molybdenum cofactor 7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>NapA is encoded, along with its periplasmic di‐heme c‐type cytochrome redox partner NapB, in the seven gene nap operon (Fig. 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>NapA is exported to the periplasm in a folded form by the twin‐arginine protein transport (Tat) pathway 10, which is a translocation system dedicated to the export of fully folded proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In E. coli approximately two‐thirds of the 28 known Tat substrates bind one or more redox cofactors 12. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Tat‐targeting signal peptides contain a conserved S‐R‐R‐X‐F‐L‐K consensus amino acid motif where the consecutive arginine residues are almost invariant 13. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>This motif is specifically recognized by the membrane‐bound TatC component 15 and the signal peptide is usually cleaved off at a late stage of protein transport by a periplasmically facing signal peptidase 16. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Some twin‐arginine signal peptides have dual functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>In addition to their Tat‐targeting role, they also act as binding sites for biosynthetic chaperones 17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>A well‐studied example of a signal‐peptide‐binding biosynthetic chaperone is TorD, which binds to the twin‐arginine signal peptide of its cognate Tat substrate trimethylamine‐N‐oxide reductase, TorA, and at a second site close to the mature N‐terminus 18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>TorD binding facilitates molybdenum cofactor insertion into TorA by maintaining the apoprotein in an open conformation, simultaneously shielding the substrate from interacting with the Tat machinery while allowing the cofactor to insert. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>This process has been termed ‘Tat proofreading’ 17 since it ensures that immature substrates are not exported to the periplasm in haste. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>The binding of the molybdenum cofactor to TorA induces folding of the enzyme that necessitates translocation via the Tat pathway (reviewed in 17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Indeed, it is thought that all Tat‐dependent molybdoenzymes receive their cofactors in the cytoplasm prior to export 17. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>NapA is subject to Tat proofreading prior to export by the Tat pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>NapD is a small (9.3 kDa) cytoplasmic protein that is essential for Nap activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>It has been shown to bind with a nanomolar dissociation constant to the isolated NapA Tat signal peptide 22. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Site‐directed mutagenesis has indicated that NapD recognizes an epitope that straddles the n‐ and h‐regions of the NapA signal peptide, including Arg6 and Lys10 that form part of the twin‐arginine consensus motif (Fig. 1A) 23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>However, the precise role of NapD in the assembly of NapA remains unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>To shed light on this process, in this work we have isolated and characterized a complex of the two proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the proteins are present in 1 : 1 stoichiometry and that the NapA precursor has a substantial degree of folding whilst in complex with NapD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>In the absence of the NapA twin‐arginine signal peptide a stable complex could not be isolated, confirming that this is the major NapD‐binding epitope. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>It has recently been shown by NMR techniques that the NapA signal peptide adopts an α‐helical conformation when bound to NapD 23; however, it is not clear whether the helical form of the signal peptide is induced upon binding with NapD or whether it is an intrinsic feature of the alanine‐rich signal peptide. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>A stable complex of the NapA precursor and an N‐terminally hexa‐histidine tagged NapD can be isolated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>The stability of the complex can be largely ascribed to the interaction of NapD with the signal peptide portion of the precursor, since in the absence of the signal peptide the complex is destabilized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>This is supported by the findings of Chan et al. 34 who showed that there was no detectable interaction between NapD and the mature sequence of NapA in the bacterial two‐hybrid system. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>The lack of molybdenum was not surprising given that the NapDA complexes studied here were produced in aerobically grown cells and that biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor is greatly induced only under anaerobic conditions 35. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>The results presented here corroborate these previous findings and, given the stable attachment of NapD to NapA observed here, suggest that NapD is additionally required for NapA maturation at a stage after [Fe‐S] cluster assembly into the enzyme. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>However, unlike the TorAD complex where the component high‐resolution structures of TorA and TorD could be well fitted into the SAXS envelope by rigid body modelling, the rigid body models created for the NapDA SAXS data had less volume than the corresponding ab initio models, even when integrating flexibility into the model by allowing flexibility in the orientation of domain IV of NapA (which is the only domain of Nap/DMSO reductase family enzymes that is formed from a contiguous stretch of polypeptide chain and which is known to be flexible in the TorA precursor 21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>This indicates that the folding present in the crystal structure is not an accurate reflection of the folding of NapA in the complex, i.e. all four domains of NapA are likely to be partially unfolded in the complex (Fig. S6). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Previous analysis of the precursor of the molybdoenzyme TorA in complex with the TorD chaperone has shown that the C‐terminal 173 amino acids of TorA, comprising the entirety of domain IV, are sensitive to trypsin digestion, indicating flexibility in this part of the protein 21. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Since this forms a lid over the MoCo binding site, it has been speculated that closing of the domain IV lid is the final step in the maturation of TorA and may promote release of the bound TorD chaperone 21. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Limited trypsinolysis of the NapDA complex indicated that the analogous domain IV region of NapA is also accessible to trypsin (data not shown), consistent with the MoCo binding site being open and empty. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>However, unlike TorA, the NapA precursor was sensitive to trypsin digestion at several sites within the N‐terminal 315 amino acids (not shown), supporting the conclusion from the SAXS analysis that the NapA precursor is much less compact than mature NapA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Finally, it should be considered that additional chaperone proteins may be required to complete the maturation of NapA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>It is known that some complex Tat substrate proteins such as the small subunits of periplasmically facing hydrogenases require more than one chaperone for their assembly 37. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>In this context, a second cytoplasmic accessory protein encoded by the nap operon NapF has also been shown to interact with NapA 39. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>NapF was not overproduced in any of the experiments described here and is likely to have been present at extremely low levels since the nap operon is repressed under aerobic growth conditions 3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>In future it would be interesting to ascertain the role of NapF in the NapA proofreading process. </plain></SENT>
