</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The human gut microbiota is a diverse ecosystem comprising of bacteria, archaea, virus and eukaryotes referred to as the gut microbiota. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It has been observed that the composition of gut microbiota depends on environmental factors [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Numerous studies focused on gut bacteria, but the repertoire of gut microeukaryotes has been poorly explored [3]–[8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Previous studies indicated that components of the gut microbiota, including gut microeukaryotes, were interacting one with each other [9], [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Recently, high-throughput sequencing and clone library sequencing of gut microeukaryote community indicated that fungi and Blastocystis were the two dominant components of gut microeukaryote community [4]–[6], [8], [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, fungal abundance was found to be significantly associated with recently consumed foods: in particular Candida spp. abundance significantly correlated with recent consumption of diet rich in high carbohydrates [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Likewise, our previous studies on eukaryote community in an obese individual and in an anorexic individual and revealed fungi diversity related to diet [4], [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>A diversity of eukaryotic fungi was detected in healthy individuals and infants with low weight [5], [6], [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Despite evidence for the gut microeukaryote community being influenced by the environment, a few studies have been reported from a limited number of individuals, mainly living in the northern hemisphere countries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Indeed, of twelve studies, three issued from individuals in Europe [4], [7], [8], three from the USA [6], [12], [14], two from China [3], [15], one from India [16], one from Turkey [17], one from Korea [11] and one from Senegal [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the current body of knowledge may not be representative of the actual diversity of this repertoire, as no data issued from individuals living in southern hemisphere countries such as Polynesia and Amazonia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Here, in an effort to broaden knowledge on gut microeukaryotes, we investigated microeukaryotes in seven individuals living in four tropical countries. </plain></SENT>
