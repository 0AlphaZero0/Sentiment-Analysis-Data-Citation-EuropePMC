</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The relationship between amino acid sequences to their corresponding three-dimensional structures continues to be of interest to biologists and bio-informaticians. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this context, we have earlier developed a relational database – PSSARD, that can be used to query the conformations associated with any given peptide sequence in proteins of known three-dimensional structure [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Later, we analyzed the conformations associated with hexa-peptide and longer sequences that occur as continuous amino acid repeats in proteins (CARPs) [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We also examined whether hepta-peptide and large sequences that entirely correspond to a helix, strand or coil conformation in one protein may be associated with a different conformation in another protein, thereby representing some of the ‘chameleon’ sequences in proteins [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the present work, we analyze the conformations and other structural properties associated with ‘inverted’ peptide sequences in proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="?"><plain>Particularly, we were interested in evaluating whether it would be possible to design ‘artificial’ proteins by incorporating ‘inverted’ peptide sequences in natural proteins and whether the artificial protein would retain the native-like protein fold? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This would suggest that natural proteins may accommodate such peptides sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Proteins designed in this manner may be useful to compare, for instance, the physiological properties of the native protein vis-à-vis the artificial protein. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of inverted repeats in proteins has been predicted long ago and was based on extensive search of internal regularities in the amino acid sequences using the genetic code and the relative frequencies of amino acid alternatives in homologous proteins [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Further, the question of whether an ‘inverted’ protein sequence (or a retro-protein) would fold to a well-defined native-like structure as natural proteins do and if so, whether the folded structure would be similar to the native conformation of the original protein has earlier been investigated [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>These authors took the retro-protein sequence corresponding to the B domain of Staphylococcal protein A (retro-protein A) and using different secondary structure prediction methods and a lattice Monte Carlo simulation model conjectured that it would form a three-helix bundle structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The topology of the retro-protein A was predicted to be similar to the native protein and this needed validation by experimental verification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>This work was followed by the observation of a large number of examples of Inverse Sequence Similarity (ISS) up to 34% identity and self-inverse protein sequences in sequence and structure databases [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate the structural meaning of ISS in proteins, these authors' extracted more than 4000 sequences from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), inverted the sequences and searched for similarity of the inverted sequences in the PDB and SwissProt sequence databases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Their study demonstrated that a degree of ISS which normally would be highly significant for structurally related proteins was not sufficient to indicate structural similarity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, many proteins in the PDB were shown to contain conspicuous ISS to each other [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>These authors analyzed whether this ISS is related to structural similarity by carrying out a large-scale three-dimensional structural superposition of corresponding C-alpha atoms for the forwardly and inversely aligned proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>While comparing proteins of less than 50% pair-wise sequence identity, only 0.5% of inversely aligned proteins had similar folds, whereas 9% of forwardly aligned proteins in the same range showed similar 3-D structures, supporting the view that the inversion of protein sequences in almost all cases lead to a different folding property of the protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>It was therefore suggested, that the inverted sequences were suitable as protein-like sequences for control purposes without relation to existing proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>It was also shown that the short helices keep their conformation when the sequence is inverted suggesting that the folding of helices is only weakly dependent on the sequence order [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>However, the relative abundance of inverse proteins was attributed to the occurrence of same repeat patterns and amino acid propensity of existing proteins sequences and it was pointed out that ISS cannot be considered as random and therefore the use of inverse sequences as negative set in experiments was cautioned [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Inverted repeats have also been observed in α-helical membrane protein structures [9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Till date, there is not a single natural protein sequence in the database of known protein three-dimensional structure that corresponds entirely to an inverted sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is not clear yet whether completely inverted protein sequences would fold like natural proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In the present work, we have carried out an exhaustive analysis in order to identify all the ‘inverted’ peptide sequences in representative proteins of known three-dimensional structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Further, we have evaluated the secondary structure conformations, solvent accessibility and number of residue neighborhood contacts corresponding to the inverted peptides. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>We exclude peptide sequences that correspond to palindromes or to continuous single amino acid repeats, as these peptides read the same regardless of the protein chain direction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>We examined whether inverted peptides present along the same protein chain or on different chains of the same protein interact in tertiary structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="?"><plain>More importantly, we evaluated whether it would be possible to ‘swap’ peptide sequences in natural proteins with their corresponding ‘inverted’ peptide sequences and whether such ‘artificial’ proteins retain native-like overall protein fold? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrates with few examples via protein structure analysis, comparative protein modeling and validation studies that certain peptide sequences in natural proteins may be inverted and the protein is likely to fold as in the native protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Further, we provide a list of natural proteins containing potentially ‘swappable’ peptide sequences with ‘inverted’ peptide sequences. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>A representative dataset of proteins of known three-dimensional structure available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [10] was identified according to the PDB_SELECT program [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>These correspond to protein crystal structures determined at ≤2.5 Å resolution and with pair-wise protein chain sequence identities ≤25%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>A computer program was developed in order to identify penta-peptide and large sequences associated as ‘inverted’ peptide pairs (or INVPEPs) in the representative protein dataset. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Starting with the N-terminal residue of the first sequence in the dataset, a ‘probe’ sequence corresponding to the first five amino acid residues (or 5-mer) was considered and a ‘target’ sequence was generated by inverting the probe peptide sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>This ‘target’ sequence was then searched starting from the N-terminal residue of the first sequence in the dataset, in order to identify exact sequence ‘hits’ by sliding one-residue at a time along the protein sequence until the end of the sequence was reached. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Next, the ‘target’ sequence was searched for identifying identical ‘hits’ in the next protein sequence and likewise in all the protein sequences in the dataset. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>For each ‘hit’ that was identified, the protein PDB code, protein chain, peptide sequence, start and end residue positions for the ‘probe’ and ‘target’ sequences in the proteins were recorded. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>The ‘probe’ and ‘target’ sequences identified in this manner constituted the ‘inverted peptide pair’ of sequences (or INVPEPs) in the corresponding proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Then a new 5-mer ‘probe’ sequence was defined, once again for the first protein sequence in the dataset, by sliding along the sequence with respect to its previous position by one residue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the corresponding new ‘target’ sequence was generated and with the new ‘target’ sequence, once again INVPEPs and their corresponding protein pairs were identified from all proteins in the dataset as described above. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>This process was repeated until all 5-mer ‘probe’ sequences in all protein sequences in the dataset were examined in order to identify the INVPEPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>In the same manner, the INVPEPs of varying sequence length, i.e., 6-mer, 7-mer, and so on, up to the largest sequence (1045 amino acid residues) in the dataset was searched. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>The redundant INVPEPs corresponding to a same protein PDB pairs were excluded and only the largest INVPEP pair was retained to represent the INVPEPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The additional redundant INVPEPs that were identified when the ‘target’ was defined as ‘probe’ were excluded from the analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Also, sequences corresponding to palindromes and continuous single amino acid repeats identified in the process were excluded from further analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Likewise, INVPEPs present within other chains of the same protein were also analyzed in order to infer if they were within interacting distance (≤3.2 Å). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>The INVPEPs present in altogether different proteins were examined for the possibility of conducting ‘swap’ experiments via comparative protein modeling. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>The secondary structure conformations were obtained from the PDB website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org">http://www.rcsb.org</ext-link>) and were calculated according to the DSSP program [12] based on the hydrogen-bonding patterns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the secondary structure conformations for the individual amino acid residues corresponding to the INVPEPs were assigned as; H (alpha helix), E (beta-strand), B (beta-bridge), T (turn), G (3/10-helix) and S (bend). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>The secondary structure conformation for amino acid residue(s) corresponding to a ‘coil’ conformation was assigned ‘C’ and those with missing ATOM records in the PDB was assigned ‘-‘ as described in PSSARD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>The solvent accessibility values were derived according to the method described in [13] and obtained by executing the AREAIMOL program available in the CCP4 software program suite (version 6.4.0) [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The total number of residue neighborhood contacts for amino acid residues constituting the INVPEPs was evaluated using the NCONT program available in the CCP4 software suite [14] by defining a distance cut-off value ≤3.2 Å between interacting atoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The average solvent accessibility values and the total number of residue neighborhood contact for the INVPEPs were evaluated by writing our own computer programs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>In calculating the average solvent accessibility and the total number of residue neighborhood contacts, the environment of the INVPEP in the context of the entire protein complex including multiple chains was considered. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>The selection of potential INVPEPs as ‘candidates’ for designing the ‘swap’ experiments were identified based on a ‘similar structural environment’ criterion corresponding to the INVPEPs in the proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, we prepared a list of exclusive INVPEPs where the difference in solvent accessibility values in the corresponding protein pairs was ≤1 Å2 and where the difference in total number of residue neighborhood contacts was ≤2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate whether it would be possible to introduce ‘inverted’ peptides in proteins, we constructed three-dimensional models of the ‘artificial’ proteins using the comparative protein modeling program – MODELER [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>MODELER is a sophisticated computer program that constructs three-dimensional models of proteins by the satisfaction of spatial restraints. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>It uses the knowledge of the template structure and the alignment of the model sequence to the sequence of the template. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>We selected certain examples for modeling artificial proteins that represented INVPEPs in helix, strand and coil conformation in proteins of known three-dimensional structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>The models were constructed using the native protein structure as template. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>The sequence of the ‘artificial’ protein differs from the native protein only in the region corresponding to the inverted peptide in the sequence alignment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>The quality of the models was evaluated using the PROCHECK program [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>The method of 3-D profiles [17] was used to evaluate the compatibility of the ‘fold’ to sequence, particularly, in the region corresponding to the INVPEPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Inter-atomic clashes defined by a distance cut-off value ≤1 Å between the INVPEP atoms and between the INVPEP and rest of the protein atoms were examined by developing a computer program. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>All the four proteins (labeled protein 1) shown in Table 2 satisfy the above criterion. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>If the two proteins share ‘similar structural environment’ as described earlier, then assess the overall quality of the model and the ‘compatibility’ of the inverted peptide sequence to the fold. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Inverted peptides that do not result in ‘good’ quality models according to PROCHECK criterion or those that are incompatible to the protein fold according to the 3-D profile scores criterion must be avoided. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Further, inverted peptides that are directly involved in the protein molecular function must be avoided. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>The inverted peptides that satisfy these conditions may be selected as ‘potential’ candidate for the ‘swap’ and the ‘artificial’ proteins designed in this manner are likely to retain native-like protein folds. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>In our analysis, we observed that the INVPEPs in proteins are associated with the helix, strand, coil conformation or combination of these conformations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>Among these, the number of INVPEPs entirely associated with a helix, strand or coil conformation is shown in Table 3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>The INVPEPs in the helix conformation are predominant suggesting they are potential ‘swappable’ candidates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>This is confirmed in the examples that we modeled (shown in Table 2) and is in agreement with previous observations that helices are much more stable to inversion than other secondary structural elements [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>However, in the present study, we observed INVPEPs also in the ‘strand’ conformation suggesting that peptides in strand conformation may also be stable to inversion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Whereas, INVPEPs in ‘coil’ conformation are rare suggesting that swapping a peptide in ‘coil’ conformation in a protein with its equivalent inverted peptide may be avoided. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>We further observed by examining on the graphics that the individual native peptide sequences related as ‘inverted’ peptides and occurring in natural proteins were generally distantly located in the protein three-dimensional structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Further, a number of ‘overlapping’ INVPEPs were observed, for instance, INVPEPs in the triple-helical structures of the collagen peptide (PDB code: 3A0M, C-chain, between positions 16–27 and 15–26). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>In summary, in the present work, we have selected a high-quality representative dataset of proteins of known three-dimensional crystal structures available in the Protein Data Bank and catalogued all penta-peptide and large sequences that are observed as ‘inverted’ peptides in proteins. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>In particular, we have analyzed whether it would be possible to ‘swap’ peptides in proteins with their corresponding ‘inverted’ peptide sequences and evaluate whether the ‘artificial’ protein generated would retain the native-like protein fold. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>In order to test our hypothesis, we selected few protein pairs that are known to contain inverted peptides sequences relative to each other and characterized with a ‘similar structural environment’ defined by the difference in solvent accessibility and number of residue neighborhood contacts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>These protein pairs provide the test cases for evaluating whether ‘artificial’ proteins generated by swapping the relevant peptide with its inverted peptide sequence would fold as in the native proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>The proteins incorporating the inverted peptides were modeled using the MODELER software and validated for the satisfaction of model quality as well as the compatibility of the inverted sequence to the protein fold. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>The modeled proteins that satisfy these criteria suggested that it may be possible to design ‘artificial’ proteins by incorporating inverted peptide sequences that are expected to retain the native-like protein fold. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>This enabled us to suggest a protocol for designing inverted peptides in natural proteins. </plain></SENT>
