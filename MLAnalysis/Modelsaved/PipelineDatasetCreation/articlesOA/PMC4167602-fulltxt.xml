However, the virions of many viruses are complex and pleomorphic, making them difficult to analyse in detail. Here we address this by identifying and quantifying virion proteins with mass spectrometry, producing a complete and quantified model of the hundreds of viral and host-encoded proteins that make up the pleomorphic virions of influenza viruses. We show that a conserved influenza virion architecture is maintained across diverse combinations of virus and host. This &#8216;core&#8217; architecture, which includes substantial quantities of host proteins as well as the viral protein NS1, is elaborated with abundant host-dependent features. As a result, influenza virions produced by mammalian and avian hosts have distinct protein compositions. Finally we note that influenza virions share an underlying protein composition with exosomes, suggesting that influenza virions form by subverting microvesicle production.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>influenza virus</kwd><kwd>mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>host factors</kwd><kwd>tetraspanins</kwd><kwd>NS1</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Viruses, unlike other parasitic nucleic acids, can cause infected cells to produce virions. These extracellular structures allow copies of the viral genome to be transferred to new hosts, and their composition is therefore the primary determinant of the stability, transmissibility, tropism and immunogenicity of a virus. Virions are assembled from virally-encoded proteins and may also include proteins encoded by the host, particularly if the virion incorporates an envelope of host membrane. While some virions have a regular architecture whose structure can be clearly determined, many important viral pathogens have pleomorphic virions whose structure can only be determined with difficulty and through the combination of different techniques. In this study we have used mass spectrometry as an alternative approach for the detailed characterisation of pleomorphic virions.</p><p id="P5">Influenza viruses are serious clinical and veterinary pathogens which cause epithelial cells to produce enveloped, pleomorphic virions<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.

This allow us to establish a complete and quantified model for the protein composition of influenza virions. We show that the core architecture of spherical influenza virions is maintained across diverse combinations of viruses and hosts, but that it is elaborated with additional architectural features which depend on the host species. Host proteins, including those whose incorporation is species-dependent, make a substantial contribution to influenza virion architecture. Furthermore, the host-encoded proteins in influenza virions are strikingly similar to the protein profile of virion-sized microvesicles shed by uninfected cells, suggesting that the virus subverts cellular pathways normally used for microvesicle formation in order to produce enveloped virions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Label-free protein ratios determined from mass spectra</title><p id="P7">Mass spectrometry provides a large amount of information which can be used to estimate protein abundance. This can be conveniently performed by Spectral Index Normalized Quantitation (SINQ)<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, a method for label-free absolute protein quantitation of data from LC-MS/MS analysis which is available as part of the Central Proteomics Facilities Pipeline software<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, and which is based on the intensities of fragment ion spectra. The method considers the summed intensity of fragment ions assigned to each protein, weighted to correct for ambiguous protein assignments, sample complexity and the tendency of longer proteins to produce more peptides<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. By analysing mixtures of proteins of known concentration we determined that SINQ could simultaneously quantify the abundance of a large number of specific proteins in a mixture. As expected, the accuracy with which protein ratios were determined depended on both the proteins&#8217; abundance and the particular proteins being compared. However, we found that SINQ could determine most equimolar and 10-fold protein ratios to within four-fold of the correct value and that even over a 1000-fold difference in abundance it could correctly place ratios within 8-fold (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a-c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The composition of an influenza virion</title><p id="P8">We used SINQ to determine the ratio of viral proteins in virions produced by bovine epithelial (MDBK) cells infected with influenza A/WSN/33 virus (WSN). After two days of infection the cells&#8217; growth medium was harvested and subjected to low-speed centrifugation to remove cellular debris. Virions were then purified from the supernatant by ultracentrifugation through a sucrose gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). By comparing data collected in three separate biological repeats (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), we obtained reproducible estimates of viral protein abundance that varied over three orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). As in a previous study<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, we detected all nine of the recognised viral structural proteins, as well as the NS1 protein. We did not detect peptides unambiguously identifying the truncated proteins PB1-N40, PA-N155 or PA-N182, and we searched for, but did not detect, PB1-F2, PA-X, M3, M4, M42, NS3 and NSP/NEG8, which have been proposed or positively identified as viral gene products but which have not been shown to be structural proteins<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. In addition we identified over three hundred host-encoded proteins. No more than eight copies of the viral polymerase are thought to be incorporated per virion<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, and we reasoned that proteins found at less than a tenth of this abundance must be present at less than one copy per virion. We could reproducibly identify proteins even at abundances hundreds of times below this threshold, indicating that we had assessed the complete consistent protein composition of an influenza virion without the need for further fractionation of the sample.</p><p id="P9">Our estimates of protein abundance were in agreement with the limited data already available on influenza virion composition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). For example, we correctly determined an equimolar ratio for the subunits of the trimeric viral polymerase (PA, PB1 and PB2) despite their low abundance in the virion. Accurate comparisons could also be made between proteins of high and low abundance. The ratio of the polymerase to the highly-abundant nucleoprotein (NP; mean 66, s.d. 14), combined with estimates that each NP binds at least 24 nt of RNA<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> and that the complete influenza genome is bound to eight polymerase trimers<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>, suggests a minimum genome size of 12.7 kb (s.d. 2.6 kb); the actual size is 13.6 kb. Some caution is needed for glycoproteins and transmembrane proteins whose features suppress the efficiency of detection by mass spectrometry. However even for these problematic proteins we were able to make consistent measurements that were comparable to those in the literature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Data 1</xref>), allowing us for the first time to assess the abundance of all viral structural proteins simultaneously.</p><p id="P10">We were surprised by our consistent identification of NS1 in purified virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), as this protein had previously been thought to be non-structural. The protein was unambiguously identified by LC-MS/MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>), and could also be detected in purified virions using a panel of specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a-c</xref>). When we examined the behaviour of NS1-bearing material during ultracentrifugation we found that NS1 migrated through density gradients at the position of a visible band of virions. It co-migrated with the viral polymerase and with actin, one of the more abundant host proteins in virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>). In samples of lysed virions NS1 did not migrate with NP on glycerol gradients, suggesting it does not form stable associations with viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>), but in samples of unlysed virions it was at least as resistant to protease treatment as NP, suggesting that it is an internal component of the virion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2f-h</xref>). We therefore concluded that NS1 is found at low levels within influenza virions.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>A conserved architecture of viral proteins</title><p id="P11">We next compared viral proteins in virions shed by a selection of different hosts (mammalian epithelial tissue cultures and embryonated chicken eggs) infected with a selection of influenza viruses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). In clinical isolates a mixture of spherical and filamentous influenza virions is typically found, but most influenza viruses adapted to growth in tissue culture or in eggs form only spherical virions<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Filamentous influenza virions are highly diverse in their morphology and presumably have highly variable protein compositions as a result<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.

The same ratio was observed for orthologous proteins in virions of an influenza B virus (B/Bris), despite the differences in protein sequence and regulation of gene expression that have emerged since this genus diverged from the influenza A viruses<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. All virions clearly contained NS1; B/Bris also incorporates low levels of the NB protein, for which there is no influenza A virus ortholog (although as this is a glycosylated transmembrane protein we expect its abundance to be somewhat higher than estimated by SINQ<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>). Despite the lack of a fixed virion structure, we show that spherical influenza virions incorporate their viral proteins in a consistent ratio, an optimal architecture that has been maintained throughout the separate evolution of influenza A and B viruses.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Influenza virions contain abundant host proteins</title><p id="P13">Host proteins have been identified in influenza virions, but their abundance has not previously been assessed. While most of the host proteins we identified were present at very low abundance and could not have been consistently incorporated into virions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Data 2</xref>), several hundred proteins were abundant enough to be virion components (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Data 3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">5</xref>), and together they made a substantial contribution to virion structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). More than a dozen of these proteins were more abundant than the viral polymerase, including some proteins whose abundance appeared roughly equal to that of the viral NA protein. These include proteins such as tetraspanins which due to their substantial transmembrane domains are likely to be present in even higher abundance than our measurements suggest. Thus, purified virions contain a large number of host proteins at low abundance and a smaller set of host proteins that are major components of the virion.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Virion architecture is shaped by the host</title><p id="P14">In order to compare proteins between different hosts we matched them to their human orthologs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Data 6</xref>). Differences in protein abundance were observed between all samples analysed, presumably due to a combination of genuine variation between virions and variations in the efficiency of detection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Data 2</xref>). However, principal coordinates analysis captured the majority of the differences in log(abundance) in two axes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Visual inspection of this plot showed that proteins formed three clusters: proteins present only in virions from mammalian hosts (either bovine or canine epithelial tissue cultures), proteins present only in virions from avian hosts (embryonated chicken eggs), and proteins present in virions from any host. Each category contained proteins abundant enough to be consistent components of virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Thus, influenza virions have a consistent core architecture which includes proteins encoded by the host as well as by the virus, as well as a variable complement of proteins whose incorporation depends on whether the virion was constructed in a mammalian or avian host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Consistent with previous studies<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, all virions incorporated abundant ubiquitin, annexins, cytoskeletal proteins and glycolytic enzymes, as well as peptidyl-prolyl <italic>cis-trans</italic> isomerase A (also known as cyclophilin A), a restriction factor for influenza replication<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. We also detected abundant membrane proteins, small GTPases and other regulators of signalling (including several 14-3-3 isoforms) as part of the core architecture. Many of the mammalian-and avian-specific proteins also fell into these categories, suggesting that the same functional niches in the virion are being filled (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Data 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">5</xref>). Notably, the tetraspanin CD9 is among the most abundant of the mammalian-specific proteins; in egg-grown virions its place appears to be taken by similar amounts of uroplakin-1B (UPK1B), a member of a separate tetraspanin family. Other proteins are unique to one host type, for example the ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 was only detected virions grown in canine epithelial (MDCK) cells.

To examine the stringency of these methods, we purified virions from the media of WSN-infected bovine epithelial (MDBK) cells and performed parallel purifications on the media of mock-infected cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Using SDS-PAGE and silver staining we could detect abundant proteins in samples prepared from the media of infected cells but we could barely detect material purified from the media of mock-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Using LC-MS/MS we could detect proteins in both infected and mock-infected samples, though the diversity and abundance of proteins in the mock-infected samples were much less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). The conditions used to purify influenza virions were designed to exclude large fragments of cellular debris, and are very similar to procedures used to purify small extracellular microvesicles such as exosomes<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>-<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>.

This step greatly increased the stringency of purification - other than protein standards and common contaminants only two proteins were consistently found in the mock-infected sample, and these at very low levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a,c</xref>).</p><p id="P18">In the infected samples HAd also increased stringency and removed a portion of the host proteins, mainly those of low abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). These included common cytoplasmic proteins that are plausible contaminants. For example, 57 of the 61 ribosomal proteins identified in the infected samples were removed by HAd (a full list of the proteins detected is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Data 2</xref> and their correspondence with other experiments is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Data 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">4</xref>). HAd should not remove components of the virion, and consistent with this it did not affect the abundance of viral proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>; the mean abundance of NS1 was slightly reduced but not significantly so: p = 0.2, 2-tailed unpaired t-test). The detection of abundant host proteins after more stringent purification demonstrates that these too are components of the virion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a,c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Influenza virions and exosomes share architectural features</title><p id="P19">Almost all of the proteins found in the uninfected material are known markers of exosomes<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>, suggesting that this material did indeed consist of microvesicles. Although these microvesicles could be removed by HAd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a,c</xref>), this did not remove exosomal markers from purified virions. Indeed, the proteins detected in microvesicles are present in the same ratio in stringently-purified virions shed by the same cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>), and the greater quantity of material purified in virions allowed the detection of many additional exosomal proteins that we could not detect in the low-abundance mock-infected samples.

To address this we used mass spectrometry to gain detailed quantitative information about the protein composition of influenza virions, as well as that of the microvesicles shed by uninfected cells. The same approach could be used to characterise many other pleomorphic virions which, for similar reasons, are not amenable to high-resolution structural analysis. More generally, its ability to determine protein ratios in complex mixtures across a large dynamic range, without the need for labelling, could be used in the study of any protein-containing structure as long as it can be purified and concentrated.</p><p id="P21">Mass spectrometry allowed us to analyse the protein composition of influenza virions with a sensitivity far exceeding that of other approaches<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Furthermore, recent increases in instrument sensitivity meant that we could detect around ten times the number of host proteins previously identified in influenza virions by mass spectrometry<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. By measuring protein abundance we found that host proteins make a substantial contribution to the structure of influenza virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). We could also detect proteins whose abundance was orders of magnitude less than the viral polymerase, indicating that we have obtained the first complete description of the protein composition of influenza virions.</p><p id="P22">We were surprised to identify the viral NS1 protein as a consistent component of influenza virions. Previous reports that NS1 was non-structural are likely due to its low abundance, and possibly also to its position on polyacrylamide gels being obscured by CD9 and the highly abundant M1 protein, which have a similar electrophoretic mobility to the NS1 protein of some influenza strains<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. NS1 was not detected in a previous LC-MS/MS study<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> but comparison to our results suggests that previously NS1 was near the lower limit of instrument sensitivity. In the present study we were able to unambiguously detect NS1 even after stringent purification, and we concluded that it is a low-abundance component of influenza virions. As was previously the case for NS2 (now called NEP<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>), NS1 can no longer formally be considered non-structural. NS1 is a multifunctional protein<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>, and could potentially play a role in virion assembly or enhance infection when introduced into a new host cell. Alternatively, as NS1 is present at high levels in the cytoplasm of infected cells<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> it is possible that it is incorporated into virions merely as a passive bystander. It is clear that NS1 is not non-structural, but considering what is currently known about the protein we note that its primary role is as a Nucleic-acid-binding Suppressor of Immunity (NSI).</p><p id="P23">More generally, we identified a consistent underlying architecture for spherical virions of influenza A viruses and an evolutionarily diverged influenza B virus. This evolutionarily conserved architecture includes the viral proteins and a set of host proteins, some of which are highly enriched in virions. Other features of the virion are not fixed, with the greatest variation due to the host. Mammalian tissue cultures and embryonated chicken eggs incorporated distinct sets of proteins into virions, some of them in substantial amounts. In some cases different proteins were recruited from related families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>); for example among the tetraspanin superfamily mammalian cells incorporate large amounts of CD9 and smaller amounts of CD81 into virions, whereas eggs incorporate UPK-1B (normally, but not exclusively, found on urothelial cells<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>).</p><p id="P24">These differences demonstrate that influenza virions derived from different hosts cannot be assumed to be the same. As virions produced by different hosts have typically been treated as equivalent when studying influenza infections, the phenotypic effects of these differences have not yet been explored in detail. The influence of the host on virion formation has been observed in influenza viruses with mutations interfering with correct genome packaging, which suppress virion budding in canine epithelial (MDCK) cells but do not have the same effect in chicken eggs<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>. Additionally, a tetraspanin whose incorporation we show here to be specific to mammalian hosts has recently been shown to be involved in virion entry and budding<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>. Host-dependent features of virions are of clinical interest as egg-grown virions are used in the preparation of influenza vaccines, and although allergies to egg proteins are not in themselves a contraindication to the administration of influenza vaccines they do increase the need for precautions<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. Finally, host-specific differences suggest that virion composition may adapt when moving from avian to mammalian hosts, and hence that the structure of influenza virions may adapt during pandemic emergence.</p><p id="P25">Spherical influenza virions are a similar size to exosomes, membrane-bound structures which also transfer protein and RNA between cells<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. By comparing separately-purified exosomes and virions we show here that they also have a strikingly similar protein profile &#8211; by many measures, an influenza virion is simply an exosome that has been enriched with additional components. Similarities have been noted between exosomes and a number of other enveloped viruses<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, most notably HIV, for which the &#8216;Trojan exosome hypothesis&#8217; was proposed to explain virion budding as a subversion of cellular pathways for exosome biogenesis<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>. The correspondence between exosomes and influenza virions is not absolute: influenza uses its M2 protein for budding rather than the ESCRT machinery used by many, though not all, microvesicles<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>, and while exosomes bud into multivesicular bodies influenza virions bud from the apical plasma membrane<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. On the other hand, influenza is capable of redirecting membrane traffic, for example by translocating markers of autophagosomes to the plasma membrane<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup>, and segments of the viral genome accumulate on unidentified structures adjacent to the plasma membrane prior to virion assembly<sup><xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup>. The exosome-like features of influenza virions therefore cast light on the viral assembly process, suggesting that the virus commandeers elements of cellular pathways in order to construct the virions it needs to infect new hosts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S12"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Cells, antisera and viruses</title><p id="P26">Mammalian epithelial tissue cultures were maintained in a humidified indicator at 37 &#176;C and 5 % CO<sub>2</sub>.

We expected that a QExactive mass spectrometer would provide more accurate quantitation due its increased sensitivity and scan speed; to test the ability of SINQ to determine protein ratios when using this instrument we analysed UPS2 dynamic protein standards (Sigma), digested with trypsin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). UPS2 is a mixture of 48 proteins spanning 6 orders of magnitude of abundance; at the concentrations used we were able to detect 24 proteins over four orders of magnitude of abundance. Pairwise comparisons were made of protein abundances determined by SINQ (based on the intensity of fragment ion spectra), intensity-Based Absolute Quantitation (iBAQ; a computationally demanding method based on the intensity of peptide spectra, reported to provide relatively accurate estimates of abundance<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref></sup>), and Normalized Spectral Abundance Factor (NSAF; a less accurate but computationally less demanding method based on spectral counts<sup><xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup>). All three methods were effective when comparing proteins in relatively high equimolar amounts, with SINQ determining most ratios within two-fold of the correct value, and the other methods determining most ratios within four-fold. Accuracy of all methods diminished for proteins of lower abundance or when comparing proteins whose amounts differed by orders of magnitude, but SINQ and iBAQ were able to place most ratios with 8-fold of the correct value over a 1000-fold difference in abundance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). We decided to use SINQ for further studies.</p><p id="P36">To test the effectiveness of SINQ in complex mixtures we mixed digested protein standards with either a digest of purified virions or of a mock sample purified from the media of uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). The additional material was purified using HAd, resulting in a complex mixture of proteins in the virion-containing sample and very few detectable proteins in the mock sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). The most abundant protein standards were introduced at levels comparable to the viral polymerase subunits, which are low-abundance components of the virion. 10 standards were detected in the high-complexity (virion-containing) sample and 17 in the low-complexity (mock) sample, over three orders of magnitude of abundance. In both the high-complexity (infected) and low-complexity (uninfected) samples most equimolar and 10-fold ratios were determined within four-fold of the correct value.</p><p id="P37">Finally, to compare SINQ to an existing method of protein quantification we measured the relative abundance of the two most highly-expressed proteins in purified virions, NP and M1, by SINQ and by densitometry of protein bands separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). The NP/M1 ratios determined by the two methods are within 15% of each other. We also compared ratios of viral proteins determined by SINQ to previously published estimates made using a variety of methods<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. In general our estimates were consistent with previously published values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). The largest discrepancies between SINQ and other methods could be seen when comparing proteins of high and low abundance, which we attribute to the limited dynamic range of the gel electrophoresis and autoradiography methods used in these studies compared to LCMS/MS. Consistent with this, when the ratio of polymerase to NP was used to predict viral genome size (see Results for details) SINQ gave a much more accurate estimate than previous methods. We would expect glycosylation and transmembrane domains to reduce the efficiency of protein detection by LC-MS/MS. Consistent with this, SINQ appears to underestimate glycoprotein numbers by around 4-fold compared to other methods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). There is less data available on the abundance of the M2 ion channel, but estimates of M2 levels by SINQ were around 9-fold less than in a previous study. Allowing for these caveats we determined that SINQ was, within reasonable limits, an effective method for simultaneously quantifying a large number of specific proteins in purified virions across a wide range of abundance.</p><p id="P38">Estimates of abundance by SINQ are affected by the overall protein concentration of the sample. To control for this when comparing infected and uninfected samples, equal amounts of digested UPS2 dynamic protein standards were mixed with the digested samples immediately prior to LC-MS/MS. This was done for all HAd samples and for a replicate analysis of one of the non-HAd WSN samples. The protein standards included ubiquitin and peroxiredoxin 1, both of which were already present in virions and could not be used for calibration. The remaining protein standards were used to normalize total protein levels and were then excluded from further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="P39">Principal co-ordinates analysis was performed using the cmdscale function in R<sup><xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></sup>.

(<bold>c</bold>) Abundance of viral proteins in purified virions, calculated by SINQ and normalized by the mean level of M1. The total abundance of all host proteins detected is also shown. The mean and s.d. is shown of 3 separate experiments, performed either with or without a haemadsorption / elution step (HAd). (<bold>d</bold>) The NS1 sequence of WSN shaded to show peptides identified by LC-MS/MS (from 3 separate experiments, purified without HAd; 87 % coverage). (<bold>e</bold>) Virions were layered onto a 30 &#8211; 60 % sucrose gradient and subjected to ultracentrifugation. The gradient was then harvested in 15 fractions from the top; the fractions shown were analysed by 14% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting for the indicated proteins. The position of molecular weight markers is indicated in kDa; concentrated virions were visible as a band in the gradient between fractions 6 and 7 (line). (<bold>f</bold>) Abundance of viral proteins in virions of 6 different influenza A viruses and an influenza B virus, grown in a variety of hosts (bovine epithelial (MDBK) cells, canine epithelial (MDCK) cells, and embryonated chicken eggs; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> for details).

A threshold was set at one tenth the abundance of the least abundant polymerase subunit, and any protein of lower abundance was assigned this value. Proteins were matched to their human orthologs to allow comparisons between virions from different host species.

(<bold>c</bold>) The core and host-dependent features of influenza virions. The maximum copy number of proteins in virions is shown, calculated by assuming that an average virion incorporates no more than eight viral polymerases. Viral proteins are shown as red lines, and host proteins with a mean copy number greater than one are shown as bars. Host proteins are only shown if detected in all four combinations of virus and host with both mammalian hosts (green bars) and avian hosts (blue bars); the mean and s.d. is indicated. The core architecture of a spherical influenza virion consists of the viral proteins (red lines) and those host proteins found in all hosts (yellow background).
