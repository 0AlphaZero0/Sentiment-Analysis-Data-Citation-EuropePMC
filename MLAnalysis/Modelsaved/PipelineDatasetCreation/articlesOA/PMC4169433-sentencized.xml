</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Tyrosine, a common residue of receptor tyrosine kinases, is a critical phosphorylation target in signal transduction pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>It is also a precursor for the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitters dopamine and epinephrine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The regulation of neurotransmitters is in part regulated by the breakdown of tyrosine into its simple constituents acetic and fumaric acids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>A key step in the catabolism of tyrosine is the decyclization of homogentisic acid to 4-maleylacetoacetate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>This reaction is catalyzed by homogentisic acid dioxygenase (EC.1.13.11.5), a hepatic enzyme that when deficient results in the urinary excretion of large accumulated amounts of homogentisic acid and its deposition in various tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Alkaptonuria (AKU; OMIM #203500), a rare autosomal recessive disorder resulting from mutations in the homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (HGD) gene, has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>It is mainly characterized by the appearance of dark brown urine, which is derived from the oxidation of homogentisic acid into benzoquinones. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Deposition of benzoquinones in connective tissues results in the darkening of the sclera, ear cartilages, causing arthritis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Other manifestations include cardiac involvement, coronary artery calcification and kidney stones [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Currently, there is no effective treatment for this condition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>However, studies have shown that nitisinone could significantly reduce urinary homogentisic acid [2] by inhibiting 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxidase, the enzyme that produces homogentisic acid. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The HGD gene, located on chromosome 3 at hg19 coordinates 120,347,020–120,401,418, is expressed in the kidneys, liver, prostate, small intestine, colon and expresses a 1,715 nucleotide transcript that encodes 445 amino acids [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the human HGD gene have been identified among patients in more than 40 countries throughout the world [4], [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The majority of these mutations, which consist mostly of missense mutations, nonsense mutations, splice sites and small insertions/deletions tend to aggregate particularly in exons 6, 8, 10 and 13 [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In this communication, we describe a novel 649 bp deletion that encompasses exon 2 of the HGD gene in a Lebanese individual, reported to have alkaptonuria and Pompe’s disease. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>While initial attempts to uncover an HGD mutation resulted in three non-deleterious polymorphisms only, it is likely that this deletion escaped detection by the initial PCR strategy [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>In this study, the unveiling of the three regions of homozygosity are consistent with a third cousin consanguineous mating, suggesting the presence of a homozygous mutation in this autosomal recessive disorder. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>The uncovering of the 649 bp deletion encompassing all the 72 bp of exon 2 is the first example of a deletion that spans an entire exon in the HGD gene, in which over 150 point mutations and small insertions/deletions were previously identified [6], [9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Because the deletion encompasses the surrounding splice donor and acceptor sites and 272 bp of intron and 305 bp of intron 3, it would result in an in-frame deletion that links exons 1 and 3 without exon 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is conceivable that a mutant mRNA without exon 2 could be transcribed and spliced, resulting in a protein with full or limited functionality. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>If such a protein were to be synthesized, its enzymatic activity is likely to be compromised, as evidenced by the accumulation of homogentisic acid in the proband [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Modeling of the mutant HGD protein with the 649 bp deletion resulted in an alternate structure that lacked from the native protein [10] two β-pleated sheets and an interconnecting loop, both encoded by the deleted exon 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, substitution of the eight α-helical coils with nine novel ones was characteristic of the predicted mutant HGD structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, most β-pleated sheets and interconnecting loops remained similar to the native protein, suggesting that the major impact of the exon 2 deletion is on the α-helical coils. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>In addition, the catalytic site constituted of the glutamic acid and the two histidines at amino acids 341, 335 and 371 [10], respectively, appeared unaltered but are likely to be encapsulated within the mutant tertiary structure, thus failing to allow access of homogentisic acid to the catalytic site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Overall, deletion of exon 2 from the HGD protein predicts a significant conformational change in protein structure and a resulting severe AKU phenotype caused by abnormal HGD enzymatic activity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>It is worthwhile noting the absence of repetitive DNA elements flanking the deletion breakpoints. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>While it is known that recombination occurs between homologous sequences flanking a duplicated/deleted genomic segment [11], it does not appear to be the case for this 649 bp deletion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Thus, a clear mechanism for its emergence remains elusive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>The report of this novel mutation in the HGD gene suggests that it could have either recently arisen and did not spread throughout the region or that it may be common but mutation screening of the HGD gene in AKU has not yet been extensively carried out in this area. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>The identification of novel AKU mutations in Jordan [12] along with this novel 649 bp deletion suggests that AKU in the Middle East may have independent origins than in other parts of the world. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>Thus, screening for the 649 bp deletion and other mutations in nearby populations would shed further light on the emergence of HGD in this part of the world. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>An important consideration in this endeavor would be the analysis of haplotypes on which the 649 bp deletion lies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>The haplotype(s) on which this mutation resides may provide a valuable starting point to extend haplotype analysis of AKU in this region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>The genetic admixture of ethnic groups in Lebanon, most of whom originated from distant regions in the Middle East and North Africa, could facilitate this endeavor and shed light on the origins of AKU that dates back to 1500 B.C. as reported by the discovery of homogentisic acid in an ochronotic Egyptian mummy [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>In turn, these haplotypes will allow their integration into databases that will contribute to retracing ancient population migrations in the area. </plain></SENT>
