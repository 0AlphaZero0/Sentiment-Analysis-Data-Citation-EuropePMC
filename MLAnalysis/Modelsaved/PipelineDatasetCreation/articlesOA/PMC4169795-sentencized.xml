</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The reversible protein phosphorylation is a fundamental mechanism that modulates many cellular functions including regulating developmental events and perceiving environmental stimuli [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>During phosphorylation, protein kinases (PKs) mainly phosphorylate serine (Ser), threonine (Thr) and tyrosine (Tyr) residues, while protein phosphatases (PPs) can reverse this process by removing the phosphate group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Based on substrate specificities, PPs can be categorized into two groups: Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphatases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Recently, 1241 maize PK-encoding genes have been identified, with the data suggesting that maize PKs were implicated in diverse biological processes, such as developmental control and drought stress [2, 3].The development of a flowering plant both at the cellular and organismal level is a highly complex phenomenon. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In spite of the apparent autonomy, roots, leaves, and other structures perceive external signals and use different signaling mechanisms to respond. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Like functions of mammalian PP genes [4], plant PPs are expected to be the key components in signal transduction networks at distinct stages of plant development and in response to multiple abiotic signals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Specific inhibitor (okadaic acid and calyculin A) of Ser/Thr phosphatases PP1 and 2A-type protein phosphatase (PP2A) arrest root hair growth in a tiny range, and severely affect the shape of cells within the elongation zone and inhibit root growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In addition, PP2A was associated with controlling microtubules length [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>As reported in Arabidopsis, PLL4 and PLL5 (POL-like gene) regulate leaf development, but having no detectable functions within the meristem [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Flowering time is a major adaptive trait and an important selection criterion in plant breeding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Kim et al. [7] showed that a self-regulatory phytochrome kinase-phosphatase coupling is a key signaling component in the photoperiodic control of flowering in Arabidopsis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Plants as sessile organisms are constantly challenged by a wide range of abiotic stresses such as salinity, drought, and cold. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>However, stresses are not necessarily a problem for plants because they have used several strategies to avoid or reduce the possible damage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Drought limits plant growth and result in a drastic decline in the photosynthetic yield due to osmotic stress-imposed constraint. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In order to cope with drought stress, plants utilize various mechanisms, known as drought escape, drought avoidance and drought tolerance [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Previous study showed that Group A PP2Cs were negative regulators in ABA signaling pathway and acted as key regulators of desiccation tolerance in land plants [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Salinity is one of the most severe environmental factors that greatly impacts plant development and restricts crop production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, salt stress may cause water deficit, ion toxicity, nutrient imbalance, and oxidative stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, salinity tolerance is more likely to be a complex multigenic trait involving responses to cellular osmotic and ionic stresses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In Arabidopsis, over-expression of AtPP2CG1 increased salt tolerance, whereas its loss of function impaired salt tolerance [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Additionally, cold stress is another key environmental factor that limits the geographic distribution of plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Cold acclimation has been described as the process in which plants adjust their metabolism during cold treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In spite of the fact that maize is generally sensitive to low temperatures [11], the extent of cold sensitivity is different within the maize germplasm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The cold signal is initially perceived by plasma membrane with the help of specific Ca2+ channel proteins, membrane histidine kinases and some unknown sensors, which then activate the sophisticated cold-responsive signaling pathways in concert with plant hormone signaling, the circadian clock, and the developmental transition to flowering. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Two PP2Cs, ABI1 and AtPP2CA, which were reported as negative regulators in ABA signaling, exhibited differences in their tissue-specific expressions as well as in temporal induction in response to chilling [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>To improve the crop yields under abiotic stress conditions, it is crucial to understand the fundamental molecular mechanisms behind stress tolerance in plants. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>One hundred twelve and one hundred thirty-two candidate PP genes were identified in Arabidopsis and rice, respectively [13, 14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>In Arabidopsis, Group A PP2Cs, ABI1 and ABI2, are negative regulators of ABA signaling, whereas Group B are characterized to regulate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>POL-type phosphatases, members of Group C PP2C, are involved in flower development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Independently, another PP2C member, kinase-associated protein phosphatase (KAPP) is a singleton that regulates receptor-like kinases [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>PTPs are critical partners for tyrosine-specific kinases in regulating the tyrosine phosphorylation status of many proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Tyrosine phosphorylation plays a role in MAPK signaling cascades. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>In particular, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation is determined by the balanced activity of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and PTPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Moreover, previous study showed that tyrosine phosphorylation is involved in phytohormone responses [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Compared with plants, other genomes which lack tyrosine kinases also have very few PTPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Hence, identification of PTPs provides a stepping stone to better understanding of the functional significance of tyrosine phosphorylation in higher plants. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Although recent advances in higher plants, only a small portion of the members in this family have been found to be components of signaling pathway in maize. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>This include, ZmPP2Ca (ZmPP8), which is involved in the signal transduction in regulating response to drought stress [17]; ZmPP2C2 (ZmPP159), which plays a positive role in tobacco cold resistance [18]; ZmPP2C (ZmPP76), which is implicated in Arabidopsis stress signal transduction [19]; ZMPP2 (ZmPP138), which was selected as a candidate for the catalytic subunit of phospho-pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP) [20]; ZmRIP1 (ZmPP1), which acts as a chloroplast-to-nucleus signaling messenger, and is confirmed to function in maize redox signaling [21]; ZmPP1 (ZmPP65), whose function and regulation might be very similar to that of mammalian PPs [22]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>In the post-genome era, the whole-genome sequencing, together with the global transcriptome profiling, such as microarray and RNA-seq, offer the opportunity to identify diverse gene families and to unravel the functions of genes involved in processes such as developmental regulation, disease resistance and abiotic stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Maize is not only one of the most important food crops of the world, but also a model plant for study of the genetics in monocotyledons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>In this study, we identified the full complement of PP genes in maize genome for evolutionary and functional analyses, which would help crop breeders to develop improved varieties. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Compared with most other eukaryotes, plants have substantially higher gene duplication rates in the adaptive response to environmental stimuli [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Previous study revealed that maize genome underwent a whole-genome duplication event (WGD) that resulted in the presence of two sub-genomes and ~30% of genes retained copies in both sub-genomes [36]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>To clarify the probable relationship between ZmPP genes and potential gene duplication within the genome, we analyzed the occurrence of tandem duplication and large-scale segmental duplication during the evolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>In all, 15 (~9.4%) ZmPP genes were found to be tandem repeats with a maximum number of ten intervening spacer genes (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>These 15 ZmPP genes were represented in 9 distinct tandem duplicated gene clusters, with one cluster containing 3 tandem genes and the rest of clusters possessing 2 tandem genes. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Hence, it is speculated that tandem duplications have an indispensable role in the evolution of maize PP gene family. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Additionally, previous study showed that most plants were diploidized polyploids and retained numerous duplicated chromosomal blocks in their genomes, segmental duplication occurred most frequently in plants [37]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, all genes in segmental duplicated pairs were from the same classes. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our analyses suggested that large-scale segmental duplication appear to have prominently contributed to the current complexity of the maize PP family. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>It is consistent with the duplicative mechanism of PP gene family in rice [14].Table 1 The Ka/Ks ratios and estimated absolute dates for the duplication events between the duplicated ZmPP genes *Ka/Ks &lt; 1 means purifying selection. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Usually, Ka/Ks &gt; 1 means positive selection; Ka/Ks = 1 means neutral evolution; while Ka/Ks &lt; 1 means purifying selection [38, 39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Ka/Ks ratios of most duplicated pairs, regardless of whether they are orthologs and paralogs, were less than 1, subjecting to purifying selection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, there are 5 segmentally duplicated pairs suffered positive selection with Ka/Ks ratios greater than 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Among these duplicated pairs, the average Ka/Ks value of segmental duplication was very similar to those in tandem duplication (~0.4), indicating that most duplicated ZmPP genes are under strong purifying selection pressure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>The duplication events for the segmental duplicated genes were estimated to occur approximately 24 Mya, while that in tandem duplicated pairs were estimated to occur approximately 37 Mya, indicating that the segmental duplication events might occur before the emergence of tandem duplication events. </plain></SENT>
