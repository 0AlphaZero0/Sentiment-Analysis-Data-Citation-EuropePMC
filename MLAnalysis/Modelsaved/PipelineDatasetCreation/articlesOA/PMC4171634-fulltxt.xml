This study investigated the framework by which histone marks influence DNA methylation at a genome-wide level. Using RNAi in a pluripotent human embryonic carcinoma cell line we depleted essential components of the MLL/COMPASS, polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and PRC1 histone modifying complexes that establish, respectively, the post-translational modifications H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and H2AK119ub, and assayed the impact of the subsequent depletion of these marks on the DNA methylome. Absence of H2AK119ub resulted predominantly in hypomethylation across the genome. Depletion of H3K4me3 and, surprisingly, H3K27me3 caused CpG island hypermethylation at a subset of loci. Intriguingly, many promoters were co-regulated by all three histone marks, becoming hypermethylated with loss of H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 and hypomethylated with depletion of H2AK119ub, and many of these co-regulated loci were among those commonly targeted for aberrant hypermethylation in cancer. Taken together, our results elucidate novel roles for polycomb and MLL/COMPASS in regulating DNA methylation and define targets of this regulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>histone modification</kwd><kwd>histone methylation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cytosine methylation and histone post-translational modifications create a complex epigenetic system required for the regulation and maintenance of gene expression programs that specify cell state (i.e., pluripotent and differentiated cell states). Determining how CpG methylation and histone marks cooperate to instruct normal cell expression programs and how this cooperation breaks down in human disease is an important area only just beginning to be understood. Numerous histone modifications involved in transcriptional regulation have been identified [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Three such marks are monoubiquitination of histone H2A lysine 119 (H2AK119ub), histone H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), and H3K4me3. H2AK119ub and H3K27me3 are typically linked to transcriptional repression and are mediated by the Polycomb group (PcG) Repressive Complexes, PRC1 and PRC2, respectively. PcG proteins regulate gene expression programs for developmental processes such as ESC pluripotency, cell fate decisions, and tissue patterning [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and PcG binding and aberrant repression of tumor suppressor target genes facilitates cancer stem cell maintenance in many tumor types [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. H3K27me3 is established by the histone methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), but EZH2's catalytic activity is dependent on embryonic ectoderm development (EED) and suppressor of zeste 12 (SUZ12) [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. At some loci, PRC2 recruits PRC1 for ubiquitination of H2AK119, but PRC1 can function independently of PRC2 and H3K27me3 [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. PRC1 core components include RING1 &amp; RING2 (RNF2), the RING-finger domain protein BMI1, and the polyhomeotic homologs PHC1-3 [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; PRC1 ubiquitination of histone H2A is dependent on the E3-ubiquitin ligase subunit RING1B [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition to PRC1's ubiquitination activity, PRC1 complexes may include one of several chromobox homologs, including CBX4, which possesses SUMO E3 ligase activity [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Although sumoylation targets of CBX4 are limited, known substrates include the transcriptional repressor C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and BMI1 [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Sumoylation of CBX4 itself also facilitates binding of PRC1 to H3K27me3 [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. H3K4me3 is associated with active transcription and is written by the MLL/COMPASS group of SET-domain histone methyltransferases, whose activities depend on interactions with WDR5, RBBP5, and ASH2 [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Gene promoters occupied by H3K4me3 generally lack repressive PcG marks, except at bivalent promoters in stem cells in which H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 coexist and are believed to facilitate transcriptional plasticity during differentiation [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Normal vertebrate cells display distinct patterns of genome-wide CpG methylation. Most CpGs exhibit a &#8220;default&#8221; methylated state, except in CpG islands (CGI), which are CpG-dense regions [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Many gene promoters are associated with CGI, which under normal conditions typically remain hypomethylated. Promoter CGI methylation is an impediment to transcriptional activity, and aberrant DNA hypermethylation is a key mechanism for tumor suppressor gene silencing in cancer cells. CpG methylation is established by the DNA methyltransferases, DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B. DNMT3A and DNMT3B are <italic>de novo</italic> methyltransferases that establish new cytosine methylation patterns during cell fate specification [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. DNMT1 maintains DNA methylation fidelity by copying CpG methylation patterns to the nascent strand during DNA replication [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Evidence suggests a functional crosstalk between DNA methylation and histone marks. Establishment of new DNA methylation patterns by DNMTs are histone modification-dependent: CpG-rich promoters marked by H3K27me3 in normal cells recruit DNMTs to induce <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation in cancer cells [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and H3K4me3 inhibits DNMT3L binding to the histone H3 N-terminus, an interaction required for DNMT3A and DNMT3B activity [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Likewise, the presence of H3K4me3 is inversely correlated with DNA methylation at promoters of highly active genes [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Second, DNA methylation patterns provide feedback for histone modifing activities. EZH2 specifically binds and occupies unmethylated CGI [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and globally hypomethylated DNMT1&#8722;/&#8722; cells display dramatic redistribution of H3K27me3 and loss of PRC2 occupancy at normal PcG target genes [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Finally, alterations in histone modification patterns in cancer cells correspond with aberrant DNA methylation patterns. For instance, loci with bivalent H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 marks in pluripotent stem cells are prone to acquiring promoter hypermethylation in progenitor cells that become transformed [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Thus, histone modification occupancy and DNA methylation patterns are clearly interdependent; yet the mechanistic underpinnings of these relationships and whether they are direct or indirect remains unknown.</p><p>The goal of this study was to determine how histone modifications functionally interface with, or regulate, genome-wide CpG methylation patterns. We interrogated the functional impact of MLL/COMPASS, PRC1, and PRC2 complexes on the human DNA methylome as these three marks have the strongest associations with DNA methylation. Our results show that both MLL/COMPASS and PRC2 prevent DNA methylation, predominantly at CGI and promoters. PRC1 promotes DNA methylation at CGI and many of the same promoter targets regulated by MLL/COMPASS and PRC2. Overall, MLL/COMPASS and polycomb complexes epigenetically regulate loci susceptible to DNA hypermethylation in cancer cells, and the opposing activities of PRC1 and MLL/COMPASS and PRC2 likely serve to establish and/or maintain a chromatin environment that finely regulates both pro- and anti-DNA methylation recruitment signals at these epigenetically metastable loci. This study constitutes a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of the impact of MLL/COMPASS and PcG functions on DNA methylation and unveils an unexpected role for PRC2 in preventing CGI hypermethylation that may have important mechanistic implications for how abnormal DNA methylation patterns arise in tumors, especially those driven by mutations in epigenetic modifiers.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>MLL/COMPASS activity protects CpG islands and bivalent promoters from DNA hypermethylation</title><p>To study the impact of MLL/COMPASS on DNA methylation, we targeted WDR5, a component essential for all MLL/COMPASS complexes to bind the histone H3 N-terminal tail [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], for siRNA-mediated depletion using the human embryonic carcinoma cell line (ECC) NCCIT as a model system. NCCIT is a nonseminomatous germ cell-derived teratoma that exhibits characteristics of pluripotent cells, in that it can be induced to differentiate into embryonic germ layers, and the NCCIT transcriptome resembles that of human embryonic stem cells (ESC) [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Depletion of H3K4 methylation has previously been shown to increase total genomic cytosine methylation levels using <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> as a model system [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], but the existence of a direct link between H3K4me and DNA methylation in the human genome remains unknown. We therefore asked whether depletion of H3K4me3 by siRNA against WDR5 (siWDR5) would result in DNA hypermethylation, if indeed these two epigenetic marks are functionally interrelated. A non-targeting control siRNA (siNTC) was used for comparison. Transfection with siWDR5 generated ~70% depletion of the target mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) and &gt;95% depletion of the target protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Depletion of WDR5 eliminated H3K4me3, and reduced H3K4me2 dramatically (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Total H3K4me1 was unaffected by WDR5 depletion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Treatment with siWDR5 had little impact on expression of DNMTs or pluripotency factors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Validation of the approach for H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H2AK119ub, and CBX4 depletions</title><p>(A) Gene expression measured by QRT-PCR normalized to GAPDH and relative to siNTC for each targeted siRNA depletion.

Scatterplots of methylation levels for all identified peaks revealed both hypo- and hypermethylation of many loci with low basal levels of methylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, blue arrows), but loci with moderate to high levels of methylation tended to become hypermethylated (in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> note the &#8220;clearing&#8221; marked by the green arrow, and the increased methylation marked by the red arrow). 5mC tag density plots across gene bodies revealed an overall hypomethylation effect on the genome resulting from WDR5 depletion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Thus, hypermethylation observed in the scatterplots must affect either a subset of genes/features or intergenic regions. Indeed, after counting genes with differentially methylated peaks, more than 10,000 genes showed hypomethylation in gene bodies, but a large proportion of gene promoters were hypermethylated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). CGI showed robust hypermethylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Nearly 10% of promoter CGI were hypermethylated and 36% of intragenic CGI were hypermethylated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D,E</xref>). In contrast to CGI, CGI shores became mostly hypomethylated upon siWDR5-depletion, and CGI shores in promoters or gene bodies were equally impacted (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Since inhibition of WDR5 impacts H3K4me3, we examined the relationship between hypermethylated promoters in siWDR5-treated cells and promoters marked with H3K4me3 determined by previously published NCCIT H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Only a subset of siWDR5 hypermethylated promoters had H3K4me3 (883 out of 2184) prior to WDR5 knockdown. Of these hypermethylation events, 77% (24% greater than expected) occurred at bivalent H3K4me3+H3K27me3 loci, but H3K4me3 monovalent promoters were underrepresented among hypermethylated H3K4me3-marked promoters in siWDR5 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). Bivalent promoters impacted by DNA hypermethylation in WDR5-depleted cells included genes with functions involved in cell-cell signaling, G-protein signaling, neuronal fate, and synaptic transmission (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>), and included genes such as those encoding the transmembrane protein <italic>TSPAN2</italic>, the oncogene <italic>MAZ</italic>, and the tumor suppressor gene <italic>EIF4E3</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H</xref>). We sought to further independently confirm our novel findings related to siWDR5-induced DNA hypermethylation, therefore we applied siNTC and siWDR5 DNA to the Infinium 450k array, which interrogates methylation at single CpG resolution using bisulfite conversion at sites spread throughout the genome [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Results from this experiment demonstrate that CGI hypermethylation in siWDR5 detected by the Infinium 450k array is a significant subset of that detected by 5mC-seq. Furthermore, the 5mC-seq observation for siWDR5 in which hypomethylation is predominantly observed at non-CGI loci and hypermethylation is observed at CGI is supported by the Infinium 450k results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 1</xref>). Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) coupled to qPCR was also used as validation of the 5mC-seq results, and further confirms several WDR5 depletion-induced DNA methylation changes predicted by the 5mC-seq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig 2</xref>). Loci that lost DNA methylation upon WDR5 depletion tended not to be enriched for H3K4me3, but rather were more linked to the presence of H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig 3A</xref>). In summary, the presence of H3K4 methylation inhibits DNA methylation specifically at promoters and CGI, and this inhibitory function is strongest at bivalent promoters compared to monovalent H3K4me3 promoters. Hypomethylation upon WDR5 knockdown may result from redistribution of the DNA methylation machinery from repressed PcG-marked loci to regions previously protected by H3K4me3. These data therefore demonstrate an active role for H3K4me3 in restricting DNA methylation within certain regions of the genome.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Disruption of MLL/COMPASS complex and H3K4 methylation induces DNA hypermethylation at CGI and bivalent promoters</title><p>(A) Scatterplots for peaks of 5mC called by SICER [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] in siWDR5 treated cells.

SiRNA against EED was used to inhibit PRC2 activity, RNF2 siRNA was used to target the ubiquitination activity of PRC1, and CBX4 was targeted by siRNA to elucidate the impact of its sumoylation activity (or other possible functions like DNMT interaction [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]) on DNA methylation. Each siRNA treatment yielded 55-75% reduction of the targeted mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). SiRNA treatments were assessed for their impact on changes in DNMT expression, which remained relatively stable (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Pluripotency markers were also unaffected, except for SOX2 expression, which was reduced by half in siCBX4 treated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Treatment of NCCIT cells with siEED nearly eliminated H3K27me3, H3K27me2 was partially depleted, and H3K27me1 was unaffected relative to the siNTC control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). SiRNF2 treatment reduced H2AK119ub by more than 80% and siCBX4 successfully reduced both its mRNA and protein level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Following 5mC-seq analysis of each of these siKDs, we observed that CBX4 depletion caused an overall trend toward hypermethylation throughout the genome (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>,i, blue arrows), which was readily apparent across gene bodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). The exception to this overall siCBX4-induced DNA hypermethylation trend occurred at high CpG-density promoters (HCP), CGI, and CGI shores, which lost DNA methylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A-C</xref>). Treatment with siEED resulted predominantly in hypomethylation of loci with low to moderate basal levels of methylation (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>,ii, blue arrows) but caused hypermethylation at a subset of loci. On average, gene bodies and promoters with low CpG density were hypomethylated under these conditions, but CGI and a subset of high CpG density promoters were targeted for DNA hypermethylation in siEED-cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A-C</xref>). Reduction of RNF2 or a combination of EED and RNF2 resulted in widespread hypomethylation throughout the genome, including gene bodies and CGI (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,B</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A-C</xref>). The result that dual siEED+siRNF2 depletion was similar to siRNF2 single depletion suggests that RNF2 depletion suppresses the hypermethylation effect of EED depletion. Across all siRNA depletion samples (CBX4, EED, RNF2, and EED+RNF2), CGI within gene bodies experienced the highest proportion of hypo- and hypermethylation events compared with promoter CGI and CGI located to the 3'end of genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D,E</xref>). In summary, CBX4 functions to limit DNA methylation levels while EED and RNF2 generally promote DNA methylation, except at CGI where CBX4 promotes DNA methylation and EED (and by inference H3K27me3) promotes a hypomethylated state.</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Differential DNA methylation in polycomb complex function-depleted cells</title><p>(A) Scatterplots for peaks of 5mC called by SICER [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].

Hypomethylation in siRNF2 and in siEED+RNF2 treated cells was more likely to occur at loci with both PRC1 and PRC2 marks (H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub) and less likely to occur at loci marked with only H2AK119ub (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>).

Thus, H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub together create a chromatin landscape predisposed, or permissive, to DNA methylation changes, where depletion of RNF2 is sufficient for DNA hypomethylation and depletion of EED function permits DNA hypermethylation (albeit only in the presence of functional RNF2).</p><fig id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Selective epigenetic co-regulation of DNA methylation at target genes by PcG complexes</title><p>(A) Graph illustrates the frequency and number of promoters marked exclusively with H3K27me3, marked exclusively with H2AK119ub, or marked with both H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub.

Hierarchical clustering revealed several subsets of promoters targeted for DNA hypo- and hypermethylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Four clusters stand out among the differentially methylated promoters. First is a cluster of promoters that are hypermethylated in two or more of siEED, siCBX4, or siWDR5 depletions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>,i); these genes are enriched for processes involved in cell-cell signaling and glycosylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 3C,i</xref>). Second is a large set of promoters exclusively hypermethylated by siCBX4 treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>,ii), which are involved in neuromuscular biology and post-embryonic development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 3C,ii</xref>). A third set of promoters become hypomethylated in both siEED and siWDR5 depletions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>,iii), and these are characterized by genes involved in chromosome condensation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 3C,iii</xref>). Last is an intriguing subset of promoters hypomethylated in siCBX4 and/or siRNF2 treatments but hypermethylated in siEED and/or siWDR5 treatments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>,iv). This last set of genes is representative of processes such as germ cell and reproductive development and meiosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 3C</xref>, iv). In general, promoter hypomethylation induced by either siCBX4 or siRNF2 treatment was strongly associated with hypermethylation induced by siEED or siWDR5, suggesting co-regulation of DNA methylation by PcG and MLL/COMPASS complexes at a common set of target promoters (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Furthermore, a significant proportion of hypomethylated promoters in siRNF2-treated cells were either hypo- or hypermethylated under EED siRNA depleted conditions suggesting functional co-targeting by PRC1 and PRC2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Co-regulated genes included N-acetyltransferase 14 (<italic>NAT14</italic>) and T-cell leukemia homeobox 2 (<italic>TLX2</italic>), which were hypermethylated by loss of WDR5 or EED, but hypomethylated under conditions of CBX4 or RNF2 depletion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). Thus overall, polycomb repressive and MLL/COMPASS complexes co-regulate the epigenetic landscape of a common set of target genes, where EED and WDR5 prevent DNA hypermethylation and RNF2 and CBX4 promote DNA methylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2_4"><title>Select polycomb complex-repressed genes experience promoter hypomethylation and gene activation upon PcG depletion</title><p>Microarray expression analysis was performed for all siRNA depletion conditions to assess the impact of MLL/COMPASS and PRC1/PRC2 perturbations on gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 4A</xref>). All siRNA knockdown conditions resulted in both gene activation and repression events. EED or RNF2 depletion resulted in more gene activation than repression, consistent with their established PcG repressive functions, while dual EED + RNF2 depletion yielded similar numbers of activated and repressed genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 4A</xref>). Interestingly, a large proportion of targets in the individual siEED or siRNF2 knockdowns overlapped, but a large, unique set of target genes were silenced upon dual EED + RNF2 knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 4B</xref>). CBX4 and WDR5 depletion resulted in more transcriptional repression than activation events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 4A</xref>). To determine whether transcriptional changes were connected to DNA methylation changes, we compared the transcriptionally regulated and epigenetically regulated targets within each siRNA knockdown. Overall, expression changes did not correlate significantly (positively or negatively) with DNA hypo- or hypermethylation events (data not shown), but of genes that became activated under siEED or siRNF2 depletion conditions, a large proportion experienced promoter hypomethylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 4C</xref>). Activated genes with hypomethylated promoters under siEED or siRNF2 depletion conditions were enriched for functions involved in epidermis development, kinase activation, and cell growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 4D</xref>). Thus, many developmental genes that are targeted by PcG and MLL/COMPASS are regulated independently of DNA methylation, but a subset of target genes are epigenetically co-regulated via DNA methylation, which we suspect provides more rigid and stable epigenetic control in the context of PcG and MLL/COMPASS regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2_5"><title>PRC2 and MLL/COMPASS complexes inhibit DNA methylation at genes commonly targeted for hypermethylation in cancer</title><p>Given that bivalent H3K4me3 and H3K27me3-marked promoters are prone to acquiring aberrant DNA hypermethylation during cellular transformation [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], coupled with our finding that PRC2 and MLL/COMPASS function to restrict DNA methylation, particularly at CGI, we asked whether loci commonly hypermethylated in cancer cells are disproportionately hypermethylated in our MLL/COMPASS- and PRC1/PRC2-depleted cells. A set of 1009 genes have been identified as commonly hypermethylated across a wide spectrum of human cancers [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These cancer hypermethylated genes were compared to those that sustain promoter DNA hypo- and hypermethylation changes in our siRNA knockdown conditions. Promoters that become hypermethylated by depletion of EED or WDR5 were more than twice as likely to be represented among genes hypermethylated in cancer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>).

These connections were present when comparing all promoters or just promoters containing CGI (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Breakdown of the commonly hypermethylated in cancer gene set by the tumor types from which it was generated (breast, colorectal, prostate, lung, brain (glioblastoma), ovarian, and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)) revealed similar associations with breast, prostate, lung, and AML tumor types (albeit with reduced significance due to smaller numbers of genes in each list) but not colorectal, glioblastoma, or ovarian tumors (data not shown).

In summary, MLL/COMPASS and PRC2 promote a hypomethylated state, particularly focused on promoters and CGI, while PRC1 promotes DNA hypermethylation; promoters where this interplay occurs are susceptible to aberrant DNA hypermethylation in human cancers.</p><fig id="F6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Promoters that are hypermethylated by depletion of WDR5 or EED are commonly hypermethylation in cancer</title><p>(A) Genes with hypomethylated and hypermethylated promoters, or (B) CGI-containing promoters only after siRNA depletions were compared to genes previously identified as being commonly susceptible to hypermethylation in human cancers (n=1009; [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]).

This study comprised the first systemic investigation into the genome-wide function of MLL/COMPASS, PRC2, and PRC1 complexes in limiting or promoting DNA methylation in human cells. MLL/COMPASS and PRC2 predominantly opposed DNA methylation at CGI and promoters. RNF2's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in PRC1 promotes methylation, but PRC1's CBX4 subunit has dual roles in promoting methylation (at CGI) and restricting methylation (across most gene regions). Importantly, loci most impacted by both DNA hypermethylation (in EED or WDR5 depletions) and hypomethylation (in CBX4 and RNF2 depletions) overlapped extensively among the knockdowns indicating multi-layered epigenetic co-regulation, and these loci were strongly susceptible to aberrant hypermethylation in cancer. Whether MLL/COMPASS and the PcG complexes have a similar impact on the methylome of other cell types as they do in NCCIT EC cells represents an interesting topic for future studies, however our finding that many of the same genes affected in the NCCIT cell model system are also affected in primary human tumors, suggests that our results have broader applicability.</p><p>Since DNA methylation is correlated with the absence of H3K4 methylation, and since methylation of the K4 residue impairs DNMT3L interaction with chromatin (an interaction that facilitates DNMT3A and DNMT3B enzymatic activity) [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], we anticipated that H3K4me3 would prevent DNA methylation throughout the genome. Our results show that, indeed, H3K4me3 prevents hypermethylation at CGI and bivalent promoters; however perturbation of MLL/COMPASS did not result in considerable hypermethylation at other loci. This may be due to the default methylated state of CpGs outside of CGI or the presence of the CpG-binding CXXC domain within the MLL1 protein and within the H3K4 methyltransferase SET1 interacting partner CFP1, which targets the MLL/COMPASS complex primarily to unmethylated CGI [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Hypomethylation events under MLL/COMPASS-depletion conditions may stem from global redistribution of DNMTs upon loss of H3K4me3 protected zones. Indeed, precedence for global redistribution of one epigenetic mark upon depletion of another exists [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>The gene repressive functions of PRC1 and PRC2 during embryonic development have been known for decades [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], but their enzymatic activities have only just begun to be elucidated, and the mechanisms by which they mediate repression remain vague. PRC2 has long been thought to mediate repression through recruitment of DNMTs [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but this function may apply to a subset of loci, since only a small proportion of activated genes were hypomethylated under PRC2 depletion conditions. More recently, the CXXC-domain-containing catalytic subunit of PRC2, EZH2, was shown to bind preferentially to hypomethylated CGI [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and peaks of H3K27me3 occupancy have been associated with transcriptional activity [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Our novel finding that functional perturbation of PRC2 leads to DNA hypermethylation (in addition to hypomethylation events) at a subset of genes and that this hypermethylation is significantly associated with loci that become hypermethylated in the cancer state, sheds important light on the multi-faceted roles of PRC2. As evidenced by our data, PRC2 impacts DNA methylation in both directions&#8212;hypo- and hypermethylation&#8212;but the hypermethylation effect, which predominated at CGI and promoters, was unexpected because previous studies of dominant-negative H3.3 K27M mutant glioblastomas, which have an extensive global loss of H3K27me3, reported only a DNA hypomethylation impact on the genome [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>We show that PRC2's role (and by inference H3K27me3's role) in repressing DNA methylation preferentially occurs at loci with both H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub marks, indicating that chromatin configuration impacts PRC2 regulation of DNA methylation. We propose a model wherein H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub may function either separately (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>) or together (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>) in regulating DNA methylation. Two independent sets of loci were found to be hypomethylated with either H3K27me3 depletion or with H2AK119ub depletion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>), and we suspect PcG marks are functioning independently of one another to promote CpG methylation at these loci. Depletion of the predominant mark is sufficient for loss of CpG methylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). On the other hand, at loci where hypermethylation occurs in the absence of H3K27me3 but hypomethylation occurs with depletion of H2AK119ub, we propose a separate scenario that is supported by the canonical model for PRC1/H2AK119ub recruitment via localization of PRC2/H3K27me3 [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). Deposition of both DNA methylation-preventing H3K27me3 and DNA methylation-promoting H2AK119ub at a given locus generates a balanced, but metastable epigenetic signature&#8212;a state of transcriptional plasticity that is more easily modulated during development or in response to fluctuating environmental stimuli (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). If H2AK119ub is removed at these loci, H3K27me3 protects the region from CpG methylation resulting in a hypomethylated state (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>,i). In the event of H3K27me3 loss (during normal development or aberrantly during malignant transformation), PRC1 (and by inference, H2AK119ub) promotes deposition of DNA methylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>,ii). Our finding that dual depletion of EED and RNF2 exhibits the same DNA hypomethylation phenotype as that of RNF2 single knockdown suggests that PRC2 promotes this balanced epigenetic signature by inhibiting PRC1's role in promoting DNA methylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>,iii). Given that loci with dual H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub marks are most impacted by DNA methylation changes in our PRC1 or PRC2 function-depleted cells, we suspect that this canonical method of PRC1 recruitment via PRC2 may be an important mechanism for establishing the precise PRC2 &#8211; PRC1 control over DNA methylation deposition. Evidence that RNF2/H2AK119ub promotes methylation at many of the same promoters protected from hypermethylation by PRC2/H3K27me3 evokes a model for why select loci become hypermethylated, while the remainder of the genome undergoes hypomethylation in tumors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><fig id="F7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Model for how H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub epigenetic signatures modulate DNA methylation patterns</title><p>(A) Two distinct subsets of genes were hypomethylated in the single siEED or siRNF2 knockdown conditions. We propose that these are loci in which PRC1 and PRC2 function independently of one another to influence DNA methylation. In the absence of PRC1 or PRC2, these loci become hypomethylated. (B) At another subset of genes, PRC2 and PRC1 act in concert to create a metastable epigenetic state. At these loci, H3K27me3 recruits PRC1 to deposit H2AK119ub. Together these marks establish opposing influences on DNA methylation: H2AK119ub promotes DNA methylation, presumably via DNMT recruitment, but H3K27me3 inhibits DNMT recruitment. With depletion of H2AK119ub, low levels of DNA methylation/DNMT recruitment are lost (i). If H3K27me3 is depleted at previously H3K27me3-marked loci, H2AK119ub remains unrestrained and promotes enrichment of DNA methylation (ii). In the event that both H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub are depleted, recruitment of DNMTs is reduced or lost.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="oncotarget-05-6338-g007"/></fig><p>The herein identified roles of PRC2 and MLL/COMPASS in repressing DNA methylation deposition may represent key mechanisms in preventing the aberrant DNA hypermethylation events that typify human cancer given that PRC2- and MLL/COMPASS-protected loci are frequently hypermethylated in tumor cells. Future studies that determine whether this novel PRC2 regulatory function causes DNA hypermethylation in cancers with mutations that deplete genomic H3K27me3, such as H3.3 K27M mutant glioblastomas or myeloid leukemias and lymphomas with EZH2 loss of function mutations, are clearly warranted. For such tumors, aberrant DNA methylation may represent a major or early mechanism driving cancer development and these tumors might be particularly good candidates for emerging epigenetic therapies. For cancers lacking identifiable mutations in direct regulators of H3K27me3 (i.e., cancers with EZH2 gain or loss of function or H3.3 K27M mutations), H3K27me3-patterning mechanisms might be responsible for driving aberrant DNA hypermethylation and directly or indirectly tumor initiation or promotion. Genes or pathways that stabilize or maintain H3K27me3 during cell replication therefore represent novel tumor suppressor genes that might act to restrict cancer development by inhibiting aberrant DNA hypermethylation of PRC2-regulated loci.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Cell culture, siRNA transfections, and extractions</title><p>NCCIT cells (from ATCC) were grown in McCoy's 5A medium as described [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

To the remainder of the sample, 1 &#956;g of mouse monoclonal 5mC antibody (Diagenode, clone 33D3; catalog # C15200081-100) was added and incubated with rotation for three hours at 4&#176;C. Three microliters of bridging antibody (Active Motif, catalog #53017) and 20 &#956;l of pre-washed protein-G agarose beads were added, and rotated at 4&#176;C overnight. The beads were washed three times with MeDIP buffer and two times with TE buffer, and the specifically bound DNA fragments were eluted twice with 50 &#956;l of elution buffer at 65&#176;C for 10 minutes. After purification with the MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen, catalog # 28004), the immunoprecipitated DNA and the input were used as templates for real-time qPCR for quantifying enrichment of specific loci defined in the 5mC-seq assays using the primers listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Table 1</xref>. The qPCR was performed with SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, catalog # 172-5274) using a C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler (with CFX96 real time system). PCR conditions were as follows: 95&#176;C for 30 s; 95&#176;C 5 s followed by 60&#176;C 20 s for 40 cycles. Enrichment of methylation was calculated based on the formula: enrichment relative to input=2^-(sample aver Ct-Input aver Ct).</p></sec><sec id="s4_6"><title>Gene ontology analysis and statistical methods for data set comparisons</title><p>Ontology analysis was performed using the functional annotation tool within the DAVID bioinformatics database [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].
