</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cytosine methylation and histone post-translational modifications create a complex epigenetic system required for the regulation and maintenance of gene expression programs that specify cell state (i.e., pluripotent and differentiated cell states). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Determining how CpG methylation and histone marks cooperate to instruct normal cell expression programs and how this cooperation breaks down in human disease is an important area only just beginning to be understood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Numerous histone modifications involved in transcriptional regulation have been identified [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three such marks are monoubiquitination of histone H2A lysine 119 (H2AK119ub), histone H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), and H3K4me3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>H2AK119ub and H3K27me3 are typically linked to transcriptional repression and are mediated by the Polycomb group (PcG) Repressive Complexes, PRC1 and PRC2, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>PcG proteins regulate gene expression programs for developmental processes such as ESC pluripotency, cell fate decisions, and tissue patterning [2], and PcG binding and aberrant repression of tumor suppressor target genes facilitates cancer stem cell maintenance in many tumor types [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>H3K27me3 is established by the histone methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), but EZH2's catalytic activity is dependent on embryonic ectoderm development (EED) and suppressor of zeste 12 (SUZ12) [4, 5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>At some loci, PRC2 recruits PRC1 for ubiquitination of H2AK119, but PRC1 can function independently of PRC2 and H3K27me3 [6, 7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>PRC1 core components include RING1 &amp; RING2 (RNF2), the RING-finger domain protein BMI1, and the polyhomeotic homologs PHC1-3 [8]; PRC1 ubiquitination of histone H2A is dependent on the E3-ubiquitin ligase subunit RING1B [6, 8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In addition to PRC1's ubiquitination activity, PRC1 complexes may include one of several chromobox homologs, including CBX4, which possesses SUMO E3 ligase activity [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Although sumoylation targets of CBX4 are limited, known substrates include the transcriptional repressor C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) [9], DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) [10], and BMI1 [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Sumoylation of CBX4 itself also facilitates binding of PRC1 to H3K27me3 [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>H3K4me3 is associated with active transcription and is written by the MLL/COMPASS group of SET-domain histone methyltransferases, whose activities depend on interactions with WDR5, RBBP5, and ASH2 [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Gene promoters occupied by H3K4me3 generally lack repressive PcG marks, except at bivalent promoters in stem cells in which H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 coexist and are believed to facilitate transcriptional plasticity during differentiation [14]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Normal vertebrate cells display distinct patterns of genome-wide CpG methylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Most CpGs exhibit a “default” methylated state, except in CpG islands (CGI), which are CpG-dense regions [15-17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Many gene promoters are associated with CGI, which under normal conditions typically remain hypomethylated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Promoter CGI methylation is an impediment to transcriptional activity, and aberrant DNA hypermethylation is a key mechanism for tumor suppressor gene silencing in cancer cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>CpG methylation is established by the DNA methyltransferases, DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>DNMT3A and DNMT3B are de novo methyltransferases that establish new cytosine methylation patterns during cell fate specification [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>DNMT1 maintains DNA methylation fidelity by copying CpG methylation patterns to the nascent strand during DNA replication [19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Evidence suggests a functional crosstalk between DNA methylation and histone marks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Establishment of new DNA methylation patterns by DNMTs are histone modification-dependent: CpG-rich promoters marked by H3K27me3 in normal cells recruit DNMTs to induce de novo DNA methylation in cancer cells [20, 21], and H3K4me3 inhibits DNMT3L binding to the histone H3 N-terminus, an interaction required for DNMT3A and DNMT3B activity [22, 23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Likewise, the presence of H3K4me3 is inversely correlated with DNA methylation at promoters of highly active genes [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Second, DNA methylation patterns provide feedback for histone modifing activities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>EZH2 specifically binds and occupies unmethylated CGI [24], and globally hypomethylated DNMT1−/− cells display dramatic redistribution of H3K27me3 and loss of PRC2 occupancy at normal PcG target genes [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Finally, alterations in histone modification patterns in cancer cells correspond with aberrant DNA methylation patterns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>For instance, loci with bivalent H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 marks in pluripotent stem cells are prone to acquiring promoter hypermethylation in progenitor cells that become transformed [14, 26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Thus, histone modification occupancy and DNA methylation patterns are clearly interdependent; yet the mechanistic underpinnings of these relationships and whether they are direct or indirect remains unknown. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to determine how histone modifications functionally interface with, or regulate, genome-wide CpG methylation patterns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>We interrogated the functional impact of MLL/COMPASS, PRC1, and PRC2 complexes on the human DNA methylome as these three marks have the strongest associations with DNA methylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Our results show that both MLL/COMPASS and PRC2 prevent DNA methylation, predominantly at CGI and promoters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>PRC1 promotes DNA methylation at CGI and many of the same promoter targets regulated by MLL/COMPASS and PRC2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Overall, MLL/COMPASS and polycomb complexes epigenetically regulate loci susceptible to DNA hypermethylation in cancer cells, and the opposing activities of PRC1 and MLL/COMPASS and PRC2 likely serve to establish and/or maintain a chromatin environment that finely regulates both pro- and anti-DNA methylation recruitment signals at these epigenetically metastable loci. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>This study constitutes a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of the impact of MLL/COMPASS and PcG functions on DNA methylation and unveils an unexpected role for PRC2 in preventing CGI hypermethylation that may have important mechanistic implications for how abnormal DNA methylation patterns arise in tumors, especially those driven by mutations in epigenetic modifiers. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>To study the impact of MLL/COMPASS on DNA methylation, we targeted WDR5, a component essential for all MLL/COMPASS complexes to bind the histone H3 N-terminal tail [27], for siRNA-mediated depletion using the human embryonic carcinoma cell line (ECC) NCCIT as a model system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>NCCIT is a nonseminomatous germ cell-derived teratoma that exhibits characteristics of pluripotent cells, in that it can be induced to differentiate into embryonic germ layers, and the NCCIT transcriptome resembles that of human embryonic stem cells (ESC) [28, 29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Depletion of H3K4 methylation has previously been shown to increase total genomic cytosine methylation levels using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system [22], but the existence of a direct link between H3K4me and DNA methylation in the human genome remains unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>We therefore asked whether depletion of H3K4me3 by siRNA against WDR5 (siWDR5) would result in DNA hypermethylation, if indeed these two epigenetic marks are functionally interrelated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>A non-targeting control siRNA (siNTC) was used for comparison. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Transfection with siWDR5 generated ~70% depletion of the target mRNA (Fig. 1A) and &gt;95% depletion of the target protein (Fig. 1B). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Scatterplots of methylation levels for all identified peaks revealed both hypo- and hypermethylation of many loci with low basal levels of methylation (Fig. 2A, blue arrows), but loci with moderate to high levels of methylation tended to become hypermethylated (in Fig. 2A note the “clearing” marked by the green arrow, and the increased methylation marked by the red arrow). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>5mC tag density plots across gene bodies revealed an overall hypomethylation effect on the genome resulting from WDR5 depletion (Fig. 2B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Thus, hypermethylation observed in the scatterplots must affect either a subset of genes/features or intergenic regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Indeed, after counting genes with differentially methylated peaks, more than 10,000 genes showed hypomethylation in gene bodies, but a large proportion of gene promoters were hypermethylated (Fig. 2C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>CGI showed robust hypermethylation (Fig. 2C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Nearly 10% of promoter CGI were hypermethylated and 36% of intragenic CGI were hypermethylated (Fig. 2D,E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>In contrast to CGI, CGI shores became mostly hypomethylated upon siWDR5-depletion, and CGI shores in promoters or gene bodies were equally impacted (Fig. 2D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Since inhibition of WDR5 impacts H3K4me3, we examined the relationship between hypermethylated promoters in siWDR5-treated cells and promoters marked with H3K4me3 determined by previously published NCCIT H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Only a subset of siWDR5 hypermethylated promoters had H3K4me3 (883 out of 2184) prior to WDR5 knockdown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Of these hypermethylation events, 77% (24% greater than expected) occurred at bivalent H3K4me3+H3K27me3 loci, but H3K4me3 monovalent promoters were underrepresented among hypermethylated H3K4me3-marked promoters in siWDR5 cells (Fig. 2F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Bivalent promoters impacted by DNA hypermethylation in WDR5-depleted cells included genes with functions involved in cell-cell signaling, G-protein signaling, neuronal fate, and synaptic transmission (Fig. 2G), and included genes such as those encoding the transmembrane protein TSPAN2, the oncogene MAZ, and the tumor suppressor gene EIF4E3 (Fig. 2H). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>We sought to further independently confirm our novel findings related to siWDR5-induced DNA hypermethylation, therefore we applied siNTC and siWDR5 DNA to the Infinium 450k array, which interrogates methylation at single CpG resolution using bisulfite conversion at sites spread throughout the genome [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Results from this experiment demonstrate that CGI hypermethylation in siWDR5 detected by the Infinium 450k array is a significant subset of that detected by 5mC-seq. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the 5mC-seq observation for siWDR5 in which hypomethylation is predominantly observed at non-CGI loci and hypermethylation is observed at CGI is supported by the Infinium 450k results (Supp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) coupled to qPCR was also used as validation of the 5mC-seq results, and further confirms several WDR5 depletion-induced DNA methylation changes predicted by the 5mC-seq (Supp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Fig 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Loci that lost DNA methylation upon WDR5 depletion tended not to be enriched for H3K4me3, but rather were more linked to the presence of H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub (Supp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Fig 3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>In summary, the presence of H3K4 methylation inhibits DNA methylation specifically at promoters and CGI, and this inhibitory function is strongest at bivalent promoters compared to monovalent H3K4me3 promoters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Hypomethylation upon WDR5 knockdown may result from redistribution of the DNA methylation machinery from repressed PcG-marked loci to regions previously protected by H3K4me3. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Reduction of RNF2 or a combination of EED and RNF2 resulted in widespread hypomethylation throughout the genome, including gene bodies and CGI (Fig. 3A,B; Fig. 4A-C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>The result that dual siEED+siRNF2 depletion was similar to siRNF2 single depletion suggests that RNF2 depletion suppresses the hypermethylation effect of EED depletion. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Several lines of evidence suggest the existence of functional crosstalk between DNA methylation and chromatin modifications [14, 20-22, 24-26, 33], and disruption of these interactions is intimately linked to cancer initiation and progression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>This study comprised the first systemic investigation into the genome-wide function of MLL/COMPASS, PRC2, and PRC1 complexes in limiting or promoting DNA methylation in human cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>MLL/COMPASS and PRC2 predominantly opposed DNA methylation at CGI and promoters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>RNF2's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in PRC1 promotes methylation, but PRC1's CBX4 subunit has dual roles in promoting methylation (at CGI) and restricting methylation (across most gene regions). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Importantly, loci most impacted by both DNA hypermethylation (in EED or WDR5 depletions) and hypomethylation (in CBX4 and RNF2 depletions) overlapped extensively among the knockdowns indicating multi-layered epigenetic co-regulation, and these loci were strongly susceptible to aberrant hypermethylation in cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Whether MLL/COMPASS and the PcG complexes have a similar impact on the methylome of other cell types as they do in NCCIT EC cells represents an interesting topic for future studies, however our finding that many of the same genes affected in the NCCIT cell model system are also affected in primary human tumors, suggests that our results have broader applicability. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Since DNA methylation is correlated with the absence of H3K4 methylation, and since methylation of the K4 residue impairs DNMT3L interaction with chromatin (an interaction that facilitates DNMT3A and DNMT3B enzymatic activity) [22], we anticipated that H3K4me3 would prevent DNA methylation throughout the genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Our results show that, indeed, H3K4me3 prevents hypermethylation at CGI and bivalent promoters; however perturbation of MLL/COMPASS did not result in considerable hypermethylation at other loci. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>This may be due to the default methylated state of CpGs outside of CGI or the presence of the CpG-binding CXXC domain within the MLL1 protein and within the H3K4 methyltransferase SET1 interacting partner CFP1, which targets the MLL/COMPASS complex primarily to unmethylated CGI [34, 35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Hypomethylation events under MLL/COMPASS-depletion conditions may stem from global redistribution of DNMTs upon loss of H3K4me3 protected zones. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Indeed, precedence for global redistribution of one epigenetic mark upon depletion of another exists [25]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>The gene repressive functions of PRC1 and PRC2 during embryonic development have been known for decades [36], but their enzymatic activities have only just begun to be elucidated, and the mechanisms by which they mediate repression remain vague. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>PRC2 has long been thought to mediate repression through recruitment of DNMTs [20, 21], but this function may apply to a subset of loci, since only a small proportion of activated genes were hypomethylated under PRC2 depletion conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>More recently, the CXXC-domain-containing catalytic subunit of PRC2, EZH2, was shown to bind preferentially to hypomethylated CGI [24], and peaks of H3K27me3 occupancy have been associated with transcriptional activity [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Our novel finding that functional perturbation of PRC2 leads to DNA hypermethylation (in addition to hypomethylation events) at a subset of genes and that this hypermethylation is significantly associated with loci that become hypermethylated in the cancer state, sheds important light on the multi-faceted roles of PRC2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>As evidenced by our data, PRC2 impacts DNA methylation in both directions—hypo- and hypermethylation—but the hypermethylation effect, which predominated at CGI and promoters, was unexpected because previous studies of dominant-negative H3.3 K27M mutant glioblastomas, which have an extensive global loss of H3K27me3, reported only a DNA hypomethylation impact on the genome [33]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>We show that PRC2's role (and by inference H3K27me3's role) in repressing DNA methylation preferentially occurs at loci with both H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub marks, indicating that chromatin configuration impacts PRC2 regulation of DNA methylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>We propose a model wherein H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub may function either separately (Fig. 7A) or together (Fig. 7B) in regulating DNA methylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Two independent sets of loci were found to be hypomethylated with either H3K27me3 depletion or with H2AK119ub depletion (Fig. 5C), and we suspect PcG marks are functioning independently of one another to promote CpG methylation at these loci. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Depletion of the predominant mark is sufficient for loss of CpG methylation (Fig. 7A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, at loci where hypermethylation occurs in the absence of H3K27me3 but hypomethylation occurs with depletion of H2AK119ub, we propose a separate scenario that is supported by the canonical model for PRC1/H2AK119ub recruitment via localization of PRC2/H3K27me3 [6, 7] (Fig. 7B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Deposition of both DNA methylation-preventing H3K27me3 and DNA methylation-promoting H2AK119ub at a given locus generates a balanced, but metastable epigenetic signature—a state of transcriptional plasticity that is more easily modulated during development or in response to fluctuating environmental stimuli (Fig. 7B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>If H2AK119ub is removed at these loci, H3K27me3 protects the region from CpG methylation resulting in a hypomethylated state (Fig. 7B,i). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>In the event of H3K27me3 loss (during normal development or aberrantly during malignant transformation), PRC1 (and by inference, H2AK119ub) promotes deposition of DNA methylation (Fig. 7B,ii). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Our finding that dual depletion of EED and RNF2 exhibits the same DNA hypomethylation phenotype as that of RNF2 single knockdown suggests that PRC2 promotes this balanced epigenetic signature by inhibiting PRC1's role in promoting DNA methylation (Fig. 7B,iii). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Given that loci with dual H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub marks are most impacted by DNA methylation changes in our PRC1 or PRC2 function-depleted cells, we suspect that this canonical method of PRC1 recruitment via PRC2 may be an important mechanism for establishing the precise PRC2 – PRC1 control over DNA methylation deposition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Evidence that RNF2/H2AK119ub promotes methylation at many of the same promoters protected from hypermethylation by PRC2/H3K27me3 evokes a model for why select loci become hypermethylated, while the remainder of the genome undergoes hypomethylation in tumors (Fig. 7). </plain></SENT>
