</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>p25α is a 25 kilodalton (kDa) phosphorylated protein, first identified from a tau protein kinase fraction [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The protein was later discovered to possess tubulin binding ability, and was renamed as tubulin polymerization promoting protein (TPPP) [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>TPPP is expressed exclusively in the oligodendroglia in the central nervous system [1,3], and plays a critical role in myelin maturation [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>TPPP is also essential for the reorganization and stabilization of microtubules [2,5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Another characteristic biochemical feature of TPPP is that it normally remains as an unfolded and unstructured protein without binding partners [6], whereas in the presence of proteins such as myelin basic protein (MBP) or tubulin [2,7–9], it changes its secondary structure and exerts physiological roles such as binding with tubulin to stabilize microtubules [2,5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>TPPP is also a guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein, which hydrolyzes GTP to produce guanosine di-phosphate (GDP), and participates in multiple physiological functions [9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In adult human brains, TPPP is considered to be expressed in the oligodendroglial cytoplasm including their terminal processes, where it plays a role in forming mature myelin by binding with MBP [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>TPPP has also been studied in a number of human diseases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In multiple sclerosis (MS), demyelinated lesions show loss of TPPP-positive oligodendroglial cells, whereas re-myelinating areas show TPPP-upregulation in the oligodendroglial cytoplasm, subsequently followed by TPPP expression in the myelin sheath [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>TPPP is known to accumulate in the oligogodendroglia of patients with various neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson’s disease [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a common neurodegenerative disorder showing parkinsonian features, cerebellar ataxia, and autonomic failure, and has been suggested to be a primary oligodendrogliopathy [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The neuropathologic hallmark of MSA is the formation of argyrophilic glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) in oligodendroglia [13,14], consisting of α-synuclein (α-syn) [15–19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Previous pathological studies on human MSA brains showed that TPPP alters its distribution from the myelin sheath to the cell soma where it colocalizes with α-syn-containing GCIs [8,12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>However, much remains unknown regarding the expression of TPPP in human brains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The normal distribution of TPPP varies among previous reports: the majority of reports have emphasized that TPPP is expressed in the oligodendroglial cytoplasm and all of the processes [7,8], whereas two studies reported that TPPP is localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus [10,20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>It is not certain if this inconsistency is due to differences in the epitope locations within TPPP of the antibodies utilized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Considering that TPPP may exert various physiological functions through its GTPase activity [9,21], it is particularly important to confirm the location where TPPP is normally expressed, and how it is altered in each disease. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>We therefore aimed to clarify the distribution of TPPP in normal and MSA brains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, we generated new antibodies against the amino (N)- and carboxyl (C)-termini of TPPP, and examined human brain tissues including 11 MSA individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>We not only confirmed that TPPP colocalizes with the myelin marker MBP, but we also found that TPPP is expressed in more than 60% of normal, mature oligodendroglial nuclei. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Immunoelctron microscopy as well as western blotting also showed that TPPP is located in normal oligodendroglial mitochondria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In MSA, TPPP was lost not only from the oligodendroglial peripheral processes including myelin sheaths, but also from the oligodendroglial nuclei, and accumulated in its cell body where increased immunoreactivity was also seen for two mitochondrial membrane proteins (translocase of the mitochondrial outer membrane 20 [TOM20] and cytochrome C), and dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) that mediates mitochondrial fission. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>We investigated the redistribution of TPPP in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), MS, and oligodendroglioma, and found that it was specific to MSA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>We propose the amount of nuclear TPPP is reduced in MSA and this may perturb normal, yet unknown nuclear functions </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>By generating two antibodies against TPPP, we here confirmed that TPPP is expressed exclusively in the brain, and further that the expression is restricted to oligodendroglia, as previously reported [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>We also found that TPPP is expressed abundantly in the cytoplasm and processes including the myelin sheath as previously described. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>In addition, the TPPP was seen in the nucleus of about 62% of normal oligodendroglia, when analyzed in the pontine base. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Considering that oligodendoglia are a group of cells with different biochemical and metabolic properties [30], it is not surprising that TPPP is not observed in all oligodendroglial nuclei. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>The presence of TPPP in the nucleus was consistent: it was demonstrated by (1) immunohistochemical and immunoelectron microscopic analyses of human and mouse brain tissues, (2) double-labeling immunofluorescence analysis for TPPP and lamin B1 with three-dimensional visualization and (3) western blotting of nuclear, cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions of human brain homogenates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Whereas most previous reports emphasized that TPPP was expressed in the oligodendroglial cytoplasm and all oligodendroglial processes [7,8], two studies previously reported that TPPP is localized in the nucleus [10,20], consistent with the present data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Höftberger and colleagues previously analyzed the localization of TPPP in the human brain by immunohistochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy, and showed that TPPP was localized in oligodendroglial nuclei as well as its cytoplasm [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Acevedo and colleagues also found similar nuclear localization of TPPP in the non-neuronal cell lines NIH-3T3 and HeLa using immunocytochemistry [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>As the present investigation and Höftberger’s study both utilized formic acid to retrieve hidden antigen, formic acid pretreatment may be required to detect nuclear TPPP in human formalin-fixed tissue samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>More importantly, the present observation of the nuclear localization of TPPP was confirmed with antibodies against both N- and C-termini of TPPP, suggesting that the full-length protein exists in the oligodendroglial nucleus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>The molecular size of TPPP (25 kDa) suggests that this protein can passively diffuse into the nucleus from the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore [31,32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>However, our finding of three predicted bipartite nuclear localization signals in TPPP indicates that this protein has the potential to translocate into the nucleus through the importin α/β pathway, which is highly conserved in eukaryotes [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Increased nuclear TPPP expression in demyelinating MS plaques also suggests an active role of TPPP in the nucleus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="?"><plain>Then, what is the role of TPPP in the nucleus? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, TPPP has the classical zinc finger domain His2Cys2 at the amino acid position 61–83 [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Although binding of a zinc ion (Zn2+) to this site has been shown to stabilize the structure of TPPP and to promote tubulin assembly in the presence of tubulin in the cytoplasm [9], its possession of a classical zinc finger motif also implicates its role as a transcription factor via binding to DNA in the nucleus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>It is interesting to note that OLIG1, another oligodendroglia-specific protein known as a helix-loop-helix transcription factor in the nucleus, can translocate into the cytoplasm, and when phosphorylated, facilitates membrane expansion leading to the maturation of oligodendroglia [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>It is thus possible that TPPP, another phosphorylated protein, has a dual role depending on its location (i.e., the nucleus or cytoplasm) within oligodendroglia. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to show that TPPP is reduced in the oligodendroglial nucleus of patients affected with MSA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>The reduction of TPPP from the nucleus is not a secondary phenomenon related to global cellular dysfunction, since other authentic nuclear proteins such as TDP43 and OLIG2 were both retained in the nucleus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>We also confirmed the results of previous studies describing that the immunoreactivity of TPPP was markedly decreased in the peripheral processes of MSA-oligodendroglia, whereas TPPP was increased in the swollen perinuclear cytoplasm of some MSA-oligodendroglia [8,11,12,27,34,35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>These observations indicate that TPPP not only relocates from the terminal processes that normally form the myelin sheath, but also translocates from the nucleus and focally accumulates in the swollen perinuclear cytoplasm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>Song and colleagues also analyzed the pontine base, and reported that the accumulation of TPPP in the oligodendroglial perinuclear cytoplasm precedes the generation of obvious pα-syn-positive GCIs, the pathologic hallmark of MSA [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>Our findings are consistent with this study, as TPPP was found reduced in the oligodendroglia lacking GCIs (MSA type 1/types 1 + 2 = 48.63 ± 10.37% vs type 1/types 1 + 2 in controls = 62.4 ± 13.5%; p = 0.0185). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>In addition, the prevalence of nuclear TPPP was further reduced among the MSA-oligodendroglia with pα-syn immunoreactivity (i.e., GCI-positive oligodendroglia) (types 3 + 5/types vs 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 in MSA = 19.6 ± 10.9%, p &lt; 0.001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>Taking the present results together with those of Song and colleagues, TPPP appears to relocate from both the terminal processes and the nucleus to the perinuclear cytoplasm in oligodendroglia prior to the formation of GCIs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>Yet, it is not clear how the relocalization of TPPP associates with the aggregation of pα-syn in oligodendroglia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>A previous study showed that α-syn is detected in rat primary culture oligodendroglial cells [36], suggesting that it could be endogenously upregulated under certain conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, α-syn may enter oligodendroglia through dynamin-mediated endocytosis, as shown in oligodendroglial cell lines [37,38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Once α-syn is expressed in oligodendroglia by means of yet unidentified mechanisms, it is conceivable that TPPP and α-syn bind to each other to form aggregates [34,37,38] and to promote the phosphorylation of α-syn at Serine 129, leading to microtubule retraction followed by oligodendroglial cell death [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>If this is the case, TPPP relocalization could be an important upstream target for developing treatments against MSA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>However, it should also be noted that the appearance of GCI may not always indicate a late stage event in oligodendroglia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>To clarify oligodendroglial pathology, we need to investigate by different methods, such as cultured cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>The present study also provides evidence that TPPP is a mitochondrial protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopic analysis combined with immunohistochemistry suggested that TPPP localizes to mitochondria, most frequently to the outer membrane. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>Subcellular fractionation experiments suggested that this protein localizes at least in mitochondria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Although the precise function of TPPP in mitochondria is completely unknown to date, it may be possible that TPPP plays a role as a mitochondrial motor protein, considering its binding capacity to tubulin [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>Similar to other mitochondrial membrane proteins such as MFN1, MFN2 or DRP1 [29,41], TPPP demonstrates GTPase activity in the presence of zinc [9] and magnesium [21] ions, suggesting its multiple roles in physiological dynamics (for example, signal transduction). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>We further demonstrated that TPPP is accumulated in MSA-oligodendroglial cell soma, where the mitochondrial proteins TOM20, cytochrome C, and DRP1 also showed stronger immunoreactivity compared to controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>The present observations using triple immunolabeling for TPPP, pα-syn, and either TOM20 or DRP1, indicate two potentially important aspects of MSA-oligodendroglia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>One is that both DRP1 and TOM20 are accumulated in the pα-syn-positive GCI of MSA-oligodendroglia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>Mitochondria dynamically control their quality through fusion and fission, creating their network in the cytoplasm [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>When the important mitochondrial fission mediator DRP1 is over-activated, it can lead to small and discrete mitochondria (mitochondrial fragmentation), and the generation of reactive oxygen species, and the mitochondria can be subjected to mitophagy in order to destroy malfunctioning mitochondria [29,41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>In a number of neurodegenerative conditions, mitochondrial fission is increased whereas fusion is impaired, resulting in mitochondrial fragmentation [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>Based on the present data, MSA oligodendroglia may be deviated toward in the hyper-fission state. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>In line with this view, parkin, a ubiquitin E3 ligase relevant to mitophagy, has been shown to be positive in some GCI-positive oligodendroglia [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>In addition, small ubiquitin-like modifier type 1 (SUMO-1), which regulates DRP1 activity, is also positive in some GCIs [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is possible that our finding of substantial DRP1 immunoreactivity in GCI-containing oligodendroglia reflects abnormal mitochondrial fission leading to mitochondrial fragmentation and mitophagy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>The other important implication from this triple-labeling experiment is that both DRP1 and TOM20 start to appear before the obvious deposition of pα-syn in MSA-oligodendroglia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>This indicates that abnormal mitochondrial accumulation, as well as fission, possibly precedes GCI formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>The Multiple System Atrophy Research Consortium reported that functionally impairing nucleotide variants in COQ2, which encodes the protein coenzyme Q2 that is essential for the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q10, were associated with an increased risk of MSA in multiplex families and in about 10% of sporadic MSA cases [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>Patients with defective COQ2 mutations were shown to have GCI-positive oligodendroglia [23], providing direct evidence for a role of mitochondrial dysfunction in MSA pathogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we were able to investigate a patient with this defective COQ2 mutation, and found that the changes in the levels of TPPP and the mitochondrial proteins TOM20 and DRP1, as well as the reduction of nuclear TPPP, are similar to what we observed in sporadic MSA individuals. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we found that TPPP normally localizes abundantly in the cytoplasm, but also in the nucleus of some oligodendroglia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>TPPP is localized in mitochondria as well as other cellular component such as cytosol. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>Based on our findings and previous descriptions [8,12], in MSA, we hypothesize that TPPP can relocates not only from the peripheral processes but also from the nucleus, and accumulates in the perinuclear cytoplasm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>Deposition of pα-syn and the eventual disappearance of TPPP appear to follow such TPPP relocation, if our classification of MSA-oligodendroglia truly reflect MSA-oligodendroglial pathologic cascade. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis requires further evaluation from different aspects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>For example, technical limitations, such as differences in the affinity of the various antibodies to their immunogen (i.e., anti-TPPP-antibody vs anti-α-syn-antibody) should be carefully re-considered. In vitro experiments such as using oligodendroglial cell line is required to make the hypothesis evident. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the present study suggests the need to discover the role(s) of TPPP in the nucleus and mitochondria, and how they are disturbed in MSA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>Concerning the TPPP and the mitochondrial proteins accumulations in the cytoplasm of MSA-oligodendroglia, the present observation on the COQ2-mutant MSA case implies that the primary mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to the TPPP relocation secondarily. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>It is also not known how TPPP relates with these mitochondrial proteins in a molecular level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>Addressing these questions will provide new information on potential roles of TPPP in both normal oligodendroglial biology and MSA pathogenesis. </plain></SENT>
