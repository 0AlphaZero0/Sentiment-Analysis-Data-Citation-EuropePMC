Leptin (LEP), a metabolic hormone, has also been implicated in the promotion of angiogenesis. In this study, LEP and its long form receptor (OB-Rb) were evaluated during porcine pregnancy to assess their basal level of expression and their potential role in conceptus development.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Expression and secretion of LEP and OB-Rb were quantified in the endometrium of non-pregnant (n =&#8201;5), and in the endometrium and chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of pregnant sows (parity 2 to 5) at gestational days (gd) 20 (n =&#8201;8) and 50 (n =&#8201;8).

Significantly greater <italic>LEP</italic> (P &lt;&#8201;0.001) was detected in the endometrial tissue at gd20 compared with gd50. At the protein level, the lowest LEP expression (P &lt;&#8201;0.01) was detected in the CAM at gd50, while OB-Rb protein was significantly lower (P &lt;&#8201;0.01) at gd50 in the CAM than in the endometrium collected from gd20 and gd50 conceptus attachment sites.

Two waves of spontaneous conceptus loss are documented: a primary loss of approximately 20-30% during the time of peri-attachment (around gestational day (gd) 15&#8211;20) and a second loss of 10-15% during mid-gestation (around gd50) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Understanding the physiological and molecular mechanisms behind these losses may help increase litter size, thus positively impacting the economic production of commercial swine.</p><p>Numerous factors contribute to early conceptus losses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that conceptus losses are associated with an imbalance of mRNA transcripts for multiple angiogenic and inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] as well as factors that can regulate mRNA stability such as the tristetraprolin family members (Khalaj et al., unpublished data). Arresting conceptuses are recognized by reduced size, weight, and vasculature at the sites of attachment, when compared to their healthy, more robust littermates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The reduction in vascularization has been shown to be associated with a decreased production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These findings suggest a correlation between abnormal angiogenesis at the maternal-fetal interface and fetal loss.</p><p>An angiogenesis-related protein of interest that has been linked to reproductive function and embryonic development is leptin (LEP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Leptin, a 16&#160;kDa, non-glycosylated polypeptide, is not only thought to have a local autocrine and immunomodulatory role in immune function and angiogenesis, but is also involved in energy metabolism, satiety, and reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The biological actions of LEP depend greatly on the presence of LEP receptors (OB-R) for which there are six identified isoforms: OB-Ra, OB-Rb, OB-Rc, OB-Rd, OB-Re, and OB-Rf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The long form of the LEP receptor (OB-Rb, contains tyrosine residues) is of particular interest due to its role in mediating LEP signaling through the cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The short isoforms are primarily involved in leptin transport across the blood&#8211;brain barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]</p><p>As previously mentioned, appropriate blood supply to the developing conceptus is essential for a successful pregnancy. The binding of LEP to OB-Rb within endothelial cells has been linked to the activation of the JAK/STAT3 molecular pathway which promotes endothelial tube formations and corneal neovascularization <italic>in vitro</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and has also been associated with the up-regulation of VEGF transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. These particular findings suggest that the role of LEP in the activation of JAK/STAT3 pathway may enhance embryonic attachment and angiogenesis at the maternal-fetal interface.</p><p>Different patterns of uterine <italic>LEP</italic> and <italic>OB-Rb</italic> transcription have been reported during porcine pregnancy. Endometrial expression of <italic>LEP</italic> at gd30-32 is significantly increased in comparison with gd14-16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The same laboratory reported no differences in <italic>OB-Rb</italic> expression between these stages of pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Besides the uterus, both <italic>LEP</italic> and <italic>OB-Rb</italic> have been detected at a higher level in the ovary during early pregnancy compared with cycling sows pointing to a role during gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In addition, <italic>OB-Rb</italic> transcripts have been noted to be differentially expressed in the implantation and the inter-implantation sites of pregnant mice, suggesting that the LEP/OB-R complex may be a regulator in the implantation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Leptin and OB-Rb gene and protein expression at the maternal-fetal interface in swine has yet to be examined in healthy and arresting attachment sites during the two waves of spontaneous conceptus losses. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine if LEP and OB-Rb are expressed during early (gd20) and mid-gestation (gd50) of porcine pregnancy and whether their expression is influenced by conceptus health.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Porcine tissue sample collection</title><p>Pathogen-free Yorkshire sows (n =&#8201;21) from Arkell Swine Research Station (University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada) were used for this study. Sows (parity 2 to5) were artificially bred through means of a sponge-tipped catheter using pooled boar semen. Tissue samples were collected from non-pregnant sows in the diestrus stage of the estrous cycle (n =&#8201;5), and pregnant animals at gd20 (n =&#8201;8, peri-attachment) and gd50 (n =&#8201;8, mid-gestation). Animal handling and euthanasia protocols were approved by the University of Guelph Animal Care Committee (Animal utilization protocol #10R061). Immediately after slaughter, the reproductive tracts were collected at the University of Guelph abattoir and transported to the laboratory on ice. Uteri were opened longitudinally along the anti-mesometrial side to remove embryos from the attachment sites. The embryos of each sow were individually categorized as healthy or arresting based on visual assessment of vascularization and color of the membrane attachment areas, as well as fetal length and weight as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Any conceptuses that had extreme resorption or a debatable health status were removed from the study. At each attachment site, endometrial tissue on the maternal side was collected separately from the corresponding chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) from the fetal side. Within a litter, each collected tissue was treated as an individual attachment site and not pooled. For non-pregnant samples, endometrial tissue was removed from the mesometrial side at random. All samples were rinsed with PBS prior to storage. Each tissue was divided into multiple samples: samples for RNA isolation or protein extraction were frozen immediately and stored at &#8722;80&#176;C, while samples for immunoflouresence were fixed in paraformaldehyde and embedded in a paraffin mold.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>RNA isolation from endometrial and CAM samples</title><p>Total RNA extraction on all collected tissues was performed using RNeasy mini kits (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada) as per the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. RNA concentration was determined using the Gene Quant pro RNA/DNA calculator (Biochrom Ltd, Cambridge, UK). RNA quality was assessed by evaluating the A260/A280. All samples were within purity range (2.0 +/&#8722; 0.25). RNA was immediately frozen at &#8722;80&#176;C for future use.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Reverse transcription</title><p>cDNA synthesis was performed using First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit as per manufacturer&#8217;s instructions (GE Healthcare Bio-Science Inc. Baie d&#8217;Urfe, QC, Canada). Briefly, 20&#160;&#956;L of diluted RNA (concentrations ranged from 224 to 890&#160;ng/&#956;L) was heated at 65&#176;C for 10&#160;minutes in the GeneAMP polymerase chain reaction (PCR) System 2700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA, USA). Once complete, 11&#160;&#956;L of the bulk first strand cDNA reaction mix, 1&#160;&#956;L of poly (dT) primer, and 1&#160;&#956;L of DTT solution was added. The reaction was incubated at 37&#176;C for 60&#160;minutes. The cDNA concentration was measured using a Gene Quant Pro RNA/DNA calculator (Biochrom Ltd, Cambridge, UK). All cDNA products were stored in &#8722;20&#176;C for subsequent real time PCR use.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Quantitative real-time PCR</title><p>Primers targeting the genes of interest (LEP and OB-Rb) were designed from the electronic nucleotide database, GenBank, using Primer 3 software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biotools.umassmed.edu/bioapps/primer3_www.cgi">http://biotools.umassmed.edu/bioapps/primer3_www.cgi</ext-link>). To test the primers and to optimize their efficiency, aliquots of cDNA from all tissues were pooled and used as a template. Information on the primers for each gene of interest is provided in Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Quantitect SYBR Green I PCR mix kit was used to optimize primer efficiency (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada) in a capillary-based real time PCR system (LightCycler, Roche Diagnostics, Laval, QC, Canada).

For each sample, protease inhibitor (2&#160;&#956;L Aprotonin, Sigma Aldrich Co., St Louis, MO) and 200&#160;&#956;L of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) were added before homogenization on ice for 1&#160;minute. Samples were then centrifuged (6000&#8201;&#215;&#8201;g) at 4&#176;C for 15&#160;minutes and supernatants were harvested. Protein concentration was quantified using the Bradford method. Aliquots of the protein samples were diluted to a final concentration of 2&#160;&#956;g/&#956;L and stored at &#8722;80&#176;C until analyzed for specific proteins. Six samples from each of the tissues were used for protein extraction and Western Blotting.</p><p>Leptin and OB-Rb proteins were quantified by Western Blot. In brief, 10&#160;&#956;g protein samples were denatured at 100&#176;C for 5&#160;minutes. Samples were then loaded into appropriate wells of 4-20% pre-cast mini-PROTEAN TGX gels (12 wells/20uL) (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mississauga, ON) and separated by electrophoresis at140 V for 1&#160;hour. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane using 100&#160;V for 2&#160;hours. The membrane was blocked with 5% skimmed milk (reconstituted in tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (TBS-T)) for 1&#160;hour at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated in primary antibody [Pierce Leptin polyclonal rabbit (PA1-052, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), or OB-R (H-300) rabbit polyclonal IgG (sc-8325, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc., Dallas, TX)] diluted in skimmed milk (1&#160;&#956;g/mL for LEP and 2.5&#160;&#956;g/mL for OB-Rb) at 4&#176;C overnight. After washing with TBS-T, the membrane was incubated in the secondary antibody diluted in skimmed milk [0.01&#160;&#956;g/mL for LEP and 0.16&#160;&#956;g/mL for OB-Rb; Anti-rabbit IgG (whole molecule)-peroxidase antibody produced in goat (Sigma Aldrich Co., St Louis, MO)] for 1&#160;hour at room temperature. The membrane was then washed and imaged using an electrochemiluminescence kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mississauga, ON) and a Konica Minolta SRX-101A X-ray film developer (Konica Minolta Ltd., Mississauga, ON). Leptin and OB-Rb were run on separate membranes. After imaging, all membranes were stripped using Restore Western Blot Stripping Buffer (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) and re-probed for ACTB, a loading control for both proteins. The same protocol was followed for ACTB except that a primary antibody pre-conjugated with horseradish perioxidase [HRP; anti-beta Actin antibody (HRP; mAbcam 8226, Abcam PLC, Cambridge, England)] was used (0.2&#160;&#956;g/mL). The X-ray images were scanned at 600 dpi (greyscale) and analyzed using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD) to obtain densitometry values as a ratio to ACTB from each corresponding blot.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Staining: immunofluorescence (IF) and hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)</title><p>Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded endometrial and CAM tissues were sectioned at 7&#160;&#956;m thickness and mounted on Superfrost Plus microscope slides (Fisher Scientific, Ottawa, ON, Canada). Tissue sections were then deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated with ethanol. A 0.2% hydrogen peroxide solution (diluted in methanol) was applied to sections for 20&#160;minutes to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Slides were then rinsed with PBS, boiled in a sodium citrate buffer (pH&#160;6.0) and allowed to cool for 45&#160;minutes at room temperature. Sections were rinsed with PBS then blocked with 1.0% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 1&#160;hour at room temperature. Primary antibody for LEP and OB-Rb [0.5&#160;&#956;g per section in 0.1% BSA in PBS (10&#160;ng/&#956;L); the same primary antibodies used in Western Blotting were used in IF] were applied to sections and incubated overnight at 4&#176;C. Serial antibody dilutions were tested before optimization. Control sections were incubated with rabbit immunoglobulin [ab37415, Abcam PLC, Cambridge, England; 0.5&#160;&#956;g per section in 0.1% BSA in PBS (10&#160;ng/&#956;L)] as a negative control.

With respect to real-time PCR data, NP data were compared to data from gd20 endometrial tissue samples only, while all CAM and endometrium samples across both gestational days were compared with each other. The effect of conceptus health, tissue type and gestational day on transcript and protein expression was tested using a three-way analysis of variance for repeated measures.

No differences in LEP expression were observed between healthy and arresting conceptus attachment sites on either gestational day. The production of LEP was similar in the CAM and endometrial tissue samples, however being significantly influenced by gestational day (P &lt;&#8201;0.01) and the tissue type by gestational day interaction (P &lt;&#8201;0.001). The LEP protein was more predominant at gd20 but its production was affected by tissue type. CAM from gd50 samples had the least amount (P &lt;&#8201;0.001) of LEP protein when compared with endometrial samples at gd50 as well as CAM and endometrial samples collected at gd20 (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B) regardless of conceptus health.Leptin receptor quantification revealed multiple bands representing the different isoforms of the receptor (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). As we are interested in the long form receptor, we quantified the largest band that was obtained (approximately 125&#160;kDa). However, the band with the greatest signal intensity was detected around the 37&#160;kDa range (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). Similar to LEP, no differences in the OB-Rb production were noted between healthy and arresting conceptus attachment sites on either gestational day (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). However, in the case of OB-Rb, production of the protein significantly differed between tissue types (P &lt;&#8201;0.001), gestational day (P &lt;&#8201;0.001) and their interaction (P &lt;&#8201;0.01). The OB-Rb protein was produced at a higher level in the endometrium than the CAM, and at gd20 compared with gd50.Taking the interaction into consideration, the greatest amount of OB-Rb protein was produced in the endometrium collected from conceptus attachment sites at gd20, and the lowest was produced in CAM collected from conceptus attachment sites at gd50 with the remaining samples having intermediate OB-Rb protein production.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>

The fact that <italic>LEP</italic> and <italic>OB-Rb</italic> mRNA transcripts are greater in the pregnant than the non-pregnant endometrium points to a role during early porcine pregnancy. Previous studies have indicated that LEP plays a role in fetal growth and development towards the end of gestation, in addition to helping the fetus transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Yet, the exact role that LEP has during early pregnancy is still unclear.</p><p>Leptin and OB-Rb mRNA and protein have been shown to be expressed and produced in the placenta of a wide range of species including humans, pigs, baboons, sheep, mice and rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Additionally, increased LEP production was reported in the anterior pituitary of early pregnant sows (gd 14&#8211;16) over mid pregnancy (gd 30&#8211;32) or non-pregnant cycling sows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The <italic>LEP</italic> mRNA expression in the current study was influenced by the tissue type by gestational day interaction, while the <italic>OB-Rb</italic> expression was affected by conceptus health by tissue type by gestational day interaction. The detected interactions indicate that the expression patterns of both <italic>LEP</italic> and <italic>OB-Rb</italic> change based on tissue and with the advancement of gestation. Increased <italic>LEP</italic> was observed in the endometrial tissue of conceptus attachment sites at gd20 compared with the remaining tissues and more so in healthy than in arresting conceptus attachment sites. Gu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] reported greater <italic>LEP</italic> expression during the early gestation of Meishan than Yorkshire gilts. The authors linked this increased <italic>LEP</italic> expression with the higher prolificacy of Meishan pigs. At gd50, <italic>OB-Rb</italic> was greater in the endometrium of arresting and CAM of healthy conceptus attachment sites than the remaining tissues. Increased <italic>OB-Rb</italic> in the porcine CAM has been reported as pregnancy progressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. An increase in OB-Rb and OB-Rb signaling over pregnancy may be important for pregnancy maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This suggests that a reduced amount of LEP lowers receptor signaling in the endometrium, creating a uterine environment that may be unable to maintain healthy developing conceptuses. The current results also support this hypothesis, as <italic>LEP</italic> transcripts, although not significant, tend to be expressed at lower levels in the endometrium of arresting sites compared to healthy. Similarly, Simon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] reported lower LEP levels in arresting human blastocysts compared to those which were healthy, further implicating LEP/OB-Rb in embryonic loss. A reduction or withdrawal of LEP during the pregnancy can result in embryonic loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. As such, areas within the uterus with a reduction in <italic>LEP</italic> gene expression seem to lead to an environment where fetal demise can ultimately occur.</p><p>Both LEP and OB-Rb proteins were quantified by Western Blotting and localized through staining. The glandular and stromal localization of LEP and OB-Rb proteins was similar to what was previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Although similar protein production patterns were observed (Figures&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), our findings were the first to show that these proteins are produced in healthy and arresting attachment sites at both gd20 and gd50.</p><p>The primary antibody used to quantify leptin receptors in this study targets both the short and long forms. Unlike other studies that detected a band for the long form (OB-Rb) in the 170&#160;kDa range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], the largest OB-Rb bands we detected fell in the 125&#160;kDa range. In the current study, LEP and OB-Rb proteins did not vary between healthy and arresting attachment sites. Both proteins were affected by the interaction between tissue type and gestational day. The lowest level of LEP protein was found in the CAM at gd50, while OB-Rb was lowest at gd50 in the CAM as compared to the gd20 and 50 endometrium; both irrespective of conceptus health. Thus, because LEP and OB-Rb are lower at the fetal side (CAM) at gd50, the LEP/OB-R complex could potentially be critical for survival and, possibly, attachment of the early porcine embryo. The variation in OB-Rb gene expression and protein production across tissues and gestational days is most likely related to changes in their sensitivity to LEP. A similar finding was reported by Smolinska et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] in pigs. Leptin mRNA transcripts and protein expression showed the highest expression during early pregnancy and more so on the maternal than the fetal side, again suggesting a more important role around the time of attachment and placentation. These results, along with previous reports from our laboratory on spontaneous fetal loss (implicating the maternal side in fetal arrest) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] support the current findings that leptin expression may be primarily a maternal response, as opposed to fetal.</p><p>Our results show that endometrial <italic>LEP</italic> transcript levels are significantly lower in mid-pregnancy compared to early pregnancy. This contradicts a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] in humans whereby placental LEP gene expression and proteins were found to increase throughout pregnancy. Potentially in swine, LEP is predominately necessary from the maternal side during the early stages of pregnancy as the developing embryo cannot yet support sufficient production through adipose tissue. Our study only went as far as gd50, where lower LEP and OB-Rb proteins were detected on the fetal side at that point. Had our study investigated later pregnancy, we might have observed a rise in fetal LEP/OB-R towards term as reported by previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Past research has suggested that the expression of OB-Rb is regulated by the amount of LEP and an increase in <italic>LEP</italic> gene expression might lead to both down and up regulation of OB-Rb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In the case of our study, LEP (mRNA and protein) was lower than the OB-Rb (mRNA and protein) no matter the gestational day, tissue type, or the health status of the conceptus. Similar findings were reported by Smolinska et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], whereby greater <italic>OB-Rb</italic> gene expression coincided with lower leptin mRNA expression in the pig CAM. During pregnancy, there is a constant demand for control on metabolic, immunologic, anti-inflammatory, and angiogenic pathways. Too much or too little may offset a pregnancy, creating an environment unstable for proper fetal development. Since LEP is involved in many of these mechanisms, its receptor would be necessary at the maternal-fetal interface to carry out biological actions. Constant levels of OB-Rb are necessary whether LEP is available or not. When or if LEP does become available, the receptors are present to take action. Generally, the more transcripts present result in more functional proteins being translated, creating an increased biological function. However, in the present study, this rule does not appear to apply in the classical sense, likely indicating the presence of post-transcriptional modifications or regulators that alter protein translation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the present study demonstrates different patterns of uterine LEP and OB-Rb gene and protein expression levels during the waves of spontaneous conceptus loss in swine pregnancy. Compared to the endometrium of non-pregnant animals, greater <italic>LEP</italic> and <italic>OB-Rb</italic> gene expression in pregnant sows suggest a role for LEP/OB-R in the maintenance of a healthy pregnancy in swine. Additionally, the decline in leptin and receptor proteins at the fetal side of the shared fetal-maternal interface during mid-gestation indicates a more important role for these proteins during early pregnancy, around the time of attachment. Overall, LEP and OB-Rb appear to participate in the health and attachment success of developing porcine embryos. With a continuation of research, a better and more complete understanding of the physiological mechanisms behind spontaneous conceptus loss may help increase litter sizes, resulting in a better economic production of commercial swine.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>ACTB</term><def><p>&#946;-actin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BSA</term><def><p>Bovine serum albumin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CAM</term><def><p>Chorioallantoic membrane</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Endo</term><def><p>Endometrium</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>gd</term><def><p>Gestational days</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>H&amp;E</term><def><p>Hematoxylin and eosin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HRP</term><def><p>Horseradish perioxidase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IF</term><def><p>Immunofluorescence</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LEP</term><def><p>Leptin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OB-R</term><def><p>Leptin receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCR</term><def><p>Polymerase chain reaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TBS-T</term><def><p>Tris-buffered saline containing Tween</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VEGF</term><def><p>Vascular endothelial growth factor.</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#8217; contributions</bold></p><p>AK, JW, AH and CT designed the experiment.
