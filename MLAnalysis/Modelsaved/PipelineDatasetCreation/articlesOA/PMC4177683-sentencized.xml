</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Prenatal embryonic/fetal loss is a major concern for North American pork producers with approximately 30 to 45% of the conceptuses lost during gestation (gestational length is 114 days) [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Two waves of spontaneous conceptus loss are documented: a primary loss of approximately 20-30% during the time of peri-attachment (around gestational day (gd) 15–20) and a second loss of 10-15% during mid-gestation (around gd50) [1–8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Understanding the physiological and molecular mechanisms behind these losses may help increase litter size, thus positively impacting the economic production of commercial swine. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Numerous factors contribute to early conceptus losses [4, 9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that conceptus losses are associated with an imbalance of mRNA transcripts for multiple angiogenic and inflammatory cytokines [10–12] as well as factors that can regulate mRNA stability such as the tristetraprolin family members (Khalaj et al., unpublished data). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Arresting conceptuses are recognized by reduced size, weight, and vasculature at the sites of attachment, when compared to their healthy, more robust littermates [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The reduction in vascularization has been shown to be associated with a decreased production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) transcripts [6, 10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a correlation between abnormal angiogenesis at the maternal-fetal interface and fetal loss. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>An angiogenesis-related protein of interest that has been linked to reproductive function and embryonic development is leptin (LEP) [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Leptin, a 16 kDa, non-glycosylated polypeptide, is not only thought to have a local autocrine and immunomodulatory role in immune function and angiogenesis, but is also involved in energy metabolism, satiety, and reproduction [14, 15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The biological actions of LEP depend greatly on the presence of LEP receptors (OB-R) for which there are six identified isoforms: OB-Ra, OB-Rb, OB-Rc, OB-Rd, OB-Re, and OB-Rf [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The long form of the LEP receptor (OB-Rb, contains tyrosine residues) is of particular interest due to its role in mediating LEP signaling through the cell membrane [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The short isoforms are primarily involved in leptin transport across the blood–brain barrier [16] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>As previously mentioned, appropriate blood supply to the developing conceptus is essential for a successful pregnancy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The binding of LEP to OB-Rb within endothelial cells has been linked to the activation of the JAK/STAT3 molecular pathway which promotes endothelial tube formations and corneal neovascularization in vitro[13, 17, 18] and has also been associated with the up-regulation of VEGF transcription [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>These particular findings suggest that the role of LEP in the activation of JAK/STAT3 pathway may enhance embryonic attachment and angiogenesis at the maternal-fetal interface. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Different patterns of uterine LEP and OB-Rb transcription have been reported during porcine pregnancy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Endometrial expression of LEP at gd30-32 is significantly increased in comparison with gd14-16 [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The same laboratory reported no differences in OB-Rb expression between these stages of pregnancy [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Besides the uterus, both LEP and OB-Rb have been detected at a higher level in the ovary during early pregnancy compared with cycling sows pointing to a role during gestation [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>In addition, OB-Rb transcripts have been noted to be differentially expressed in the implantation and the inter-implantation sites of pregnant mice, suggesting that the LEP/OB-R complex may be a regulator in the implantation process [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Leptin and OB-Rb gene and protein expression at the maternal-fetal interface in swine has yet to be examined in healthy and arresting attachment sites during the two waves of spontaneous conceptus losses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine if LEP and OB-Rb are expressed during early (gd20) and mid-gestation (gd50) of porcine pregnancy and whether their expression is influenced by conceptus health. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>The overall results of the current study show that LEP and OB-Rb transcripts and proteins are expressed and produced in the conceptus attachment sites while being influenced by the type of tissue as well as the two periods of spontaneous conceptus loss (gd20 and 50). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>The fact that LEP and OB-Rb mRNA transcripts are greater in the pregnant than the non-pregnant endometrium points to a role during early porcine pregnancy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have indicated that LEP plays a role in fetal growth and development towards the end of gestation, in addition to helping the fetus transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Yet, the exact role that LEP has during early pregnancy is still unclear. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Leptin and OB-Rb mRNA and protein have been shown to be expressed and produced in the placenta of a wide range of species including humans, pigs, baboons, sheep, mice and rats [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Additionally, increased LEP production was reported in the anterior pituitary of early pregnant sows (gd 14–16) over mid pregnancy (gd 30–32) or non-pregnant cycling sows [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>The LEP mRNA expression in the current study was influenced by the tissue type by gestational day interaction, while the OB-Rb expression was affected by conceptus health by tissue type by gestational day interaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>The detected interactions indicate that the expression patterns of both LEP and OB-Rb change based on tissue and with the advancement of gestation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Increased LEP was observed in the endometrial tissue of conceptus attachment sites at gd20 compared with the remaining tissues and more so in healthy than in arresting conceptus attachment sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Gu et al. [27] reported greater LEP expression during the early gestation of Meishan than Yorkshire gilts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>The authors linked this increased LEP expression with the higher prolificacy of Meishan pigs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>At gd50, OB-Rb was greater in the endometrium of arresting and CAM of healthy conceptus attachment sites than the remaining tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Increased OB-Rb in the porcine CAM has been reported as pregnancy progressed [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>An increase in OB-Rb and OB-Rb signaling over pregnancy may be important for pregnancy maintenance [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>This suggests that a reduced amount of LEP lowers receptor signaling in the endometrium, creating a uterine environment that may be unable to maintain healthy developing conceptuses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>The current results also support this hypothesis, as LEP transcripts, although not significant, tend to be expressed at lower levels in the endometrium of arresting sites compared to healthy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Similarly, Simon et al. [29] reported lower LEP levels in arresting human blastocysts compared to those which were healthy, further implicating LEP/OB-Rb in embryonic loss. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>A reduction or withdrawal of LEP during the pregnancy can result in embryonic loss [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>As such, areas within the uterus with a reduction in LEP gene expression seem to lead to an environment where fetal demise can ultimately occur. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Both LEP and OB-Rb proteins were quantified by Western Blotting and localized through staining. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>The glandular and stromal localization of LEP and OB-Rb proteins was similar to what was previously reported [20, 21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Although similar protein production patterns were observed (Figures 5 and 6), our findings were the first to show that these proteins are produced in healthy and arresting attachment sites at both gd20 and gd50. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>The primary antibody used to quantify leptin receptors in this study targets both the short and long forms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Unlike other studies that detected a band for the long form (OB-Rb) in the 170 kDa range [26], the largest OB-Rb bands we detected fell in the 125 kDa range. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>In the current study, LEP and OB-Rb proteins did not vary between healthy and arresting attachment sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Both proteins were affected by the interaction between tissue type and gestational day. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>The lowest level of LEP protein was found in the CAM at gd50, while OB-Rb was lowest at gd50 in the CAM as compared to the gd20 and 50 endometrium; both irrespective of conceptus health. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Thus, because LEP and OB-Rb are lower at the fetal side (CAM) at gd50, the LEP/OB-R complex could potentially be critical for survival and, possibly, attachment of the early porcine embryo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>The variation in OB-Rb gene expression and protein production across tissues and gestational days is most likely related to changes in their sensitivity to LEP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>A similar finding was reported by Smolinska et al. [21] in pigs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Leptin mRNA transcripts and protein expression showed the highest expression during early pregnancy and more so on the maternal than the fetal side, again suggesting a more important role around the time of attachment and placentation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>These results, along with previous reports from our laboratory on spontaneous fetal loss (implicating the maternal side in fetal arrest) [6, 10, 24] support the current findings that leptin expression may be primarily a maternal response, as opposed to fetal. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Our results show that endometrial LEP transcript levels are significantly lower in mid-pregnancy compared to early pregnancy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>This contradicts a previous study [31] in humans whereby placental LEP gene expression and proteins were found to increase throughout pregnancy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>Potentially in swine, LEP is predominately necessary from the maternal side during the early stages of pregnancy as the developing embryo cannot yet support sufficient production through adipose tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Our study only went as far as gd50, where lower LEP and OB-Rb proteins were detected on the fetal side at that point. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Had our study investigated later pregnancy, we might have observed a rise in fetal LEP/OB-R towards term as reported by previous studies [25]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Past research has suggested that the expression of OB-Rb is regulated by the amount of LEP and an increase in LEP gene expression might lead to both down and up regulation of OB-Rb [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>In the case of our study, LEP (mRNA and protein) was lower than the OB-Rb (mRNA and protein) no matter the gestational day, tissue type, or the health status of the conceptus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Similar findings were reported by Smolinska et al. [20, 21], whereby greater OB-Rb gene expression coincided with lower leptin mRNA expression in the pig CAM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>During pregnancy, there is a constant demand for control on metabolic, immunologic, anti-inflammatory, and angiogenic pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Too much or too little may offset a pregnancy, creating an environment unstable for proper fetal development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Since LEP is involved in many of these mechanisms, its receptor would be necessary at the maternal-fetal interface to carry out biological actions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Constant levels of OB-Rb are necessary whether LEP is available or not. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>When or if LEP does become available, the receptors are present to take action. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Generally, the more transcripts present result in more functional proteins being translated, creating an increased biological function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>However, in the present study, this rule does not appear to apply in the classical sense, likely indicating the presence of post-transcriptional modifications or regulators that alter protein translation. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present study demonstrates different patterns of uterine LEP and OB-Rb gene and protein expression levels during the waves of spontaneous conceptus loss in swine pregnancy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Compared to the endometrium of non-pregnant animals, greater LEP and OB-Rb gene expression in pregnant sows suggest a role for LEP/OB-R in the maintenance of a healthy pregnancy in swine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the decline in leptin and receptor proteins at the fetal side of the shared fetal-maternal interface during mid-gestation indicates a more important role for these proteins during early pregnancy, around the time of attachment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Overall, LEP and OB-Rb appear to participate in the health and attachment success of developing porcine embryos. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>With a continuation of research, a better and more complete understanding of the physiological mechanisms behind spontaneous conceptus loss may help increase litter sizes, resulting in a better economic production of commercial swine. </plain></SENT>
