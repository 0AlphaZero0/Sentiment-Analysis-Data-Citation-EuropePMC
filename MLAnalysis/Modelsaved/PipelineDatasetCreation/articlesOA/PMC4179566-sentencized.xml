</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In 2010, the lifetime risk in women of developing breast cancer was estimated as one in eight, with the disease now the most commonly occurring cancer in the UK.1 Surgery remains the treatment of choice, with around 43% of women with breast cancer opting for mastectomy.2 A total of 16 595 mastectomies were performed in England and Wales in 2012–2013.3 The most common complications of mastectomy are postoperative acute and chronic pain and slow recovery of shoulder function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Acute pain in mastectomy patients is currently managed with systemic opiates, either by intramuscular injection or using an intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) device. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Chronic postoperative pain is frequent (20–45%)4–7 and requires significant use of National Health Service (NHS) resources. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Poor recovery of shoulder function, associated with initial poor analgesia, impacts on quality of life long after the initial recovery period.89 These effects are all the more significant considering the young age at which many patients present. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Postoperative analgesia therefore remains a challenge for these patients despite a range of treatment options.10 Most postoperative pain in mastectomy occurs within the first 24 h of surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Inadequately managed pain in the acute postoperative phase is a major risk factor of chronic pain syndromes,5 which are present in up to 50% of patients 6 months after operation.11 Impaired shoulder function also causes significant problems postmastectomy12–14 and it has been suggested that better postoperative analgesia may enhance the effects of early physiotherapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>There is no gold standard for pain relief following mastectomy surgery.10 Morphine, the mainstay of therapy, is associated with vomiting and excessive drowsiness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Thoracic epidural and paravertebral blocks have been shown to provide adequate analgesia,10 but associated complications (eg, pneumothorax), although rare, are severe and potentially life-threatening. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Local anaesthesia wound infiltration has not been adequately studied using randomised controlled trials.10 An informal survey of current practice in the South West Peninsula of England suggested that its use is patchy and erratic, with a third of surgeons not using any at all and others reporting a range of different methods of administration and doses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The use of wound catheters to deliver continuous local anaesthetic has been shown to reduce postoperative pain and analgesic requirements in cardiothoracic, orthopaedic and general surgery.6 15 16 The nerve supply to the breast is predominantly from the lateral and anterior branches of the second to sixth intercostal nerves and the supraclavicular nerves.17 Nerves pass beneath the pectoral fascia before reaching the breast and it is here that local anaesthetic may be deposited via a catheter, as a bolus or subpectoral infusion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The ‘Pecs block’ was described in 201118 as a technique for placing local anaesthesia in the subpectoral plane at the time of surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>There have since been a number of similar descriptions of ultrasound-guided chest wall local anaesthetic techniques for use in breast surgery.19–21 Case reports and small studies indicate that these techniques are efficacious in reducing postoperative pain, however there are, as yet, no large randomised controlled trials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>So far these techniques have not been described with the use of continuous local anaesthetic infusion. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Current published research relating to postmastectomy local anaesthesia infusion is scant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis of surgically placed wound catheters concluded that there was a trend towards improved analgesia in the immediate post-operative period, however studies were underpowered and often poorly designed.22 One randomised study23 of 42 patients found no significant difference in postoperative analgesia (as measured by PCA use and pain scores) between administration of 4-hourly 20 mL bolus doses of 0.5% bupivacaine and placebo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>However, the technique tested involved infiltration via wound drains which deposited local anaesthetic in a more superficial tissue plane than the subpectoral plane and did not use a continuous infusion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Non-randomised, non-blinded, retrospective and observational studies of local anaesthetic infusion24–26 suggest more favourable results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Baroody et al25 demonstrated a fivefold reduction in analgesic requirement following local anaesthetic infusion after reconstructive breast surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Morrison et al24 compared postoperative opioid use in mastectomy patients receiving local anaesthetic infusion or no infusion and found a significant reduction in opiate use and hospital length of stay in the local anaesthetic arm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>However, this was an unblinded retrospective analysis and made no attempt to investigate chronic pain or arm mobility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Lu et al26 compared local anaesthetic infusion to placebo in patients undergoing reduction mammoplasty and reconstruction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Results showed reductions in opiate use and pain scores in the local anaesthetic group but controls were historical and the study was unblinded and not randomised. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Given the limitations of the study designs, it is currently difficult to make firm conclusions or recommendations for clinical practice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>There are no published studies assessing the impact of local anaesthetic infiltration on postoperative shoulder function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>There has recently been increased interest in postoperative local anaesthesia for the reduction of chronic pain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>A 2012 Cochrane analysis pooled the results of two trials and concluded that paravertebral block may favour the reduction of chronic pain following mastectomy in one in five patients.27 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Levobupivacaine is the S(-)-isomer of bupivacaine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>In common with other local anaesthetic agents, it is widely accepted that levobupivacaine blocks nerve conduction in sensory and motor nerves by blocking voltage sensitive sodium channels in the cell membrane. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Levobupivacaine exhibits fewer cardiovascular toxicity effects28 29 than bupivacaine and, as such, is safer for use as an infusion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>There appears to be no measurable difference in clinical effectiveness between the two agents.30 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to establish whether the use of continuous local anaesthetic infusion in the subpectoral tissue plane can improve postoperative analgesia and quality of life for patients undergoing mastectomy with or without axillary surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>If the use of this local anaesthetic infusion technique is shown to be more effective than current practice, the reduction of pain and opiate use in the immediate post-operative period would be a significant benefit to patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>The technique also holds the potential to improve patients’ quality of life by reducing the longer term risks of chronic pain and impaired shoulder function. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>The study was originally designed as a single centre study in Cornwall, but audit data prior to the study start confirmed a significant reduction in the number of mastectomies being conducted locally, following changes in the surgical team and surgical practice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>In order to achieve the required sample size, the study design was therefore amended to include two study sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>At the same time, an emerging trend for early discharge of patients postmastectomy prompted a change in the timing of primary outcome data collection from 48 to 24 h postoperatively. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>The study sample size was calculated to assess the joint aims of the effectiveness of a 24-hour continuous subpectoral local anaesthetic infusion on total morphine consumption and total pain over the 24-hour postsurgery period. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Few studies have addressed the question of what reduction in total morphine use after breast surgery might be clinically important. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>A small number of studies have reported total morphine use after breast surgery, at varying end points.32–39 Four have reported total morphine use at 24 h postsurgery; three of these were comparative studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Two of these three studies based their sample size calculations on the same prior belief that the minimum clinically important difference was 10 mg (estimated SD of 10 mg, estimated mean 24-hour total morphine consumption of 40 mg).38 39 Therefore, the minimum clinically important difference in 24 h total morphine consumption was set as 10 mg. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>These studies also showed actual SDs in 24 h post-operative total morphine consumption of 10–22 mg. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>To allow for the variability in the total morphine consumption being at the upper end of this range, the sample size calculation for total morphine consumption assumed a SD of 20 mg. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>To detect a difference of 10 mg between groups, with 80% power and at the 5% significance level, requires 65 participants per group. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there is a lack of information on which to base a formal sample size calculation for pain as the (joint) primary outcome measure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>With the sample size of 65 participants per group, there will be approximately 80% power to detect an effect size of around 0.5 SDs on the measure of pain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Such an effect size would be considered as being of ‘moderate’ size.40 From studies using a single VAS pain measure, it has been suggested that clinically meaningful differences are of the magnitude of 20–30 mm on a 100 mm VAS,41 while a recent review reported that at the group level the difference in pain levels varied from 4 to 40 mm for acute pain.42 Assuming the SD of the VAS is between 1343 44 and 26 mm,37 45 this suggests that clinically meaningful effect sizes are of the order of at least 0.8 SDs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>To detect a difference of around 0.8 SDs would need 26 patients per group, assuming a two-sided significance level of 5%, with 80% power. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the sample size of 65 participants per group will be large enough to detect clinically relevant differences between groups, in terms of pain. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measures are at 24 h with a minimal probability of drop out. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>However, enough participants will be recruited to attempt to ensure 65 participants per group are followed up at 6 months. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>As patients remain engaged with the breast service for clinical reasons, loss to follow-up is also expected to be low but there may be losses to the study because, for example, of the need for further surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in order to achieve a study sample of 65 women per group at the 6-month follow-up, the aim is to recruit a total of 160 participants over a 2-year period, which allows for a loss to follow-up rate of just under 20%. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>The lack of good quality evidence regarding the effectiveness of a continuous local anaesthetic infusion on postoperative pain following mastectomy indicates the need for well-designed clinical trials to investigate this subject. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>This is the first study to assess the use of such a continuous infusion in the subpectoral plane, as well as the first study to assess the effects on postoperative shoulder function or the development of chronic pain and will therefore give a pragmatic answer to the question of whether continuous local anaesthetic infusion in the subpectoral tissue plane should be used in these patients. </plain></SENT>
