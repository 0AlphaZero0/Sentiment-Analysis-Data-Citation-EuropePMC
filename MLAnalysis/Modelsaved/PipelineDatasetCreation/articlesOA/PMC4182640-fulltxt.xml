To study the effects of mechanisms acting on a global level, we observed with single molecule sensitivity the effects of mild acidic shift and oxidative stress on the <italic>in vivo</italic> transcription dynamics of a probe gene encoding an RNA target for MS2d-GFP, under the control of a synthetic promoter. After showing that this promoter is uninvolved in fast stress-response pathways, we compared its kinetics of transcript production under stress and in optimal conditions. We find that, following the application of either stress, the mean rates of transcription activation and of subsequent RNA production of the probe gene are reduced, particularly under oxidative stress. Meanwhile, the noise in RNA production decreases under oxidative stress, but not under acidic shift. From distributions of intervals between consecutive RNA productions, we infer that the number and duration of the rate-limiting steps in transcription initiation change, following the application of stress. These changes differ in the two stress conditions and are consistent with the changes in noise in RNA production. Overall, our measurements of the transcription initiation kinetics of the probe gene indicate that, following sub-lethal stresses, there are stress-specific changes in the dynamics of transcription initiation of the probe gene that affect its mean rate and noise of transcript production. Given the non-involvement of the probe gene in stress-response pathways, we suggest that these changes are caused by global response mechanisms of <italic>E. coli</italic> to stress.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Academy of Finland (126803 to ASR), Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation (TEKES, 40284/08 to ASR), Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (PTDC/BBB-MET/1084/2012 to ASR), and TUT President's Doctoral Programme (ABM), as well as funding for open access charge from TEKES (40284/08 to ASR).

From the analysis of when new, individual RNA molecules from the probe gene appear in the cells under stress and in optimal conditions, we address the following questions. Does stress affect the kinetics of activation of the probe gene? Does stress affect the kinetics of transcription of the probe gene following activation? Are these changes immediate or gradual? Do the effects of the two stress conditions tested differ from one another? What changes in the kinetics of the intermediate stages of transcription are responsible for the observed changes in the kinetics of RNA production from the probe gene?</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Our aim is to assess the effects of &#8220;mild&#8221; stress conditions on the dynamics of transcription of a gene uninvolved in stress-response pathways. By &#8220;mild&#8221;, we imply &#8220;cells with significantly reduced, but not null, division rates&#8221;. For this, we selected oxidative stress and acidic shift as the stress conditions since, first, it is possible to tune the degree of stress so as to attain the &#8216;mild stress&#8217; conditions. Also, the effects of both stress conditions can be observed in reasonable short time scales <xref rid="pone.0109005-Zheng2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Finally, it is possible, using a peristaltic pump for constant media refreshment, to maintain mild-stress conditions stable during the live cell imaging.</p><p>As described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Methods</xref> section, microscopy measurements were made on cells in the exponential phase (OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.45). The mild stress conditions were applied only at this stage of cell growth and after placing the cells under the microscope (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Methods</xref> section). Then, we followed, <italic>in vivo</italic> and with single-molecule sensitivity, the kinetics of transcript production of a synthetic gene on a single copy F plasmid. This gene, under the control of the <italic>lac-ara1</italic> promoter <xref rid="pone.0109005-Lutz1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, encodes an RNA with an <italic>mRFP1</italic> coding region followed by 96 binding sites for MS2d-GFP reporter proteins <xref rid="pone.0109005-Golding2" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. These are coded from a medium-copy plasmid and, by binding to the target RNA molecules as soon as these are produced, allow their quick detection.</p><p>Images of cells were taken immediately after the application of stress, once per minute, for 4 hours (under dark conditions to prevent photolytic activities), allowing quick detection of both produced RNA molecules as well as of cell division events. In general, we performed two microscopy sessions per condition, since preliminary assessments showed no significant differences between sessions and because, in each session, several independent panels can be captured, so as to maximize the number of cells observed. No significant differences were found between sessions performed in the same conditions.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Effects of the mild-stress conditions on cell division rates</title><p>To quantify the degree of stress on the cells during the measurements, we measured their division time from the images <xref rid="pone.0109005-LpezMaury1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109005-Jozefczuk1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109005-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. For that, we selected cells that were born from a cell present at the start of the measurements. In the rare cases that these cells of generation 1 (G1) did not divide until the end of the measurements, we assumed that they divided at that moment. For comparison, we obtained the same data from cells under optimal growth conditions (control). In total, we extracted this data from 477 cells in the control measurements, from 182 cells under acidic shift, and from 251 cells under oxidative stress.</p><p>The mean division time was found to be 66.7 min in control cells (optimal conditions), 87.2 min in cells under acidic shift, and 91.0 min in cells under oxidative stress, while the standard deviation of these times was found to be 38.4 min in control cells, 52.5 min in acidic shift and 70.3 min in oxidative stress. These numbers indicate that cells were stressed in the two latter conditions <xref rid="pone.0109005-LpezMaury1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109005-Jozefczuk1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109005-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. To confirm this, we performed Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests to determine whether the distributions of division times in both stress conditions could not be statistically distinguished from the distribution obtained from control cells. In both comparisons, the p-value was smaller than 10<sup>&#8722;7</sup> and, thus, we conclude that the division times differed significantly from the control (usually, for p-values smaller than 0.01 it is accepted that two distributions differ significantly). We conclude that the cells under acidic shift and oxidative stress by constant media refreshment during the microscopy measurements were mildly stressed during that period of time, similarly to when in liquid culture.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Effects of stress on the dynamics of transcription of the target gene when uninduced</title><p>Next, we verified if our target gene was, in some way, directly activated or repressed by any stress-response mechanism of <italic>E. coli</italic> to acidic shift or oxidative stress. For that, without inducing the target gene and 1 h after applying stress and inducing the plasmids coding for MS2d-GFP, we measured the number of target RNA molecules in individual cells from fluorescent microscopy images. For comparison, we also observed cells under optimal growth conditions (control). The mean number of tagged RNAs per cell equalled 0.14 in optimal, control conditions (206 cells), 0.10 in acidic shift (83 cells), and 0.16 in oxidative stress (216 cells). These mean numbers are, in all cases, much lower than in cells where the target gene is fully induced (&#8764;3 RNA/cell 1 h after induction, in optimal conditions <xref rid="pone.0109005-Kandhavelu1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>). Further, the distributions of RNA numbers in individual cells in each of the three conditions could not be statistically distinguished from one another (p-values of the three, pairwise KS tests larger than 0.01). We conclude that neither the promoter controlling the production of the RNA target for MS2d-GFP is activated or repressed by any of the response mechanisms to acidic shift or to oxidative stress, neither is the detection mechanism of target RNA molecules affected. As such, this synthetic gene (here onwards referred to as &#8216;probe&#8217; gene) can be used as a probe gene to study the kinetics of transcriptional dynamics of a promoter not belonging to stress-response pathways. As a side note, from this, it is also possible to conclude that neither stress condition affects the kinetics of binding of MS2-GFP molecules to the target RNA coded by the probe gene (e.g. by reducing the binding affinity) or the detection mechanism in any other significant way.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Effects of stress on the kinetics of activation of the target gene</title><p>Previous studies have reported that stress leads to multiple changes in the cells, including a decrease in fluidity (and, thus, permeability) of the cell membranes that, in general, delay the transcriptional response to external signals <xref rid="pone.0109005-Farr1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109005-Farr2" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0109005-Chung1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>.

Namely, we performed KS tests to compare all pairs of distributions of values of t<sub>0</sub>. We obtained p-values of 2.2&#215;10<sup>&#8722;8</sup>, 4.3&#215;10<sup>&#8722;6</sup>, and 0.0012, for the pairs of conditions control vs. oxidative, control vs. acidic shift, and oxidative vs. acidic shift, respectively. Since all p-values are much smaller than 0.01, we conclude that the activation time of the probe gene differs significantly between all conditions, in a statistical sense. In particular, this activation time is shorter in optimal, control conditions when compared to either stress condition. Also, it is significantly longer under oxidative stress than under acidic shift. The cell-to-cell variability in activation times, as measured by the squared coefficient of variation, CV<sup>2</sup>, also differs between the conditions. In particular, it equals 0.94 in control cells, 0.56 under acidic shift, and 0.46 in oxidative stress. Overall, these results provide strong evidence that the kinetics of intake of the inducer, IPTG, are significantly altered in both stress conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Effects of stress on the kinetics of transcription of the target gene</title><p>Next, we studied the temporal evolution of the kinetics of RNA production from the probe gene during the microscopy measurements, under both stress conditions. In each case, given the time scale of the duration of intervals between consecutive RNA productions and the duration of the measurements, we compare the mean and standard deviations of the intervals between consecutive RNA productions (in individual cells) that were initiated in the first hour of the measurements with those initiated during the second hour (<xref rid="pone-0109005-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). From <xref rid="pone-0109005-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, in both stress conditions, the mean duration of the intervals initiated in the second hour is longer than of those initiated during the first hour. In particular, in cells under acidic shift, they become 41% longer while in cells under oxidative stress they become 29% longer. Meanwhile, under oxidative stress, the variability of the intervals' duration (as measured by the CV<sup>2</sup>) also differs between intervals initiated during the first and the second hour, being much smaller in the latter ones. In cells under acidic shift, this quantity does not differ significantly between the two distributions of intervals. To test whether these changes in the kinetics of RNA production between the first and the second hour following the application of stress are statistically significant, we performed KS tests. We compared, for each stress condition, the distributions of interval initiated in the first and in the second hour. In both stress conditions, the p-value of the KS test was much smaller than 0.01, from which we conclude that the distributions differ, in a statistical sense. Thus, we conclude that, following the application of the stresses, there is a gradual reduction in the rate of transcription.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0109005-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0109005.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Intervals between consecutive RNA productions in individual cells.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0109005-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0109005.t001"/></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><label/><p>Number of cells analysed from start to end of the measurement period, number of intervals between productions of consecutive RNA molecules in individual cells collected, mean duration (&#956;<sub>&#916;t</sub>) and standard deviation (&#963;<sub>&#916;t</sub>) of the intervals' durations for the first and for the second hour, and squared coefficient of variation (&#963;<sub>&#916;t</sub>

In control conditions, the mean of the intervals equalled 898 s and the CV<sup>2</sup> equalled 0.60, throughout the two hours of measurements. As such, for cells under acidic shift, only the distribution of intervals initiated during the second hour of the measurements differed from the control (p-value&lt;0.01 for intervals initiated in the second hour, and p-value of 0.82 for intervals initiated in the first hour). Meanwhile, in cells under oxidative stress, the changes in the kinetics of RNA production with stress appear to occur faster, since both the intervals initiated in the first hour and the intervals initiated in the second hour differed from the control (both p-values&lt;0.01).</p><p>Given the difference in the values of the CV<sup>2</sup> of the duration of the intervals initiated in the first hour and of the intervals initiated in the second hour of the measurements, one expects the cell to cell diversity in numbers of RNA molecules produced during those two periods of time to differ significantly.

From this, we found that under acidic shift this quantity equalled &#8764;1.7 at both time moments. However, under oxidative stress, it equalled &#8764;1.8 at the end of the first hour, and &#8764;1.2 at the end of the second hour. We conclude that the decrease over time in the variability of the duration of intervals between consecutive RNA molecules in cells under oxidative stress significantly affects the cell to cell diversity in RNA numbers.</p><p>It is of interest to note that, while RNA production is a sub-Poissonian process (CV<sup>2</sup> of the intervals smaller than 1), the Fano factors of the numbers of RNA molecules are larger than 1. This is due to the dependence of the latter quantity, and only the latter quantity, on the variability between cells' lifetime and errors in partitioning of the tagged RNA molecules in cell division <xref rid="pone.0109005-LloydPrice1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, among other factors.</p><p>Finally, in comparison to the control, the mean duration of the intervals between productions of consecutive RNAs by the probe gene increased by 62% under acidic shift and by 112% under oxidative stress (log10 ratios of 0.2 and 0.32, respectively).

These increases are such that the ratio between them remained similar to the ratio in the control (one step is approximately double the length of the other), which can explain why the noise in transcription in this stress condition did not differ significantly from the control. On the other hand, according to the model of transcription inferred for cells under oxidative stress, the reduction in the transcript rate was achieved not only by increasing the duration of the two steps but also by an additional step in transcription becoming rate-limiting.

As explained in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">methods</xref> section, this is due to an unknown artefact that favours solutions where the intermediate steps are of identical size, when the steps are of similar duration. We performed a rough estimation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">methods</xref>) based on the number of samples of the minimum ratio between these durations that would allow the inference algorithm to be more likely to return a non-gamma solution. This ratio equalled 1.30. Thus, using this method of inference, we can only conclude that the three rate-limiting steps differ in duration by less than 30% in this case.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>From the moments of appearance of the first target RNA and the subsequent time intervals between consecutive target RNA productions in individual, live cells, we studied the kinetics of transcription of a synthetic probe gene, following its induction, in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells subject to sub-lethal stress conditions, acidic shift and oxidative stress. In particular, we studied how this kinetics changes over time due to the metabolomic and transcriptomic changes that cells undergo under the mild stress conditions. To control the production of the target RNA, we used the <italic>lac/ara-1</italic> promoter, which we verified to be not directly affected by the stress-response mechanisms to the two stress conditions studied here.</p><p>First, we observed that the activation of the probe gene by external induction (as measured by the appearance of the first target RNA) was slower in stressed cells. The duration of this delay was found to be stress-dependent. This observation is in agreement with previous observations of genome-wide delays in transcriptional responses to external signals in cells subject to stress conditions <xref rid="pone.0109005-Farr1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109005-Farr2" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0109005-Chung1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. Notably, the activation time measured here includes both the time for a cell to intake inducers from the medium as well as the time to produce the first RNA, once the promoter is activated by the inducers <xref rid="pone.0109005-Mkel1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Since the kinetics of transcription of activated genes did not differ widely from the control during the first hour following the application of stress (e.g. under acidic shift, no changes were detected), the main cause for the increase in the time for the appearance of the first RNA in the cells is likely a decreased rate of intake of inducers (IPTG), via diffusion through the membrane <xref rid="pone.0109005-Jensen1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>, by the stressed cells. This would be in agreement with the known reduction of membrane fluidity due to the down-regulation of OMP proteins under stress <xref rid="pone.0109005-Farr1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109005-Kanjee1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109005-Farr2" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0109005-Chung1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. Finally, since the increase in the time for the first RNA to appear in the cells differed in the two stress conditions tested, it is reasonable to hypothesize that <italic>E. coli</italic> is able to fine-tune this decrease in fluidity of IPTG. Future studies should provide more information.</p><p>Next, we compared the distributions of intervals between consecutive transcription events in individual cells when under stress and when in optimal conditions. As part of the global response to stress, we observed a gradual, significant reduction of activity of the activated probe gene in stressed cells, in agreement with previous studies <xref rid="pone.0109005-Farr1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109005-Farr2" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109005-Chung1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. Both the degree and speed of this reduction, confirmed by qPCR, are stress-dependent. Under oxidative stress, the kinetics of transcription changed rapidly. Under acidic shift, the kinetics only differed significantly from the control in the second hour. This is, perhaps, not surprising, given the acid tolerance system in enteric bacteria <xref rid="pone.0109005-Bearson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109005-Leyer1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109005-Foster1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. Overall, the changes in the mean rate of RNA production (up to 40%) and in the degree of noise (up to 100%, as measured by the CV<sup>2</sup>) ought to be of significance to the cells' phenotype, as they are expected to affect significantly both the mean and variability of protein numbers. As a side note, these results support the hypothesis that the genome-wide reduction in RNA and protein numbers of genes unrelated to stress <xref rid="pone.0109005-Farr1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109005-Farr2" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109005-Yuk1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref> is achieved by <italic>E. coli</italic> by decreasing transcription rates (suggested in <xref rid="pone.0109005-Tucker1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109005-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>) rather then, e.g. increasing the rates of RNA and/or protein degradation (which would be more energy-consuming).</p><p>Also as a side note, we did not assess whether the copy number of the single-copy F plasmid coding for the probe RNA was affected by the stress conditions. The observed reduction of activity suggests that the copy numbers did not increase. Also, there is no evidence of plasmid loss, as the activity reduction observed is not based on a halting of transcription in some cells. Nevertheless, such plasmid-loss would not have affected the conclusions, as these are based on the time for the first RNA to be produced and on the duration of intervals between consecutive RNAs in each cell.</p><p>Notably, the graduality of the stress responses in the transcription kinetics of the probe gene, supports the hypothesis that they are indirect consequences of the global response mechanisms to stress of <italic>E. coli</italic>. If, instead, the observed changes were due to changes in the physical parameters of the probe system (e.g. in the binding affinity of the MS2d-GFP proteins to the target RNA), or of the cell cytoplasm or membrane, they should have occurred rapidly. That is, its effects should be visible in the first hour following the application of stress, and remain stable thereafter. Instead, we expect the observed gradual changes to be a result of a changing cellular physiology due to the stress-response mechanisms, which take at least 30 to 60 minutes to occur, depending on the severity of the stress conditions <xref rid="pone.0109005-Jozefczuk1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109005-Gasch1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>.</p><p>Finally, our results showed that the changes with stress on the dynamics of RNA production of the probe gene occurred at the level of the number and duration of the rate-limiting steps in transcription initiation, which allows tuning both rate and noise level in RNA production. Importantly, the changes were found to be stress-dependent.</p><p>Interestingly, while a change in the steps' duration, particularly of the closed complex formation, can be explained by, e.g., a decrease in the number of available RNA polymerases, changes in the kinetics and number of subsequent steps (e.g. open complex formation and promoter escape) require changes in the kinetics of interaction between RNA polymerase and promoter region of the target gene. Because of this, we hypothesize that the changes observed, in particular the increase in the number of rate-limiting steps under oxidative stress, were caused by changes in the populations of molecules component of, or regulators of, the RNA polymerase.

This increase is stress-dependent. Interestingly, the cell-to-cell variability in activation times decreased significantly in stressed cells, from which we conclude that the effects of stress on the cells' intake processes were fairly homogenous.</p><p>The changes in the distributions of intervals between consecutive RNA productions following the application of stress allow concluding that, in stressed cells, the rate of transcript production by the probe gene decreases gradually. From the analysis of these distributions of intervals it was further possible to infer how the RNA production rates were reduced. While under acidic shift this reduction was achieved by an increase in duration of the same two rate-limiting steps in transcription observed under optimal conditions, under oxidative stress a third rate limiting step emerged, explaining how it was possible to achieve a strong reduction of the noise in RNA production as well.</p><p>Overall, we conclude that, following the application of stress conditions, there are stress-specific, gradual changes in the transcription dynamics of genes uninvolved in stress-response pathways. The non-involvement of the probe gene in the stress-response pathways and the time necessary for the changes to occur suggest that these changes are an outcome of the global stress-response mechanisms of <italic>E. coli</italic>. The differences in the changes observed in the two tested stress conditions suggest that these mechanisms possess significant sensitivity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s5"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s5a"><title>Chemicals</title><p>The components of Lysogeny Broth (LB) (Tryptone, Yeast extract and NaCl) and antibiotics for <italic>E. coli</italic> cultures are from Sigma-Aldrich (Finland).

Intervals between RNAs of different cells (e.g. the last RNA of a mother cell and the first RNA of a daughter cell) were not recorded. These intervals were collected from the first two hours of the measurements, following the application of stress. For this, and to remove false correlations between the length of the intervals and the cell lifetime or the time for the first RNA to appear in a cell, we proceeded with a method similar to the one used in <xref rid="pone.0109005-Mkel1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Namely, the intervals between consecutive RNAs in each cell were collected only for a time window of size t<sub>c</sub>, after the appearance of the first RNA of that interval.</p><p>By imposing a fixed value of t<sub>c</sub> for all cells, the probability of appearance of the next RNA molecule during that period becomes uniform for all cells, irrespective of their division time. Here, the value of t<sub>c</sub> was set to 75 minutes so as to minimize the probability mass being cut off from the distributions of intervals. We note that, to search for changes in the kinetics of RNA production over time, we recorded at which moment each interval was initiated, following the application of stress. This allows us to compare the distributions of intervals that were initiated during the first hour following the application of stress with the distributions of intervals that were initiated during the second hour.</p><p>Also, for the population images taken to check for the effects of stress on the dynamics of transcription of the target gene when uninduced, the total number of RNA molecules in the cells at a given moment in time was extracted not by the jump detection method, but from the total spot intensity distribution from all cells in an image as in <xref rid="pone.0109005-Golding2" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. For this, the first peak of the distribution is set to correspond to the intensity of a single RNA. The number of tagged RNAs in each spot can be estimated by dividing its intensity by that of the first peak. Finally, we extracted the time, t<sub>0</sub>, for the first target RNA to appear in each of the cells present at the start of the imaging <xref rid="pone.0109005-Mkel1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, except for those few cells already containing a target RNA at the start.</p></sec><sec id="s5i"><title>Inference of the number and duration of the sequential steps in transcription</title><p>The duration of each rate-limiting step in transcription, as well as their total number, can be obtained for each condition from the distributions of intervals between consecutive RNA productions as in <xref rid="pone.0109005-Kandhavelu1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109005-Muthukrishnan1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. The inference method, for a given number of steps, assumes only that the duration of each step follows an independent exponential distribution. Given this, the most likely durations of the steps can be determined by maximum likelihood. The number of steps can then be determined by a likelihood-ratio test between pairs of models to reject a lower-degree model in favour of a higher-degree one. Finally, the goodness of fit of the preferred model can be independently evaluated by a KS test between the inferred model and the measured data.</p><p>This method does not inform on the temporal order of the inferred steps. Also, as reported in <xref rid="pone.0109005-Kandhavelu1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109005-Muthukrishnan1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, due to an unknown artifact, when the duration of the steps is similar, this method may favour solutions where the intermediate steps are of identical size. Increasing the number of samples used for the inference will decrease the size of the difference between the two steps below which this problem occurs. However, using models of transcription with exponentially distributed steps, it is possible to determine the smallest relative difference between two steps that our method of inference can distinguish, for given number of samples (i.e. of intervals between consecutive transcription events). For example, we verified that it reliably distinguishes the duration of each step, when these differ by &#8764;25% or more in duration, from sets of &#8764;250 intervals sampled from a model of gene expression. For smaller differences, the solution becomes biased towards identical values unless more samples are provided.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0109005.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
