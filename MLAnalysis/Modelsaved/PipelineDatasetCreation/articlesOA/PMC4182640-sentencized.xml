</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Bacteria possess stress-response mechanisms [1]–[5] which, in response to sensing signals, orchestrate organized responses that lead to or include rapid changes in the cellular metabolism [1], [3], [5]–[9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>These responses have both specific and global effects on the gene expression profile [6], [10]–[14]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Studies using two-dimensional gels and transposable lac fusions [15] initially identified specific responses to stress conditions such as temperature shifts [16], pH shifts [17] DNA damage [18] and starvation [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In particular, it was identified that these conditions activate specific sets of genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In general, the genes activated code for proteins governing the repair and recovery mechanisms and are responsible for altering the metabolic state [6], [20], [21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide microarray studies revealed changes in the transcriptomic profile, such as the up-regulation and down-regulation of specific groups of genes in response to stress inducers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>For example, when subject to acidic conditions, genes encoding glutamate decarboxylase, gadA and gadB are significantly induced, which provides acid resistance via consumption of protons leaking into cells during extreme acidic conditions [22], [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Another study [14] distinguished three classes of changes in gene expression following rapid acid treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>These are up-regulation with recovery (e.g. fimB, ygaC, and yodA), up-regulation without recovery (hdeB, glpF, and hdeA) and, delayed response to acid (e.g., nuo and hsl). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The delayed acid response was hypothesized to be a secondary effect of an acid-associated metabolism, rather than a direct response to cytoplasmic acidification [14]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Similarly, being a facultative anaerobe, E. coli also has the means to deal with oxidative stress [24]–[27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The adaptive response to reactive oxygen species (ROS) exposure, such as super oxide and peroxide is triggered by regulons, namely, SoxRS and OxyR [28]–[30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The SoxRS regulon prevents cellular damage by superoxide and nitric oxide by activating the superoxide dismutase system [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, the OxyR regulon protects cells from damage by peroxides such as Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by coding for a transcriptional activator, OxyR, which activates genes encoding catalases (katG), alkyl hydrogen peroxide reductases (ahpCF), and small regulatory RNA (OxyS) [31], [32]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Aside the triggering of specific responses, there are also global changes in the expression level of genes that, while unrelated to stress-response regulators or effectors [6], [7], [22], [33], are instead involved in metabolism regulation, membrane transport, transcription and translation, among others [9], [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>These global changes are believed to balance energy-efficient growth with the costs of increased activity of stress-related genes [7], aiding survival at reduced growth rates [4], [5], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Some of these global changes are believed to be implemented by alternative sigma (σ) factors [4], [10], [11], [33], [35] and small nucleotides accumulated in stress conditions, namely, guanosine pentaphosphate or tetraphosphate (p) ppGpp [6], [36], [37], among others. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Gene expression dynamics in E. coli are believed to be mainly controlled at the stage of transcription, particularly its initiation [38], since subsequent stages, namely elongation and termination, as well as translation elongation, are much faster [39]–[42] and only rarely are halted or prematurely terminated [43], [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Transcription initiation is a multi-stepped process [45]. In vitro [45]–[47] and recent in vivo studies [48]–[52] showed that, under optimal conditions for the promoters studied, at least two of the steps in transcription initiation limit the rate of RNA production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Namely, their dynamics of RNA production is well fit by a sub-Poissonian model of two or more steps, each exponentially distributed in duration [48]–[52]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The RNA production kinetics is regulated by molecules that affect the duration of these steps [45], [50], [53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The duration of these steps is also influenced by environmental factors [52], [54], is sensitive to small changes in the promoter sequence [54], and varies from one event to the next [48]–[52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The latter is a strong source of noise in RNA production [48]–[52]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Previous studies using MS2d-GFP tagging of RNA showed that, in stable environmental conditions, once the target gene is activated and if the inducer concentration is kept constant, the mean rate of transcript production does not change significantly over time [48], [51], [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained using microarrays, at a genome wide level [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, stress-response mechanisms alter the cellular metabolism [7], [9], [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that such changes include a reduction in the expression rate of many non-stress-related genes [34]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigate how mild acidic shift [17], [22] and oxidative stress [9], [24], [25] affect the in vivo transcriptional kinetics of a probe gene under the control of a synthetic promoter (Plac/ara-1) uninvolved in stress-response pathways. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>By “mild”, we imply “cells with significantly reduced, but not null, division rates”. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>For this, we selected oxidative stress and acidic shift as the stress conditions since, first, it is possible to tune the degree of stress so as to attain the ‘mild stress’ conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Also, the effects of both stress conditions can be observed in reasonable short time scales [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Finally, it is possible, using a peristaltic pump for constant media refreshment, to maintain mild-stress conditions stable during the live cell imaging. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>As described in the Methods section, microscopy measurements were made on cells in the exponential phase (OD600 of 0.45). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The mild stress conditions were applied only at this stage of cell growth and after placing the cells under the microscope (see Methods section). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Then, we followed, in vivo and with single-molecule sensitivity, the kinetics of transcript production of a synthetic gene on a single copy F plasmid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>This gene, under the control of the lac-ara1 promoter [46], encodes an RNA with an mRFP1 coding region followed by 96 binding sites for MS2d-GFP reporter proteins [55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>These are coded from a medium-copy plasmid and, by binding to the target RNA molecules as soon as these are produced, allow their quick detection. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Images of cells were taken immediately after the application of stress, once per minute, for 4 hours (under dark conditions to prevent photolytic activities), allowing quick detection of both produced RNA molecules as well as of cell division events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>In general, we performed two microscopy sessions per condition, since preliminary assessments showed no significant differences between sessions and because, in each session, several independent panels can be captured, so as to maximize the number of cells observed. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>To quantify the degree of stress on the cells during the measurements, we measured their division time from the images [7], [9], [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>For that, we selected cells that were born from a cell present at the start of the measurements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>In the rare cases that these cells of generation 1 (G1) did not divide until the end of the measurements, we assumed that they divided at that moment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>For comparison, we obtained the same data from cells under optimal growth conditions (control). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>In total, we extracted this data from 477 cells in the control measurements, from 182 cells under acidic shift, and from 251 cells under oxidative stress. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>The mean division time was found to be 66.7 min in control cells (optimal conditions), 87.2 min in cells under acidic shift, and 91.0 min in cells under oxidative stress, while the standard deviation of these times was found to be 38.4 min in control cells, 52.5 min in acidic shift and 70.3 min in oxidative stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>These numbers indicate that cells were stressed in the two latter conditions [7], [9], [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>To confirm this, we performed Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests to determine whether the distributions of division times in both stress conditions could not be statistically distinguished from the distribution obtained from control cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>In both comparisons, the p-value was smaller than 10−7 and, thus, we conclude that the division times differed significantly from the control (usually, for p-values smaller than 0.01 it is accepted that two distributions differ significantly). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the cells under acidic shift and oxidative stress by constant media refreshment during the microscopy measurements were mildly stressed during that period of time, similarly to when in liquid culture. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Next, we verified if our target gene was, in some way, directly activated or repressed by any stress-response mechanism of E. coli to acidic shift or oxidative stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>For that, without inducing the target gene and 1 h after applying stress and inducing the plasmids coding for MS2d-GFP, we measured the number of target RNA molecules in individual cells from fluorescent microscopy images. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>For comparison, we also observed cells under optimal growth conditions (control). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>The mean number of tagged RNAs per cell equalled 0.14 in optimal, control conditions (206 cells), 0.10 in acidic shift (83 cells), and 0.16 in oxidative stress (216 cells). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>These mean numbers are, in all cases, much lower than in cells where the target gene is fully induced (∼3 RNA/cell 1 h after induction, in optimal conditions [48]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Further, the distributions of RNA numbers in individual cells in each of the three conditions could not be statistically distinguished from one another (p-values of the three, pairwise KS tests larger than 0.01). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>We conclude that neither the promoter controlling the production of the RNA target for MS2d-GFP is activated or repressed by any of the response mechanisms to acidic shift or to oxidative stress, neither is the detection mechanism of target RNA molecules affected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>As such, this synthetic gene (here onwards referred to as ‘probe’ gene) can be used as a probe gene to study the kinetics of transcriptional dynamics of a promoter not belonging to stress-response pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>As a side note, from this, it is also possible to conclude that neither stress condition affects the kinetics of binding of MS2-GFP molecules to the target RNA coded by the probe gene (e.g. by reducing the binding affinity) or the detection mechanism in any other significant way. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Therefore, from the time lapse microscopy measurements, we first studied how acidic shift and oxidative stress affect the activation time of our target gene in individual cells, following the introduction of the inducer, IPTG, in the media of cells under microscopy observation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>From cells present at the start of the measurements, we extracted the time for the first target RNA to appear in each cell (named ‘activation time’, t0), in each stress condition and in control conditions, for comparison. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>From the inferred models (Table 3) we find that, compared to the control, the mean rate of transcription initiation in cells under acidic shift was reduced via an increase of the duration of the two rate-limiting steps. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, according to the model of transcription inferred for cells under oxidative stress, the reduction in the transcript rate was achieved not only by increasing the duration of the two steps but also by an additional step in transcription becoming rate-limiting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Note that, provided that transcription is a multi-step process [45]–[48], [50], [52], [54], [67] and that each step follows an exponential distribution in duration, values of CV2&lt;0.5 are possible only if there are at least three rate-limiting steps (as confirmed by the inference procedure). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Relevantly, it is noted that the rate-limiting steps detected likely occur in transcription initiation rather than elongation, since elongation only lasts for tens of seconds [43], [68] while the changes in the intervals between consecutive RNAs were of the order of hundreds of seconds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Further, events in elongation (e.g. transcriptional pauses) will contribute to the variability of the intervals, but not to their mean duration. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>From the moments of appearance of the first target RNA and the subsequent time intervals between consecutive target RNA productions in individual, live cells, we studied the kinetics of transcription of a synthetic probe gene, following its induction, in E. coli cells subject to sub-lethal stress conditions, acidic shift and oxidative stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>In particular, we studied how this kinetics changes over time due to the metabolomic and transcriptomic changes that cells undergo under the mild stress conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>To control the production of the target RNA, we used the lac/ara-1 promoter, which we verified to be not directly affected by the stress-response mechanisms to the two stress conditions studied here. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>First, we observed that the activation of the probe gene by external induction (as measured by the appearance of the first target RNA) was slower in stressed cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>The duration of this delay was found to be stress-dependent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>This observation is in agreement with previous observations of genome-wide delays in transcriptional responses to external signals in cells subject to stress conditions [21], [56]–[58]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Notably, the activation time measured here includes both the time for a cell to intake inducers from the medium as well as the time to produce the first RNA, once the promoter is activated by the inducers [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Since the kinetics of transcription of activated genes did not differ widely from the control during the first hour following the application of stress (e.g. under acidic shift, no changes were detected), the main cause for the increase in the time for the appearance of the first RNA in the cells is likely a decreased rate of intake of inducers (IPTG), via diffusion through the membrane [63], by the stressed cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>This would be in agreement with the known reduction of membrane fluidity due to the down-regulation of OMP proteins under stress [21], [23], [56]–[58]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Finally, since the increase in the time for the first RNA to appear in the cells differed in the two stress conditions tested, it is reasonable to hypothesize that E. coli is able to fine-tune this decrease in fluidity of IPTG. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Future studies should provide more information. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Next, we compared the distributions of intervals between consecutive transcription events in individual cells when under stress and when in optimal conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>As part of the global response to stress, we observed a gradual, significant reduction of activity of the activated probe gene in stressed cells, in agreement with previous studies [21], [56], [58]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Both the degree and speed of this reduction, confirmed by qPCR, are stress-dependent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Under oxidative stress, the kinetics of transcription changed rapidly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Under acidic shift, the kinetics only differed significantly from the control in the second hour. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>This is, perhaps, not surprising, given the acid tolerance system in enteric bacteria [20], [64], [65]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Overall, the changes in the mean rate of RNA production (up to 40%) and in the degree of noise (up to 100%, as measured by the CV2) ought to be of significance to the cells' phenotype, as they are expected to affect significantly both the mean and variability of protein numbers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>As a side note, these results support the hypothesis that the genome-wide reduction in RNA and protein numbers of genes unrelated to stress [21], [56], [57] is achieved by E. coli by decreasing transcription rates (suggested in [22], [34]) rather then, e.g. increasing the rates of RNA and/or protein degradation (which would be more energy-consuming). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Also as a side note, we did not assess whether the copy number of the single-copy F plasmid coding for the probe RNA was affected by the stress conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>The observed reduction of activity suggests that the copy numbers did not increase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Also, there is no evidence of plasmid loss, as the activity reduction observed is not based on a halting of transcription in some cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, such plasmid-loss would not have affected the conclusions, as these are based on the time for the first RNA to be produced and on the duration of intervals between consecutive RNAs in each cell. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Notably, the graduality of the stress responses in the transcription kinetics of the probe gene, supports the hypothesis that they are indirect consequences of the global response mechanisms to stress of E. coli. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>If, instead, the observed changes were due to changes in the physical parameters of the probe system (e.g. in the binding affinity of the MS2d-GFP proteins to the target RNA), or of the cell cytoplasm or membrane, they should have occurred rapidly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>That is, its effects should be visible in the first hour following the application of stress, and remain stable thereafter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Instead, we expect the observed gradual changes to be a result of a changing cellular physiology due to the stress-response mechanisms, which take at least 30 to 60 minutes to occur, depending on the severity of the stress conditions [9], [66]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Finally, our results showed that the changes with stress on the dynamics of RNA production of the probe gene occurred at the level of the number and duration of the rate-limiting steps in transcription initiation, which allows tuning both rate and noise level in RNA production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the changes were found to be stress-dependent. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, while a change in the steps' duration, particularly of the closed complex formation, can be explained by, e.g., a decrease in the number of available RNA polymerases, changes in the kinetics and number of subsequent steps (e.g. open complex formation and promoter escape) require changes in the kinetics of interaction between RNA polymerase and promoter region of the target gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Because of this, we hypothesize that the changes observed, in particular the increase in the number of rate-limiting steps under oxidative stress, were caused by changes in the populations of molecules component of, or regulators of, the RNA polymerase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that changes in the populations of σ factors [4], [10], [11], [33], [35] or ppGpp and pppGpp molecules [36], [37], [69] are the most likely explanations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Future studies are needed to assess this. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>The duration of each rate-limiting step in transcription, as well as their total number, can be obtained for each condition from the distributions of intervals between consecutive RNA productions as in [48], [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>The inference method, for a given number of steps, assumes only that the duration of each step follows an independent exponential distribution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>Given this, the most likely durations of the steps can be determined by maximum likelihood. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>Also, as reported in [48], [52], due to an unknown artifact, when the duration of the steps is similar, this method may favour solutions where the intermediate steps are of identical size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>Increasing the number of samples used for the inference will decrease the size of the difference between the two steps below which this problem occurs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>However, using models of transcription with exponentially distributed steps, it is possible to determine the smallest relative difference between two steps that our method of inference can distinguish, for given number of samples (i.e. of intervals between consecutive transcription events). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>For example, we verified that it reliably distinguishes the duration of each step, when these differ by ∼25% or more in duration, from sets of ∼250 intervals sampled from a model of gene expression. </plain></SENT>
