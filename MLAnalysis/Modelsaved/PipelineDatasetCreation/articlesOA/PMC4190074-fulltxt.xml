Chickpea productivity is adversely affected by a large number of biotic and abiotic stresses. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in the regulation of plant responses to several biotic and abiotic stresses. This study is the first attempt to identify chickpea miRNAs that are associated with biotic and abiotic stresses. The wilt infection that is caused by the fungus <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> f.sp. <italic>ciceris</italic> is one of the major diseases severely affecting chickpea yields. Of late, increasing soil salinization has become a major problem in realizing these potential yields. Three chickpea libraries using fungal-infected, salt-treated and untreated seedlings were constructed and sequenced using next-generation sequencing technology. A total of 12,135,571 unique reads were obtained. In addition to 122 conserved miRNAs belonging to 25 different families, 59 novel miRNAs along with their star sequences were identified. Four legume-specific miRNAs, including miR5213, miR5232, miR2111 and miR2118, were found in all of the libraries. Poly(A)-based qRT-PCR (Quantitative real-time PCR) was used to validate eleven conserved and five novel miRNAs. miR530 was highly up regulated in response to fungal infection, which targets genes encoding zinc knuckle- and microtubule-associated proteins. Many miRNAs responded in a similar fashion under both biotic and abiotic stresses, indicating the existence of cross talk between the pathways that are involved in regulating these stresses. The potential target genes for the conserved and novel miRNAs were predicted based on sequence homologies. miR166 targets a HD-ZIPIII transcription factor and was validated by 5&#8242; RLM-RACE. This study has identified several conserved and novel miRNAs in the chickpea that are associated with gene regulation following exposure to wilt and salt stress.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by a grant from ICAR-Network Project on Trasgenic Crops (Functional Genomics Component) no. 2049/3003.

These RNAs participate in the regulation of target genes by binding to complementary mRNAs, resulting in either their cleavage or translational repression. miRNAs are involved in diverse processes in different organisms, including developmental timing in worms, cell death and fat metabolism in flies, hematopoiesis in mammals and leaf development, floral patterning and environmental stress responses in plants <xref rid="pone.0108851-Bartel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>
<italic>MIRNA</italic> genes are transcribed as independent transcriptional units by RNA polymerase II enzymes to generate primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs). pri-miRNAs form imperfect folded structures that are processed by Dicer-like1 nuclease (a member of the RNase III endonuclease family) to precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs). The secondary structures of these precursors are well conserved in plants. The pre-miRNA contains a miRNA-star miRNA (miRNA*) intermediate duplex from which the miRNA* eventually is degraded. However, recent studies have revealed the higher accumulation of miRNA* under certain conditions in plants, indicating the probable role of miRNAs in modulating plant growth and development <xref rid="pone.0108851-Sunkar1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Mature miRNAs are 19 to 24 nucleotides (nt) in length and interact with an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to cleave specific target mRNAs or inhibit their translation. This complementarity plays an important role in determining the fate of the mRNA. When the complementarity between the miRNA and mRNA is perfect or near perfect, the mRNA is cleaved; however, if there are many mismatches between them, translational repression occurs. There are also instances in which miRNAs and mRNAs with perfect complementarities lead to the repression of translation and not to the usual cleavage.</p><p>The first identified miRNAs were lin4 and let7 in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, which is a model nematode <xref rid="pone.0108851-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108851-Reinhart1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The first plant miRNAs were identified in Arabidopsis <xref rid="pone.0108851-Reinhart2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and later in other plants. Currently, 7,321 mature miRNAs have been reported in 72 plant species (miRBase version 20) <xref rid="pone.0108851-Kozomara1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Among dicots, the maximum number of miRNAs occurs in the legume family (1,460), followed by Brassicaceae (863). Although the legume family has the best representation in terms of the number of miRNAs, chickpea is a notable omission from the list.</p><p>Chickpea (<italic>Cicer arietinum</italic>) is the world's second most widely grown legume and is cultivated in more than 40 countries. The Indian subcontinent is the principal chickpea-producing and consuming region, contributing almost 70% of the world's total production <xref rid="pone.0108851-FAOSTAT1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Chickpea seeds are a rich source of protein and starch for the human population and the records of chickpea cultivation date back to 6,000 BC. Globally, chickpea is grown on 11.5 million hectares (ha) to produce 10.4 million tons with an average yield of approximately 0.9 t/ha, which is far below its yield potential of 6 t/ha under optimal growth conditions <xref rid="pone.0108851-FAOSTAT1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The disparity between the actual and potential yields can be explained by large numbers of biotic and abiotic stresses that adversely affect its productivity. Among the biotic stresses, wilt infection that is caused by the fungus <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> f.sp. <italic>ciceris</italic> is a major concern. Abiotic stress conditions, such as terminal drought and salt stress, also lead to major losses. ICC4958 is a drought tolerant chickpea cultivar and gets affected at terminal drought, which occurs at the pod filling and seed-developing stage of the crop <xref rid="pone.0108851-Boominathan1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108851-Deokar1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, recent studies on salinity tolerance and ion accumulation in chickpea have revealed it as a highly sensitive crop to salinity when compared to other species in cropping systems <xref rid="pone.0108851-Flowers1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108851-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Thus, salinity is another major constraint in chickpea yield. A better understanding of genes and their interactions with the environment can play a very important and determinant role in tackling these stress conditions. The recently available transcriptome and genome sequences that have been reported by independent groups are important resources that will facilitate the attainment of these goals in the chickpea <xref rid="pone.0108851-Agarwal1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108851-Varshney1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108851-Jain1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Hu et al. (2013) identified 28 potential miRNA candidates belonging to 20 families from 16 ESTs and 12 GSSs in the chickpea using a comparative genome-based computational analysis <xref rid="pone.0108851-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. A total of 664 miRNA targets were predicted, including genes encoding transcription factors (TFs) in addition to those that function in the stress response, signal transduction, methylation and a variety of other metabolic processes. These findings lay the foundation for the elucidation of miRNA function in the development and stress responses of the chickpea.</p><p>miRNAs have been discovered primarily using direct cloning and bioinformatic approaches. All of the miRNAs in plants have been identified via the cloning of small RNAs or a computational approach, in which the homologs of known miRNAs are searched. We have generated small RNA libraries corresponding with the control conditions, Fusarium wilt infection and salt stress, which were sequenced using the Illumina sequencing platform to identify miRNAs in the chickpea. This study is the first report in which small RNA libraries have been constructed and sequenced to identify miRNAs in the chickpea.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Sequence analyses</title><p>Three separate small RNA libraries that were constructed from the total RNA of the control, Fusarium wilt-infected and salt-stressed plants were subjected to Illumina Solexa sequencing. This sequencing generated 29,170,463 raw reads, which after processing by UEA sRNA workbench 2.4- Plant version sequence file pre-processing tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://srna-tools.cmp.uea.ac.uk/">http://srna-tools.cmp.uea.ac.uk/</ext-link>), produced approximately 12,135,571 total unique reads (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108851-t001">Table 1</xref>). After removing the adaptor sequences, filtering the low-quality tags and eliminating the t/rRNA sequences, the putative small RNA population accounted for approximately 88.5%, 79.1% and 78.4% in the control, wilt-infected and salt-stressed libraries, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108851.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The majority of small RNAs (approximately 50%) from the control and salt-stressed libraries were 24 nt in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108851-g001">Figure 1</xref>), which is similar to other plant species, such as <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> and <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic>

Notably, in the wilt-infected library, small RNAs that were 20 nt in length accounted for 20% of the population, but when unique reads were analyzed, the small RNA distribution revealed that 24 nt was the major size class.

In soybean, the unique and redundant sequence classes possessed 24 nt and 23 nt long small RNAs, respectively, as the most abundant sequences. For the differential expression analysis, the total numbers of miRNA reads in each given sample were normalized as transcripts per million, and the fold changes between the treated and control samples were calculated. Out of 122 conserved miRNAs, 44 were upregulated in response to wilt stress, but in the case of salt stress, the number of down regulated miRNAs was greater than that which was observed in response to wilt stress. However, the differential expression of novel miRNAs under both of these stresses showed relatively similar patterns, with approximately 60% of the miRNAs being down regulated under either wilt and/or salt stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108851-g002">Figure 2a, b</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0108851-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0108851.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Length distribution of small RNA population.</title><p>Size distributions of the miRNAs in the three chickpea libraries.

The small RNA sequences that matched the known miRNAs from the miRBase database were identified as conserved miRNAs in the chickpea. The sequence analyses revealed the presence of 122 miRNAs belonging to 25 conserved families. The most abundant family was miR156 with 14 members. Among the others, miR171 (12 members), miR169 and miR172 (9 members each), miR166 and miR167 (8 members each), miR319 and miR399 (6 members each) and miR396 (5 members) were present. The remaining miRNA families had less than five members, with some families, such as miR530, miR162, miR5232 and miR408, being represented by only one member (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108851-t002">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108851.s002">Table S1</xref>).

Accordingly, miR5232 may be a legume-specific miRNA that is involved in the biotic stress response. The multiple sequence alignment of the mature miRNAs in addition to the precursor sequences of these four legume-specific miRNAs revealed that they were most closely similar to Medicago and consequently has been conserved throughout evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108851-g003">Figure 3a, 3b</xref>).

The target prediction analysis revealed the involvement of some of the miRNAs in regulating metabolic processes through the target genes. In chickpea, miR159 is involved in the metabolism of amino acids, fatty acids and lipids. One of the target genes of miR159 encodes acyltransferase, which is essential for ester biosynthesis.

Greater increases in miRNA expression were observed following wilt stress compared with salt stress, suggesting the significant role of small RNAs in the response to pathogen attack.

Four legume-specific miRNAs were identified in the chickpea libraries, including miR2111, miR2118, miR5232 and miR5213, which were previously reported in Medicago. The sequence conservation among the different legumes and the precursor sequence similarity of these four chickpea miRNAs further substantiate their accurate identification in this study. car-miR5232 cleaves only two transcripts encoding an ATPase E1-E2 type and an expressed protein of unknown function, in concordance with a similar study in Medicago, in which miR5232 targets were experimentally confirmed by degradome sequencing <xref rid="pone.0108851-Devers1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>The significance of miRNA* in authenticating the presence of miRNA has previously been established.

It appears that miR2111 and F-box proteins act together to regulate the defense response in chickpea following biotic stress. Other than F-box proteins, miR2111 also targets TIR domain-containing NBS-LRR disease resistance proteins. miR2118 and miR5213 also target the same class of R genes.

It can be presumed that together, these miRNAs might mediate defense mechanisms under stress conditions via transcriptional regulators. miRNAs also target genes that are directly or indirectly involved in the defense against various stresses. For example, car-miR08 targets a chalcone synthase gene, which is an intermediate in flavonoid biosynthesis. Flavonoids are secondary metabolites that serve variable functions, including those involving pigmentation, UV protection and antifungal defense.

The unique tags were generated following a series of processing steps, which included adaptor trimming (using the adaptor removal tool), the elimination of low-quality sequences and the removal of contaminated and other non-coding RNAs, including tRNAs, rRNAs, etc. The UEA sRNA toolkit-Plant version filter pipeline (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://srna-tools.cmp.uea.ac.uk/">http://srna-tools.cmp.uea.ac.uk/</ext-link>) was used to exclude the low-complexity and low-quality sequences and eliminate the t/r RNA population by mapping them to plant t/r RNAs from the "Rfam" database, Arabidopsis tRNAs from &#8220;The Genomic tRNA Database&#8221; and plant t/rRNA sequences from the &#8220;EMBL&#8221; release 95.

The small RNA sequences that matched the following criteria were considered to be valid miRNA precursors: i) no more than 3 consecutive mismatches between the miRNA and miRNA*; ii) at least 17 of the 25 nt surrounding the miRNA must be involved in base pairing; iii) the hairpin must be at least 75 nt in length; and iv) at least 50% of the bases in the hairpin should be paired. The folding structures of the precursors of the new miRNA with the miRNA* were carried out using the UEA sRNA toolkit-RNA hairpin folding and annotation tool, which uses the Vienna Package to obtain the secondary structure of a precursor sequence, highlighting the miRNA/miRNA* sequences on the hairpin structure <xref rid="pone.0108851-Hofacker1" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>.

The total RNAs from the treated and control samples were extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 1-&#181;g aliquot of this RNA was used for the poly(A) tailing using the Poly(A) Tailing Kit (Ambion, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and then purified using the RNeasyMinElute Cleanup Kit (QIAGENGmBH, Germany). The poly(A) RNA (2 &#181;g) was then reverse-transcribed into cDNA that was primed by a standard poly(T) anchor adaptor using an RTQ primer. For the RT-PCR reaction, the conditions were as follows: 65&#176;C for 10 min, 4&#176;C for 2 min, 50&#176;C for 60 min and 70&#176;C for 15 min. Three biological replicates per sample were used for the analyses.</p><p>The poly(T) cDNA was diluted 10-fold and used to perform qRT-PCR using KAPA FAST SYBR Green chemistry (Kapa Biosystems, USA). For the qRT-PCR, the sequences of the specific miRNAs that were validated served as the forward primer and RTQ uni-primer, having an adaptor sequence as the reverse primer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108851.s008">Table S7</xref>). The 5S rRNA was used as the reference gene for all of the reactions. Three biological replicates were used per sample in addition to three technical replicates along with a no-template control and no-RT enzyme control. The data were analyzed using the 2[-Delta DeltaC(T)] method <xref rid="pone.0108851-Livak1" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref> and reported as the means &#177; standard errors (SE) of three biological replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Prediction and validation of chickpea miRNA target genes</title><p>The chickpea transcript dataset, which was downloaded from the chickpea transcriptome database (CTDB), was used to determine the potential target mRNA candidates for the miRNAs using the psRNATarget program with default parameters (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://plantgrn.noble.org/psRNATarget/">http://plantgrn.noble.org/psRNATarget/</ext-link>). To reduce the false-positive prediction rate, the cut-off threshold was set at 0 to 3.0 points. Thus, all of the sequences with &#8804;3.0 points were considered to be miRNA targets. The functional annotations of the predicted target transcripts were performed using the NCBI nucleic acid and protein databases. Based on the predicted data, miRNA166 was validated using modified 5&#8242; RACE. For this validation, the FirstChoice RLM-RACE Kit (Ambion, USA) was used with minor modifications, and the cDNA amplification was carried out using 1 &#181;g of total RNA. A single PCR fragment was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, USA) and sequenced to identify the 5&#8242;end of the target gene.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Analyses of GO terms and KEGG pathways</title><p>The GO terms of the target genes were annotated according to their biological processes, molecular functions or involvement as cellular components using Blast2GO <xref rid="pone.0108851-Conesa1" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref>.
