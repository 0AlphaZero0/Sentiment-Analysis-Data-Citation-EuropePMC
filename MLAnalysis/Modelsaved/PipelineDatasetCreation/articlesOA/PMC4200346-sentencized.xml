<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, WNV is endemic, and infection is primarily asymptomatic or associated with a mild febrile illness known as WN fever. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, recent outbreaks of WNV in the western hemisphere have occurred with a significantly higher incidence of severe neurological disease [1–5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The viral determinants responsible for the increased virulence of these emerging WNV strains are poorly understood. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The naturally occurring diversity in the neuropathogenicity among strains of WNV provides an excellent model system to define virulence determinants of emergent strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To facilitate comparative pathogenicity studies, we generated a complete full-length infectious clone of the lineage 2 African isolate WNV-MAD78. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Since WNV-MAD78 is non-pathogenic in mice when inoculated in the periphery [6, 7], it is a useful strain for comparison studies with pathogenic lineage 1 strains such as WNV-NY99 or WNV-TX02, for which infectious clones are also available. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although the sequence of the first 10,866 nucleotides, representing nearly the entire genome, of WNV-MAD78 was reported previously (accession DQ176636), the precise length and sequence of the 3′ end of the genome was not determined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we sequenced the 3′ end of WNV-MAD78 RNA extracted from infected A549 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>TRIzol (Invitrogen)-extracted RNA was treated with Terminator Exonuclease (Epicentre) to selectively remove rRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Since the WNV genome lacks a polyA tail, the extracted RNA was polyadenylated with polyA polymerase (NEB) and then used as a template for reverse transcription (RT) with an oligo-dT primer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The 3′ end of the resulting cDNA was PCR-amplified using the oligo-dT primer and a sense primer corresponding to position 10743 within the WNV-MAD78 genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis identified 20 nucleotides immediately adjacent to the added polyA nucleotides that aligned with the 3′ end of another lineage 2 strain of WNV, WNV-956, suggesting that this sequence represented the exact 3′ end of WNV-MAD78. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>To confirm the sequence of the WNV-MAD78 3′UTR, we repeated the amplification of this region using the 10743 primer and an antisense primer complimentary to the exact 3′ end of the WNV-MAD78 genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of the resulting RT-PCR product identified a total of 97 nucleotides that were not reported previously (Fig. 1a and accession number KJ909513). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>To generate a full-length infectious clone of WNV-MAD78, we utilized the strategy outlined in Fig. 1c. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>First, total RNA extracted from WNV-MAD78-infected Vero cells was used as template for RT-PCR to generate eight WNV-MAD78 cDNAs spanning the entire virus genome (Fig. 1c, Stage 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>During PCR, an MluI restriction site followed by the T7 promoter was inserted immediately upstream of the 5′ end of the genome (Fig. 1d). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Of the four mutations noted, three were present in our WNV-MAD78 stock (Fig. 1e), indicating that only one (T5339C) arose during the cloning process. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>To generate virus, linear pWNV-MADIC was used as template for in vitro transcription, and 12 μg of the resulting RNA was used to transfect 1 × 106 Vero cells using the Neon® Transfection System (Invitrogen) set to the following conditions: 1150 V, 20 ms, and 2 pulses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>After seven days, culture supernatant containing WNV-MADIC was collected and subsequently passaged once in Vero cells to generate a working stock. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>The presence of a cytosine nucleotide at position 5339 within the recovered virus (Fig. 1e) confirmed that it was WNV-MADIC and not parental WNV-MAD78. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>To assess the biological properties of WNV-MADIC, we compared the growth kinetics of the recovered virus to that of the parental strain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Vero cells were infected with WNV-MAD78 or WNV-MADIC and infectious particle production assessed by plaque assay (Fig. 2a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Similar levels of infectious particles were observed at all times, with peak levels occurring at 48 h after infection for both viruses (Fig. 2a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Moreover, plaques for both viruses developed at similar rates on Vero cells and were visible at 6 days post-inoculation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>To assess virulence, wild-type C57BL/6 and interferon receptor knockout (Ifnar-/-) mice, which are resistant and highly susceptible, respectively, to WNV-MAD78 [7], were inoculated subcutaneously with 100 PFU of WNV-MAD78 or WNV-MADIC (Fig. 2b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>No differences in survival were observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>In wild-type mice, neither strain caused mortality or weight loss, though one mouse inoculated with WNV-MADIC showed mild signs of disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in the absence of IFN signaling, infection with either strain was 100 % lethal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Thus, the virus recovered from the infectious clone was indistinguishable from the parental strain.Fig. 2WNV-MADIC displays similar biological properties to parental WNV-MAD78. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>(a) Vero cells were inoculated with WNV-MAD78 or WNV-MADIC (MOI = 0.05). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>(b) Eight- to twelve-week-old C57BL/6 or Ifnar -/- mice were infected with WNV-MAD78 or WNV-MADIC (n = 7) by subcutaneous injection of 100 PFU into the left rear footpad. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Mice were monitored daily and euthanized when body weight loss was &gt;20 % or they reached clinical scores of 4 or above (1, no paresis; 2, mild paresis; 3, frank paresis; 4, severe paresis; 5, true paresis; 6, moribund) </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Recently, Suthar et al. generated a similar infectious clone, herein referred to as WNV-MADTX-UTRs, which contains the 5′ and 3′ UTRs of a virulent WNV strain, WNV-TX [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>The WNV-TX UTRs have notable differences from those of WNV-MAD78. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Within the 5′ UTR, WNV-TX contains an extra adenosine at position 51, and the WNV-TX 3′UTR is 78 nucleotides longer and shares only 73.2 % sequence identity with that of WNV-MAD78 (Fig. 1b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Specific sequences and structural folds within the UTRs are critical for WNV replication [11–15], and previous work suggests that the UTRs are virulence determinants [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Thus, sequence differences among the UTRs of various WNV strains may alter the structure and function of these regions and thereby influence the pathogenicity of the resulting virus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>To assess the effect of the TX-UTRs on WNV-MAD78 fitness, we compared WNV-MAD78, WNV-MADIC, and WNV-MADTX-UTRs replication in A549 cells, human brain cortical astrocytes (HBCAs), and C6/36 cells, models for WNV infection within the periphery, the neurovascular unit, and the mosquito vector, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>In all cell types, similar titers were observed for all three viruses throughout the infection (Fig. 3a-c), consistent with the initial characterization of WNV-MADTX-UTRs within A549 cells [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Thus, the TX-UTRs are neither beneficial nor detrimental to WNV-MAD78 replication in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>However, we consistently observed that WNV-MADTX-UTRs plaques on Vero cells were larger than those of WNV-MADIC or parental WNV-MAD78 (Fig. 3d), suggesting that the presence of TX-UTRs may marginally enhance viral spread in some mammalian cells.Fig. 3WNV-MAD78, WNV-MADIC, and WNV-MADTX-UTRs exhibit similar replication and neurovirulence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>(a-c) A549 (a) (MOI = 0.05), HBCA (b) (MOI = 0.01), or C6/36 (c) (MOI = 0.02) monolayers were inoculated with WNV-MAD78, WNV-MADIC, or WNV-MADTX-UTRs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Culture supernatants were collected and titers determined as in Fig. 2(a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>(d) Vero monolayers were infected with ~50 pfu of WNV-MAD78, WNV-MADIC, or WNV-MADTX-UTRs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>After 1 h, inoculums were removed and a 0.9 % agarose-media overlay was added. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>After 7 days, the monolayers were fixed with 4 % formaldehyde and stained with crystal violet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>(e) Four-week-old Swiss Webster mice were inoculated intracranially with 10 pfu of WNV-MAD78 (n = 20), WNV-MADIC (n = 20), or WNV-MADTX-UTRs (n = 20) or mock inoculated (n = 10) with 20 μL of PBS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Mice were monitored daily and euthanized when body weight loss was &gt;20 % or clinical scores indicated severe disease </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>When inoculated in the periphery, parental WNV-MAD78 and WNV-MADTX-UTRs are completely avirulent in mice [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>In contrast, approximately 60 % of mice inoculated intracranially with parental WNV-MAD78 succumb to infection [17], making intracranial (IC) inoculation a good model for assessing virulence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>To determine if the WNV-TX UTRs affected WNV-MAD78 virulence, we compared WNV-MAD78, WNV-MADIC, and WNV-MADTX-UTRs in 4–week-old outbred Swiss Webster mice (Harlan Laboratories) inoculated intracranially with 10 pfu of virus or a sham PBS control. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>All viruses exhibited similar lethality (Fig. 3e, p = 0.766), with 80–90 % of infected animals succumbing to infection by 9 days after inoculation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Morbidity correlated directly with mortality, and no animals that lost weight or showed signs of disease recovered (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Thus, the virulence phenotypes of the infectious clones are indistinguishable from each other and from that of parental WNV-MAD78. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>In summary, we have generated an infectious WNV-MAD78 clone (WNV-MADIC) that contains the authentic UTRs of the viral RNA and is indistinguishable from parental WNV-MAD78 in replication and neurovirulence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Replacing the WNV-MAD78 UTRs with those of a pathogenic strain of WNV had no effect on the biological phenotype of WNV-MAD78. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>This finding is consistent with a study of another low-pathogenicity WNV strain, Kunjin virus, in which replacing both the Kunjin UTRs with those of WNV-NY did not enhance virulence in mice [16], though replacing the 5′ UTR alone did increase pathogenicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Thus, divergence among the UTRs of various WNV strains may not be a determining factor in virulence, as long as they are maintained as a cognate pair. </plain></SENT>
