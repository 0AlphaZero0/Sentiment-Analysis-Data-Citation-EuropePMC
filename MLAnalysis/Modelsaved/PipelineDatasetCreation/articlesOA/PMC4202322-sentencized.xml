</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Numerous studies over the past decades have demonstrated that the protein-coding genes that regulate development of diverse animals are widely conserved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For example, the homeobox genes that control the anterior–posterior patterning are highly similar in their sequence, genomic organization, expression, and function in both invertebrates and vertebrates (McGinnis et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>1984). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Whole-transcriptome analyses between different species have further suggested that the temporal expression of developmental genes is well conserved (Kalinka et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>2010; Grün et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, the genes expressed at different stages of embryonic development appear to be subject to different levels of constraint (reviewed in Kalinka and Tomancak 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>A number of models have been posited to describe evolutionary constraint across development, firstly based on morphology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>An early conservation model following “Baer's laws of embryology” suggested that embryos of different species are most similar at the very beginning of their development, and then gradually diverge (von Baer 1828). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>More recently, the “hourglass” model of embryonic conservation was proposed, where animals are most similar at an intermediate stage of embryogenesis called “the phylotypic stage,” and earlier and later stages are more divergent (Duboule 1994; Raff 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>A number of studies have demonstrated that various aspects of transcriptome conservation follow an hourglass pattern, including gene expression variation, correlation, sequence divergence, evolutionary age, and gene regulation (Davis et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>2005; Hazkani-Covo et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>2005; Cruickshank and Wade 2008; Domazet-Lošo and Tautz 2010; Kalinka et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>2010; Irie and Kuratani 2011; Quint et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>2012; Piasecka et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>However, the early conservation model has also received recent support (Roux and Robinson-Rechavi 2008; Piasecka et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>2013). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In the past few years, microRNAs have gained attention as alternative sequence markers for evolutionary modeling and phylogenetic analysis (Sempere et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>2006, 2007; Wheeler et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>2009; Rota-Stabelli et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs are a class of small noncoding RNAs with well-established biogenesis and function: Mature microRNAs, generated by the cleavage of a hairpin precursor, guide the RNA-induced silencing complex to complementary sites in the 3′ untranslated regions of target mRNAs, thereby down-regulating translation (reviewed in Bartel 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The discovery of microRNAs revealed an entirely new layer of regulation at the level of production of proteins from mRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>MicroRNA regulation is known to be crucial for many processes involved in animal development: Specific microRNAs play a role in developmental timing, maternal transcript turnover, cell differentiation, morphogenesis, organogenesis, and apoptosis (reviewed in Kloosterman and Plasterk 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Many microRNA families are deeply conserved in bilaterian animals (Berezikov 2011), and display similar tissue specificities between divergent species, highlighting their role in the evolution of tissue identity (Christodoulou et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>For example, members of the microRNA family mir-1 are characteristic of muscle cells, while mir-9 sequences are expressed in the nervous system in both protostomes and deuterostomes (Christodoulou et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The expression pattern of fast-evolving and lineage-specific microRNAs can also be highly conserved, as exemplified by the mir-309∼6 cluster in Drosophila (Ninova et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, detailed studies have revealed multiple instances of temporal and spatial differences in the expression patterns of some conserved microRNAs, with potential implications in animal evolution (Ason et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>2006; Arif et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Most studies to date concentrate on specific microRNAs, and the relationship between microRNA evolution and temporal expression conservation has not been explored in a genome-wide manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The constraints on microRNA expression in development are therefore much less well understood than for protein-coding genes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Deep sequencing of small RNA libraries allows the comparison of microRNA expression patterns on a global scale. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>We took advantage of small RNA expression data sets covering discrete time windows during the ontogenesis of Drosophila melanogaster and D. virilis to explore the temporal conservation of microRNA expression in a developmental context. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>These species represent two major branches in the Drosophila phylogeny and are at an evolutionary distance that allows assignment of orthology for both conserved and divergent microRNA genes. D. melanogaster and D. virilis are separated by approximately 63 Myr of evolution (Tamura et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>2004), and have at least 131 microRNAs in common. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>We have established the timing of events during the embryogenesis of the two species, and showed that the temporal expression patterns of orthologous microRNAs are highly similar, not only for microRNAs with highly conserved sequence, but also for rapidly evolving orthologs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Globally, homologous developmental stages display well-correlated microRNA expression profiles between D. melanogaster and D. virilis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Among all periods, the stages representing gastrulation, germband elongation, and germband shortening exhibit the most similar inter-species similarity of microRNA expression, reflecting an hourglass pattern of expression conservation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>This supports a model where the constraints on microRNA expression are similar to those for protein-coding genes, highlighting the integral role of microRNAs in developmental regulatory networks. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>At 25 °C, D. virilis embryos develop for approximately 30–32 h, slower than the embryonic developmental time of 22–24 h for D. melanogaster. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>As correlating gene expression between species across development may be confounded by heterochronic shifts, we determined the timing of homologous developmental events between the two species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>To this end, we immunostained aliquots of embryos from each sequenced D. virilis sample and from a similar D. melanogaster time course, and used the occurrence of key morphologically evident developmental events to identify comparable stages. Figure 1 shows representative embryos stained for nuclei and the conserved segmentation gene engrailed at each time point in the two species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>In D. virilis, cleavage and pole bud formation occur more slowly and occupy approximately the first 4 h of development (fig. 1a and b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>The first invaginations, gastrulation, and the beginning of engrailed expression occur between 4 and 6 h postfertilization (fig. 1c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>Germband extension and associated processes are also prolonged, spanning the next 6 h (6–12 h) of development (fig. 1d–g). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Germband retraction begins at the end of this period (10–12 h) and continues during the 12–14 h time point (fig. 1h). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>About 14–18 h after fertilization, the D. virilis embryo approaches the end of germband retraction and begins head involution and dorsal closure—a process that occurs at about 10–12 h of D. melanogaster development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Overall, we did not observe any significant heterochronic shifts in early D. virilis development, but a proportionate 1.5 times delay in the relative timing of events with respect to D. melanogaster. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a similar discrepancy in the earliest stages was observed for protein-coding genes between vertebrate embryos (Irie and Kuratani 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Downstream analysis suggested that this is at least partly due to the presence of zygotically expressed microRNAs (e.g., from the mir-309∼6 cluster) at relatively high levels in the 0–1 h interval of D. melanogaster, but not in the 0–4 h interval of D. virilis (fig. 3b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>The similarity of microRNA gene expression between species is also lower in the late embryo, larval, and adult stages, compared with that of the mid-embryo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Among all homologous developmental stages, microRNA expression is the most highly correlated in the intervals representing the stages of gastrulation and beginning of germband elongation (2–6 h in D. melanogaster data sets vs. 4–8 h in D. virilis), and slow germband elongation until the beginning of segmentation (around 6–10 h in D. melanogaster vs. 6–14 h in D. virilis). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the similarity of microRNA profiles across the development of D. melanogaster and D. virilis follows an hourglass pattern. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed the temporal expression patterns of microRNAs throughout embryonic development in two Drosophilid species from two perspectives: The similarity of global microRNA expression profiles between species and the similarity of the expression profiles of pairs of orthologous microRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Comparisons of microRNA expression profiles differ in many ways from comparisons of protein-coding genes and provide a unique opportunity to evaluate evolutionary trends with very different genetic elements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>For example, the total number of microRNA genes in a genome is considerably smaller than genes encoding proteins, and the proportion conserved in even closely related organisms is lower: The current release of D. melanogaster genome (r5.54) contains 238 microRNAs, 131 of which conserved in D. virilis, and over 16,000 protein-coding genes, around 80% of which have annotated homologs in the current release of the D. virilis genome (r1.2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Unlike proteins, microRNAs are known to emerge in animal genomes by continuous acquisition throughout evolutionary time, and the proportion of lineage- and species-specific microRNAs is large (Sempere et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>2006; Wheeler et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Global comparisons of microRNA expression across species therefore need to be a careful compromise between evolutionary distance and availability of common data points. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Our transcriptome-wide comparison of temporal microRNA expression patterns during the development of two divergent fruit flies, D. melanogaster and D. virilis, showed that on this evolutionary scale, the temporal expression of homologous microRNAs is highly conserved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the conservation of expression is high even when the sequences of the orthologs have diverged. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the temporal regulation of microRNA transcript expression may be more constrained than the content of the transcript itself. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>We speculate that this is because changes outside the seed sequence that defines target interactions have comparatively mild effects on global target regulation within a cell type. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>A regulatory change in an existing microRNA resulting in its misexpression in a foreign tissue, on the other hand, may result in more dramatic changes in the gene network, with deleterious consequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with repeated observations that ectopic expression of microRNAs outside the normal expression domain almost always results in major phenotypic consequences, while loss of microRNA function frequently has no obvious developmental consequences, even for conserved microRNAs (Bushati and Cohen 2007; Smibert and Lai 2008). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that some fast-evolving microRNAs in Drosophila are expressed at high levels uniquely in the early embryo, consistent with the notion that different developmental stages are not equally robust to change (Ninova et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>A high constraint on the regulation of microRNA expression independent of sequence conservation is also compatible with this hypothesis: If some stages are more canalized or developmentally robust than others, mutations in microRNA transcripts expressed at these stages might be tolerated as long as the expression pattern is unchanged. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Such mutations could include not only changes in the sequence of existing microRNAs, but also the emergence of new hairpins within the same transcript, especially when their seeds are identical to those of ancestral members. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>For instance, the mir-310∼313 cluster encodes a different number of mir-310 paralogs in the two species but is conserved in its maternal deposition (Ninova et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>However, changes in microRNA regulation resulting in a shift in expression to a developmental stage that is more sensitive to perturbation could be highly deleterious. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>The same principle can be extended to spatial expression: If some tissue types are more robust to changes in their microRNA complement, those tissues would be expected to be enriched for fast-evolving and novel microRNAs, but conserved microRNAs would maintain their tissue specificity throughout evolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Indeed, previous studies suggested that the tissue specificity of ancient microRNAs is highly conserved (Christodoulou et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>2010). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Given that the temporal expression of orthologous microRNAs is well conserved, it is perhaps unsurprising that homologous developmental stages in the two species also show highly correlated global microRNA expression profiles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Notably, the most highly correlated microRNA expression values are observed for samples representing the periods of gastrulation, germband elongation, and shortening, while the periods before and after these stages are less similar in their microRNA complement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Thus, mature microRNA expression profiles follow an hourglass pattern of developmental conservation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>An hourglass pattern of gene expression conservation has also been observed for protein-coding genes in Drosophila and other organisms (Davis et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>2005; Hazkani-Covo et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>2005; Cruickshank and Wade 2008; Domazet-Lošo and Tautz 2010; Kalinka et al. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>2012; Piasecka et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>2013), and is thought to reflect changing constraints throughout development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>However, we note that the precise timing of the hourglass “bottleneck” in our comparisons overlaps with, but is not identical to, that shown at the protein-coding transcriptome level (Kalinka et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>2010): The protein-coding gene expression conservation between species is maximal at the end of germband extension stage (8–10 h in D. melanogaster), while for microRNAs, the period of maximal similarity starts earlier. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, many individual protein-coding transcripts display minimal expression variation between species at the phylotypic stage (Kalinka et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>However, that pattern is not obvious for individual microRNAs, mostly because many microRNAs are present only during certain stages, and the period of minimal variance in expression often represents that of lowest abundance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Clearly, there are technical factors that obstruct the direct comparison between microRNA and whole transcriptome-based results, such as the different number of species included in the analysis, the different temporal resolution of the developmental time courses, and the different technologies employed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, it is likely that mRNA and microRNA expression throughout development are not subject to exactly the same constraints. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>For example, differences may reflect the fact that microRNAs have extremely long half-lives relative to mRNAs and proteins (median approximately 5 days compared with minutes to hours for mRNAs) (Thomsen et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>2010; Gantier et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>2011; Yang et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Thus, microRNA expression may have more extended temporal effects on developmental processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>It has also been suggested that various aspects of protein-coding gene conservation do not necessarily follow the same pattern (Piasecka et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>2013). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we demonstrate that key transitions during fruit fly development are accompanied by changes in the global microRNA expression profiles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>The temporal dynamics of microRNA expression are highly conserved between species, particularly during the early and intermediate embryonic stages when body plans are organized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Moreover, temporal profiles of microRNAs with higher substitution rates in their hairpin and mature sequences are also similar, suggesting that the timing of microRNA expression can be more constrained than their sequences. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>The conservation of transcript levels during embryogenesis provides important insights into the basic principles underlying animal development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>However, as transcript abundance does not necessarily reflect protein abundance (de Sousa Abreu et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>2009; Schwanhäusser et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>2011), the posttranscriptional control of protein expression is an important component to consider in understanding the evolution of developmental gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>In a recent study, it was demonstrated that both mRNA and protein expression between two species of Caenorhabditis separated by approximately 30 Myr of evolution are highly correlated, while the transcript and protein levels within species are not, suggesting that gene regulation at the posttranscriptional level is highly conserved during development (Grün et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>The notion of microRNA temporal conservation during development therefore fits and complements the observed patterns of gene regulation constraints, highlighting their role as an integral part of the molecular pathways that govern animal development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the control of microRNA expression is dependent on transcription factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Because of their intrinsic and complex regulatory relationships, the roles of microRNA and protein-coding gene expression are difficult to decouple. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Future studies in the context of regulatory networks are therefore required to reveal a more complete picture of the mechanisms driving the development and evolution of multicellular animals. </plain></SENT>
