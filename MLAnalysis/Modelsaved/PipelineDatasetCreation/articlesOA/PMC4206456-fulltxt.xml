This observation has prompted the reclassifications of body mass index thresholds for the definitions of &#8220;overweight&#8221; and &#8220;obese&#8221; in East Asians. However, the question remains over what evolutionary mechanisms have driven the differences in adiposity morphology between two population groups that shared a common ancestor less than 80,000 years ago. The Thrifty Gene hypothesis has been suggested as a possible explanation, where genetic factors that allowed for efficient food-energy conversion and storage are evolutionarily favoured by conferring increased chances of survival and fertility. Here, we leveraged on the existing findings from genome-wide association studies and large-scale surveys of positive natural selection to evaluate whether there is currently any evidence to support the Thrifty Gene hypothesis. We first assess whether the existing genetic associations with obesity and T2D are located in genomic regions that are reported to be under positive selection, and if so, whether the risk alleles sit on the extended haplotype forms. In addition, we interrogate whether these risk alleles are the derived forms that differ from the ancestral alleles, and whether there is significant evidence of population differentiation at these SNPs between East Asian and European populations. Our systematic survey did not yield conclusive evidence to support the Thrifty Gene hypothesis as a possible explanation for the differences observed between East Asians and Europeans.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>XHK, XYL and YYT acknowledge support from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health from the National University of Singapore and the National Research Foundation Singapore (NRF-RF-2010-05).

For example, a systematic review of 22 studies reported an increase in prevalence of Type 2 diabetes (T2D) in adults in China from 2.6% in 2000 to 9.7% in 2010 <xref rid="pone.0110974-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Epidemiologically, for the same body mass index (BMI), an East Asian individual is more susceptible to insulin resistance, and is more predisposed to body fat and visceral adiposity than a European individual <xref rid="pone.0110974-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The observations that East Asians tend to develop T2D at a less severe stage of obesity compared to Europeans have contributed in part to the reclassification of the definitions of &#8220;overweight&#8221; and &#8220;obese&#8221; for East Asians. Overweight and obese are defined as possessing a BMI &#8805;23 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and BMI &#8805;28 kg/m<sup>2</sup> respectively for East Asians, compared to corresponding thresholds of 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for non-East Asians <xref rid="pone.0110974-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>While the global surge in obesity and T2D has undoubtedly been attributed to the shift towards a high-fat high-sugar diet coupled with increasingly sedentary lifestyles, a fundamental question exists around the physiological differences in T2D etiology between East Asians and other populations. What are the molecular mechanisms that have resulted in the different types and location of adiposity, and what evolutionary processes could have driven these changes?</p><p>The Thrifty Gene hypothesis has been posited as a possible explanation for the steep increase in the prevalence of obesity and T2D in modern populations, particularly amongst East Asians. This hypothesizes that periods of famine in the history of modern humans presented a significant evolutionary force in favour of genes involved in fat storage, by increasing fertility and survival <xref rid="pone.0110974-Prentice1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Even during fluctuating periods of abundance and scarcity, these individuals with metabolically thrifty genes were able to utilize food, store fat and gain weight more efficiently such that they were likely to survive better than those without the thrifty genes during periods of famine. The comparative perpetual abundance of food in modern societies means that the advantageous genes are preparing the hosts for famines that do not occur, which subsequently manifests as obesity and increases the risk to T2D <xref rid="pone.0110974-Speakman1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. A famine-like incident is believed to have occurred during the human migration to East Asia (and subsequently onwards to the Americas) in the last 20,000 years that is believed to have led to further enhancements of metabolically thrifty genes amongst East Asians than in the Europeans <xref rid="pone.0110974-Diamond1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0110974-Benyshek1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Presently, there have not been many concrete reports validating or refuting the Thrifty Gene hypothesis despite an ongoing debate and growing literature that focused on the role of natural selection in this hypothesis <xref rid="pone.0110974-Speakman1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110974-Prentice4" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. One of the metrics to appraise the evidence of positive selection is by measuring the length of haplotypes in the genome. Recombination breaks down long haplotypes, and an uncharacteristically long haplotype at a locus often indicates that the particular genetic background has been preferred over other shorter haplotypes. This is thus indicative that a &#8220;hard sweep&#8221;, defined as a selection event with very high evolutionary fitness, has occurred.</p><p>The availability of high-density genetic data across multiple populations, coupled with recent discoveries from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on obesity and T2D, confers an unprecedented opportunity to explore the Thrifty Gene hypothesis. Here, we combine findings from positive selection analyses and GWAS to evaluate whether there is any evidence to support the Thrifty Gene hypothesis in East Asians. This utilizes a recently developed method (haploPS) to locate genomic signatures of positive selection in humans <xref rid="pone.0110974-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, which additionally identifies the haplotype form that the advantageous allele sits on. This allows us to evaluate whether the selected haplotype form actually carries known variants that have been reported to increase the risk to obesity or T2D, which is vital given the reliance on tagging SNPs in GWAS to discover phenotypic associations.</p><p>Specifically, we adopted a four-step qualitative approach in evaluating the evidence to support the Thrifty Gene hypothesis in East Asians that is otherwise absent outside East Asia and the Americas. (i) We first examined the GWAS catalogue to identify SNPs that have been indisputably associated with obesity and T2D onset, and to compare these against the set of positive selection signals that were present only in the East Asian populations of the International HapMap Project <xref rid="pone.0110974-Altshuler1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and the Singapore Genome Variation Project <xref rid="pone.0110974-Teo1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> (CHB, CHD, CHS, JPT). (ii) The selected haplotype forms were then checked to see whether they carried the reported risk alleles. (iii) In addition, we interrogated whether the reported risk alleles were the derived alleles by comparing against the chimpanzee genome sequence from dbSNP Build 138, as would have been supported under the Thrifty Gene hypothesis. (iv) Finally, we evaluated the degree of population differentiation using F<sub>ST</sub> at the reported SNPs between East Asian and European populations, with the expectation of significant differentiation between the two ancestry groups if the East Asian-specific evolutionary events under the Thrifty Gene hypothesis did occur.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Datasets</title><p>We used the genome-wide genotype data for 11 populations from Phase 3 of the International HapMap Project (abbreviated subsequently as HapMap) <xref rid="pone.0110974-Altshuler1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and for the three populations in the Singapore Genome Variation Project (SGVP) <xref rid="pone.0110974-Teo1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. All 14 populations were genotyped on the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 and Illumina 1M genotyping microarrays. We only considered unrelated individuals from the HapMap and these consisted of: (i) 53 individuals of African ancestry in Southwest USA (ASW); (ii) 113 Utah residents with Northern and Western European ancestry from the CEPH collection (CEU); (iii) 84 Han Chinese from Beijing, China (CHB); (iv) 85 Chinese in Metropolitan Denver, Colorado (CHD); (v) 88 Gujarati Indians in Houston, Texas (GIH); (vi) 86 Japanese from Tokyo, Japan (JPT); (vii) 90 Luhyas from Webuye, Kenya (LWK); (viii) 50 individuals with Mexican ancestry in Los Angeles, California (MXL); (ix) 143 Maasai in Kinyawa, Kenya (MKK); (x) 88 Toscani in Italia (TSI); and (xi) 113 Yoruban from Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI). We considered a consensus set of 1,525,445 SNPs that was present across all eleven populations, and the phased haplotypes downloaded from the HapMap resource were thinned to consist of only this set of SNPs. The SGVP resource comprised 268 individuals from the three major ethnic groups in Singapore consisting of 96 Southern Han Chinese (CHS), 89 Southeast Asian Malays (MAS) and 83 South Asian Indians (INS). We considered the phased haplotypes of the post-QC set of autosomal SNPs that were available from the SGVP resource, which consisted of 1,584,040 SNPs for CHS, 1,580,905 SNPs for MAS and 1,583,454 SNPs for INS.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Analysis of positive selection</title><p>Genomic evidence of positive selection was quantified with the use of the haploPS algorithm <xref rid="pone.0110974-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Briefly, haploPS explicitly locates uncharacteristically long haplotypes in the genome at a given frequency, which is defined against the distribution of haplotypes for that particular frequency across the genome by performing an exhaustive search across the SNPs. The length of each haplotype is measured by the genetic distance (in cM) spanned and by the number of SNPs on the haplotype. These two metrics are ranked against all other haplotypes across the genome of the same frequency in other to derive two empirical p-values: (i) the proportion of haplotypes that span a genetic distance at least as large as the target haplotype; and (ii) the proportion of haplotypes that span as many SNPs as the target haplotype. The haploPS score is defined as the product of these two empirical p-values and the total number of haplotypes across the genome at that particular frequency, and haplotypes with scores &lt;0.05 are interpreted as exhibiting evidence of positive selection. This analysis is performed for each of the 14 populations, with the haplotype frequencies ranging from 0.05 to 0.95 in increments of 0.05. Since a site that is found to possess an uncharacteristically long haplotype at a particular frequency is similarly likely to possess long haplotypes at lower frequencies as well, we report only the evidence found at the highest haplotype frequency, and identify the specific haplotype form at this frequency as the one that is expected to carry the advantageous functional allele. Population-average recombination rates from the HapMap were used in the calculation of genetic distance <xref rid="pone.0110974-Frazer1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Quantifying similarity of positively selected haplotypes</title><p>A positive selection signal in a particular genomic region can be present across multiple populations, either by stemming from the same mutation event in the common ancestor of these multiple populations, or through convergent evolution where different mutation events in response to the same environmental trigger have happened independently in these populations. HaploPS quantifies the presence of positive selection by locating the longest haplotype form in a particular genomic region, and we can differentiate between the two scenarios above by comparing the selected haplotype forms from the multiple populations: in the former scenario where the selection seen in multiple populations is attributed to the same mutation event, we expect a significant degree of similarity between the haplotype forms; whereas in the latter scenario, we expect the advantageous alleles (either at the same site or at different sites) to have arisen on different haplotype backgrounds such that the longest haplotypes from different populations will exhibit a significant degree of discordance. As such, the haplotype similarity index (HSI), as described in the formulation of haploPS <xref rid="pone.0110974-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, is used to distinguish between the two scenarios, where a HSI &gt;0.98 is indicative of a single mutation event in the common ancestor of the multiple populations, and a HSI &lt;0.9 is indicative that convergent evolution is likely to have happened.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Mapping GWAS signals to positively selected haplotypes</title><p>We considered the GWAS findings for obesity and T2D from the GWAS catalogue maintained by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies/">http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies/</ext-link>, which was accessed on 30<sup>th</sup> June 2013. Specifically, we considered 56 loci for T2D from 31 GWAS studies and nine loci for obesity from four GWAS studies, where for each locus there was at least one SNP reported to be associated with the phenotype where the statistical significance of the association was more significant than 5&#215;10<sup>&#8722;8</sup> (<bold>Tables S1, S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0110974.s001">File S1</xref></bold>). Note that we did not require these associations to be specific to or have been reported in East Asian populations. In searching for uncharacteristically long haplotypes, haploPS explicitly identifies the specific haplotype form that is expected to be carrying the functional allele that confers an evolutionary advantage. We thus interrogated whether there was any evidence of positive selection in East Asian populations that overlapped with any of the 35 loci reported to be associated with T2D and obesity, and if so, whether the reported risk alleles were found on the selected haplotype forms in the East Asian populations. The loci are considered to be overlapping with the selection signals if they are located within the selection regions.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Measurement of population differentiation</title><p>We used the locus-specific fixation index F<sub>ST</sub> to quantify the extent of genetic differences between populations at a particular SNP <xref rid="pone.0110974-Qian1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.

One possible explanation centers around the Thrifty Gene hypothesis, and we attempted to evaluate whether current findings from GWAS and genetic surveys of positive selection can provide the genetic evidence to support this hypothesis. We observed that only six T2D-associated loci were found in regions undergoing positive selection in East Asian populations, and while the risk alleles of three of these loci sat on the positively selected haplotypes, they were all ancestral alleles that, despite acknowledging the reliance of GWAS on identifying tagging SNPs, did not conform to the notion that these alleles are derived from specific mutation events that have occurred recently to confer greater survivability. Similar to a previous report <xref rid="pone.0110974-Southam1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, we did not find consistent evidence to unambiguously support the Thrifty Gene hypothesis as it pertains to East Asians.</p><p>There has been considerable confusion as to what constitutes a &#8216;thrifty gene&#8217;. While it is most commonly associated with a metabolic trait related to the frugal utilization of fuel <xref rid="pone.0110974-Prentice2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, various researchers have broadened the concept to encompass multiple notions of thrift, such as behavioral and physiological traits that might be adaptive during periods of food shortages <xref rid="pone.0110974-Prentice2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110974-Wells1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In this paper, we adopted the definition of &#8216;thrift&#8217; as five broad categories that favor sustained positive energy balance as suggested by Bouchard <xref rid="pone.0110974-Bouchard1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, encompassing (a) metabolism or thermogenesis, (b) regulation of appetite, (c) physical inactivity, (d) lipid oxidization, and (e) lipid storage capacity of adipocytes, for practical purposes of testability. As such, the central assumption is that individuals possessing thrifty genes may exhibit high adiposity in modern society, and thus be identified among populations of people with obesity and/or type 2 diabetes. While obesity and type 2 diabetes are not perfect surrogate measures of the modern day effects of metabolic thrift, they represent objective measures of the biological system that can be tested and compared across populations.</p><p>It is interesting to note that, despite explicitly searching for obesity and T2D-associated loci, none of the obesity-associated SNPs displayed evidence of position selection that was specific to East Asians even though obesity is commonly regarded as upstream of T2D pathogenesis and would have been a better surrogate measure for the presence of thrifty genes. Although obesity is a major predictor of T2D, most obese individuals do not develop T2D, and conversely T2D patients are not necessarily obese. The complexity of the interaction between both diseases illustrates the difficulty in using T2D as a surrogate for the modern day effect of thrifty genes.</p><p>A gene that shows evidence of positive selection and an association with T2D is not necessarily a thrifty gene, as it may have been selected for reasons other than thrift. For example, the thymine allele of rs7903146 in <italic>TCF7L2</italic> increases T2D risk with an odds ratio of 1.37 <xref rid="pone.0110974-Frayling1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, representing the T2D susceptibility gene with the largest effect size discovered to date that has been successfully replicated across multiple populations. However, the HapB<sub>T2D</sub> haplotype containing the risk allele is found to be negatively associated with BMI in T2D patients and is not the variant that displays evidence of recent positive selection, contrary to predictions of the thrifty gene hypothesis <xref rid="pone.0110974-Helgason1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. If thrifty genes indeed exist, functional evidence that the T2D risk alleles are involved in a mechanism consistent with thrift is essential.</p><p>One challenge to testing the Thrifty Gene theory is the lack of clarity behind the mechanisms linking obesity, T2D, and insulin resistance. It has been proposed that the phenotypic expression of the thrifty gene may be hyperinsulinemia or insulin resistance <xref rid="pone.0110974-Wendorf1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, although this appears to be paradoxical as a decrease in insulin sensitivity suggests a negative impact on fat storage ability. For normal individuals without pancreatic islet &#946;-cell dysfunction, the &#946;-cells increase insulin secretion sufficiently to compensate for the reduced sensitivity to insulin action, thereby maintaining normal glucose tolerance <xref rid="pone.0110974-Kahn1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. It is hypothesized that this increase in blood insulin is responsible for a greater net tendency towards fat storage. However, some have proposed that the evidence behind insulin resistance as the phenotypic expression of the thrifty gene is inconsistent <xref rid="pone.0110974-Watve1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, citing evidence that Pima Indians have the greatest prevalence of diabetes in the world and ought to be an obvious candidate for carriers of thrifty genes given the population genetic history, except that in non-diabetic Pima Indians, insulin resistance is instead associated with a reduced risk of weight gain <xref rid="pone.0110974-Swinburn1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> which is contrary to what one would expect under the Thrifty Gene hypothesis.</p><p>One proposed mechanism linking obesity, insulin resistance, and T2D suggests that a defect in the ability of &#946;-cells to secrete insulin is sufficient to lead to decreased insulin signaling in the hypothalamus, resulting in increased food intake and thus weight gain <xref rid="pone.0110974-Schwartz1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In this way, a thrifty allele that causes &#946;-cell dysfunction and results in decreased insulin secretion can potentially be selected for thrift through its effects on increased food intake, consistent with the Thrifty Gene hypothesis. However, a decrease in insulin secretion also impairs the storage of glucose as triglycerides in adipocytes, leading to increased lipolysis and elevated plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) levels <xref rid="pone.0110974-Kahn1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The increase in NEFA and glucose levels in the plasma, together with increased food intake due to brain signaling processes can result in insulin resistance, further aggravating &#946;-cell function <xref rid="pone.0110974-Kahn1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Interestingly, the convergence of events towards increased insulin resistance may hint at thrifty genes with different phenotypic expressions that function along a similar pathway. It thus remains an open question as to whether thrifty genes directly affect &#946;-cell function, insulin resistance, fat storage upstream of any T2D-related event, or if a more plausible thrifty genotype exists where numerous genes involved in different functions at various points along the carbohydrate and fat regulation pathway account for an aggregate effect towards fat storage. Even then, a possibility maintains that thrift is also accounted for by mechanisms other than increased fat storage.</p><p>Though it remains to be demonstrated that the genes at which the index SNPs are located in are functionally responsible for the GWAS signals for obesity and T2D, there is a great amount of evidence supporting the roles of the identified genes, particularly for <italic>THADA</italic> and <italic>PAX4</italic>. The <italic>THADA</italic> risk allele is linked to decreased glucagon-like peptide-1-induced and arginine-induced insulin release <xref rid="pone.0110974-SimonisBik1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, while studies have shown that the early expression of <italic>PAX4</italic> is involved in the differentiation of &#946;-cells in the pancreas, thus affecting insulin secretion <xref rid="pone.0110974-Blyszczuk1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110974-SosaPineda1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. It has to be noted that both genes affect pancreatic insulin secretion and/or plasma insulin levels that is upstream of fat storage. Ideally, we would expect a thrifty allele to be directly involved in efficient fat storage. However, it remains to be seen if genes that affect fat storage indirectly have less of an impact on fertility and/or survival, and thus selection.</p><p>Perhaps one of the most plausible explanations on the lack of evidence thus far for the Thrifty Gene hypothesis is the fact that the search for genomic signatures of positive selection with recent genome-wide data has primarily focused on locating hard sweeps, given the reliance on methods that capitalise on variance in allele frequencies or the presence of long haplotypes. These methods are capable of identifying selection signals that leave distinctive imprints in the genome, but are unfortunately poorly powered to locate evidence arising from polygenic soft sweeps. This is compounded by the fact that obesity and T2D are complex phenotypes, where even the genetic determinants are multi-factorial and exert at best a modest impact, unlike the classical situation where genetic mutations confer a strong fitness against an infectious disease that produces a rapid proliferation of the advantageous mutations in a population. If indeed thrifty genes do exist, these are highly likely to be working in tandem in a polygenic manner to alter phenotype expression, where any evolutionary advantage they confer will similarly be visible only by explicitly searching for polygenic soft selection sweeps.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0110974.s001"><label>File S1</label><caption><p><bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0110974.s001">File S1</xref> includes Figure S1, Table S1 and Table S2.
