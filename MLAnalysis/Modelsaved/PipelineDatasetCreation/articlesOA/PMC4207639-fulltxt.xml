We have previously mapped a major quantitative trait loci (QTL) for GP on chromosome 3 in a White Duroc &#215; Erhualian F<sub>2</sub> intercross. We herein performed a systems genetic analysis to identify the causal variant underlying the phenotype QTL (pQTL). We first conducted genome-wide association analyses in the F<sub>2</sub> intercross and an F<sub>19</sub> Sutai pig population. The QTL was then refined to an 180-kb interval based on the 2-LOD drop method. We then performed expression QTL (eQTL) mapping using muscle transcriptome data from 497 F<sub>2</sub> animals. Within the QTL interval, only one gene (<italic>PHKG1</italic>) has a cis-eQTL that was colocolizated with pQTL peaked at the same SNP. The <italic>PHKG1</italic> gene encodes a catalytic subunit of the phosphorylase kinase (PhK), which functions in the cascade activation of glycogen breakdown. Deep sequencing of <italic>PHKG1</italic> revealed a point mutation (C&gt;A) in a splice acceptor site of intron 9, resulting in a 32-bp deletion in the open reading frame and generating a premature stop codon. The aberrant transcript induces nonsense-mediated decay, leading to lower protein level and weaker enzymatic activity in affected animals. The mutation causes an increase of 43% in GP and a decrease of&gt;20% in water-holding capacity of pork. These effects were consistent across the F<sub>2</sub> and Sutai populations, as well as Duroc &#215; (Landrace &#215; Yorkshire) hybrid pigs. The unfavorable allele exists predominantly in Duroc-derived pigs. The findings provide new insights into understanding risk factors affecting glucose metabolism, and would greatly contribute to the genetic improvement of meat quality in Duroc related pigs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Glycogen storage diseases (GSD) are a group of inherited disorders characterized by storage of excess glycogen, which are mainly caused by the abnormality of a particular enzyme essential for releasing glucose from glycogen. GSD-like conditions have been described in a wide variety of species. Pigs are a valuable model for the study of human GSD. Moreover, pigs affected by GSD usually produce inferior pork with a lower ultimate pH (so-called &#8220;acid meat&#8221;) and less processing yield due to post-mortem degradation of the excess glycogen. So far, only one causal variant, <italic>PRKAG3</italic> R225Q, has been identified for GSD in pigs. Here we reported a loss-of-function mutation in the <italic>PHKG1</italic> gene that causes the deficiency of the glycogen breakdown, consequently leading to GSD and acid meat in Duroc-sired pigs. Eliminating the undesirable mutation from the breeding stock by a diagnostic DNA test will greatly reduce the incidence of GSD and significantly improve pork quality and productivity in the pig.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors appreciate the financial support provided by the Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31230069), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31101697), the Development Programs for Basic Research of China (973 Programs, No. 2012CB722502 and 2012CB124702).The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>The authors confirm that all data underlying the findings are fully available without restriction.

The recent availability of livestock genome sequences and high-density SNP chips has allowed detection of significant association of nucleotide polymorphisms with complex traits, and effective identification of causal mutations for some monogenic traits <xref rid="pgen.1004710-Ren1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgen.1004710-Rubin2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Despite these progresses, uncovering the quantitative trait genes (QTGs) or nucleotides (QTNs) for complex traits remains a challenging task. Only a handful of QTNs have been convincingly identified in livestock <xref rid="pgen.1004710-Andersson1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgen.1004710-Ren2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>More recently, several studies in human, mouse and <italic>Drosophila</italic> have shown that the integration of phenotypic traits, genetic and gene transcript data enables researchers to identify expression QTL (eQTL), untangle gene-based regulatory networks, infer relationship between gene expression levels and phenotypic traits, and thereby detect novel trait-causing genes <xref rid="pgen.1004710-Schadt1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgen.1004710-Tu1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Therefore, the integrative analysis would play a key role in acquiring the knowledge of mechanisms responsible for livestock complex traits. Indeed, some researchers have identified a number of promising candidate genes for muscle traits and blood lipid traits of pig by integrative analyses of GWAS (or linkage mapping), eQTL and trait-correlated expression <xref rid="pgen.1004710-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgen.1004710-Corominas1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Glycogen storage diseases (GSD) characterized by defects in glycogen metabolism and excess glycogen stored in liver and muscle are multifactorial disorders. Both human and animals suffer from GSD. Agricultural researchers often measure the glycogen content or glycolytic potential [GP &#8202;=&#8202;2&#215; (glucose + glycogen + glucose-6-phosphate) + lactate] in skeletal muscle of farm animals at slaughter. However, instead of the GSD diagnostic indicator, the GP value is mainly used for the prediction of meat quality development during the conversion of muscle to meat, because GP is a determinant of multiple meat quality characteristics, such as pH, color, water holding capacity (drip loss), tenderness and processing yields <xref rid="pgen.1004710-Hamilton1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004710-Wulf1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>GSD or extreme GP phenotype can be caused by genetic variation of various enzymes or transporters, which are involved either directly in the synthesis or breakdown of glycogen or in the utilization of its catabolite, glucose-1-phosphate <xref rid="pgen.1004710-Burwinkel1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. To date, only one responsible gene, <italic>PRKAG3</italic>, has been elaboratively evidenced to impact glycogen and GP levels in Hampshire and its related synthetic lines <xref rid="pgen.1004710-Ciobanu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004710-Milan1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

One is that cis-eQTL mapping for annotated genes residing the QTL region can not only contribute to identification of regulatory QTNs, but also benefit characterization of protein-altering QTNs including splice and nonsense mutations that affect transcript levels by NMD, just like our identified QTN. Another implication is that if a gene is subjected to alternative splicing, it is necessary to determine the levels of its different transcripts (instead of only the total amount of these transcripts) by deep RNA sequencing and then examine their individual relationship with phenotypic traits. The third one is that we could identify a cis QTL for PHKG1 protein level that overlaps with the mapped cis-eQTL and pQTL on SSC3 if a big data set on protein abundance was available, and find a strong relationship between protein level and GP-related traits.

In contrast, the <italic>PHKG1</italic> g.8283C&gt;A mutation that we identified is a loss-of-function mutation causing the defect in glycogen degradation. This variant occurs predominantly in Duroc or Duroc-crossed pigs.

However, Duroc and two Duroc-derived lines carry the mutation at relatively high frequencies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004710-t003">Table 3</xref>). The result may suggests that meat quality has not been the primary breeding goals in these pig populations.</p><p>In conclusion, we identified a causal mutation in the <italic>PHKG1</italic> gene associated with excess glycogen content in Duroc and its related pigs. The finding highlights the important role of genes encoding PhK subunits in the formation of the GP-related traits. More intriguingly, our finding would be of considerably importance for the pig industry as we can develop a diagnostic DNA test to effectively eliminate the <italic>PHKG1</italic> undesirable allele from nucleus herds and consequently improve meat quality.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All procedures involving animals followed the guideline for the care and use of experimental animals established by the Ministry of Agriculture of China.
