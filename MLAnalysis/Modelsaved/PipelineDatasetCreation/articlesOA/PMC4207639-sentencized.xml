</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In past decades, thousands of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) have been detected for economically important traits in livestock through genetic linkage studies [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The recent availability of livestock genome sequences and high-density SNP chips has allowed detection of significant association of nucleotide polymorphisms with complex traits, and effective identification of causal mutations for some monogenic traits [2]–[4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Despite these progresses, uncovering the quantitative trait genes (QTGs) or nucleotides (QTNs) for complex traits remains a challenging task. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Only a handful of QTNs have been convincingly identified in livestock [5]–[7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>More recently, several studies in human, mouse and Drosophila have shown that the integration of phenotypic traits, genetic and gene transcript data enables researchers to identify expression QTL (eQTL), untangle gene-based regulatory networks, infer relationship between gene expression levels and phenotypic traits, and thereby detect novel trait-causing genes [8]–[10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the integrative analysis would play a key role in acquiring the knowledge of mechanisms responsible for livestock complex traits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Indeed, some researchers have identified a number of promising candidate genes for muscle traits and blood lipid traits of pig by integrative analyses of GWAS (or linkage mapping), eQTL and trait-correlated expression [11]–[14]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Glycogen storage diseases (GSD) characterized by defects in glycogen metabolism and excess glycogen stored in liver and muscle are multifactorial disorders. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Both human and animals suffer from GSD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Agricultural researchers often measure the glycogen content or glycolytic potential [GP  = 2× (glucose + glycogen + glucose-6-phosphate) + lactate] in skeletal muscle of farm animals at slaughter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>However, instead of the GSD diagnostic indicator, the GP value is mainly used for the prediction of meat quality development during the conversion of muscle to meat, because GP is a determinant of multiple meat quality characteristics, such as pH, color, water holding capacity (drip loss), tenderness and processing yields [15], [16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>GSD or extreme GP phenotype can be caused by genetic variation of various enzymes or transporters, which are involved either directly in the synthesis or breakdown of glycogen or in the utilization of its catabolite, glucose-1-phosphate [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>To date, only one responsible gene, PRKAG3, has been elaboratively evidenced to impact glycogen and GP levels in Hampshire and its related synthetic lines [18], [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Although more than 10 different QTLs for the trait have been reported (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cn.animalgenome.org/cgi-bin/QTLdb/index">http://cn.animalgenome.org/cgi-bin/QTLdb/index</ext-link>), QTGs or QTNs underlying these QTLs remain unexplored. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>We have previously identified a major QTL for GP and pH values at 42 cM on chromosome 3 in a large scale White Duroc × Erhualian F2 intercross [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>To decipher the molecular basis of the GP QTL, we herein performed an integrative genetic analysis by utilizing extensive data sets of GP-related traits, high-density genotypes and gene expression profiling from three experimental populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>We show compelling evidence that a splice mutation in the PHKG1 gene is the QTN underlying the major QTL effect on GP and its related traits. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Consistent with our previous QTL results [20], the GWAS results demonstrated that Sus Scrofa chromosome 3 (SSC3) contained the most genome-wide significant locus (P = 5.85×10−22) for both GP and RG with the top SNP ss131031160 (pSNP) at 17.09 Mb (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>However, this lead SNP was not associated with the glycolysis intermediate product G-6-P and end-product lactate (Figure S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the underlying QTG likely influences the conversion between glycogen and glucose (or G-6-P) rather than the conversion between G-6-P to lactate. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Besides 62163 SNPs on the Illumina Porcine SNP 60K Beadchip, 53 SNPs derived from DNA sequence comparison between Erhualian and Duroc (see Materials and Methods) within a 1-Mb region surrounding the top pSNP were genotyped for these Sutai pigs. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our study shows the following evidences for the PHKG1 g.8283C&gt;A mutation as QTN underlying the SSC3 QTL effect: (1) The mutation caused abnormal splicing of PHKG1 mRNA, resulting in a shift in the reading frame with a premature stop codon. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>(2) The aberrant mRNA transcripts were diminished by NMD, which reduced the PHKG1 protein level and led to PhK enzyme deficiency. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Here, we illustrate that the QTN (g.8283C&gt;A) is a splice site mutation affecting both transcription and translation levels of the PHKG1 gene, which has at least three implications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>One is that cis-eQTL mapping for annotated genes residing the QTL region can not only contribute to identification of regulatory QTNs, but also benefit characterization of protein-altering QTNs including splice and nonsense mutations that affect transcript levels by NMD, just like our identified QTN. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Another implication is that if a gene is subjected to alternative splicing, it is necessary to determine the levels of its different transcripts (instead of only the total amount of these transcripts) by deep RNA sequencing and then examine their individual relationship with phenotypic traits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>The third one is that we could identify a cis QTL for PHKG1 protein level that overlaps with the mapped cis-eQTL and pQTL on SSC3 if a big data set on protein abundance was available, and find a strong relationship between protein level and GP-related traits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>This information could add a new dimension for the search of QTG. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Several studies have recently demonstrated the feasibility of high-throughput proteome quantification and revealed the variation and genetic control of protein abundance in humans and mice [23], [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Hopefully, whole proteome analysis will be more efficient and routinely added to integrative genomic analysis to accelerate the identification of QTG and QTN for complex traits in livestock. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylase kinase (PhK) is comprised of four different subunits with a stoichiometry of (αβγδ)4; α,β, and δ are regulatory, while γ is catalytic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Each of these subunits has isoforms or splice variants differentially expressed in different tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Mutations in 4 PhK subunit genes (PHKA1, PHKA2, PHKB and PHKG2) have been implicated in low PhK activity in liver and/or muscle [25]–[29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>No variant in the muscle isoform of the PhKγsubunit (PHKG1) has been reported for muscle PhK deficiency [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this study is the first one to confirm the association of the PHKG1 mutation with PhK deficiency, muscle glycogenosis and meat quality traits in pigs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Pork with high GP (&gt;180 µmol/g) often has low ultimate pH and water holding capacity, and is therefore called “acid meat”. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>The R225Q mutation in PRKAG3 gene was the first identified causal mutation for acid meat [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>This gain-of-function mutation causes an increased glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle [30], [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Its unfavorable allele (225Q) is dominant and specifically present in Hampshire and related breeds [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the PHKG1 g.8283C&gt;A mutation that we identified is a loss-of-function mutation causing the defect in glycogen degradation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>This variant occurs predominantly in Duroc or Duroc-crossed pigs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>The mutant allele A appears to be partially recessive, since the average RG value of AC heterozygotes approximates to that of CC homozygotes rather than AA homozygotes (Table S3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Costa et al. [32] have reported that 9.8% of DLY hybrid pigs free of the PRKAG3 225Q allele still show the acid meat phenotype with GP higher than 180 µmol/g. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>In this study, we found that the PHKG1 QTNs are segregating in DLY hybrid pigs with a frequency of 1.7% (9/540) for the homozygous mutant with GP beyond 180 µmol/g. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we speculate that a substantial proportion of acid meat is likely caused by the PHKG1 g.8283C&gt;A mutation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>It was observed that the mutation had negative effects on almost all meat quality traits but did not impact any growth traits (e.g. carcass weight; see Table S6) in the F2, Sutai and DLY populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>However, Duroc and two Duroc-derived lines carry the mutation at relatively high frequencies (Table 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>The result may suggests that meat quality has not been the primary breeding goals in these pig populations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we identified a causal mutation in the PHKG1 gene associated with excess glycogen content in Duroc and its related pigs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>The finding highlights the important role of genes encoding PhK subunits in the formation of the GP-related traits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>More intriguingly, our finding would be of considerably importance for the pig industry as we can develop a diagnostic DNA test to effectively eliminate the PHKG1 undesirable allele from nucleus herds and consequently improve meat quality. </plain></SENT>
