</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a severe vascular disease characterized by persistent precapillary pulmonary hypertension (PH) (Stacher et al. 2012; International PPHC et al. 2000; Zhao et al. 2002; Fujiwara et al. 2008; Nasim et al. 2011; Olschewski 2010; Bogaard et al. 2012; MMea and 2013), which can be either be idiopathic (sporadic-90 %, familial-10 %). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PAH can also be a complication associated with other conditions such as connective tissue disease, congenital heart disease, anorexigen use (dexfenfluramine), portal hypertension, and human immunodeficiency virus (Stacher et al. 2012; International PPHC, Lane KB, Machado RD, Pauciulo MW, Thomson JR, et al. 2000; MMea et al. 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Evidence in the literature suggests that metabolic pathway abnormalities characterize and may play a significant role in the development and progression of PAH (Fessel et al. 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For example, pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAECs) in PAH share similar hyperproliferative characteristics as malignant tumor transformation that is accompanied by significant metabolic shifts to support anabolic growth and energy metabolism (Xu et al. 2005; Chen et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it has been shown that mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation with glucose uptake and utilization occurs in PAEC development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Significant elevation of hemoglobin has been found in the PAH sample group without a history of diabetes or any other obvious metabolic diseases, indicating the impairment of whole-body glucose homeostasis in PAH (Pugh et al. 2011; Hansmann et al. 2007; Archer et al. 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Additionally, vascular changes under chronic hypoxic condition has been directly linked to an imbalance between glycolysis, glucose oxidation, and fatty acid oxidation (Sutendra et al. 2010), while in vitro pulmonary arterial endothelial cell culture with disruption of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptor II (BMPRII) gene showed significant metabolomic changes (Fessel et al. 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Our recent work showed that disrupted glycolysis, increased TCA cycle, and fatty acid metabolites with altered oxidation pathways exited in the human PAH lung, indicating that PAH has specific metabolic pathways contributing to abnormal ATP synthesis for the vascular remodeling process in pulmonary hypertension (Zhao et al. 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Collectively, in vitro, human and animal models suggest that multiple metabolic pathways are reprogrammed during PAH vascular remolding and that metabolic heterogeneity may play an important role in both ATP energy supply and the molecular pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Here, we provide direct evidence of a novel increase in bile acid metabolites in PAH lung tissue associated with the elevated expression of bile acid synthesis related transcripts, indicating de novo synthesis of bile acids may characterize and contribute to the pathogenesis of PAH. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>We explored and characterized the metabolomic signature of pulmonary hypertension (PAH) to enhance our understanding of disease progression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Using untargeted metabolic profiling, we found that PAH lung (n = 8) possessed significantly higher levels of multiple bile acid metabolites, including the primary bile acids taurocholate (Fig. 1), glycocholate (Fig. 2), taurochenodeoxycholate, and glycochenodeoxycholate (Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Bile acids are normally synthesized in the liver and gallbladder from cholesterol by 7-alpha-hydroxylase, also called cytochrome P450 (CYP7A1), as a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of bile acid via the classic pathway (Nishimoto et al. 1993; Cohen et al. 1992; Crestani et al. 1993; Wang and Chiang 1994). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Although the presence of bile acids in lung tissue may partially reflect reflux in these patient (D’Ovidio et al. 2005; Blondeau et al. 2009), microarray analysis surprisingly revealed that the gene encoding cytochrome P450 B1 (CYP7B1), but not CYP7A1, had a significantly higher expression in PAH lung (Fig. 4a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>This finding was also confirmed by Real time RTPCR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Further molecular analysis using Western blot showed that the expression of CYP7B1enzyme was higher in PAH lung (Fig. 4b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that increased bile acid metabolites may not solely be due to reflux from the esophagus (D’Ovidio et al. 2005; Blondeau et al. 2009) but come from the lung itself. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Thus, PAH lung tissue may have the capacity for de novo synthesis of bile acids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Notably, increased bile acids metabolites could potentially serve as biomarkers for disease progression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>By applying immunohistochemistry, CYP7B1positive immunostaining was found in pulmonary vascular endothelial cells, specifically in newly formed vascular endothelial cells in plexiform lesions of occluded pulmonary arteries (Fig. 4c), suggesting that CYP7B1may also be involved in the vasculogenesis during the vascular remodeling process of PAH (Fig. 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis needs to be further tested by additional functional analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>In summary, we have shown direct evidence that a de novo synthesis of bile acid may be involved in pathogenesis of PAH, suggesting that bile acids in lavage fluid may serve as ideal biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of PAH.Fig. 1MS/MS fragmentation spectrum of taurocholate in control and PAH lung.
