</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Protein phosphatases are a diverse group of proteins that have in common the ability to dephosphorylate different substrates, predominantly proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Phosphatases have been recently classified in three major groups: the classic serine/ threonine (Ser/Thr) phosphatases, the protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP), and the aspartate-based protein phosphatases (recently reviewed in refs. 1 and 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This classification is based on the amino acid sequence of the catalytic domain and the structural similarity of these proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There are ~147 protein phosphatases in the human genome (1) and they participate in a number of critical biological processes such as proliferation, tumor suppression and motility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In the cells, a delicate balance is kept between protein kinases and phosphatases for the control of a variety of biological functions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>We previously found that the expression of the mitogen activated protein kinase-phosphatase 1 (MKP-1, also called DUSP1 or CL100), a dual specificity phosphatase whose known substrates are ERK, JNK and p38, is an independent prognostic factor in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, suggesting a potential role of this phosphatase in lung cancer (3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>We have also previously shown that DUSP1 is differentially expressed in epithelial ovarian cancer as compared with normal ovarian epithelium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>High levels of DUSP1 are found in normal ovarian epithelium whereas patients with advanced epithelial cancer tend to show a marked decrease in its expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Induced reexpression of DUSP1 in ovarian cancer cell lines decreases their anchorage-dependent and -independent growth, indicating a potential role of this phosphatase in ovarian cancer progression (4). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Here, we wanted to explore the phosphatase transcriptome in different phenotypes of breast cancer (BC) patients with a particular focus in estrogen receptor-negative (ER−) BC patients by using expression microarrays. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>We characterize the ribonucleic acid (RNA) expression of phosphatases in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), estrogen receptor-negative (ER−) BC and in the two major subgroups of ER− BC [epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (ERBB2+) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (ERBB2−)] by expression microarrays. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The potential relevance of both the MAPK pathway and the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathways is inferred from the distinct phosphatase expression pattern in the ER− BCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Finally we also show the prognostic relevance of RNA expression of phosphatases in BC by building and validating a multiphosphatase signature predicting distant methastasis-free survival (DMFS) in untreated, lymph node-negative BC patients. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Part of the tissue obtained at surgery was used for routine pathological evaluation of the samples, which also included immunohistochemistry (IHC) to assess estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PGR) and ERBB2, and the rest was snap-frozen in OCT at −80°C shortly after surgery and stored in tumor banks at the two participating institutions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>For the expression microarray study, samples were obtained from the tumor banks of Complejo Hospitalario Universitario of Santiago (35 samples) and from Hospital Quiron Torrevieja (6 samples) both in Spain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>For the IHC study, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples from primary BC were obtained from archival material at the Pathology department in Hospital Quiron Torrevieja (45 samples). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Only samples that were ER− by IHC were selected for this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>A perfect agreement was found with the microarray study as none of these samples expressed levels of ESR1 mRNA significantly above background level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>All patients were also progesterone receptor-negative (PGR−) except one (from the expression microarray study), in which some expression of PGR was detected by IHC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>As this tumor did not express any PGR in the microarray, it was considered as PGR− for all the microarray analysis performed. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Tumor total RNA for all samples was labelled with Cy3 using the QuickAmp labeling kit, and the hybridisation kit (both from Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Two protocols were used: for the first 10 microarrays, a one-color protocol, and for the remaining 31 microarrays, a two-color protocol. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>As explained above, all tumor RNA samples were labelled with Cy3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>For the two-color protocol used with the last 31 microarrays, in addition to the 200 ng of tumor RNA labelled with Cy3, labeling of a common reference RNA consisting of 200 ng of Universal Human reference RNA (Stratagene, CA, USA) with Cy5 was also performed (using also the QuickAmp labeling and hybridization kits from Agilent Technologies). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>For the analysis the R statistical environment (version 2.10.1) was used (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cran.r-project.org/">http://cran.r-project.org/</ext-link>) along with packages from the BioConductor project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioconductor.org/">http://www.bioconductor.org/</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>As described above there were two groups of arrays: 10 hybridized according to one-color protocol, and 31 according to a two-color protocol. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>To make the two groups comparable, and to be able to analyse them jointly, avoiding any batch effects, the normalized signal (derived from Cy3, green channel) was chosen as a measurement of the signal intensity in both groups of arrays. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Functions of the limma package (5) from the Bioconductor project were used for further preprocessing, that consisted of: background correction (normexp), quantile normalization among all the microarrays for interarray normalization and log2 transformation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>QC filtering of probes was done by filtering out probes that were not expressed significantly above background levels in order to increase the signal to noise ratio. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>This filtering and summarization of identical probes repeated throughout the chip was done using the Bioconductor package Agi4×44PreProcess. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>By using the green normalized signal the ranges of signal and background intensities were fully comparable between the one-color and the two-color microarrays as demonstrated by box plots. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>To further rule out any possible batch effect after preprocessing the 41 microarrays as mentioned above, unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The 10 one-color microarrays did not form a separate cluster but rather mixed well with the remaining 31 arrays, ruling out in this way a batch effect. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The raw and preprocessed data from the 41 microarrays of the ER− BC patients of this study have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus repository (GEO accession no. GSE51999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>For the different comparisons between two classes in BC patients described in Results statistical analysis of microarrays (SAM) was performed using the t-statistics of the siggenes package (from the Bioconductor project) with default parameters at the false discovery rate (FDR) indicated for each comparison. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Each comparison was done selecting the probes representing many of the known phosphatase (and subunits) genes from the Bioconductor libraries corresponding to the chips analysed (Agilent hgug4112a and the Affymetrix hgu133a) in the different datasets used. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>The preprocessing and summarization at the probe level of the Affymetrix hgu133a chips was done when possible from the original CEL files using the Robust Multiarray Average (RMA) algorithm as implemented in the Bioconductor affy package. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Preranked GSEA was used with our ER− BC series comparing ERBB2 enriched versus triple-negative (TN) or basal-like BC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>All the preprocessed genes in the Agilent microarrays dataset were ranked using SAM analysis, and the results loaded in the software. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>For derivation of a multiphosphatase prognostic signature GSE2034 was used for training and GSE7390 for validation purposes (both use the Affymetrix hgu133a platform, include primary lymph node-negative patients, and contain distant metastases-free survival information). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>These two large series have been used extensively in the literature for survival analysis. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>We studied the expression of 207 phosphatases and subunits (304 probes) by microarray profiling in a group of 41 primary BC patients with ER− tumors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of the patients presented here are shown in Table I. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>We compared in our series of ER− BC, those ERBB2-overexpressing tumors (as determined by IHC), that we designated the clinical ERBB2, with the TN by using SAM analysis at a 5% FDR (q&lt;0.05). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight probes corresponding to 34 different genes were identified (Table II). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>The top phosphatases characterizing the clinical ERBB2 tumors that showed an ~1.5-fold change (or more) were DUSP6, DUSP4, FBP1, PPAPDC1A, ENPP1, INPP4B, PPAPDC1B, PTPRH, DUSP10, PPAPDC3, CTDSPL, PTEN and DOLPP1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>The eight phosphatases identified showed an ~1.5-fold change (or more) difference in TN tumors: PPM1K, PTPLB, PSPH, PTPN14, PTPRE, PTPLA, PTPN2 and PPP1R12A. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Given the important cellular functions of phosphatases, that keep a delicate balance in the phosphorilation status of different molecules, particularly kinases, we did not expect to find large fold changes in the comparisons made, as these changes would likely have important metabolic consequences. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Only one of the three series used to establish the most characteristic phosphatases in ER+ vs. ER− BC (see below), provided information regarding the ERBB2 status of patients as determined by IHC: GSE20194. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we used the ER− BC patients (n= 89) of the aforementioned series as a first validation of our results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>SAM analysis at a 5% FDR (q&lt;0.05) was also applied to this subgroup of patients comparing the clinical ERBB2 of this series with the TN tumors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine different probes were identified (Table II) corresponding to 20 different phosphatase genes. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Since the seminal study by Perou et al (16) describing the different molecular BC subtypes by using expression micro-arrays, it was noted that hierarchical clustering of ER− tumors with the intrinsic signature genes yielded at least two clusters, one of them enriched in ERBB2 overexpressing tumors and another comprising mainly basal-like tumors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Although we applied a single sample predictor to the samples of our series using the classifier PAM50 published by Parker et al (17), with the exception of the basal-like subtype, the rest of the molecular subtypes did not have sufficient number of cases to analyze them separately (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Thus, we decided to apply hierarchical clustering to our samples using all the probes that in our microarray platform matched the intrinsic signature as reported by Hu et al (18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>As expected, and noted previously by Perou and et al (16), mainly two clusters could be readily identified: the first was enriched in clinical ERBB2, containing 11 out of 14 (78%) of the clinical ERBB2 tumors (Fig. 1A), constituting the ERBB2-enriched molecular subtype; the second cluster contained the basal-like enriched tumors comprising TN (24 patients) and 3 clinical ERBB2 tumors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>We designated the tumors belonging to the ERBB2 enriched cluster as molecular ERBB2 to distinguish them from the clinical ERBB2 (those tumors overexpressing ERBB2 by IHC), and the cluster of the predominant TN tumors as the basal-like enriched tumors even though there is a significant overlap among the clinical and molecular subtypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>We also used all the genes in the microarray to plot the first two principal components, showing that the same two groups characterized by hierarchical clustering can also be observed with a different unsupervised analysis (Fig. 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Given the reproducibility of this molecular classification of ER− tumors we used it to validate further our results as we did not find other large breast cancer microarray series providing information regarding the ERBB2 status as determined by IHC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>SAM analysis was also applied at a 5% FDR (q&lt;0.05) to our series to identify differentially expressed phosphatases between the molecular ERBB2 and the basal-like enriched tumors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Forty-one probes (corresponding to 38 genes) were differentially expressed (Table III). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Comparing with the phosphatases identified earlier in the comparison of clinical ERBB2 with TN tumors, 23 out of 41 (56%) probes (corresponding to 20 out of 38 genes) were common with the previous analysis (Tables II and III). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>To further validate these results in another independent series, we used the NKI series (9) (295 patients) comprising 69 ER− tumors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>First, we applied hierarchical clustering to these 69 patients and as expected two major clusters could be identified, one comprising mainly the molecular ERBB2 and the other comprising the basal-like tumors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Then we applied SAM analysis at a 1% FDR (q≤0.01) to find genes differentially expressed between the molecular ERBB2 and the basal-like tumors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two probes (corresponding to 21 genes) were differentially expressed (Table III). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>After analysing our series of estrogen receptor-negative (ER−) breast cancers we characterized the phosphatase transcriptome in the whole population of breast cancer patients encompassing both estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and ER− patients as a reference point to our study by using three large independent published microarrays series. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to identify the phosphatases that were more characteristic of the major ER− subgroups by taking into account the phosphatome of ER+ and ER− BC phenotypes as a whole. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>In order to identify phosphatases differentially expressed in ER+ versus ER− breast cancer patients, we selected three large microarray series of breast cancer patients with the following characteristics: a) having ~200 or more patients so as to have statistical power, b) all performed in the same microarray platform to make possible a direct comparison of the same probes across the 3 series, c) all series must include information regarding the estrogen receptor status, and d) the series used do not have overlapping patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>The three series selected meeting these characteristics were downloaded from the public domain available at the GEO repository: GSE7390 (198 patients), GSE20194 (230 patients) and GSE2034 (286 patients). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>In all, the three series comprised 714 patients, and all used the Affymetrix HGU133A platform. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Each individual series was analyzed for differential expression of phosphatases between patients with ER+ vs. ER− by SAM at a 5% FDR (q≤0.05). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Out of a total of 326 probes (corresponding to 196 phosphatase and subunits genes) screened in the three series, 136 probes comprising 92 different genes were identified as differentially expressed in GSE7390, 144 probes (104 genes) in GSE20194, and 149 probes (106 genes) in GSE2034. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>A total of 79 probes (Table IV) were identified as differentially expressed in each and every one of the three studied series. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>These 79 probes correspond to 62 different genes that can be consistently identified in the three series. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>All these 62 phosphatases were differentially expressed in the same manner in each series (i.e., the same phosphatases were predominantly expressed in either ER+ or in ER− tumors in all series), as shown in Table IV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>It is remarkable and interesting to note that out of 196 studied phosphatases 62 (31.6%, i.e., almost a third) were found differentially expressed by SAM at a stringent 5% FDR, suggesting that these genes may contribute in a relevant manner to the estrogen receptor driven phenotype of breast cancer. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>In summary, pooling together the ER− comparisons made between the two major subgroups, three phosphatases (DUSP4, DUSP6 and DUSP10) were consistently identified in our ER− series (for both comparisons the clinical ERBB2 vs. TN and the molecular ERBB2 vs. the basal-like enriched tumors) and in the two independent series used for validation purposes, and 9 additional phosphatases (PPAPDC1A, DOLPP1, PTPN14, FBP1, ENPP1, INPP5A, LPPR2, PPP2R4 and PTPLA) were identified in our ER− series (for both comparisons) and in at least one of the ER− series used for validation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>We consider that those phosphatases found in both our clinical ERBB2 vs. TN and in our molecular ERBB2 vs. basal-like enriched comparisons are likely to be the most relevant phosphatases of these ER− subtypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>It is interesting to note that three of these phosphatases are dual specificity phosphatases (DUSP4, DUSP6 and DUSP10) and DUSP4 and DUSP6 share the same substrate: ERK (DUSP4 in addition to ERK also targets JNK and p38 kinases), suggesting that the control of the MAPK pathway through these phosphatases could be highly relevant to the biology of this subgroup of BC patients (ER− ERBB2+). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Another interesting observation related to these findings is that DUSP6, DUSP10, PPAPDC1A, DOLPP1 and INPP5A are phosphatases that we have identified upregulated (at ~1.5-fold or more) in the subgroup of ER− that overexpress ERBB2 (or are enriched in ERBB2 over-expressing tumors). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>However, these genes were not picked as differentially expressed when comparing the phosphatases differentially expressed between ER+ and ER− (Table IV) in the three large series analyzed in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>This fact suggests that ER− ERBB2+ BC patients tend to have upregulated some specific phosphatases that may be important for this subtype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>However, DUSP4, FBP1, ENPP1, LPPR2 and PPP2R4 are upregulated in both ER− ERBB2+ patients and in ER+ BC patients, whereas PTPN14 and PTPLA are upregulated in TN (and basal-like) and in all the ER− BC patients, suggesting that these phosphatases also play a role in other BC subtypes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>As we have pointed out, not all the phosphatases screened in our platform and found differentially expressed in the comparisons made in our ER− series, are actually represented in the other platforms used for validation purposes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Therefore, those differentially expressed phosphatases not represented in the other platforms might still be a true positive finding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Review of the literature of the phosphatases found differentially expressed in BC provided another source of validation for some of our findings, even for some that were not identified in the other two series used for validation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Two examples can be mentioned in this regard. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II (encoded by the gene INPP4B), a phosphatase that affects PI3K signaling by hydrolysis mainly of phosphatidyl inositol 3,4-biphosphate (PIP2) was found differentially overexpressed in ER− ERBB2+ as compared with ER− ERBB2− tumors in our series of ER− patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>It was also found overexpressed in ER+ BC patients as compared with ER− patients in the screening carried out in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Gewinner et al found that the majority of TN BC tumors they studied had loss of heterozygosity at the 4q31.21 locus (where INPP4B resides), and that the messenger RNA expression of INPP4B was lower in this subgroup of BC patients (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Further they also reported that decreased protein expression of INPP4B (as determined by IHC) correlated with a worse overall survival, suggesting that INPP4B behaves as a tumor suppressor (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Fedele et al confirmed some of these findings and showed that indeed INPP4B protein is expressed at high levels in the normal breast, and predominantly in ER+ BC patients (20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>PTEN was also identified as overexpressed in ER− ERBB2+ in comparison with ER− ERBB2− in our series. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Several previous reports have validated this finding at the protein level (21–23). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Finally, we attempted to obtain insight into the function of the main phosphatases found differentially expressed between the two major ER-BC subgroups in all the series studied here including our own (i.e., DUSP4, DUSP6 and DUSP10) by using the GeneMANIA plugin for cytoscape in different human tumor datasets (Co-expression network in Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Interestingly in two previous reports (24,25) a coexpression network, based on correlation coefficients, could be identified involving not only other MAPK phosphatases (like DUSP1, DUSP2 and DUSP5 among others) but also PTEN, suggesting a complex and intertwined regulation of phosphatases controlling the MAPK and PI3K pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Remarkably another phosphatase was part of the co-expression networks with DUSP4, DUSP6 and DUSP10: PTPRE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>This phosphatase has been found to induce a positive feedback on ERK1/2 and AKT protein pathways in human breast cancer cells (26). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data point to an important and complex regulatory function of different phosphatases in the control of the MAPK and PI3K pathways in BC. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>As stated above, several upregulated phosphatases (DUSP4 and DUSP6) in ER− ERBB2+ patients share ERK as a substrate, and others like INPP4B and PTEN regulate the PI3K pathway, so we investigated whether specific signaling pathways were likely to cause the regulation of expression shown above. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, we applied the Speed algorithm (10) to the top differentially expressed genes (not just the phosphatases) that were upregulated between clinical ERBB2 and TN tumors in our series as identified by SAM at a 1% FDR (q≤0.01) using in the comparison all the genes in our platform after QC filtering. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>As suspected by the phosphatases having ERK as substrate, it seems that one of the major signaling pathways driving their regulation is the MAPK pathway with a contribution from the PI3K pathway. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>In a similar manner, we also run the Speed algorithm with the top genes that were upregulated in TN (and therefore downregulated in clinical ERBB2), as picked by SAM at a 1% FDR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Six pathways (out of 9) were significant (Table V) at an adjusted p&lt;0.05: the MAPK_only, MAPK_PI3K, interleukin-1 (IL1), toll-like receptor (TLR), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and the Wnt signaling pathways, being the Wnt and the TLR pathways the most significant of all (Wnt adj p=4.577e−7 and TLR adj p=3.975e−7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>When running the Speed algorithm in a similar way on the top genes upregulated in molecular ERBB2 and in the basal-like tumors of our series, similar results were obtained (Table V). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>The most significant pathway was the MAPK pathway (adj p=3.5117e−16) in the molecular ERBB2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>In the basal-like tumors three pathways were the most significant: Wnt pathway (adj p=2.62e−5), IL1 (adj p=2.38e−5) and TLR (adj p=2.49e−5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>However, MAPK (adj p=0.02158) and PI3K (adj p=0.047) pathways were also significant in the basal-like subgroup of ER− BC, suggesting a role for these pathways in the expression of some of the phosphatases studied here. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>The ERBB2 and MEK1 signatures were generated in a human ER+ breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) overexpressing constitutively activated ERBB2 or activated MEK1 (the upstream ERK1/2 kinase), respectively, suggesting a potential role of the MAPK pathway in the ERBB2-enriched patients, and possibly in the regulation of the expression of those phosphatases having ERK as substrate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>In addition, these 2 subgroups (clinical and molecular ERBB2) had in common another significant hit (FDR≤0.01): a KRAS.PROSTATE_UP.V1_UP signature obtained in epithelial prostate cancer cell lines over-expressing an oncogenic form of KRAS, suggesting a role for both the MAPK and PI3K pathways in the regulation of expression of the phosphatases detected in ER− ERBB2+ BCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Exploring signatures overlapping with the activated MEK and the KRAS.PROSTATE_UP.V1_UP signatures, a signature of ETS2 regulated gene targets was found to be a highly significant overlap (FDR q-value = 5.03e−11 and 6.44e−3, respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>It is known that DUSP6 has an ETS2 site in its promoter that in vitro is responsive to MAPK activation (reviewed in ref. 27). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>We decided then to study at the protein level by IHC the expressions of DUSP4, DUSP6 and its relationship with the activated form of ERK (as detected by a phospho-ERK1/2 specific antibody) in an independent series of 45 ER− BC patients (12 ER− ERBB2+, 33 TN), and to focus on the clinical classification of BC tumors for this IHC study as similar pathway analysis results were found with the molecular ER− classification (see above). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>As expected, we found differences in protein expression of DUSP6 and phospho-ERK between the clinical ER− subgroups (ERBB2+ and TN) but not for DUSP4, following the same trend observed for the RNA expression in the microarray analysis (i.e., higher expression of DUSP6 and phospho-ERK in ER− ERBB2+ than in TN), although these differences were not statistically significant considering a categorical classification of the expression of these proteins (Fisher’s exact test p-values (two sided) p=0.176 for DUSP6 and p=0.179 for phosho-ERK), likely due to the limited number of ER− ERBB2+ tumors analyzed (Table VII). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>By using a continuous IHC score of the expression of these proteins we found a statistically significant correlation [Spearman’s rho = 0.307, p-value (2-tailed) = 0.043] between phospho-ERK and DUSP6, but not between phospho-ERK and DUSP4 [Spearman’s rho = 0.136, p-value (2-tailed) = 0.379]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>There was also a significant correlation between DUSP6 and DUSP4 [Spearman’s rho = 0.415, p-value (2-tailed)= 0.005]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>These results in ER− BC tissues suggest first that the protein expression of DUSP6 is linked to the activation of ERK1/2 and second that the expression of DUSP4 depends not only on the activation of ERK1/2 but also on other factors, as this phosphatase has other substrates in addition to ERK1/2 (i.e., JNK and p38). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Some transcription factors known to be substrates of these kinases are also part of co-expression networks (like FOS for MAPK and ATF2 for p38 pathways) as shown above. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>To study whether the differential pattern of expression of phosphatases studied above had not just a relationship with the BC phenotype but also a potential association with prognosis, we focused on two of the series we used for comparison between ER+ and ER− tumors (GSE2034 and GSE7390) as the third one used (GSE20194) did not provide survival information. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>These two series included information on DMFS that was used for this analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>In addition, both series included untreated, lymph node-negative BC patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Hence these two large series were ideal to explore a potential association between the distant metastases-free survival and the expression of the phosphatases screened in our study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Using as a starting point all the phosphatases screened here, we were able to find a multigene signature in the whole population of BC patients (considering both ER+ and ER− patients) with a highly statistically significant prognostic value. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>We used as training set all the BC patients in the GSE2034 dataset in order to obtain a 58 probes signature (comprising 48 genes) (Table VIII) and we validated this signature in the GSE7390 dataset, that was used as the validation set (HR=2.718, 95% CI=1.616–4.571; p&lt;0.001 for the training set and HR=3.005, 95% CI=1.315–6.870; p=0.009 for the validation set when the signature was used as a continuous variable). Fig. 3, shows the Kaplan-Meier curves of the 2 datasets using the optimal cutoff of the signature score, i.e., the 3 lower quintiles versus the 2 upper quintiles (log-rank test p=0.0002 for the training set and p=0.01 for the validation set). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Using this signature in the GSE7390 validation dataset (that provided more information about known clinical prognostic factors) as a continuous variable, it was found to retain statistical significance in predicting DMFS in a multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model adjusted for other known prognostic factors (HR=2.784, 95% CI=1.086–7.136, p=0.033) (Table IX). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>The same was true for the training dataset (GSE2034 series), although in this series there was a reduced amount of provided information on other known prognostic factors (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>We also used the multiphosphatase signature as a discrete variable (with the optimal separation of 2 groups of patients corresponding to the 3 lowest quintiles and the 2 upper quintiles, respectively) in the GSE7390 validation dataset, and it was also found to retain statistical significance in a multivariate Cox regression model (following a backward elimination method based on the Wald test) along with tumor size [signature: HR=1.755, 95% CI=1.061–2.903, p=0.028, and tumor size (continuous): HR=1.394, 95% CI=1.049–1.852, p=0.022), whereas estrogen receptor status, age and grade (all as discrete variables) were not significant and were eliminated and not retained in the minimum optimal model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Similarly the signature as a discrete variable was also highly significant in the training set after adjusting for other potential prognostic factors (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>To further confirm the prognostic value of the 48 genes used in the multiphosphatase signature, as an independent confirmation, we used an online database where a simplified model of the signature used in our study is used as explained (28). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>In brief, the linear part of a multivariate Cox model is used by these authors to obtain a prognostic index, i.e., they use directly the Cox coefficients as weights of the expression of the genes used in the generation of their prognostic index. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>We could confirm utilizing all the available genes (and probes where applicable) of our multiphosphatase signature in the Aguirre-Gamboa et al (28) database that with exactly the same probes and genes used in our study a highly statistically significant prognostic model (with the same or analogous endpoint, DMFS or RFS) could be fit not only to the same BC datasets used to train and validate our signature, but also to other breast cancer datasets we tried (which were those with the larger number of patients) in this database [namely: GSE2990 (n=187), GSE6532 (n=214), GSE4922 (n=249), E-TABM-158 (n=117), GSE20685 (n=327), and finally a pool of 9 breast cancer datasets (n=676)] (data not shown]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>These data suggest the robustness of these genes to predict DMFS and RFS in BC. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>It is noteworthy that a number of phosphatases that were part of the signature were those that had been identified as differentially expressed in the previous analysis comparing ER+ vs. ER− patients (like DUSP4, INPP5J, PTP4A2 and PPP2R2A) as well as others that had been identified in the ER− ERBB2+ vs. ER− ERBB2− analysis (like DUSP6). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>In this study we characterized the differential expression of phosphatases that accompany the most relevant phenotypic subtypes of BC by gene expression profiling using microarrays, with a particular focus on ER− BC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Although there is a previous molecular profiling study by microarrays of the tyrosine phosphatome of ERBB2 overexpressing BC by Lucci et al (29), a different procedure was used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>In the study of Lucci et al only the protein tyrosine phosphatases were studied with a custom microarray in breast cancer cell lines under different conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Then Lucci et al also studied two different BC datasets where they compared ERBB2+ vs. ERBB2− in the whole population of BC patients (i.e., including both ER+ and ER− tumors). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Thus they did not separate them according to their ER status. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, in common with our study, they identified DUSP6 and DUSP10 as differentially expressed between ERBB2+ and ERBB2−, being DUSP6 the most significant finding (29). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge our study represents the first thorough characterization of the transcriptome of most of the known phosphatases in BC phenotypes according to their ER status in 3 large independent microarrays series. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Here, ER+ BC tumors could be considered as a surrogate of the luminal subtype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Our study also provides a characterization of the phosphatome of the 2 major molecular subgroups of ER− tumors: ERBB2 overexpressing and ERBB2− (basal-like). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>In order to achieve this in the ER− subgroup, we used the data generated by our own series of ER− BC patients and validated our findings in at least 2 large independent microarrays series. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Further validation of some of our findings was provided by a literature review as stated earlier for PTEN and INPP4B (19–23). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>PTPN13 (also known as PTPL1) was found overexpressed in ER+ patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>A previous report showed a positive statistically significant correlation between the expression of this phosphatase as measured by quantitative real-time PCR and hormonal receptor status in BC patients, thus confirming our observation (30). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Recently, a study of predictive biomarkers of efficacy of trametinib (GSK1120212), a new inhibitor of MEK1/2 (2 kinases that are upstream of ERK1/2 in the MAPK pathway) that is being tested in clinical trials (31), has shown in multiple human cancer cell lines that the RNA expression of DUSP6 is associated with sensitivity to this compound irrespective of the mutational status of RAS/RAF, thus behaving as a surrogate marker of MAPK activation, and as a predictor of sensitivity to MEK inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Our study supports the association between the expression of DUSP6 and the activation of ERK1/2 at the protein level in ER− BC, suggesting that DUSP6 could be used in these patients as a predictive biomarker for treatment with MEK inhibitors, like trametinib. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>The pathway analysis carried out in this study in ER− BCs, derived from the differential expression of phosphatases, lends support to other reports in the literature of BC regarding the role of the MAPK (32) and PI3K pathways in ER− BCs in both ERBB2+ and ERBB2− patients (20,23,33). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>However, in addition, it supports that multiple phosphatases targeting the MAPK and PI3K pathways act in a coordinated manner to control the regulation of these pathways as shown by the co-expression network analysis included in this study, suggesting cross-talk at different levels of the two pathways mediated, at least in part, by different phosphatases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>A recent report by Will et al (34) further supports these observations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>In BC cell lines with amplified ERBB2, inhibitors of PI3K pathway are effective in causing apoptosis, that is dependent on a transient inhibition of ERK activation, suggesting that it could be of clinical relevance in these subgroups of BC patients to inhibit both pathways as shown by Will et al (34). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>It is also of interest that the report of Will et al corroborates previous reports placing the RAS-ERK pathway downstream of PI3K under certain cellular contexts. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>We were able to generate and validate in two large independent BC microarrays series (comprising 486 patients) a multiphosphatase signature in untreated, lymph node-negative primary BC patients (both ER+ and ER−) with highly statistically significant differences in DMFS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was only to show the potential prognostic relevance of phosphatases as a functional group of genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>It is noteworthy that a significant number of the phosphatases comprising the signature were found differentially expressed in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>The signature found would need further validation to consider it in the clinical setting, but as pointed out, it was not our purpose, as we did not choose other genes, different from phosphatases or their subunits to generate the signature, that could certainly be more strongly correlated with DMFS in the GEO studies analyzed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>It is interesting to note that phosphatases such as DUSP4 and PTPRC, that are in our signature, are actually part of published BC prognostic signatures (8,35). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Lower levels of DUSP4 are associated with worse prognosis in our multi-phosphatase signature, and also in a recent report profiling residual BCs after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (36). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we characterized the distinctive phosphatome of the major BC phenotypes (ER− ERBB2+, ER− ERBB2−, ER+), and provide evidence of the relevance of the MAPK and PI3K pathways in ER− BC as potential drivers of several of the differentially expressed phosphatases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that these pathways might be of potential therapeutic interest in these patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>We also show that the expression of DUSP6 could be used as a surrogate marker of MAPK activation, and hence as a potential predictive biomarker of activity of MAPK pathway inhibitors in ER− BCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Finally, we show the prognostic value of coordinated phosphatase RNA expression in primary BC by generating and validating a multiphosphatase signature enriched in differentially expressed phosphatases. </plain></SENT>
