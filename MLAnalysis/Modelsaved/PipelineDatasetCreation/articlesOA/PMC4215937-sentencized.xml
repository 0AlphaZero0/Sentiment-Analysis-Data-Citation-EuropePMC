</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC, MedGen 147591) is a disorder of the choroid and the retina characterized by serous detachment of the neurosensory retina and focal angiographic leakage at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) secondary to choroidal vascular exudation Spaide et al., 1996; Wang et al., 2008. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The most common symptoms are a central relative scotoma, metamorphopsia, reduced contrast sensitivity, and reduced color saturation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients with CSC have a favorable prognosis but some patients may experience significant vision loss because of degenerative RPE changes and photoreceptor atrophy after recurrent or persistent serous retinal detachment Wang et al., 2002; Piccolino et al., 2005. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The disorder presents in acute and chronic forms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Acute CSC cases often resolve spontaneously in 3–4 months Yannuzzi, 2010. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Cases that progress to chronic CSC have recurrent or persistent detachments for 6 months or longer Gass, 1977; Yannuzzi et al., 1992. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>It is currently believed that CSC is primarily an exudative choroidal vasculopathy since indocyanine-green (ICG) angiography has revealed choroidal vascular hyperpermeability and staining of choroidal vessels Spaide et al., 1996; Yannuzzi et al., 2003; Pryds et al., 2010. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This is supported by enhanced depth-imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT) having demonstrated increased thickness of the choroid in patients with CSC and reduction of choroidal thickness after photodynamic therapy Imamura et al., 2009; Pryds and Larsen, 2012. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Although CSC is considered a vascular disorder, the primary exudative disturbance resulting in a macular detachment is thought to be nonvasogenic, that is, not associated with proliferation of choroidal vessels, which distinguishes CSC from other forms of macular detachment associated with neovascularization of the choroid and eventual disciform scarring, such as in CNV in AMD Yannuzzi, 1986; Spaide et al., 2008. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The mechanism whereby choroidal hyperpermeability becomes symptomatic involves RPE detachment and detachment of the neurosensory retina, which is presumably caused by increased hydrostatic pressure in the choroid. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The main risk factors for CSC are either endogenous or exogenous corticosteroid imbalance, Garg et al., 1997; Carvalho-Recchia et al., 2002; Yannuzzi, 2010 type A personality, episodes of psychosocial stress, and pregnancy, especially with complications such as (pre)eclampsia Tittl et al., 1999; Carvalho-Recchia et al., 2002. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Other, more minor risk factors include hypertension, elevated plasma testosterone levels and infections (e.g., H. pylori) Mauget-Faysse et al., 2002; Ahnoux-Zabsonre et al., 2004. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of CSC (suggested at 1:10,000) is highest in men and has a peak incidence at 47.5 years of age Tittl et al., 1999; Haimovici et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2005. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The female to male gender ratio is reported to be from 1:3 to 1:4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Familial cases of CSC are very rare, but the existence of familial cases may very likely be obscured by misdiagnosis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in many instances, especially in chronic CSC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The few reports suggesting genetic predisposition to CSC include a description of fundus lesions compatible with CSC in 35 out of 80 relatives of chronic CSC patients Weenink et al., 2001. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Another study reported that two to four siblings were affected with CSC in each of the families of 10 CSC patients, including a parent and offspring pair. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The chronic course of the disease was found in 80% of all eyes presenting with CSC Oosterhuis, 1996. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>CSC has been also reported in monozygotic twins Wyman, 1963. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The mode of inheritance remains obscure. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Although the disease seems to be caused largely by external, environmental factors, this study tested the hypothesis that the existence of familial cases suggests a genetic component directing the response to the external stimuli, such as stress and hormonal imbalance by influencing choroidal endothelial permeability. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>We propose that molecular and structural changes in the choroid may alter the microenvironment of the RPE in a way that affects its transport and barrier capabilities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, this effect appears to be downstream of steroid exposure as organ cultures exposed to prednisolone appeared to possess normal RPE intercellular junctions and functional studies suggest that RPE junctions become less permeable to horseradish peroxidase in corticosteroid-exposed cells (Zeng and Mullins), which is also consistent with elevated claudin-1 expression in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>In summary, the choroidal endothelium and, specifically, CDH5 appear to be targets of corticosteroids in human and animal eyes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>The functional studies were supported by genetic analysis of the CDH5 gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Screening of htSNPs from the entire CDH5 locus revealed strong association of independent variants, and haplotypes tagged by these, with the CSC phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the association was largely driven by the male part of the both cohorts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>CSC is known to be much more prevalent in males; the male:female ratio being, on average, 80:20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the association with males is not overly surprising; however, we have no straightforward explanation for this observation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Similar to the functional part of the study, the genetics part has also some limitations, the main of which is the relatively small samples sizes of both discovery and replication cohorts, which could result in chance findings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>However, we suggest that the results are valid for at least the following four reasons:The association is observed in both discovery and replication cohorts and is remarkably similar in associated variation, and in the strength and direction of association (Tables1 and 2).The association is observed in males, who account for 80% of the disease.Functional/expression studies support the genetic findings and vice versa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>The reduction of CDH5 expression following corticosteroid exposure, which results in the attenuation of cell–cell contacts in the choroidal vasculature, provides a plausible mechanism by which the fluid leakage under the retina, the main feature of CSC, occurs.Involvement of a glucocorticoid response pathway in CSC, specifically through the mineralocorticoid receptor, has been demonstrated in a recent study Zhao et al., 2012. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>If confirmed, the accumulated data could serve as a basis for pretreatment genetic screening of male patients to identify those who are at subtantially elevated risk for developing CSC as a consequence of corticosteroid treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>If applicable, alternative treatments should be considered for cases of high CSC risk. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study describes the first gene/locus associated with CSC and confirms the influence of the corticosteroid imbalance to vascular permeability in the pathophysiology of CSC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>It suggests that steroid-induced suppression of CDH5 expression may be associated with genetic variation in the gene and results in the major feature of this, relatively common ocular disease, the leakage of fluid into the subretinal space, therefore further strengthening the proposed model of CSC that increased choroidal vascular permeability plays a major role in this disorder. </plain></SENT>
