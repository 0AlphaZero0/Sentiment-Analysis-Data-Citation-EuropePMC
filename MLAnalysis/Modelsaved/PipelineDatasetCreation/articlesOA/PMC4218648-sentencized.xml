<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) is a disease transmitted by the filarial worm Wuchereria bancrofti. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>It is earmarked for elimination by the year 2020, and since the year 2000 there have been yearly mass treatment of endemic communities with Ivermectin and Albendazole. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Mass Drug Administration (MDA) coverage for LF increased from three million people treated in 12 countries in 2000, to nearly 950 million in 53 countries in 2011 [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In order to prevent failures of the massive control programs that have been embarked upon, an understanding of how genetic variations within W. bancrofti affect the epidemiology of LF is required in different settings. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In Ghana, studies on LF have shown differences in disease prevalence and multiplicity of symptoms in two geographically distinct regions [3]: the Northern regions of the country exhibit higher prevalence compared to the Southern regions [3, 4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The pattern of the disease manifestations reveal a preponderance of elephantiasis (1.7%), microfilaremia (11.3%), hydrocele (20.3%) and breast lymphedema (6.6%) in the North of Ghana, compared to the south (0.3%, 0.6%, 5.2% and 6.1% respectively) [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>While the reasons for these differences are unknown, it is could be due to the existence of different parasite strains in the country. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Few studies have pointed to genetic and morphological variations in W. bancrofti populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Two different genetic variants of the parasite, have been reported, with high genetic divergence and gene flow in different geoclimatic regions in India [5, 6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In view of the current elimination program [7], which assumes no differences within the parasite population in West Africa, further studies are required in order to formulate appropriate strategies should there be genetic variability in W. bancrofti that may affect the success of MDA programs. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>The data from this initial study indicates that the Southern samples are more distant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>This data does provide relevant information about the possible route of entry of the parasite into Ghana and its subsequent spread. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Consequently, because only anecdotal evidence of the parasites existence and prevalence in Ghana exists prior to 1990, this information is of great importance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>This study, despite the small number of samples analyzed, does reveal some level of genetic variability in W. bancrofti in Ghana, thus adding to the very few studies that aimed at understanding the genetic heterogeneity of W. bancrofti [5, 6, 22]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>The genetic differences observed in this study may be attributed to environmental selection pressures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>This may explain the epidemiological and field observations of LF in Ghana. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>High prevalence of LF in Northern Ghana [3] could be as a result of a recent population expansion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Thus, the negative D value observed in the northern population (Tajima's D= -1.56), reveals that mutations have not resulted in high nucleotide diversity, based on the number of segregating sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, the positive D value (Tajima's D= 1.26) shows that the southern population may have suffered a population bottleneck, resulting in higher nucleotide diversity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>From the phylogenetic tree the closeness of samples from both areas could be a result of migration of microfilaremic individuals from the South to the North or vice versa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Migration is an important routine activity in the Bongo District that occurs during specific times of the year, purposely for economic activities, and could result in the transfer of parasites from the South to the North. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>The current LF control strategy is based on the assumption that MDA can be used alone in areas where W. bancrofti is transmitted by Anopheles species, including most endemic areas in Africa [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>This strategy is dependent on the use of MDA with Albendazole and either DEC or Ivermectin to reduce circulating microfilariae below a threshold level, to break transmission by the disease vectors [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>However, in other areas such as the Polynesian Islands of Moorea and Maupiti, over 50 years of MDA using DEC did not eliminate the disease [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>We posit that the genetic differences in parasite population could be one of many possible explanations for this failure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>These differences could be an indicator of selection pressure on the parasite suggesting that perhaps environmental selection pressures or other factors are in play. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>While no known cases of LF associated drug resistance in humans have yet been reported, the development of drug resistance is a realistic possibility as drug resistance to both Ivermectin and Albendazole is prevalent in nematodes of veterinary importance [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Also, there is some evidence of developing Ivermectin resistance in the closely related O. volvulus [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there have been reports of persistent residual Lf infections in some communities in Ghana and Burkina Faso, despite 5-8 rounds of treatments [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Whiles non-compliance and the influence by vector species may be attributed to these residual LF infections [24]; the possibilities of sub-optimal treatment responses to Ivermectin + Albendazole still remain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Thus, an understanding of the genetic distinctness of various parasite populations could be a useful indicator in assessing and responding to the development of drug resistance in the future. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>The findings of this study may also suggest that the geographic strains of W. bancrofti can make a vector a more or less efficient one. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>In a susceptibility study [29], Culex quinquefasciatus strains from Liberia had a low susceptibility to W. bancrofti from Liberia, while the same strain had a high susceptibility to W. bancrofti from Sri Lanka. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the study concluded that the Liberian and Sri Lankan strains of W. bancrofti differed in their ability to infect specific mosquito strains and therefore confirms our suggestion that the geographic strain of W. bancrofti can improve vector competence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>The same reasons may explain the different epidemiologies of LF in East and West Africa, as to why Culex quinquefasciatus is not a vector of LF in West Africa, but is a very efficient very in urban areas in East Africa [28, 30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>However, this needs to be further investigated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>In order to further explore the results produced in this study, we recommended that further studies with a much larger sample size and more detailed, population analyses be conducted on the diversity of W. bancrofti populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>This will enable the determination of profound conclusions on W. bancrofti diversity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>The availability of the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of W. bancrofti [31] will enhance a further understanding of phylogenetic and geographic relationships between isolates, and assessing population diversity within endemic regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Studies encompassing parasites from different geo-climatic regions will further enhance our understanding of W. bancrofti diversity as well as vector-parasite co-adaptations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Until more information, regarding the impact of W. bancrofti diversity on disease and treatment outcomes, becomes available, it is recommended that MDA be supplemented with vector control in order to ensure effective control of the parasite, in working towards the LF elimination goals of 2020. </plain></SENT>
