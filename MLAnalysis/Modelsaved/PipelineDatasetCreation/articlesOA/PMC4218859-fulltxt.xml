Nevertheless, virus persistence in reservoirs prevents complete virus eradication in patients treated with current therapies <xref rid="pone.0111919-Chun1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0111919-Finzi1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In recent years, <italic>a)</italic> the introduction of new drugs (e.g. viral integrase inhibitors, co-receptor antagonists), in addition to the classic inhibitors of reverse transcriptase and protease, which interfere with other steps in the virus life cycle, and/or new therapeutic vaccinations, <italic>b)</italic> efforts to gain a greater understanding of the nature and role of the reservoir in AIDS pathogenesis and <italic>c)</italic> low-level persistent viremia despite clinically successful antiretroviral therapy have encouraged a careful analysis of the kinetics and relative contributions of the viral DNA to HIV-1 replication and latency during disease progression and ART treatment.</p><p>Total cell-associated HIV-1 DNA (total HIV DNA) is present in infected cells in three major forms that reflect the different stages and fates of development during viral replication: integrated proviral DNA (IDNA) and unintegrated (extrachromosomal) forms (UF) including both linear and circular DNA (1-LTR and 2-LTR). Several authors have shown the presence of small amounts (1% or more) of the aberrant circular forms. HIV-1 infection <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> results in an abundance of UF, regardless of cell type and activation status <xref rid="pone.0111919-Bell1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0111919-Sloan1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Blood, lymphoid tissue and brain tissue show a ratio of extrachromosomal to integrated forms of 99&#8758;1, while the ratio linear/1-LTR/2-LTR is 20&#8758;9&#8758;1 <xref rid="pone.0111919-Chun1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111919-Butler1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111919-Teo1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Regarding stability, the following order was found: integrated DNA&gt;circular DNA (1-LTR and 2-LTR)&gt;linear DNA. The detection of high levels of unintegrated DNA in the brain has been associated with the development of AIDS dementia <xref rid="pone.0111919-Teo1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In particular, 2-LTR circles, have been suggested as a possible marker of recent infection due to their labile nature, although stable unintegrated forms have been shown to exist, and hence their utility as a clinical marker of recent infection is questionable. 2-LTR circles are often viewed as overall markers of all unintegrated forms, although they are present at relatively low levels compared to other HIV DNA species. The extrachromosomal forms are biologically active: they produce functional viral proteins, are toxic to the cell and can trigger the apoptotic cascade <xref rid="pone.0111919-Sloan1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111919-Brussel1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0111919-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Currently, HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4+ T lymphocyte counts are the standard markers used in clinical practice for the management and the monitoring of HIV-1 infected patients. CD4+ T cell counts yield information on the patient's immunological status and the HIV-RNA load provides information on the extent of viral replication at the time of the assay. At present, antiretroviral protocols use drugs that suppress the replicative ability of HIV-1 to the point that circulating virus in plasma becomes undetectable using the standard commercial viral RNA detection assays (20&#8211;50 copies/ml). However, low levels of free virus can still be detected in a majority of patients on ART using ultrasensitive assays. After several years of therapy, this residual viremia reaches a plateau of 1&#8211;10 copies/ml and does not appear to decline any further <xref rid="pone.0111919-Palmer1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Hence, in this scenario, it would be useful to have additional virological markers for monitoring and predicting therapy responses and for measuring the degree of HIV-1 persistence in patients on ART. Assays that quantify viral DNA have been already developed and are taking an important role in HIV cure-related research. Total HIV DNA has been used for a number of years and is currently the most feasible tool available for large-scale clinical trials and cohort studies <xref rid="pone.0111919-Agosto1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0111919-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.

HIV DNA provides essential information on the reservoir and dynamics of the HIV-1 infection, especially in patients with undetectable plasma viremia, in whom HIV DNA could represent the only biomarker of viral activity that can be easily detected. </p><p>The aim of this work was to evaluate the reliability and usefulness of the simultaneous quantification of total and all unintegrated HIV DNA forms (linear+1- and 2-LTR circles) in a wide range of clinical situations. We used a high performance workflow and a PCR plate layout (<italic>TotUFsys</italic> platform), starting from a single cellular DNA recovered once from whole blood of HIV-1 infected patients. These patients reported to the reference hospital for routine clinical tests. Based on a previously developed strategy <xref rid="pone.0111919-Casabianca1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, we improved the whole blood leukocyte assay (pbs-rtPCR) in terms of robustness for total HIV DNA quantification and also developed a new SYBR Green qPCR, which was optimized and validated for quantifying all unintegrated forms. For a further comprehensive analysis of the clinical samples, we also developed a SYBR Green qPCR based method to specifically detect 2-LTR circles in the same cellular DNA samples used for the quantification of total and unintegrated HIV DNA. Both the <italic>TotUFsys</italic> platform and the 2-LTR assay were developed analyzing the Guidelines for the Validation of Analytical Procedures (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ich.org">http://www.ich.org</ext-link>).

In the present investigation, the possible use of a small amount of cellular DNA (5 &#181;g) was evaluated. This DNA was obtained by the phenol extraction procedure able to ensure an HMW of typically &#8764;100&#8211;200 Kb <xref rid="pone.0111919-Sambrook1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and non degraded DNA. The genomic DNA extracted using commercial kits (&lt;50 kb) could be co-purified in the eluate fraction. To assess the performance of this approach, 5 &#181;g of an HMW DNA sample and an equal amount of the molecular weight Marker II (Lambda DNA/HindIII), used as a procedure monitor, were processed in columns and the eluate fractions were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The results showed the absence of HMW DNA&gt;10 Kb and a slight degradation of the DNA sample, demonstrating the ability of the procedure to selectively recover the DNA which approximates the genome length of HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111919.s002">Figure S2</xref>). To assess the extent of DNA degradation, the &#946;-actin housekeeping gene was amplified and quantified on ACTstd. The percentage was estimated at 5.0&#177;1.3% (mean&#177;SD, n&#8202;=&#8202;20), revealing the presence of a negligible amount of HMW DNA fragments co-purified in the low molecular weight (LMW) DNA fraction, containing unintegrated HIV DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111919.s008">Table S6</xref>). Clearly, this drawback was intrinsic in the spin-column method itself, and did not affect the final results. To measure the actual recovery of unintegrated forms, the 13 Kb pEXg plasmid, which simulates the HIV-1 genome length, was included at the beginning of the column separation procedure as an exogenous standard. A typical experiment involved the addition of known amounts of the pEXg (10&#8743;2 or 10&#8743;3 copies) to 5 &#181;g of cellular DNA, followed by the evaluation of the recovered quantity by qPCR.

The median total HIV DNA was 17 (range: &lt;2&#8211;923, IQR: 5&#8211;40) and 693 copies (range: 12&#8211;30044, IQR: 180&#8211;1584) per &#181;g of DNA or ml of whole blood, respectively; the median unintegrated HIV DNA was 5 (range: &lt;2&#8211;238, IQR: &lt;2&#8211;14) and 192 copies (range: 12&#8211;6931, IQR: 76&#8211;549). The integrated HIV DNA revealed a median of 9 (range: &lt;2&#8211;802, IQR: &lt;2&#8211;26) and 355 (range: 12&#8211;26105, IQR: 72&#8211;1016) per &#181;g of DNA or ml of whole blood, respectively. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111919-g003">Figure 3</xref> are reported the percentages of copy number distribution of the total, unintegrated and integrated HIV DNA forms. We evidenced that 65% of sample quantifications of the various forms were in the range 2&#8211;60 copies, supporting the use of the half-log dilution standard curve to enhance precision of the data. To account for the variation in the number of CD4+ T cells in different samples, the results were further normalized by the CD4+ percentage of total WBC and expressed as copies/10<sup>4</sup> CD4+. This normalization is based on the assumption that most of the HIV DNA is in the CD4+ T cells <xref rid="pone.0111919-Eriksson1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111919-Finzi2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and on our statistical analysis which showed an average of 10867 CD4+ analyzed per &#181;g of DNA (median, range: 8632, 158&#8211;34869).

The integrated form showed a median of 10 (range: 0&#8211;950, IQR: 3&#8211;32) copies per 10<sup>4</sup> CD4+. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111919-t003">Table 3</xref> shows the differences in HIV DNA load in some samples according to the normalization procedure that was chosen. Individuals with quite similar data trends regarding total HIV DNA copies/&#181;g (or ml of blood) recorded in two sequential visits (patients 9&#8211;35), actually show at least a two-fold decrease in the content of HIV DNA copies/&#181;g or even a nearly 20-fold decrease, considering the same data expressed for 10<sup>4</sup> CD4+ T cells. This decrease correlates with the increase in equal measure of the percentage of CD4+ T cells. The decrease in HIV DNA content is actually much more evident considering the data normalized for 10<sup>4</sup> CD4+, a nearly five-fold decrease (patients 41, 26, 22). Likewise, an apparent two- to five-fold increase (patients 33, 52, 56) results in no change in the HIV DNA load for 10<sup>4</sup> CD4+. Due to the impact of the normalization procedure on the quantification of HIV DNA, we decided henceforth to conduct each type of subsequent analyses comparing the data obtained by qPCR (copy number/&#181;g DNA) to those expressed for 10<sup>4</sup> CD4+ T cells, considering these data to be more informative than HIV DNA per ml of blood.</p><fig id="pone-0111919-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0111919.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Distribution of total, unintegrated and integrated HIV DNA copy number in four range: very low (&lt;2 copies), low (2&#8211;10), medium (&gt;10&#8211;60) and high (&lt;60) for 195 blood samples.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0111919.g003"/></fig><table-wrap id="pone-0111919-t003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0111919.t003</object-id><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>The effect of the data normalization procedure on the quantification of HIV DNA in blood samples from HIV-1 positive subjects.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0111919-t003-3" xlink:href="pone.0111919.t003"/></alternatives></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Correlations between study parameters in blood samples</title><p>The correlations between the amount of HIV DNA and plasma viremia or CD4+ T cell counts and between HIV-1 RNA and CD4+ were examined using Spearman's rank test.

When all 195 samples were analyzed together, no significant correlation was observed between plasma viremia and CD4+ (r&#8202;=&#8202;&#8722;0.14, p&#8202;=&#8202;0.05) and there was a marginal positive correlation between plasma viremia and the amount of unintegrated HIV DNA (r&#8202;=&#8202;0.31, p&lt;0.0001). However, there was a moderate inverse correlation between CD4+ T cell counts and both total (r&#8202;=&#8202;&#8722;0.48, p&lt;0.0001) and UF HIV DNA (r&#8202;=&#8202;&#8722;0.52, p&lt;0.0001). Due to the wide range of clinical situations within our cohort of samples, correlations were evaluated in different subsets, dividing them into six groups according to various criteria. Two groups were defined according to evidence of resistance: MDR (Multidrug resistant HIV-1 infection) and non-MDR. Three groups were identified on the basis of therapy: ART, under RAL, and without therapy (Na&#239;ve). Finally, a sixth group was defined according to measurable plasma viremia (HIV-1 RNA&gt;50 copies/ml). There was an inverse moderate correlation between viral load and CD4+ T cell counts only in the treatment-na&#239;ve group (r&#8202;=&#8202;&#8722;0.57, p&lt;0.005). Plasma viremia showed a weak positive correlation with HIV DNA (total and UF) in the non-MDR group (r&#8805;0.31, p&lt;0.005), it correlated strongly with HIV DNA in the treatment-na&#239;ve group (r&#8805;0.66, p&lt;0.0001) and in the samples with measurable plasma viremia (r&#8805;0.40, p&#8804;0.005). Each of these correlations was stronger when the UF were considered. Interestingly, there was consistently a significant inverse correlation between CD4+ and HIV DNA in all the groups examined (r within &#8722;0.40 and &#8722;0.77, p&lt;0.0001). Such inverse correlations were stronger for UF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111919-g004">Figure 4</xref>). We selected 45 subjects for whom at least two sequential samples were available, to compare samples from an arbitrary time zero (START, first sampling available) to those taken at the end of the observation period (STOP, last sampling available) and the following groups were analyzed: treatment-na&#239;ve, under ART, ART-subjects under RAL intensification and a last group was formed by combining the latter two groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111919.s012">Table S10</xref>). It should be noted that for the 45 patients, while a modest correlation between plasma viremia and CD4+ (r&#8202;=&#8202;&#8722;0.29, p&#8202;=&#8202;0.06) or HIV DNA (r&#8805;0.40, p&#8805;0.01) is reduced to insignificant values from the beginning to the end of the observation period, the higher inverse correlation between CD4+ and HIV DNA observed at the beginning (r&#8804;&#8722;0.67, p&lt;0.0001) remained moderate at the end of the observation period (r&#8202;=&#8202;&#8722;0.53, p&lt;0.005). In the treatment-na&#239;ve group, there were no statistically significant correlations (p&#8805;0.23). This may be due to the small number of patients. For patients under the ART regimen, significant initial moderate inverse correlations were observed between CD4+ T cell counts and both plasma viremia (r&#8202;=&#8202;&#8722;0.53, p&#8202;=&#8202;0.02) and total HIV DNA (r&#8202;=&#8202;&#8722;0.62, p&#8202;=&#8202;0.01), and a stronger correlation was found with UF (r&#8202;=&#8202;&#8722;0.73, p&lt;0.005). At the end of the observation period, the only correlation that is was still evident, although not statistically significant, was between CD4+ and UF (r&#8202;=&#8202;&#8722;0.42, p&#8202;=&#8202;0.09).

Recent reports suggest that transcription from unintegrated HIV DNA appears to be a normal early step in HIV replication pointing to a potential role for unintegrated viral DNA in HIV-1 pathogenesis. High levels of UF can be detected <italic>in vivo</italic> and it is the most prevalent form of HIV DNA (2 log more than IDNA) in resting and activated CD4+ T cells <xref rid="pone.0111919-Brussel3" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111919-Wu2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p>QPCR-based methods are now available to accurately quantify HIV DNA forms and they are widely used to explore the pathogenetic role of reservoirs, viral persistence and to monitor the effectiveness of antiviral therapy. Some of these assays have a throughput which is too low (up to 40 replicates for just a single sample) <xref rid="pone.0111919-ODoherty1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and too expensive for use in large clinical trials or in routine clinical practice to complement CD4+ T cell counts and HIV-1 RNA, which are routinely used in the management of HIV-1 infected patients. Some authors have performed a concurrent measurement of total and integrated HIV DNA <xref rid="pone.0111919-Carr1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0111919-Mexas1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. However, no methodology has been developed for assaying total HIV DNA and all unintegrated forms in a relatively simple manner. The aim of this work was to evaluate the reliability and usefulness of the simultaneous quantification of total and unintegrated HIV DNA forms <italic>(TotUFsys</italic> platform) in HIV-1 blood samples. The novelty of the strategy lies in the fact that for each sample, both measurements are obtained in a single PCR run starting from a single DNA isolated from a small amount of frozen blood, omitting the PBMC separation on ficoll-hypaque gradient. The assay uses specific primers spanning the highly conserved PBS region and its flanking sequences <xref rid="pone.0111919-Casabianca1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and is unaffected by the location of the HIV-1 integration site, unlike the <italic>Alu</italic>-assay <xref rid="pone.0111919-Koelsch1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111919-ODoherty1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Employing the same primers and using a single standard curve, the identical amplification efficiency and sensitivity allowed us to accurately compare the data. Moreover, it appears that the integrated level can be calculated indirectly as the difference between the total and unintegrated HIV DNA. Unlike other published reports, for the first time, the UF were separated from HMW DNA through column chromatography on silica gel, starting from a small amount of cellular DNA (5 &#181;g) and then quantified in the LMW fraction. The phenol-chloroform DNA extraction procedure ensured a not degraded, HMW DNA, and only a slight cross-contamination of genomic DNA fragments in the LMW fraction were observed. Other faster or automated DNA extraction procedures may also be used, first thoroughly assessing genomic DNA contamination in the eluate fraction. The high rate of recovery demonstrates the feasibility of the separation method starting with DNA to measure extrachromosomal forms in HIV patients. A qPCR to specifically detect 2-LTR circles in the same DNA sample used for the quantification of total and UF HIV DNA was also developed. Due to the unique nature of the LTR-LTR junction, which can be readily assayed by PCR <xref rid="pone.0111919-Butler1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, the 2-LTR circles are often recognized as overall markers of all unintegrated forms and it has been suggested that could be a surrogate marker of HIV-1 replication, although their use remains debatable, primarily due to controversy regarding their half-life. Because of this ongoing dispute and the low 2-LTR levels (also confirmed in our group of samples), the quantification of all the unintegrated forms seemed a more correct approach to reduce the percentage of samples near the low quantification limit (from 53% to 29%). However, the method is a useful tool for the quantification of 2-LTR in DNA samples from <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments involving the use of purified CD4+ T cells, PBMC or macrophages, where a higher content of these forms is expected. The decision to develop both the 2-LTR and <italic>TotUFsys</italic> assays based on SYBR Green instead of fluorogenic probes stems from the high LTR-LTR junction sequence heterogeneity <xref rid="pone.0111919-Jurriaans1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, and the fact that the presence of even just a single mismatched base at the 5&#8242; end of the probe can fail to detect the target sequence and/or affect the quantifications with the risk of &#8220;false negative&#8221; results. High sensitivity (2 copies), high amplification efficiency and specificity across different clades within group M were demonstrated. In addition, no cross-reactivity with HERV, which are highly similar in terms of DNA sequence to HIV-1, was revealed in HIV-negative samples, confirming the absence of interference in very low HIV DNA copy quantification and a realistic diagnostic specificity. The accuracy of the results was improved by a standard of half-log plasmid dilutions in the low range of quantification. Reproducibility was realistic over the experimentally determined standard curve dynamic range, showing the reliability of the technical set-up over time. Moreover, to maximize assay precision in the samples with a low HIV DNA level (copy number &#8804;30), repetitive sampling (8 replicates) allowed us to report standard deviation, coefficient of variation and confidence interval. Reliable, simultaneous quantification of total and unintegrated HIV DNA was obtained for 195 blood samples collected from HIV-1 patients in a wide range of clinical pictures during routine laboratory monitoring. A high success rate was obtained for all the samples, even those from patients with suppressed plasma viremia, regardless of CD4+ T cell counts, or therapy. We conducted each type of analysis by considering normalization per &#181;g of DNA as well as per 10<sup>4</sup> CD4+ since they harbour most of the HIV-1 genomes detectable in blood, highlighting that inappropriate normalization may induce misleading effects and conclusion regarding the real state of patient health. Moreover, when the amount of HIV DNA is expressed for CD4+, the results could have greater relevance.</p><p>If we consider all the samples together, while there was only a marginal positive correlation between plasma viremia and the amount of HIV DNA, both total HIV DNA and unintegrated forms inversely correlated with CD4+ T cell counts. However, no significant correlation was observed between the two currently most frequently used prognostic markers: plasma viremia and CD4+ count. Within the cohort of patients, correlations were evaluated in six different clinical situations. There was consistently a significant inverse correlation between CD4+ and HIV DNA in all subsets, reaching the highest value between CD4+ and unintegrated HIV DNA and no significant correlation was found between HIV-1 RNA and CD4+, except for the treatment-na&#239;ve group. Forty-five subjects monitored for an observation period, showed the strongest correlation between CD4+ and HIV DNA and this was the only correlation that remains over time. The same conclusion could be drawn even when considering separately subjects under ART, subjects under RAL intensification or the combination of these. In particular, from moderate to very strong correlations were observed frequently between CD4+ and total HIV DNA, and almost always between CD4+ and unintegrated HIV DNA. These analyses highlight the limited correlation between CD4+ and plasma viremia in patients under classical ART or/and ART plus an integrase inhibitor agent such as Raltegravir and show that the correlation is often lost after effective ART. In general, we found that in our cohort of patients representing different clinical situations, there was a weak or no correlation between CD4+ and viremia. However, we found a high inverse correlation between CD4+ and HIV DNA with the strongest correlations for unintegrated forms.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The use of a distinctive and well-performing workflow and a layout of PCR plates (<italic>TotUFsys</italic> platform), allowed us to obtain in less than two working days, HIV DNA copy number per &#181;g of DNA or 10<sup>4</sup> CD4+ for 12 HIV-1 patients. We developed a practical method able to simultaneously measure total and unintegrated HIV DNA as well as indirectly integrated provirus, in a wide range of clinical situations typical of HIV-1 infection, such as treatment-naive, under effective/suboptimal ART, new drug regimes, MDR and or co-infected patients. Because the assay makes use of frozen whole blood specimens, it has broad applications and is well-suited for a large series of sequential samples collected within clinical trials/vaccination protocols. A careful choice of the most suitable DNA extraction method makes it possible to easily adapt our assay to alternative sample types such as tissue biopsies, purified CD4+ T cells, PBMC or macrophages from <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, and on the same specimen collected for routine plasma viremia determination, after removal of the plasma for the HIV-RNA assay. Our findings support the quantification of total and unintegrated HIV DNA as an additional or alternative tool to traditional assays to estimate the state of viral infection, the risk of disease progression and to monitor the effects of therapy (suppressive or new treatments), providing useful data that could influence decisions whether to initiate, change, intensify or simplify the ART.

For the pEXg and &#946;-actin, a variable quantity of DNA was assayed on the basis of the specific PCR experiment. The amplification profile for total HIV DNA, unintegrated HIV DNA, pEXg and &#946;-actin was as follows: one cycle of 10 min at 95&#176;C to activate the Hot-Rescue DNA polymerase followed by 40 cycles in two steps, consisting of 15 sec at 95&#176;C and 35 sec at 68&#176;C, while for 2-LTR circles one cycle of 15 min at 95&#176;C followed by 40 cycles of three steps consisting of 95&#176;C for 15 sec, annealing at 60&#176;C for 20 sec and extension at 72&#176;C for 35 sec. The fluorescence intensity of the products was measured at the end of each cycle and post-PCR melt curve analysis was performed to detect primer-dimers or other non-specific products and to confirm the specificity of the target.
