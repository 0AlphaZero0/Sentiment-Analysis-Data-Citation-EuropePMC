</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>HIV infection has been transformed over the past two decades from a lethal disease to a manageable chronic condition thanks to the advent of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, virus persistence in reservoirs prevents complete virus eradication in patients treated with current therapies [1]–[3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In recent years, a) the introduction of new drugs (e.g. viral integrase inhibitors, co-receptor antagonists), in addition to the classic inhibitors of reverse transcriptase and protease, which interfere with other steps in the virus life cycle, and/or new therapeutic vaccinations, b) efforts to gain a greater understanding of the nature and role of the reservoir in AIDS pathogenesis and c) low-level persistent viremia despite clinically successful antiretroviral therapy have encouraged a careful analysis of the kinetics and relative contributions of the viral DNA to HIV-1 replication and latency during disease progression and ART treatment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Total cell-associated HIV-1 DNA (total HIV DNA) is present in infected cells in three major forms that reflect the different stages and fates of development during viral replication: integrated proviral DNA (IDNA) and unintegrated (extrachromosomal) forms (UF) including both linear and circular DNA (1-LTR and 2-LTR). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Several authors have shown the presence of small amounts (1% or more) of the aberrant circular forms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>HIV-1 infection in vitro and in vivo results in an abundance of UF, regardless of cell type and activation status [4]–[7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Blood, lymphoid tissue and brain tissue show a ratio of extrachromosomal to integrated forms of 99∶1, while the ratio linear/1-LTR/2-LTR is 20∶9∶1 [1], [8], [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Regarding stability, the following order was found: integrated DNA&gt;circular DNA (1-LTR and 2-LTR)&gt;linear DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The detection of high levels of unintegrated DNA in the brain has been associated with the development of AIDS dementia [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In particular, 2-LTR circles, have been suggested as a possible marker of recent infection due to their labile nature, although stable unintegrated forms have been shown to exist, and hence their utility as a clinical marker of recent infection is questionable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>2-LTR circles are often viewed as overall markers of all unintegrated forms, although they are present at relatively low levels compared to other HIV DNA species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The extrachromosomal forms are biologically active: they produce functional viral proteins, are toxic to the cell and can trigger the apoptotic cascade [7], [10]–[12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Currently, HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4+ T lymphocyte counts are the standard markers used in clinical practice for the management and the monitoring of HIV-1 infected patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>CD4+ T cell counts yield information on the patient's immunological status and the HIV-RNA load provides information on the extent of viral replication at the time of the assay. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>At present, antiretroviral protocols use drugs that suppress the replicative ability of HIV-1 to the point that circulating virus in plasma becomes undetectable using the standard commercial viral RNA detection assays (20–50 copies/ml). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>However, low levels of free virus can still be detected in a majority of patients on ART using ultrasensitive assays. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>After several years of therapy, this residual viremia reaches a plateau of 1–10 copies/ml and does not appear to decline any further [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Hence, in this scenario, it would be useful to have additional virological markers for monitoring and predicting therapy responses and for measuring the degree of HIV-1 persistence in patients on ART. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Assays that quantify viral DNA have been already developed and are taking an important role in HIV cure-related research. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Total HIV DNA has been used for a number of years and is currently the most feasible tool available for large-scale clinical trials and cohort studies [14]–[20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Several reports have investigated the prognostic value of HIV DNA measurement as a marker of disease progression and treatment efficacy [21]–[27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>HIV DNA provides essential information on the reservoir and dynamics of the HIV-1 infection, especially in patients with undetectable plasma viremia, in whom HIV DNA could represent the only biomarker of viral activity that can be easily detected. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to evaluate the reliability and usefulness of the simultaneous quantification of total and all unintegrated HIV DNA forms (linear+1- and 2-LTR circles) in a wide range of clinical situations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>We used a high performance workflow and a PCR plate layout (TotUFsys platform), starting from a single cellular DNA recovered once from whole blood of HIV-1 infected patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>These patients reported to the reference hospital for routine clinical tests. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Based on a previously developed strategy [28], we improved the whole blood leukocyte assay (pbs-rtPCR) in terms of robustness for total HIV DNA quantification and also developed a new SYBR Green qPCR, which was optimized and validated for quantifying all unintegrated forms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>For a further comprehensive analysis of the clinical samples, we also developed a SYBR Green qPCR based method to specifically detect 2-LTR circles in the same cellular DNA samples used for the quantification of total and unintegrated HIV DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Both the TotUFsys platform and the 2-LTR assay were developed analyzing the Guidelines for the Validation of Analytical Procedures (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ich.org">http://www.ich.org</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>An appropriate exogenous control was added to monitor the various steps of the procedure, and negative controls were also tested. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>The selective separation of extrachromosomal HIV DNA from high molecular weight (HMW) genomic DNA, which could harbor integrated HIV-1 provirus, was performed adapting a plasmid DNA purification through column chromatography on silica gel procedure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>This strategy was reported for the first time by Sharkey et al. [6] for the selective detection of 2-LTR circles and by others [15], [31] using a PBMC pellet of about ∼2–6×10∧7 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>In the present investigation, the possible use of a small amount of cellular DNA (5 µg) was evaluated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>This DNA was obtained by the phenol extraction procedure able to ensure an HMW of typically ∼100–200 Kb [32] and non degraded DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>The genomic DNA extracted using commercial kits (&lt;50 kb) could be co-purified in the eluate fraction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>To assess the performance of this approach, 5 µg of an HMW DNA sample and an equal amount of the molecular weight Marker II (Lambda DNA/HindIII), used as a procedure monitor, were processed in columns and the eluate fractions were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>The results showed the absence of HMW DNA&gt;10 Kb and a slight degradation of the DNA sample, demonstrating the ability of the procedure to selectively recover the DNA which approximates the genome length of HIV-1 (Figure S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>To assess the extent of DNA degradation, the β-actin housekeeping gene was amplified and quantified on ACTstd. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>The percentage was estimated at 5.0±1.3% (mean±SD, n = 20), revealing the presence of a negligible amount of HMW DNA fragments co-purified in the low molecular weight (LMW) DNA fraction, containing unintegrated HIV DNA (Table S6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Clearly, this drawback was intrinsic in the spin-column method itself, and did not affect the final results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>To measure the actual recovery of unintegrated forms, the 13 Kb pEXg plasmid, which simulates the HIV-1 genome length, was included at the beginning of the column separation procedure as an exogenous standard. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>A typical experiment involved the addition of known amounts of the pEXg (10∧2 or 10∧3 copies) to 5 µg of cellular DNA, followed by the evaluation of the recovered quantity by qPCR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Repeated experiments showed high levels of recovery (94%–98%, Table S7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>We used 10∧2 and 10∧3 plasmid copies because the expected copies/PCR were 10 and 100 respectively, reflecting the HIV DNA content found in HIV-1 positive patients (range from 2 to 108 in 73 samples) [28]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Total cell-associated HIV-1 DNA consists of unintegrated linear and circular 1-LTR and 2-LTR forms and integrated proviral DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Recent reports suggest that transcription from unintegrated HIV DNA appears to be a normal early step in HIV replication pointing to a potential role for unintegrated viral DNA in HIV-1 pathogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>High levels of UF can be detected in vivo and it is the most prevalent form of HIV DNA (2 log more than IDNA) in resting and activated CD4+ T cells [35], [36]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>QPCR-based methods are now available to accurately quantify HIV DNA forms and they are widely used to explore the pathogenetic role of reservoirs, viral persistence and to monitor the effectiveness of antiviral therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Some of these assays have a throughput which is too low (up to 40 replicates for just a single sample) [37] and too expensive for use in large clinical trials or in routine clinical practice to complement CD4+ T cell counts and HIV-1 RNA, which are routinely used in the management of HIV-1 infected patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Some authors have performed a concurrent measurement of total and integrated HIV DNA [16]–[18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>However, no methodology has been developed for assaying total HIV DNA and all unintegrated forms in a relatively simple manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to evaluate the reliability and usefulness of the simultaneous quantification of total and unintegrated HIV DNA forms (TotUFsys platform) in HIV-1 blood samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>The novelty of the strategy lies in the fact that for each sample, both measurements are obtained in a single PCR run starting from a single DNA isolated from a small amount of frozen blood, omitting the PBMC separation on ficoll-hypaque gradient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>The assay uses specific primers spanning the highly conserved PBS region and its flanking sequences [28] and is unaffected by the location of the HIV-1 integration site, unlike the Alu-assay [17], [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Employing the same primers and using a single standard curve, the identical amplification efficiency and sensitivity allowed us to accurately compare the data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it appears that the integrated level can be calculated indirectly as the difference between the total and unintegrated HIV DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Unlike other published reports, for the first time, the UF were separated from HMW DNA through column chromatography on silica gel, starting from a small amount of cellular DNA (5 µg) and then quantified in the LMW fraction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>The phenol-chloroform DNA extraction procedure ensured a not degraded, HMW DNA, and only a slight cross-contamination of genomic DNA fragments in the LMW fraction were observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Other faster or automated DNA extraction procedures may also be used, first thoroughly assessing genomic DNA contamination in the eluate fraction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>The high rate of recovery demonstrates the feasibility of the separation method starting with DNA to measure extrachromosomal forms in HIV patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>A qPCR to specifically detect 2-LTR circles in the same DNA sample used for the quantification of total and UF HIV DNA was also developed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Due to the unique nature of the LTR-LTR junction, which can be readily assayed by PCR [8], the 2-LTR circles are often recognized as overall markers of all unintegrated forms and it has been suggested that could be a surrogate marker of HIV-1 replication, although their use remains debatable, primarily due to controversy regarding their half-life. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Because of this ongoing dispute and the low 2-LTR levels (also confirmed in our group of samples), the quantification of all the unintegrated forms seemed a more correct approach to reduce the percentage of samples near the low quantification limit (from 53% to 29%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>However, the method is a useful tool for the quantification of 2-LTR in DNA samples from in vitro experiments involving the use of purified CD4+ T cells, PBMC or macrophages, where a higher content of these forms is expected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>The decision to develop both the 2-LTR and TotUFsys assays based on SYBR Green instead of fluorogenic probes stems from the high LTR-LTR junction sequence heterogeneity [38], and the fact that the presence of even just a single mismatched base at the 5′ end of the probe can fail to detect the target sequence and/or affect the quantifications with the risk of “false negative” results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>High sensitivity (2 copies), high amplification efficiency and specificity across different clades within group M were demonstrated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>In addition, no cross-reactivity with HERV, which are highly similar in terms of DNA sequence to HIV-1, was revealed in HIV-negative samples, confirming the absence of interference in very low HIV DNA copy quantification and a realistic diagnostic specificity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of the results was improved by a standard of half-log plasmid dilutions in the low range of quantification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Reproducibility was realistic over the experimentally determined standard curve dynamic range, showing the reliability of the technical set-up over time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Moreover, to maximize assay precision in the samples with a low HIV DNA level (copy number ≤30), repetitive sampling (8 replicates) allowed us to report standard deviation, coefficient of variation and confidence interval. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Reliable, simultaneous quantification of total and unintegrated HIV DNA was obtained for 195 blood samples collected from HIV-1 patients in a wide range of clinical pictures during routine laboratory monitoring. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>A high success rate was obtained for all the samples, even those from patients with suppressed plasma viremia, regardless of CD4+ T cell counts, or therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>We conducted each type of analysis by considering normalization per µg of DNA as well as per 104 CD4+ since they harbour most of the HIV-1 genomes detectable in blood, highlighting that inappropriate normalization may induce misleading effects and conclusion regarding the real state of patient health. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Within the cohort of patients, correlations were evaluated in six different clinical situations. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>The use of a distinctive and well-performing workflow and a layout of PCR plates (TotUFsys platform), allowed us to obtain in less than two working days, HIV DNA copy number per µg of DNA or 104 CD4+ for 12 HIV-1 patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>We developed a practical method able to simultaneously measure total and unintegrated HIV DNA as well as indirectly integrated provirus, in a wide range of clinical situations typical of HIV-1 infection, such as treatment-naive, under effective/suboptimal ART, new drug regimes, MDR and or co-infected patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Because the assay makes use of frozen whole blood specimens, it has broad applications and is well-suited for a large series of sequential samples collected within clinical trials/vaccination protocols. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>A careful choice of the most suitable DNA extraction method makes it possible to easily adapt our assay to alternative sample types such as tissue biopsies, purified CD4+ T cells, PBMC or macrophages from in vitro experiments, and on the same specimen collected for routine plasma viremia determination, after removal of the plasma for the HIV-RNA assay. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Our findings support the quantification of total and unintegrated HIV DNA as an additional or alternative tool to traditional assays to estimate the state of viral infection, the risk of disease progression and to monitor the effects of therapy (suppressive or new treatments), providing useful data that could influence decisions whether to initiate, change, intensify or simplify the ART. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the newly developed TotUFsys platform is relatively fast and less labor intensive than other already existing quantification assays. </plain></SENT>
