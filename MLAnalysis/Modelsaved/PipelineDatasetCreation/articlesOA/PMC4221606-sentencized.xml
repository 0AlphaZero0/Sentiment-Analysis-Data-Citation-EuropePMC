</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Viruses are classified based on their properties, such as morphology, serology, host range, genome organization and sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>With the development of better sequencing technologies, more virus sequences have become available in public databases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In the last ten years (as of June, 2014), the total number of virus sequences in the GenBank database increased from 0.2 million to 1.8 million, and the total number of complete viral genome sequences collected in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Viral Genome Project [1] increased from 1,150 to 3,980. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This makes sequence-based virus classification more feasible. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The most commonly used sequence-based virus classification tool is phylogenetic analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The classification of about 70 % of the families and floating genera described in the Ninth Report of the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) is supported by phylogenetic trees [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>However, phylogenetic analysis is usually computationally intensive and requires expertise to interpret the results. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Lauber and Gorbalenya [3] developed a sequence-based virus classification method called DEmARC (DivErsity pArtitioning by hieRarchical Clustering). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In this approach, multiple sequence alignment is performed on proteins from all genomes of a virus family, and the pairwise evolutionary distances (PEDs) among all genomes are calculated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The distribution of PEDs is used to quantitatively estimate hierarchy levels of taxonomy in the family. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>DEmARC is objective and has been applied to the classification in the families Picornaviridae [3] and Filoviridae [4], but it is not well suited for high-throughput applications. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Recently, a novel method using Natural Vector, based on distributions of nucleotide sequences, was reported to characterize phylogenetic relationships among some viruses [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Its application to virus classification has been investigated [6], and high prediction accuracies have been achieved at the genus level and above. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Its ability to classify viruses at the species level needs to be improved. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Another sequence-based molecular classification method for viruses is based on pairwise identities of virus sequences within a virus family. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>A histogram is then generated to represent the number of virus pairs at each percentage of sequence identity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>This will usually produce peaks that represent different taxonomic groups such as strains, species, and genera, and the percentages of the lowest points between the peaks can be used as demarcation criteria for different taxa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>This method has been applied to a few viral taxonomic groups including the families Coronaviridae [7], Geminiviridae [8–10], Papillomoviridae [11], Picornaviridae [12], Potyviridae [13] and the species Rotavirus A [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>A major drawback of this method is the inconsistency of the results when different protocols are used to calculate the pairwise identities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The exact algorithm and parameters used to establish the demarcation criteria are very difficult for researchers to reproduce when testing their own sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The identities obtained from different protocols are therefore not comparable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>To overcome this problem, NCBI created a PASC (Pairwise Sequence Comparison) resource [15], where the same protocol is used for both procedures. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>We have applied a new algorithm and added several new features to the NCBI PASC tool since it was initially launched, and these will be described in this paper. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The new implementations greatly enhance the performance of the tool and improve the results by eliminating artifacts that were associated with the old method. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>For viruses whose genomes are smaller than 32 kb, the alignment is done using the global Needleman-Wunsch alignment algorithm [16] with the affine scoring model. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Since genomes can vary in length, terminal gaps are not penalized. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Two rounds of BLAST [18] are performed on each pair of genome sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>In the first round, the translated protein sequences of one genome in six frames are searched against the nucleotide sequence of the other genome using tblastn. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>In the second BLAST round, pairwise blastn is carried out on the nucleotide sequences of the genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>We then select a consistent set of hits from the two sets of BLAST results, giving preference to higher-identity hits and trimming overlaps out of lower-identity hits, to generate a set of hits that do not overlap in any region on any genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>This process will select blastn hits for closely related genomes, but most likely tblastn hits for distant ones. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>A mixture of blastn and tblastn hits might be used in some cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>The aligned regions used to calculate the identities can be viewed as a matrix plot and detailed alignments in text (see the upper part of Fig. 5 for an example). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Since our algorithm does not discriminate between genuine and spurious BLAST hits, nor does it evaluate the likelihood of an open reading frame being expressed in vivo, some false BLAST hits might be used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Also, because of the overlap-trimming process, our algorithm creates some artificial tiny hits (as short as 1 nucleotide). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>But the number of artificial hits is far smaller than that of genuine hits (compare the tiny dots with the lines marked with arrows in the upper plot in Fig. 5) and therefore can be ignored. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>The BLAST-based alignment panel in Fig. 1 demonstrates a good PASC result where the bars of different colors group together and the groups are well separated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>This indicates that a) the classification based on sequence identities of genomes in the family Microviridae agrees mostly with the current ICTV taxonomy; b) the taxonomy assignment of genome sequences within the family in the INSDC databases (DDBJ/ENA/GenBank) are fairly accurate; c) clear species and genus demarcations can be set for the family, which is between 82 % and 85 % for species, and between 28 % and 34 % for genera. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>It is important to keep in mind that when selecting demarcations, users should focus on the sizes of gaps between the peaks rather than the heights of the peaks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>The peak heights are determined by the number of genomes in each species and genus and therefore could be misleading due to sampling bias within particular species/genera. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>The gap sizes, on the other hand, indicate the possibility that these regions will be filled with sequences from novel viruses. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Recently, we added a new feature in PASC that allows users to test ideas for genus/species demarcation and see what taxonomy changes are needed using existing sequences to achieve user-selected demarcations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Figure 2 illustrates how taxonomy changes can be simulated in the family Caliciviridae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>The upper plot shows the pairwise identity distribution of 274 genomes calculated by BLAST-based alignment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>We can see green and yellow bars in the 15-20 % range, mixed with the dominating peach bars; and some yellow bars in the greater than 69 % region, mixed with the dominating green bars. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>This indicates that some of the viruses might be assigned to an incorrect lineage by GenBank sequence submitters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Also, the current species demarcation criteria are probably too low for the percentage of sequence similarity, because the green bars go all the way down in the region below 40 %, which is not common in other virus families.Fig. 2Frequency distribution of pairwise identities from the complete genome sequence comparison of 274 caliciviruses, and the simulation of taxonomy changes using proposed species and genus demarcations </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>To explore different demarcations, users can try different numbers for “Merge species above” and “Separate species below”, and for “Merge genera above” and “Separate genera below” as indicated at the lower left section of “Taxonomy changes:”, namely 63 and 39. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>As a result, a perfect taxonomy can be achieved when 63 % and 39 % are used as the species and genus demarcation, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>The lower plot shows the same genome set after taxonomy changes are applied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>In this example, 56 instead of 63 can also be tried for “Merge species above” to see if an alternative species demarcation can be established. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>When more than one demarcation is acceptable in PASC, other criteria (e.g., host) should be taken into consideration to select the suitable one. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Following the output depicted in Fig. 2, PASC also lists recommended taxonomy changes needed for such a result, some of which are shown at the bottom of Fig. 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>In this example, PASC indicates that both European brown hare syndrome virus and rabbit calicivirus Australia 1 MIC-07 belong to the species Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus, and calicivirus isolate TCG, which is currently unassigned to a genus, belongs to the species Newbury-1 virus in the genus Nebovirus. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Another taxonomy change simulation tool in PASC splits genomes into subgroups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>For example, there is a peak below 12 % in the upper plot in Fig. 1, indicating genome groups with very low similarities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>To see how these groups are formed, the number 12 is entered in the box next to “Split genomes below” at the lower left section of Fig. 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>After this is applied, PASC determines that three groups can be formed – the first consists of Cellulophaga phage phi12:2 and Cellulophaga phage phi12a:1, the second consists of the genus Microvirus, and the third consists of three genera, Bdellomicrovirus, Chlamydiamicrovirus and Spiromicrovirus, plus two unclassified viruses, Marine gokushovirus and Microviridae phi-CA82. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Plots showing the distributions of pairwise similarities of genomes within the three groups are also provided (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>This suggests that three subfamilies can be created from these three groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the ICTV has already assigned the genera Bdellomicrovirus, Chlamydiamicrovirus and Spiromicrovirus to the subfamily Gokushovirinae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>The genus Microvirus should form a second subfamily, and the two other viruses, Cellulophaga phage phi12:2 and Cellulophaga phage phi12a:1, a third. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>The primary application of PASC is to classify viruses with newly sequenced genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>This is demonstrated using the example in Figure 3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>The accession numbers of two potyvirus genomes recently released in GenBank, JN190431 and HE608964, were entered into the “Sequence” box of the PASC page for the family Potyviridae and compared with existing potyvirus genomes and with each other. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>The closest genome to JN190431 was AY575773 (bean common mosaic virus strain Blackeye), and their identity was 69.14 % by the BLAST-based alignment method. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>This is indicated by a red bar on the x-axis of the upper plot. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Since this red bar is located in the region consisting of yellow bars, this suggests that JN190431 and AY575773 belong to different species but should be in the same genus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>The organism name for JN190431, yam bean mosaic virus, is currently a species-level name under the “unclassified potyvirus” node in NCBI’s taxonomy database, which indicates that its classification agrees with the PASC analysis, but this name has not been approved by ICTV. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>AM113988 (potato virus Y strain Wilga) was the closest genome to HE608964. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>It showed 98.42% identity by the BLAST-based alignment method. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Since the red bar is in the region consisting of green bars, PASC suggests that HE608964 and AM113988 belong to the same species, and therefore, the organism name for HE608964, potato virus Y, is appropriate. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>The identity between the input sequences JN190431 and HE608964 was also reported by PASC, which was 47.54 %. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Such a report is very useful in determining the relationships among genomes of members of new species, because they could belong to the same new species (if their identity is higher than 76 %) or different ones (if their identity is lower than 76 %). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>In this case, the result suggests that JN190431 and HE608964 belong to different species. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>When a new genome is known to belong to a member of an existing genus, all other genera can be unchecked from the “Genera selection” section below the sequence input box. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>New sequences will then only be compared with existing sequences in the selected genus, therefore reducing the time of computation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>This makes it a lot easier to identify demarcation criteria – they are at the borderlines between peaks of different colors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>We should point out that the taxonomy relationships are based on their current assignment in the NCBI taxonomy database. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Although NCBI uses the official ICTV taxonomy names whenever possible, there are times when GenBank sequence submitters assign their sequences to incorrect virus names, which will cause color mixture in the peaks (e.g., yellow bars in the green-dominant peaks or vise versa). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>The removal of redundant genomes can, in some cases, significantly increase the speed with which new genomes are tested without compromising PASC’s ability to establish demarcation criteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>For example, after removing sequences with identities higher than 95 %, only 75 out of the over 5,000 total genomes are left in PASC for the family Hepadnaviridae (as of April, 2014). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Previously, genome similarities were calculated based on pairwise global alignments in PASC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Although this method works well for some virus families/groups, such as papillomaviruses and potyviruses, the results are not very good for others. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Our analysis showed several problems with the use of global alignment in PASC.In some viruses with circular genomes, such as the circoviruses, there is an inconsistency in the designation of the first nucleotide of the genome sequences in public databases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>For example, the genome of Y09921 is about 765 nucleotides off from the majority of other porcine circovirus 1 sequences, with the latter starting from TAGTATTA in the stem-loop region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>This shift in the sequence positions reduces genome similarities when they are calculated based on global alignment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>For instance, the genome sequences AF055391 and AY484407 belong to the same species, but their genome similarity is only 66 % by global alignment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>The similarity would be much higher, at about 97 %, if the two sequences started from the same position in the genome.In some viruses, particularly those with negative-strand RNA genomes, the opposite strand of the genome is sometimes submitted to the public databases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>When genome similarities are calculated based on a global alignment of the opposite strands of two genomes, the result is just wrong and meaningless. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>For example, the genome sequence of BD091237 was deposited as the genomic strand rather than the usual complementary strand for negative-strand RNA viruses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>When this sequence is used directly in global alignment with other genomes, the genome with the highest similarity to it, at 54 %, is GU591771. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>However, if the opposite strand of BD091237 is used in global alignment with GU591771, their similarity is 98 %.For viruses that are distantly related, the identities obtained by global alignment are usually misleading, because the identity of two random genome sequences of the same size could be as high as 50 %. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>For example, sequences DQ641708 and EU273817 belong to two viruses in different genera and have only minimum similarities in small regions of the genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>However, their pairwise identity by global alignment could be as high as 49 %, which obviously does not reflect their real similarity. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>To overcome the problems associated with global alignment, we employed BLAST-based alignment to calculate pairwise identities of genome sequences. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>We started with tblastx [18], a translation-based alignment method, on genome pairs to calculate their identities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>The procedure was similar to the BLAST-based alignment described in Materials and methods, except that tblastx was used instead of the combination of blastn and tblastn. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>We later observed that the tblastx alignment did not work well for genomes that do not encode proteins (e.g., viroids). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>In addition, tblastx does not allow gaps in the alignment and is therefore not optimized for genomes with low similarities. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>We then switched to the current method, which uses the combination of blastn and tblastn. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>It selects the better of the two alignments for the same region in the genomes and therefore effectively applies the most appropriate blast program automatically on protein coding and non-coding regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>This approach captures all possible similar regions among the genomes and has improved the results to some extent in almost all of the virus families/groups we currently have in PASC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>In the future, we will discontinue the global alignment method to speed up the tool. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>For the family Microviridae, whose members have circular genomes, there is a great deal of mixture of color bars in the PASC plot based on global alignment (the lower panel in Fig. 1) because some sequences start at different positions in the genome than others. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>This is corrected completely when BLAST-based alignment is used (the upper panel in Fig. 1), and bars of the same color all group together. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Previously [15], we discussed that PASC using global alignment does not work well for large genomes with low overall sequence similarities (e.g., the family Baculoviridae). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>This is demonstrated in Fig. 4a, where the yellow and peach bars are mostly mixed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>This is greatly improved when BLAST-based alignment is used (Fig. 4b and c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>The genome sizes of baculoviruses vary from less than 82 kb to nearly 179 kb. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>The use of the average genome length (Fig. 4b) instead of the maximum genome length employed previously (Fig. 4c) to calculate pairwise identities also results in better separation of the yellow and peach peaks below 24 % identity.Fig. 4Frequency distribution of pairwise identities from the complete genome sequence comparison of 81 baculoviruses, using global alignment (a) and BLAST-based alignment (b and c). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>The BLAST-based alignment method produces better separation for certain taxonomy groups than the global alignment method does. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>For example, a peak representing groups (i.e., bovine lentivirus group and the primate lentivirus group) in the genus Lentivirus is separated from the rest of the yellow peaks, which is otherwise not the case in the global alignment method. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>For some virus families, demarcation criteria for the sub-species level can be determined by PASC, as demonstrated for marburgviruses [19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>The BLAST-based alignment method also makes it possible to apply PASC to some families of phages with large genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>For the family Podoviridae, the overlap of yellow and peach bars below 55 % in the global alignment method no longer exists in the BLAST-based alignment method, and therefore, the genus demarcation criteria can tentatively be set to around 35 %. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>The genomes of enterobacteria phage SP6 (NC_004831) and enterobacteria phage T7 (NC_001604) are only conserved in the following T7 genes: gp0.3, gp1, gp1.7, gp4, gp5, gp8, gp10, gp11, gp12, gp16 and gp19 [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>These are the major regions used by the BLAST-based alignment method to calculate the similarity between the two genomes (Fig. 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>This method is essentially the same as the one used by Lavigne et al. [21], where members of the family Podoviridae were classified based on similarities of protein sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>The identity between SP6 and T7 is 12 % using the BLAST-based alignment method here, which is very close to the 15 and 17 % obtained by the two methods described by Lavigne et al. [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>There are still overlaps between the green, yellow and peach bars in the plot using the BLAST-based alignment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>This is mainly because there are currently some unclassified viruses in the NCBI taxonomy database, some of which belong to other official ICTV species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>For example, the following unclassified phiKMV-like phages in the NCBI taxonomy database probably all belong to the species Enterobacteria phage phiKMV: Pseudomonas phage LKD16, Pseudomonas phage LUZ19, Pseudomonas phage PT2, Pseudomonas phage PT5, Pseudomonas phage phikF77 and Pseudomonas phage vB_Pae-TbilisiM32. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>These can be identified using the taxonomy change simulation tool described above.Fig. 5Dot matrix and text views of pairwise alignment between genome sequences of enterobacteria phage SP6 (NC_004831) and enterobacteria phage T7 (NC_001604), using the BLAST-based and global alignment methods. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>It is important to keep in mind that because of the different methods used in calculating the pairwise genome identities, the demarcations obtained using the BLAST-based alignment could be different from those obtained using the global alignment and would be more likely different from those determined by other algorithms using different datasets and/or different genome regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>For example, the species demarcation for the family Papillomoviridae is about 65 % and 69 % using BLAST-based and global alignment in PASC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/pasc/viridty.cgi?cmdresult=main&amp;id=347">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/pasc/viridty.cgi?cmdresult=main&amp;id=347</ext-link>), respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Both are higher than the 60 % currently used by the papillomavirus community, which is based on the L1 gene of these viruses [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the percentage of identities between existing and new genomes calculated in PASC (e.g., those in Figure 3) is not comparable with other methods and can only be used in this system, and vice versa. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>The PASC tool is currently based on complete genomes for non-segmented viruses or on one of the genome segments for segmented viruses (e.g., DNA A of geminiviruses). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Working with ICTV’s Nanoviridae Study Group, we have added nanoviruses to PASC using their DNA-R, DNA-S, DNA-C, DNA-M and DNA-N segments, and in most cases, PASC assigns a particular nanovirus to the same species regardless of the segment used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>However, there are a few instances where species assignment varies depending on the segment used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Further investigations will be needed to find out whether this represents different evolutionary rates in different segments, or e.g., reassortment events among viruses of different species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Many families whose members have segmented genomes are not currently present in PASC, and input from the ICTV Study Groups would be helpful to determine which segment(s) to use. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>The PASC tool is linked to the NCBI’s viral genome collection [1] and taxonomy database, with new viral genomes added and taxonomy status of viruses updated every day. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>It runs very fast, and results can usually be obtained within minutes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>The tool is online, so there is no software to download/install, no parameters to set, and everybody uses the same algorithm and same dataset. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>This allows for consistent results between different users. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>We believe that PASC can be a great aid to ICTV Study Groups by providing much more objective criteria for making taxonomic assignments based on sequence comparisons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Indeed, our PASC analysis result for the family Polyomaviridae has been adopted by the ICTV Study Group as one of the demarcation criteria for new species in the family. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>ICTV is the official authority to establish new virus species, but it can take up to several months with the current procedure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>When virus sequences are submitted to GenBank, they are immediately required to be placed under a species node (whether an existing species or an unclassified one) in NCBI’s taxonomy database. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>It is not possible to wait for ICTV to determine what species a sequence belongs to. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>PASC, on the other hand, can provide a quick guide for the proper species classification, thereby reducing the number of sequences mis-assigned to a species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>PASC is routinely used by the NCBI viral genomes group to curate viral genome collections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>The taxonomy simulation function of PASC can not only identify problematic entries in the current NCBI taxonomy database but also help the ICTV Study Group to see how demarcation criteria changes affect the taxonomy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Although the NCBI PASC tool has been used in several studies [22–34], no cutoff values in sequence identity percentages are provided currently in our PASC system that can be used to separate species and genera. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>We can do this only after the PASC result is accepted by the community to determine the demarcation criteria for a virus family. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>There are some families for which peaks overlap in PASC, and therefore, demarcation criteria cannot be easily established (e.g., the family Betaflexviridae, data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>In such cases, we would like to receive advice from the ICTV Study Groups on alternative ways to perform PASC, e.g., using sequences of one or several genes rather than complete genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>By working together with the ICTV Study Groups, we believe we can explore the potential of PASC and maximize its application for as many viruses as possible. </plain></SENT>
