</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>WS is a human autosomal recessive disorder characterized by genomic instability and the premature onset of a number of age-related diseases [1–4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The defective enzyme responsible for WS possesses a 3′-5′ exonuclease activity in addition to a 3′-5′ helicase activity [5, 6] and is involved in DNA repair, replication, transcription, and telomere maintenance [7–11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>We previously generated a mouse model with a deletion in the helicase domain of the murine WRN homologue [12] that recapitulates most of the WS phenotypes, including an abnormal hyaluronic acid excretion, higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, dyslipidemia, increased genomic instability, and cancer incidence [13, 14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Overall, such mutant mice have a 10-15% decreased of their mean life span [15, 16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the treatment of Wrn mutant mice with vitamin C reverted the life span of such animals to the normal wild type phenotype [16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The WRN protein is a member of the RecQ family of DNA helicases [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>It is highly conserved across species including in invertebrates such as the small worm Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Interestingly, the exonuclease and the DNA helicase domains homologous to the human WRN protein are encoded by two different genes in C. elegans [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The C. elegans wrn-1 gene codes for the ATP-dependent 3′-5′ DNA helicase capable of unwinding a variety of DNA structures [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Notably, it has been shown that the RNAi knockdown of the C. elegans wrn-1 gene shortens the life span, increases sensitivity to DNA damage, and accelerates aging phenotypes [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Similarly, a C. elegans strain lacking the expression of the wrn-1 helicase protein (wrn-1(gk99)) also exhibit a shorter life span when grown at 25°C [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, supplementation of vitamin C normalizes the median life span of the wrn-1(gk99) mutant worms [19] as seen in mice lacking part of the helicase domain of the Wrn protein [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Thus, the wrn-1(gk99) mutant worm model gives us the opportunity to examine the global mRNA expression of a whole animal upon vitamin C treatment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed the global mRNA expression of wild type and wrn-1(gk99) mutant C. elegans in the presence or absence of vitamin C by RNA-seq. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>RNA-seq has been shown to be quantitatively accurate over a larger range of expression levels than previous methods, such as microarrays [20–24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that wrn-1 mutant animals showed significant changes in biological processes affecting several carbon structures (including lipid metabolisms) and oxidation-reduction reactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Although supplementation of vitamin C significantly increased the life span of both wild type and wrn-1 mutant worms, no gene was similarly affected by vitamin C in these strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Vitamin C altered the expression of genes in wrn-1(gk99) worms involved in locomotion and anatomical structure development. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>As shown in Figure  1, the median life span of vitamin C treated wrn-1(gk99) worms was significantly increased by 26% (7.0 days versus 8.8 days) compared to untreated wrn-1(gk99) animals (log-rank test: P =1.83 × 10-6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>These results replicate previous data obtained with these strains [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the median life span of vitamin C treated wrn-1(gk99) worms was close to the median life span of wild type worms (Figure  1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The median life span of vitamin C treated wild type worms was significantly increased by 22% (9.0 days versus 11.0 days) compared to the untreated wild type animals (log-rank test: P =2.07 × 10-5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that vitamin C increased the life span of both strains by more than 20% at 25°C.Figure 1 Impact of vitamin C on the life span of wild type and wrn- 1 mutant C. elegans strains.

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>To gain insight into the rescuing effect of vitamin C on the life span of wrn-1(gk99) worms, we first established the global expression profile of untreated wild type and mutant worms at the L4 stage by RNA-seq. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>By carefully monitored physiological developmental cues (such as vulva and gonad development), we noticed a three hours developmental delay in wrn-1(gk99) mutants compared to wild type animals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Therefore, mRNA was extracted based on the biological age (i.e. the exact developmental stage) and not on the chronological age of the animals for the RNA-seq analyses. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>A preliminary list of differentially expressed genes was generated by keeping the genes that showed a two-fold difference or more between wild type N2 and wrn-1(gk99) worms with an adjusted P-value &lt;0.01. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>This first list contained 2528 genes (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>We randomly chose 16 genes representing a range of base mean number from 4 to 3500 reads in both or in either N2 or wrn-1 mutant animals based on the RNA-seq normalized data (list of genes in Table  2) to determine the minimum of reads required for a gene to be detected by RT-PCR in our analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>We thus designed 16 pairs of primers to validate the differential expression of these genes by quantitative RT-PCR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The tubulin encoding gene (tba-1) was included as a control (no difference in tba-1 expression between both strains). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>No Ct could be detected by quantitative RT-PCR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a band for the ugt-33 gene was detected with mRNA from the wild type worms only (no band was detected for the wrn-1(gk99) worms) (Figure  2). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>We have previously observed that homozygous mice lacking exons encoding part of the helicase domain of the Werner syndrome gene product have a reduced mean life span of 16.5% compared to wild type mouse [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Importantly, such mutant mice exhibit an abnormally high oxidative stress that can be neutralized by supplementation of vitamin C in drinking water [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>In fact, vitamin C re-established the normal mean life span of Wrn helicase mutant mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, C. elegans lacking the wrn-1 helicase ortholog also have a reduced mean life span compared to wild type worms [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>The global mRNA expression of whole wrn-1(gk99) worms by RNA-seq analyses indicated major changes in set of genes involved in overall carbon metabolism (sugars and lipids). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with the premature aging phenotype observed in worms with a reduced WRN-1 helicase activity [19, 33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Although the analysis was performed on mRNA from L4 stage C. elegans, altered expression of these genes will have an effect on the duration of adulthood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Indeed, alterations in reactive oxygen species and ATP levels has been observed in adult wrn-1(gk99) mutant worms [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Notably, alteration in the expression of several sets of genes involved in growth and lipid or fatty acid metabolism has not only been observed in cultured Wrn mutant mouse embryonic fibroblasts but also in the liver of Wrn helicase mutant mice [16, 34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Importantly, since we noticed a three hours developmental delay in wrn-1(gk99) animals compared to wild type, we carefully monitored physiological developmental cues (i.e. vulva and gonad development) in both animal population before harvesting them to perform mRNA analysis (as described in the Methods). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the change of the expression profile of genes involved in different biochemical pathways observed between wrn-1(gk99) mutant and wild type animals reflect accurately the difference detected at a specific developmental time point rather than a developmental shift caused by the loss of wrn-1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Detailed comparative microscopic and genetic analyses along with global mRNA expression analyses at several developmental stages will be necessary to acquire a better picture of changes as a function of not only chronological but also biological age in wrn-1(gk99) mutant animals. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>Vitamin C treatment increased the mean life span of wrn-1(gk99) worms to untreated wild type levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>This is similar to the result obtained with mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Vitamin C supplementation rescued the shorter mean life span of Wrn mutant mice [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Vitamin C also significantly increased the life span of wild type C. elegans (Figure  1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>We did not see an increase in the life span of wild type mice supplemented with vitamin C in a previous study [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Unlike mice, wild type C. elegans do not have the enzyme required for the synthesis of their own vitamin C as far as we can tell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>However, C. elegans contains three potential cytochromes b561 encoding genes (F55H2.5, F39G3.4 and F39G3.5) [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Cytochromes b561 are intrinsic membrane proteins containing two heme molecules, and reducible by ascorbate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>They have been suggested to function as electron transporters, shuttling electrons across membranes from ascorbate to an acceptor molecule. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>The one-electron oxidation product of ascorbate, monodehydro-ascorbate has been shown, at least in vitro, to function as an electron acceptor for cytochromes b561. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>This reaction results in the regeneration of a fully reduced ascorbate molecule [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>The presence of Cytochromes b561 encoding genes in C. elegans suggests that this species could potentially use vitamin C in different chemical reactions [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>The impact of vitamin C on the levels of different metabolites required for energy or impacting on ROS levels in the body of wild type and wrn-1(gk99) C. elegans is currently under investigation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the expression of the F39G3.4 gene is reduced in wrn-1(gk99) mutants (Additional file 3: Table S3) but was not changed by the addition of vitamin C (Additional file 4: Table S4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>The F39G3.4 gene may be required for the regeneration of ascorbate from monodehydro-ascorbate in wrn-1(gk99) mutants, a hypothesis that will require confirmation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate a major difference in gene expression response to vitamin C between wild type and mutant worms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>The list of differentially expressed genes in untreated wrn-1(gk99) mutants versus vitamin C treated wrn-1(gk99) mutants was very different from the list of genes in vitamin C treated wild type versus untreated wild type worms (Additional file 4: Tables S4 and Additional file 5: Table S5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that although vitamin C increased the life span of both mutant and wild type worms, it affected different sets of genes in both strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Another important difference is that the mean life span of vitamin C treated wrn-1(gk99) worms is shorter (~9 days) than vitamin C treated wild type worms (11 days) (Figure  1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>The median life span of wrn-1(gk99) worms treated with vitamin C was close to untreated wild type worms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>The expression profile of vitamin C treated wrn-1(gk99) worms compared to untreated wrn-1(gk99) worms revealed down regulation of genes involved in biological processes related to locomotion and anatomical structure development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Upon examination of the global mRNA expression analysis of treated and untreated wrn-1(gk99) worms (taking the global mRNA expression of wild type as a reference), we found that the expression of 472 genes at the mRNA level was similarly altered in mutant worms compared to wild type worms in the presence or absence of vitamin C. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>The expression of these genes was affected by the wrn-1(gk99) mutation but was not reversed by vitamin C suggesting that alteration in expression of these genes is not required for the impact of vitamin C on C. elegans life span. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>These genes are involved in oxidation-reduction, cellular ketone, organic acid, and lipid metabolic processes (Table  6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Thus, vitamin C extended the life span of wrn-1(gk99) worms by altering biological processes not only involved in locomotion but also in anatomical structure development (Table  4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Such processes are indeed affected at the physiological levels, as a knock down of WRN-1 protein expression by the RNA interference technique results in various developmental defects, including small, dumpy, ruptured, transparent body, growth arrest and bag of worms [33]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which vitamin C alters gene expression in mutant and wild type C. elegans is unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Our analysis of enrichment for specific transcription factor binding sites in the altered genes in the presence of vitamin C have indicated changes in the activity of hormone receptor-type transcription factors (like NHR-28 and NHR-76) and of PHA-4, a transcription factors which activity depends on pathways affecting the status of several metabolites and/or nutrients in C. elegans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>One important pathway modulated by metabolites is the CeTOR pathway that affects PHA-4 activity [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Our hypothesis is that vitamin C not only affects the redox status of cell in C. elegans, but also important metabolites that may be used as ligands for nuclear receptors (lipid derived steroidogenic metabolites) or for signaling molecules that regulate the activity of different transcription factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Metabolomics analysis with both wrn-1(gk99) mutant and the N2 wild type strains in the absence or presence of vitamin C is underway and is the scope of another study. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Based on our criteria to generate lists of differentially expressed genes between genotypes, we observed alteration in the expression of 1522 genes in wrn-1(gk99) worms compared to wild type worms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Vitamin C did not significantly modify the alteration of 472 of these genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Such genes are mainly involved in oxidation-reduction, cellular ketone, organic acid, carbohydrate, and lipid, metabolic processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Vitamin C, in return, altered the expression of several genes in wrn-1(gk99) worms involved in locomotion and anatomical structure development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>It is interesting to mention that vitamin C can rescue the morphology of liver and adipose tissues of Wrn helicase mutant mice [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>This report thus provides lists of genes that can potentially affect the healthy aging of not only wild type but also wrn-1(gk99) worms upon genetic manipulation in the presence of vitamin C. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>It also provides important clues on the biological processes that vitamin C affects to increase life span in C. elegans. </plain></SENT>
