</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Cryptococcal meningitis is the commonest cause of meningitis in adults in sub Saharan African (SSA) countries with high HIV seroprevalence [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The global incidence of cryptococcal meningitis was estimated at 957,900 cases/year in 2009 and 75% of cases occur in SSA [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In Blantyre, Malawi, C. neoformans was responsible for 70% of adult CSF-culture positive meningitis presenting to a tertiary referral hospital from 2000 until 2012 [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>This burden of cryptococcal meningitis has not changed despite a highly successful national programme of antiretroviral therapy (ART) roll-out since 2004 [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Current gold standard induction therapy is two weeks of amphotericin B and flucytosine [4], [5]; however these drugs remain largely unavailable in SSA including Malawi [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Amphotericin B is not only expensive, but difficult to administer and associated with toxicities which are challenging to monitor in resource-poor settings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Consequently, high-dose oral fluconazole is widely used in SSA, but has significantly weaker early fungicidal activity than the gold standard regimen [4], [7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported extremely poor outcomes from cryptococcal meningitis in Blantyre, when treated with 800mg daily oral fluconazole as induction therapy [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In 2011 the Malawian national treatment guidelines regarding the management of cryptococcal meningitis changed, increasing the initial dose of fluconazole at treatment induction from 800mg to 1200mg daily [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Many African health services elected to make this change following a study that demonstrated better early fungicidal activity using 1200mg fluconazole than with 800mg [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>We present a pragmatic, prospective observational study of clinical outcomes from cryptococcal meningitis using this dose, which is the current standard of care for many African countries. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Consecutive adult patients (age ≥16) with a first presentation of cryptococcal meningitis were recruited between September 2012 and May 2013. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was confirmed by positive India-Ink microscopy of CSF or culture-confirmed C. neoformans from CSF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Cryptococcal antigen testing (CrAg), quantitative cryptococcal cultures and fluconazole resistance testing were unavailable. </plain></SENT>

</text></p></sec></SecTag><SecTag type="DISCUSS"><sec id="s4"><title><text><SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Discussion </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>A Ugandan study of fluconazole demonstrated higher EFA in CSF at a daily dose of 1200mg than 800mg without increased toxicity [10], and it was hoped that this would translate into improved clinical outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>However, a more recent pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model of treatment with 1200mg fluconazole predicted that only 67% of patients on this dose will obtain adequate CSF drug concentrations to achieve fungal stasis [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>In our study, 10-week mortality from cryptococcal meningitis in Malawi has not improved following an increase in the induction dose of fluconazole from 800mg to 1200mg. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>The highest mortality occurred in the initial two weeks, suggesting that rapid fungal clearance is essential for a good clinical outcome. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Expanded access to ART in Malawi [12] meant that more patients had received ART before recruitment to the current cohort than in our previous study of fluconazole 800mg/day [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>This raises the possibility that Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) masked a benefit from the higher dose of fluconazole, however in the current study, there was slightly higher survival in patients on ART and in a combined analysis of both studies the effect of prior ART was non-significant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Secondly IRIS is unlikely as these patients were culture positive with CD4 counts &lt;50 cells/uL at presentation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Overall, these data do not support a negative confounding effect from IRIS. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Despite improved ART provision, there remains a large population with advanced HIV in Blantyre, and there is an urgent need to protect them from cryptococcal meningitis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>General strategies include earlier HIV diagnosis and treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>A specific approach with increasing evidence of cost-effectiveness is CrAg screening and treatment of asymptomatic antigenaemia in the ART clinic [13,14,15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Several studies have reported that serial LPs to lower ICP during treatment of cryptococcal meningitis may improve outcomes [16], [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Although Malawian national guidelines suggest performing daily LPs during early therapy [9], there is neither adequate staffing nor the equipment for this to be possible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Without CSF manometers we could only repeat LPs on patients with symptoms of raised ICP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>There was weak evidence of improved survival in this group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Importantly the individuals selected for additional procedures had the worst initial symptoms; these data support the importance of therapeutic CSF drainage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>The benefit of serial LPs may be even greater if they are routinely guided by CSF pressure measurement. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>The current and previous study recruited patients with similar characteristics in the same setting, however they have limitations; the studies were undertaken sequentially, not as part of a combined randomised controlled trial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there was some loss to follow up and it was different to monitor adherence to therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Serial CD4-counts and HIV-viral loads were unavailable preventing a formal diagnosis of IRIS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the studies provide important information on the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis from an authentic high-burden setting. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Oral fluconazole is currently the only routinely available therapy in much of SSA, but mortality rates are unacceptably high. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>An increase in the recommended induction dose from 800mg to 1200mg daily has had no impact on clinical outcomes in Malawi. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>There are on-going studies with even higher doses of fluconazole, (ACTG study: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00885703">http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00885703</ext-link>) and of novel therapeutic strategies (“Advancing cryptococcal meningitis treatment in Africa” [ACTA] ISRCTN: 45035509). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>Whilst the outcome of these studies is awaited, there remains an urgent need for expanded access to amphotericin B and flucytosine across SSA. </plain></SENT>
