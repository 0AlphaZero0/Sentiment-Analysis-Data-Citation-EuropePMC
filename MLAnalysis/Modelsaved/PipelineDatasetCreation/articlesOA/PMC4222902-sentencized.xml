<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>During pregnancy, maternal zinc deficiency can increase the frequency of congenital malformations across many animal species [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Symptoms of zinc deficiency in humans include weight loss, severe dermatitis, slow wound healing, male hypogonadism, and reduced immune function [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Zinc deficient experimental diets in laboratory animals [6] or plant protein-based feed with low zinc bioavailability in livestock [7], [8] lead to similar symptoms such as impaired growth, development, fertility, and epidermal health. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Members of the solute carrier 39 (SLC39) gene family encode zinc transport proteins that are critical mechanisms for maintaining zinc homeostasis across a wide range of species [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The SLC39 family, with similarity to iron transporter IRT1 [10], is present in Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast [11], Arabidopsis plants [12], invertebrates [13], and vertebrates [14] including humans [15], [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The phenotypic similarities of zinc deficiency across different mammals due to impaired intestinal zinc transport caused by spontaneous or targeted mutations of slc39a4 (ZIP4) in humans [17], [18], mice [19], and cows [20] demonstrates how physiological functions for SLC39 members may be conserved across species. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The zinc transporter ZIP12 encoded by the slc39a12 gene was uncovered by analyses of gene expression across different human tissues [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>ZIP12, which highly expressed in the brain, is required for multiple aspects of neuronal differentiation including cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation and activity, neurite outgrowth, and microtubule polymerization and stability [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>ZIP12 is also necessary for embryogenesis because inactivation of ZIP12 by antisense morpholino knockdown halted neural tube closure in Xenopus tropicalis, resulting in arrested development and lethality during neurulation [21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Comparative genomics can be useful for determining the functions of genes in varied and assorted contexts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The general assumption of comparative genomics is the conservation of genomic sequence due to evolutionary constraints that imply some kind of biological importance or function [22] encoded by the conserved sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Comparative genomics may predict the physiological role of genes due to the relationship between tissue expression profiles and biological function [23]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>The human slc39a12 gene spans 13 exons across 91.4 kilobases (kb) on chromosome 10p12.33 (Figure 1, Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Orthologs to the human slc39a12 gene (Table 1) were identified by combinations of Homologene searches, reciprocal BLAST hits [40], and local synteny preservation [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Identified orthologs of ZIP12 shared amino acid identities with the human ZIP12 that correlated with the relatedness of the organisms to humans, ranging from 86 to 99 percent for non-human primates to 48 to 50 percent in fish (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the amino acid identities of the ZIP12 orthologs to human ZIP4 ranged between 31 to 40 percent without any correlation to relatedness with humans (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Because there are many common elements between members of the SLC39 gene family, particularly between ZIP12 and ZIP4 [9], [42], it can be difficult to distinguish orthologs of ZIP12 from SLC39 paralogs solely based upon sequence similarity such as BLAST. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Local synteny between ortholog candidates is extremely useful in confirming reciprocal BLAST hits [41], especially in cases of gene families with large numbers of paralogs, such as the case with the solute carrier (SLC) gene families [43], [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>In general, synteny was observed across vertebrates (Figure 3, Figure S1), but possible disruptions of the syntenic block in more distant organisms corresponded with reduced relatedness to humans, possibly due to genomic rearrangements during evolution [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>As with the case with most orthologous genes in vertebrates [46], the coding exon structure of slc39a12, including number of exons and exon size, is conserved across humans, mice, and Xenopus tropicalis (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>An alignment of human ZIP12 with other related ZIP genes (Figure S2) and with other ZIP12 orthologs (Figure S3) shows that many C-terminus elements are conserved, especially those predicted to encode the transmembrane helices and zinc transport function, such as the HEXPHEGD motif that is present in the LIV-1 subfamily of ZIP transporters [47]â€“[49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>The phylogenetic tree (Figure 4) indicates that the relatedness of ZIP12 across different organisms is highly correlated with the relatedness of the whole genomes across organisms [50]â€“[52]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>The conservation of ZIP12 expression in the nervous system of vertebrates, combined with the previous report of the critical role of ZIP12 in Xenopus embryogenesis and mouse neuronal development supports the notion that zinc transport by ZIP12 is crucial for many vertebrate organisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Zinc deficiency in numerous animal models is associated with congenital malformations and impaired development including neural tube defects [4], [6], [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Conserved gene co-expression analysis [23] and genotype-phenotype relationships (phenologs) across species [90] have been hypothesized by other researchers to predict candidate genes in human disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>These observations further strengthen the notion that slc39a12 may be a candidate gene for neural tube defects or neurodevelopmental disorders [21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>The role of zinc in the evolution of embryogenesis is not currently well-studied, but the wide presence of ZIP12 in vertebrates and possibly chordates suggests a physiological importance of zinc transporters in these pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Cellular zinc homeostasis and free zinc availability is tightly regulated [91], even in bacteria, but there is emerging evidence shows that zinc may affect cell signaling [21], [49] and post-transcriptional mechanisms [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>It is possible that the origins of zinc transporter functions in cell signaling originated from the role of related paralogs and their roles in zinc homeostasis and detoxification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Further investigation is required in order to determine the origins of ZIP12 in relation to the evolution of developmental processes and the likely significant role of ZIP12 in nervous system function in vertebrate organisms. </plain></SENT>
