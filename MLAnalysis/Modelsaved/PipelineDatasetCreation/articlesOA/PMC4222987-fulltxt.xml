However, despite the <italic>in vitro</italic> sensitivity of c-KIT mutant cell lines to c-KIT inhibitors, primary resistance in patients remains a significant concern. Direct interactions between leukemia cells and bone marrow stromal cells in the hematopoietic microenvironment (HM) as well as soluble factors secreted by stromal cells can support leukemic cell proliferation and survival in the presence of cytotoxic and molecularly targeted therapies<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Accordingly, defining the mechanisms by which the microenvironment contributes to leukemia growth and therapy resistance is essential for ensuring the success of c-KIT inhibitors, and other new therapies, as they advance from the laboratory to the clinic. This is particularly relevant for c-KIT mutated AML as a phase II clinical trial (NCT01830361) is currently underway to assess the efficacy of adding the c-KIT inhibitor midostaurin (PKC412) to standard therapy in patients with newly diagnosed c-KIT or FLT3-ITD mutated t(8;21) AML. In this study, we demonstrate that <italic>ex vivo</italic> modeling of components of the hematopoietic microenvironment provides valuable insights into mechanisms of primary therapy resistance in c-KIT dependent AML.</p><p id="P2">In agreement with previous studies<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, the c-KIT inhibitors imatinib and nilotinib decreased the proliferation of the c-KIT mutant AML cell lines Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1 relative to DMSO treated controls in regular media consisting of RPMI and 20% FBS (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A &amp; B</xref>). However, the effect of c-KIT inhibition on proliferation was significantly attenuated when the cell lines were cultured in RPMI/FBS 20% that had been conditioned for 48&#8211;72 hours with either i) the human bone marrow stromal cell line HS-5, or ii) primary human bone marrow stromal cells from two independent donors (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A &amp; B</xref>). Consistent with the proliferation assay, nilotinib decreased the cell number of both cell lines in the regular, but not HS-5 conditioned media when cultured over a 48 hour time-course (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C &amp; D</xref>). Furthermore, HS-5 conditioned media significantly diminished nilotinib-induced apoptosis as determined by annexin-V/7-AAD staining and flow cytometry, caspase 3/7 activity, and morphology (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figures S1A&#8211;C</xref>). In agreement with the primary effect of conditioned media being on a reduction in apoptosis, conditioned media also showed no significant effect on cell cycle progression as analyzed by DAPI staining (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1D</xref>).</p><p id="P3">To confirm that the effects of the drugs on apoptosis correlated with c-KIT inhibition, western blots for phospho-c-KIT and total c-KIT were performed on Kasumi-1 cells that had been treated with nilotinib for 4, 24, or 48 hours in either regular or HS-5 conditioned media (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Nilotinib treatment in regular media diminished c-KIT phosphorylation relative to total c-KIT protein levels at all time-points, consistent with a rapid and sustained c-KIT inhibition. In contrast, while nilotinib still inhibited phosphorylation of c-KIT in HS-5 conditioned media, the level of total c-KIT protein was also significantly diminished relative to regular media in the absence of nilotinib (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). In agreement, the level of c-KIT cell surface expression, as assessed with an APC-conjugated c-KIT antibody and flow cytometry, was reduced in both the Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1 cell lines in HS-5 conditioned media (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). The presence of stem cell factor (SCF), the ligand for c-KIT in HS-5 conditioned media, likely contributes to c-KIT down-regulation as c-KIT is rapidly internalized and degraded following ligand binding<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). However, in addition to the effects of HS-5 conditioned media on c-KIT protein stability, Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1 cells cultured in HS-5 conditioned media also exhibited significantly decreased c-KIT mRNA levels (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). Together, these data suggest that the cause of c-KIT down-regulation in HS-5 conditioned media is likely multi-factorial and occurs at both a transcriptional and post-translational level.</p><p id="P4">In an attempt to identify the soluble factor(s) mediating rescue of c-KIT inhibition we next examined a variety of cytokines secreted by HS-5 cells that are known to stimulate hematopoietic cells. We initially tested the effect of G-CSF, IL-6, and SCF on Kasumi-1 proliferation in the presence of c-KIT inhibitors. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> shows that G-CSF alone, but not IL-6 or SCF, could mimic the effects seen with HS-5 conditioned media. Furthermore, the concentration of G-CSF in the minimal amount of HS-5 conditioned media that affords rescue (240 pg/mL G-CSF) correlates well with the results of a G-CSF titration in the presence of nilotinib (EC50=140 pg/mL; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figures S2A&#8211;C</xref>). Although this G-CSF concentration is greater than the average level of 25 pg/mL measured in healthy, normal adults<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> it is well below levels measured in patients immediately following myeloablative therapy (699 pg/mL)<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> or in patients with documented infections (731.8 pg/mL)<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and thus may be clinically relevant. Further illustrating this dynamic regulation of cytokine production, we also found that treatment of the low cytokine secreting HS-27A human bone marrow stromal cell line with non-toxic doses of cytarabine and daunorubicin stimulated the release of sufficient G-CSF to partially rescue the effects of c-KIT inhibition on Kasumi-1 cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3C, D &amp; E</xref>). Finally, a neutralizing antibody for the G-CSF receptor partially restored sensitivity of Kasumi-1 cells to c- KIT inhibitors in the presence of HS-5 conditioned media (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The lack of complete rescue may be due to incomplete neutralization of the receptor by the antibody or the ability of soluble factors other than G-CSF to provide partial rescue.</p><p id="P5">Having demonstrated a clear role for G-CSF in modulating the response of Kasumi-1 cells to c- KIT inhibition, we next examined the effect of G-CSF and other cytokines on the sensitivity of other c-KIT mutant leukemia cell lines to c-KIT inhibition. Surprisingly, SCF provided a more substantial rescue of the effects of c-KIT inhibition than G-CSF for the SKNO-1 cell line (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Similarly, for HMC1.1<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, a mast cell leukemia cell line containing an activating c-KIT mutation, G-CSF did not rescue the effect of c-KIT inhibition, whereas IL-3 and GM-CSF both provided modest rescue (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). To investigate whether the ability of G-CSF to rescue proliferation was correlated with receptor expression, the level of the G-CSF receptor expression on the leukemia cell surface was determined by flow cytometry. As seen in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, over 80% of Kasumi-1 cells exhibited cell surface expression of the G-CSF receptor compared to &lt;20% of SKNO-1 and HMC1.1 cells. In agreement, it has been previously shown that Kasumi-1 cells express significantly more G-CSF receptor mRNA than SKNO-1 cells<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. These data suggest that the cell surface expression of the G-CSF receptor is correlated with the capacity of the cytokine to reverse sensitivity to c-KIT inhibition in Kasumi-1 cells and its failure to do so in SKNO-1 and HMC1.1 cells. Furthermore, the data suggest that directly targeting individual cytokines to restore c-KIT inhibitor sensitivity, as demonstrated in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, may not be a viable therapeutic option unless the cytokine sensitivity is profiled for each c-KIT dependent leukemia.</p><p id="P6">These results also have additional implications for understanding leukemia development, maintenance, and therapy. In fitting with the two-step model of AML development<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, it is hypothesized that the t(8;21) (AML1/ETO) or inv(16) translocation impairs hematopoietic differentiation and cooperates with an activating c-KIT mutation to confer a proliferative advantage and full leukemic transformation<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Murine models have elegantly supported this model as activating c-KIT mutations cooperate with the full length AML1/ETO translocation to induce leukemia in the mouse<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. However, the requirements for leukemia maintenance may be different than those required for leukemia development. Consistent with this, when c-KIT mutant leukemia cell lines are cultured with stromal conditioned media, c-KIT signaling appears to be dispensable for leukemia cell maintenance as i) the c-KIT leukemia cell lines are relatively resistant to c-KIT inhibitors in stromal conditioned media despite adequate c-KIT inhibition as seen by western blot (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), and ii) c-KIT dependent leukemia cells proliferate in stromal conditioned media despite extensive down-regulation of c-KIT (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E, F, &amp; G</xref>). These data suggest that mutant c-KIT signaling may not be required for leukemia maintenance in the presence of leukemia stem cell niche-derived pro-survival cytokines. This has implications for both understanding leukemia development and raises concerns about the efficacy of targeting mutant c-KIT in AML, although when combined with conventional cytotoxic therapy there may be an additive or synergistic effect that would render it a more effective therapeutic strategy.</p><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S1"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS608868-supplement-1.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e247" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S2"><p>We thank Drs.
