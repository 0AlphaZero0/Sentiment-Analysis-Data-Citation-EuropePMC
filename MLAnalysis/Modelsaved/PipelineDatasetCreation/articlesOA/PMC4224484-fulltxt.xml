However, it is difficult to detect correlative motions that appear transiently in only a part of the trajectory, such as atomic contacts between the side-chains of amino acids, which may rapidly flip. In order to capture these multi-modal behaviors of atoms, which often play essential roles, particularly at the interfaces of macromolecules, we have developed the &#8220;multi-modal DCC (mDCC)&#8221; analysis. The mDCC is an extension of the DCC and it takes advantage of a Bayesian-based pattern recognition technique. We performed MD simulations for molecular systems modeled from the (Ets1)<sub>2</sub>&#8211;DNA complex and analyzed their results with the mDCC method. Ets1 is an essential transcription factor for a variety of physiological processes, such as immunity and cancer development. Although many structural and biochemical studies have so far been performed, its DNA binding properties are still not well characterized. In particular, it is not straightforward to understand the molecular mechanisms how the cooperative binding of two Ets1 molecules facilitates their recognition of Stromelysin-1 gene regulatory elements. A correlation network was constructed among the essential atomic contacts, and the two major pathways by which the two Ets1 molecules communicate were identified. One is a pathway via direct protein-protein interactions and the other is that via the bound DNA intervening two recognition helices. These two pathways intersected at the particular cytosine bases (C110/C11), interacting with the H1, H2, and H3 helices. Furthermore, the mDCC analysis showed that both pathways included the transient interactions at their intermolecular interfaces of Tyr396&#8211;C11 and Ala327&#8211;Asn380 in multi-modal motions of the amino acid side chains and the nucleotide backbone. Thus, the current mDCC approach is a powerful tool to reveal these complicated behaviors and scrutinize intermolecular communications in a molecular system.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI, Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas, Grant Number 24118001, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/">https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/</ext-link>.

In particular, an unexpectedly huge amount of regulatory elements have been found by recent studies <xref rid="pone.0112419-Consortium1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Currently, the mechanistic details of gene expression regulation through these elements are not well understood, especially at the atomistic level. Since regulatory elements conduct their functions through specific binding with a certain class of proteins, <italic>i.e.</italic>, transcription factors (TFs), the molecular interactions between TFs and DNA are the keystone to gene expression. The DNA binding affinity of a TF is dynamically modulated by a variety of biochemical phenomena, such as post-translational modifications <xref rid="pone.0112419-Gardner1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, ordering or disordering of disordered regions <xref rid="pone.0112419-Petersen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, and cooperative binding of one or more other TFs <xref rid="pone.0112419-Siggers1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>As an interesting example, the v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 1 product (Ets1), which plays essential roles in a wide range of important biological processes, such as cancer and immunity, has been extensively studied <xref rid="pone.0112419-GarrettSinha1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0112419-Gallant1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. A highly conserved region named the ETS domain consisting of a winged helix-turn-helix motif specifically recognizes the GGA(A/T) signature sequence. Many regulatory elements control the transcriptional activity of their target genes by binding with Ets1 and other partner TFs. For example, the TCR&#945;/&#946; gene is regulated by the cooperative binding of three TFs: the Ets1, the runt-related TF 1 (Runx1), and the core-binding factor &#946; (CBF&#946;) <xref rid="pone.0112419-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Regulation of the mb-1 gene is established by the cooperative binding of Ets1 and paired box 5 (Pax5) to the promoter region <xref rid="pone.0112419-Garvie1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The stromelysin-1 gene is regulated by the Ets1 homo-dimer <xref rid="pone.0112419-Babayeva1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0112419-Lamber1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The partner TFs are considered to affect the stability of the &#8220;inhibitory module&#8221; of Ets1, which consists of short helices upstream of the ETS domain (HI1 and HI2 helices) and downstream from it (H4 and H5 helices). Interestingly, the HI1 region adopts a helix conformation only when Ets1 is free from DNA; in other words, the formation of the inhibitory module with ordered HI1 inhibits DNA binding by Ets1 <xref rid="pone.0112419-Wasylyk1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Although these phenomena have been proven by experiments, the details of the molecular mechanisms by which the partner TFs affect the Ets1&#8211;DNA binding stability are still largely unclear. Here, we have focused on the Ets1 homo-dimer with the Stromelysin-1 gene promoter <xref rid="pone.0112419-Babayeva1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, as an example of the cooperative binding of Ets1, to investigate the effects of an Ets1 molecule on the binding of the other Ets1 with the regulatory element at the atomistic level.</p><p>The molecular dynamics (MD) method, which simulates a time evolution of atomic coordinates based on the Newtonian mechanics, is a promising method toward illuminating the atomistic details of such complicated processes in molecular systems from the 3D structure data. It has been applied to analyze Ets1&#8211;DNA binding <xref rid="pone.0112419-Reddy1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0112419-Karolak1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Reddy <italic>et al</italic>. analyzed binding specificity of the signature sequence with simulations of Ets1&#8211;DNA complexes with different sequences <xref rid="pone.0112419-Reddy1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Kamberaj and van der Vaart showed that Leu337&#8211;DNA interactions works as a conformational switch of Ets1 by using the DCC analysis <xref rid="pone.0112419-Kamberaj1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Karolak and van der Vaart also simulated the stability of the inhibitory module by applying the replica exchange method <xref rid="pone.0112419-Karolak1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. While the MD method provides fruitful information about atomic motions, and today&#8217;s supercomputers are able to perform long-term MD simulations of large molecular systems, extracting knowledge from a huge amount of data generated by simulations is not straightforward. For analyzing communications among separate parts of a molecular system, <italic>e.g.</italic>, communication among two Ets1 molecules and DNA, the dynamic cross correlation (DCC) analysis has been extensively applied to quantify the correlation coefficients of motions between atoms <xref rid="pone.0112419-McCammon1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The DCC between the <italic>i</italic>th and <italic>j</italic>th atoms is defined by the following equation,<disp-formula id="pone.0112419.e001"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e001.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <bold><italic>r</italic></bold>
<italic><sub>i</sub>(t)</italic> denotes the vector of the <italic>i</italic>th atom&#8217;s coordinates as a function of time <italic>t</italic>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e002.jpg"/></inline-formula> means the time ensemble average and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e003.jpg"/></inline-formula>. While the DCC analysis can provide insight into the correlative motions of atoms, it could overlook some kinds of correlative motions, due to its reliance on displacements from the uniquely determined average coordinate. Namely, the DCC has a definitive meaning if an atomic coordinate behaves under a uni-modal distribution. Atoms may perform multi-modal behaviors over a long time period, especially for the side-chains of amino acids, which rapidly move with flipping motions. Although the DCC has usually been applied for analyses of backbone fluctuations and domain motions by focusing on only the C&#945; atoms, observations of side-chain interactions are also important for our purposes. Therefore, we developed a new method to extend the conventional DCC, by explicitly including the multi-modal motions of atoms. We call the method &#8220;multi-modal DCC&#8221; (mDCC). In addition, we used techniques in the field of complex network analyses for visualization and investigation of communications among molecules, via the atomic correlative motions in a molecular assembly.</p><p>In this article, we first introduce our new method to analyze atomic correlative motions on the MD trajectory, mDCC. We then report the results of MD simulations on the crystal structure of the (Ets1)<sub>2</sub>&#8211;DNA complex (PDB ID: 3MFK) and three other models constructed from this crystal structure: the single Ets1&#8211;DNA complex constructed by removing an Ets1 (chain B), the model with the N380A mutation in the both Ets1 molecules, and the isolated double-stranded DNA extracted from the crystal structure. In total, 900 ns trajectory data (200 ns for each, and an additional 100 ns run of the (Ets1)<sub>2</sub>&#8211;DNA model with another set of initial atomic velocities) were analyzed by using the mDCC method, and the results were visualized as heatmaps, the 2D and 3D network diagrams. We discuss the communication between the two Ets1 molecules and how it affects Ets1&#8211;DNA binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Multi-modal Dynamic Cross Correlation Analysis</title><p>Here, we introduce a new method, named mDCC, that quantifies the correlation of motions between atoms moving under multi-modal distributions.

<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> to the Gaussian functions and the estimations of parameters of the Gaussian mixture distributions were iteratively updated in order to obtain the parameter values with the maximum likelihood, which is based on a variational approximation. The k-means clustering was employed with randomly generated initial assignments in order to generate an initial guess of the assignments for the variational Bayesian approach. Here, the maximum number of modes of each atom (the parameter <italic>K</italic>) was set to five. If an atomic motion was likely to behave under a smaller number of modes than five, then the weighted value &#960;<italic><sub>k</sub></italic> of excess modes should be close to zero in the learning process (we omitted minor modes with &#960;<italic><sub>k</sub></italic>&lt;0.01).</p><p>Second, on the basis of the inferred Gaussian mixture distributions, the correlation, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e007.jpg"/></inline-formula> between the fluctuation of the <italic>i</italic>th atom from the <italic>k</italic>th mode (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e008.jpg"/></inline-formula>) and that of the <italic>j</italic>th atom from the <italic>l</italic>th mode (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e009.jpg"/></inline-formula>) is defined by the following equation,<disp-formula id="pone.0112419.e010"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e010.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula>

Eq. (4) is different from Eq. (1) in several respects. First, it does not use just the single average <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e016.jpg"/></inline-formula>, but instead uses a number of &#8220;averages,&#8221; <italic>viz.</italic>, several modes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e017.jpg"/></inline-formula>, in order to distinguish atomic fluctuations from the individual mode, each of which can be viewed as a quasi-stable position. Second, Eq. (5) introduces a weight, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e018.jpg"/></inline-formula> to observe the relationship between the two atom motions for which the <italic>i</italic>th atom is near <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e019.jpg"/></inline-formula> and the <italic>j</italic>th atom is near <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e020.jpg"/></inline-formula> by emphasizing the specific simulation duration. Namely, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e021.jpg"/></inline-formula> is mainly calculated from the time ranges when the <italic>i</italic>th and <italic>j</italic>th atoms simultaneously belong to modes <italic>k</italic> and <italic>l</italic>, respectively, by using the coefficient <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e022.jpg"/></inline-formula> weighting these time ranges. For aiming this emphasizing effect, we use the common weight, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e023.jpg"/></inline-formula> for the two terms in the denominator of Eq. (4), although it may seem to be peculiar from the viewpoint of the basic definition of a correlation coefficient. However, it should be noted that the normalized property, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e024.jpg"/></inline-formula> is ensured, since <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e025.jpg"/></inline-formula> measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e026.jpg"/></inline-formula> one is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e027.jpg"/></inline-formula> and the other is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e028.jpg"/></inline-formula> where <italic>T</italic> is the total number of the time ensemble. The mDCC can compensate for the weakness in the DCC analyses by detecting hidden information about the multi-modal behaviors of atomic motions.</p><p>In practice, when <italic>K</italic> and <italic>L</italic> Gaussian functions with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e029.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e030.jpg"/></inline-formula> were found for the <italic>i</italic>th and <italic>j</italic>th atoms, respectively, then the <italic>K</italic>&#215;<italic>L</italic> mDCC values were defined for this atom pair. In this paper, we mainly analyze the maximum value of mDCC for each pair of atoms or residues, and mode pairs with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e031.jpg"/></inline-formula> were omitted because of the very few co-occurrences of these pairs of fluctuation modes.</p><p>To illustrate the characteristic features of the mDCC and its advantages over the conventional DCC, a simple toy model consisting of two oscillating particles was analyzed by the mDCC method, and the results are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112419.s001">Fig. S1</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112419.s014">Movie S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Overview of the mDCC Analysis of the (Ets1)<sub>2</sub>&#8211;DNA Complex</title><p>We performed the MD simulation of the (Ets1)<sub>2</sub>&#8211;DNA model, prepared from the crystal structure (PDB ID: 3MFK) consisting of two Ets1 molecules (chain A and B) and a double-stranded DNA.

Then, the simulation trajectory was analyzed by using the mDCC method. As a result of a pattern recognition process for each 3D spatial distribution of 2,887 heavy atoms, 6,886 Gaussian functions (or modes) were found. Remember that the maximum number of Gaussian functions for each atom is an adjustable parameter, and five was applied in this study. Only 8.80% of heavy atoms had five Gaussian functions to approximate the distribution, and most of the atoms had smaller numbers than five (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112419.s002">Fig. S2B</xref>).

</p><p>Here, to elucidate the effects of local interactions on the communications of the entire molecular assembly, we focused on highly positively correlated pairs, by taking the maximum values. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112419-g001">Fig. 1</xref> shows that the DCC and mDCC maps show similar features, but the mDCC values were tended to be higher than the corresponding DCC values, because the maximum values were taken from all combinations of modes in mDCC. The median DCC and mDCC values were 0.0956 and 0.114, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112419-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><p>In order to evaluate robustness of the mDCC analysis, we calculated the mDCC maps from the following four different conditions: (i) the parameter <italic>K</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;10, (ii) use of backbone atoms for calculating mDCC values of residue pairs, (iii) use of some different time windows in the trajectory, and (iv) another initial guess of the pattern recognition process. (i) We analyzed the trajectory with the parameter <italic>K</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;10 in addition to the default parameter <italic>K</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;5. Differences of the mDCC with <italic>K</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;10 from that with <italic>K</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;5 mainly appeared at the flexible N-terminal regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112419.s003">Fig. S3A</xref>) because wide spread distributions need a large number of Gaussian functions to cover all of sampled coordinates. The Pearson correlation coefficient for mDCC values of <italic>K</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;10 from those of <italic>K</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;5 was 0.975. This result indicates that the mDCC values were not significantly affected by the changes of the adjustable parameter <italic>K</italic> value lager than <italic>K</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;5. Thus, the value of <italic>K</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;5 is good to represent the atomic motions. (ii) We calculated the residue pair mDCC value by taking a representative backbone atom from each residue, C&#945; and C5&#8217; for amino acids and nucleotides, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112419.s003">Fig. S3B</xref>), instead of taking the maximum mDCC value among atom pairs in each residue pair. The result shows that the overall tendencies of the mDCC map and the original one were very similar (the Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.938). Focusing on the maximum value can detect positive correlations in contacting side-chain pairs without hiding the strongly anti-correlated motions. (iii) Following the previous arguments about the convergence for the conventional DCC analysis <xref rid="pone.0112419-Hnenberger1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112419-Karplus1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, the convergence of the mDCC analysis was examined by calculating the mDCC maps with the different time windows: the time range from 10 ns to 100 ns, the time range from 110 ns and 200 ns, and the time range from 10 ns to 100 ns in the alternative run with the different initial atomic velocities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112419.s004">Fig. S4A, B, and C</xref>). The Pearson correlation coefficients with the mDCC map calculated from 10 ns to 200 ns were 0.939, 0.923, and 0.832, respectively. The mDCC map of the alternative run was slightly different from the mDCC map of the original trajectory, where the most of differences were arisen from the motion of the inhibitory module including the disordered N-terminal region. The Pearson correlation coefficient only for the DNA-binding ETS core domain (Leu337&#8211;Phe414) was 0.910. While it is difficult to characterize the equilibrium motion of the disordered region within the 200 ns of simulation trajectory, the motions in the ETS core domain was considered to be well converged. The movies of these two trajectories are shown in Movies S2 and S3. (iv) As the pattern recognition process depends on randomly determined initial parameters, we repeated the analysis by using different random values with the same trajectory and compared the mDCC map with the original one. Consequently, the Pearson correlation coefficient of all of residue-wise mDCC values was 0.995, and the mDCC maps almost coincide with each other, except subtle differences only appearing in the flexible N-terminal region of Ets1 molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112419.s004">Fig. S4D</xref>). In summarize, while there were some differences in the mDCC values at the flexible regions among some conditions, the correlations in other regions were robust. We mainly discuss the motion of correlations among these structured regions.</p><p>Comparing the DCC and mDCC values for each pair of residues revealed that there are several pairs with transiently correlated motions at the intermolecular interfaces. As examples of them, interaction of Asn380 at the two Ets1 interface and Leu337 at the interface of Ets1 and DNA are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112419-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, because these residues are known as important residues for the cooperativity by the mutation study <xref rid="pone.0112419-Babayeva1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In the first example, the side-chain of Asn380B at the H2&#8211;H3 loop interacts with Ala324A and Ala327A at the HI2 helix of the partner Ets1 (the characters A and B after the residue numbers indicate the chain ID of the Ets1 molecules). The time courses of the interatomic distances between the N&#948; atom of Asn380B and the C&#946; atoms of these alanine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112419-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) and the probability density functions for each Gaussian element of the N&#948; atom of Asn380B (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112419.s005">Fig. S5</xref>) showed that Asn380B transiently flipped and switched its fluctuation modes. The spatial distributions obtained from the simulation trajectory for the atoms in Asn380B, Ala324A, and Ala327A are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112419-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, and they were modeled as four, three, and three Gaussian functions, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112419-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). The mode with the highest probability in the N&#948; atom of Asn380B (&#960;<italic><sub>k</sub></italic>&#8202;=&#8202;0.683) was highly correlated with both Ala324A and Ala327A, with mDCC values of 0.613 and 0.654, respectively. These correlations cannot be detected by using the conventional DCC method, where the DCC values were 0.282 and 0.389 for Asn380B&#8211;Ala324A and Asn380B&#8211;Ala327A, respectively. A previous experimental study showed that Asn380 and Gly333 at the partner chain are key residues for establishing intermolecular communications between the two Ets1 molecules <xref rid="pone.0112419-Babayeva1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Our simulation study showed that Asn380 transiently interacted with Ala324 and Ala327 of the partner Ets1, and further analyses imply these interactions could play an important role for the interplay of dimerized Ets1 molecules as described below.</p><fig id="pone-0112419-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0112419.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Examples of transiently formed intermolecular interactions.</title><p>(A, B, and C) Interactions among the N&#948; atom of the Asn380B side-chain, and the C&#946; atoms of Ala324A and Ala327A.

The side-chain of Tyr396B in the H3 helix of the Ets1 molecule flipped, and the phosphate group of C11 of DNA slid at about 120 ns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112419-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>). As these two motions were coupled, the distance between these two groups did not change very much (the red plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112419-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>), but the relative positions with Leu337B in H1 helix were altered. The maximum mDCC values were 0.799, 0.676, and 0.734, and the DCC values were 0.162, 0.0384, and 0.359 for the Tyr396B&#8211;C11, Leu337B&#8211;C11, and Leu337B&#8211;Tyr396B pairs, respectively. An experimental study indicated that Leu337 plays important roles in the cooperative binding of Ets1 and partner TFs and in the regulation of auto-inhibition <xref rid="pone.0112419-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In these examples, particular intermolecular interactions, which are crucial for molecular communications, showed multi-modal behaviors due to amino acid side-chain flipping and nucleotide backbone sliding motions. Thus, the current mDCC method is useful for finding and analyzing such transient interactions without <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge about mechanisms of the transitions, such as flipping, and sliding.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Correlation Network in the (Ets1)<sub>2</sub>&#8211;DNA Complex</title><p>The mDCC map (the upper triangle of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112419-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) shows that the &#946;-sheet region exhibited weak negative correlations with the other parts inside an Ets1 molecule (a, b and c in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112419-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), except for the H4 and H5 helices. These helices, which are parts of the inhibitory module, correlated weakly and negatively with the H2, H3 helices and the two loops at the interface of the protein&#8211;protein interaction (HI2&#8211;H1 and H2&#8211;H3 loops, indicated by d and e in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112419-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). As the intermolecular interactions, these two interface loops correlated positively with the same regions in the partner Ets1 (f, g, h, and i in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112419-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), because of the direct contacts. In contrast, the recognition helix H3 correlated positively with the entire region of the partner Ets1, although they did not contact directly. This correlation of the recognition helix with the partner implies that binding with the partner affects the recognition of the regulatory element by altering the motions of the recognition helix.</p><p>In order to analyze the propagation effects of local interactions toward the entire molecular assembly, especially from the recognition helix, we focused on interacting pairs with correlative motions. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112419.s007">Fig. S7</xref> visualizes a network of residue pairs in a positively correlative motion, where the maximum value of mDCC is equal to or larger than 0.5, and the strongly coupling pair has a distance between the centers of the modes that is shorter than 5.0 &#197;. In addition, because correlation values do not directly mean the importance of the interactions, we applied the &#8220;Betweenness&#8221;, a well-known measure of centrality in the field of complex network analysis, which is defined by the following equation, in order to assess the importance of each residue for the connection of the entire network:<disp-formula id="pone.0112419.e035"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e035.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><label>(9)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>g(i)</italic> is the Betweenness of the <italic>i</italic>th node, &#963;<italic><sub>st</sub></italic> denotes the number of shortest paths between the <italic>s</italic>th and <italic>t</italic>th nodes, and &#963;<italic><sub>st</sub> (i)</italic> denotes the number of shortest paths between the <italic>s</italic>th and <italic>t</italic>th nodes via the <italic>i</italic>th node. For example, Betweenness becomes very high at a bridge between two cliques (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112419.s006">Fig. S6</xref>). This value is calculated from only the topological feature of the network without direct consideration of 3D information, modes of motions, and chemical information about atoms or residues. The Betweenness values were mapped onto the network, as the colors of the nodes in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112419.s007">Fig. S7</xref>. In order to simplify this complex network, a sub-network was created by extracting the top 20% highest Betweenness residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112419-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>), where the residues without any edges are not shown.

The residue with the highest Betweenness is Asn380, which is a main player in the intermolecular interactions between two Ets1 molecules, by forming a hydrogen bond with Gly333 and other interactions (the pink arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112419-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). In fact, their importance has been reported by mutation assays <xref rid="pone.0112419-Babayeva1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. A neighboring residue, Lys379, which has the ninth and tenth highest Betweenness values for chains A and B, forms a salt bridge with the phosphate groups of T111 and T12, respectively (the lime arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112419-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). The Arg378 side-chain forms a salt bridge with the side-chain of Glu343 in the H1 helix, and it also makes a water-mediated interaction with the backbone nitrogen atom of Ala324 in the HI2 helix of the same Ets1 molecule (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112419.s008">Figs.

The second and third residues with the highest Betweenness are G10 and A109, which intervene between the two H3 helices (the cyan arrow), and they interact with Tyr396 in the H3 helix, which has the fourth and fifth highest Betweenness (the green arrows). Both Tyr396 and G10/A109 interact with Gln336 at the HI2&#8211;H1 loop (the yellow and orange arrows). On the contrary, it is interesting that the consensus sequence GGAA did not exhibit a high Betweenness, because it is located on the distal side of the DNA structure (the gray arrows in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112419.s007">Fig. S7</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, this network was mapped onto the 3D graphics of the complex structure with the extraction of the &#8220;core&#8221; of the network, to avoid filling up the entire structure with a massive amount of edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112419-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>).

These 3D networks visualize spatial communication pathways between the two recognition helices in the two Ets1 molecules: namely, the path through protein&#8211;protein interactions between the H2&#8211;H3 and HI2&#8211;H1 loops in each Ets1, contacting around Asn380 and Gly333 (the pink arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112419-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, corresponding to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112419-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> f and i), and the path through DNA (the cyan arrow). While these pathways are spatially distinguishable at the middle of complexes (edges with the pink and cyan arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112419-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), these two paths are connected in the network in each Ets1 molecule. The former pathway reaches the recognition helix via the interactions of Tyr396 with the HI2&#8211;H1 loop (Gln336) and the N-terminus of the H1 helix (Leu337 shown by the yellow arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112419-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). For the latter pathway, the bases of A109, C110, and T111 interact with the H3 helix (Arg391A, Tyr395A, Tyr396A, and Lys399A shown by the green arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112419-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).

This model is referred as the &#8220;single Ets1&#8211;DNA model&#8221;, hereafter. The conformation of Ets1 was not significantly changed from the native structure, with an exception at the N-terminal region including the HI1 and HI2 helices (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112419.s009">Fig. S9</xref>). The large fluctuations of the HI1 helix during the simulation are considered to be natural, because the HI1 helix is disordered when Ets1 binds DNA and the ordered helical structure observed in the complex crystal structure is due to the crystal contacts forming a domain swapped assembly with a neighboring asymmetric unit <xref rid="pone.0112419-Babayeva1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>The C-terminus of HI2 also largely fluctuated during the whole simulation, and it became partly unstructured after 150 ns in the single Ets1&#8211;DNA model, while the HI2 helix retained the initial structure during 200 ns MD for (Ets1)<sub>2</sub>&#8211;DNA. This is due to the dissociation of the Ala327A&#8211;Gly333A interactions caused by the loss of the intermolecular interaction between Gly333A and Asp380B (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112419.s009">Fig. S9B, C, and D</xref>). This conformational change is an unexpected relaxation, because the loss of the partner Ets1 could facilitate the formation of the inhibitory module, by packing of the HI1, HI2, H4, and H5 helices. However, the observed behavior with large fluctuations seems to avoid the packing of these helices. This deformation can be interpreted as the first step for packing the inhibitory module. In fact, helix HI2 in the inhibitory module in an isolated Ets1 (PDB-ID: 1R36, measured by NMR <xref rid="pone.0112419-Donaldson1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>) is more tightly packed than that in the (Ets1)<sub>2</sub>&#8211;DNA complex (PDB-ID: 3MFK; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112419.s010">Fig. S10A</xref>).

This phenomenon was observed during the simulation with the (Ets1)<sub>2</sub>&#8211;DNA model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112419.s010">Fig. S10B</xref>), but it did not affect the interactions between Ets1 and DNA within 200 ns of the simulation. Thus, forming the inhibitory module would require not only ordering the HI1 helix and forming its macroscopic helical dipole interaction with H4, but also repositioning the helices to more packed conformations. The observed partial deformation of HI2 may be required for the repositioning of its helical structure.</p><p>Next, we applied the mDCC approach to the MD trajectory of the single Ets1&#8211;DNA model and compared it with the results of the (Ets1)<sub>2</sub>&#8211;DNA model. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112419-g004">Fig. 4</xref> shows the mDCC map of the single Ets1&#8211;DNA model and its differences from the (Ets1)<sub>2</sub>&#8211;DNA model as the upper and lower triangles, respectively.

This separation of motions between the two Ets1 binding sequences indicated that the binding of dimerized Ets1 stabilizes the cooperative motions between these two DNA regions. While most of the components of Ets1 positively correlate with the first half of the DNA sequence bound to Ets1, the &#946;-sheet (b and c in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112419-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) and the C-terminal loop have positive correlations with the other side of the DNA, and they correlate negatively with the other parts of the Ets1 molecule (d and e in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112419-g004">Fig. 4</xref>).

There were some discrepancies between the two chains of Ets1. The differences in the correlations of the Ets1&#8211;DNA interactions in the N380A model from the (Ets1)<sub>2</sub>&#8211;DNA model were basically greater in chain A than in chain B. The contacts at the protein&#8211;protein interface around the mutated points and their interaction partners reduced their correlations in both chains. For example, the mDCC values of Ala324A&#8211;Ala380B were 0.654 and 0.395 for the wild type and mutant, respectively. The corresponding DCC values were 0.330 and 0.105, respectively.

This dissociation of the interactions and the movement of the HI2 helix away from the partner H2 helix may trigger the disruption of the interplay between the two Ets1 molecules. Thus, the importance of Asn380 is supported by the current analysis for the dynamics of the Ets1 systems.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>DNA Structures</title><p>We simulated the system composed of an isolated double-stranded DNA molecule in solution, to evaluate the effects of Ets1 binding on the DNA structure (referred to as the isolated DNA model, hereafter).

The structural parameters of DNA, defined by 3DNA software <xref rid="pone.0112419-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, were computed for the significant conformational changes in the single Ets1&#8211;DNA, N380A, and isolated DNA models from the (Ets1)<sub>2</sub>&#8211;DNA model. The gains in the ensemble averages of the geometrical descriptors &#8220;Slide&#8221; and &#8220;X-displacement&#8221;, which are defined as the displacements of a base pair along the plane orthogonal to the helix axis in 3DNA, from the isolated DNA to the single Ets1&#8211;DNA were 0.328 &#197; and 0.53 &#197;, respectively. Those from the isolated DNA to the (Ets1)<sub>2</sub>&#8211;DNA were 0.975 &#197; and 1.61 &#197;, respectively. The details are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112419.s013">Fig. S13B and C</xref>. These displacements of the base pairs can be interpreted as the result of interactions with the Tyr395A side-chain, the Tyr396A backbone, (the green arrow) and the Leu337A backbone (the orange arrow), and the homo-dimerization of Ets1 affects these interactions and facilitates this conformational change at C110.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Summary</title><p>We developed the multi-modal extension of the DCC method, named mDCC, which can be interpreted as the decomposition of the DCC value into each pair of modes of motions. We applied it to the analysis of Ets1 dimerization upon binding to the Stromelysin-1 gene promoter. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112419-g005">Fig. 5</xref> summarizes the correlation network in this molecular assembly analyzed in this study. The homo-dimerization of Ets1 on this palindromic regulatory element modifies the motions of the recognition helix (H3) to correlate with the partner Ets1, while they did not directly contact. The results of the mDCC analysis suggest that the effects from the partner are propagated via two pathways: (i) direct protein&#8211;protein interactions at the HI2&#8211;H1 and H2&#8211;H3 loops, such as the hydrogen bond between the Asn380 side-chain and the Gly333 backbone (the pink arrows), and (ii) the pathway through DNA (the cyan arrow). These two pathways are interconnected by direct contacts among the DNA (A109, C110, and T111), the N-terminus of the H1 helix (Ile335, Gln336, Leu337, Asn380) and the H3 helix (Tyr395, Tyr396, and Lys399), and the C-terminus of the H2 helix (Trp375, Arg378, and Lys379) shown as bold arrows in different colors (The details are provided in the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112419-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). While the two loops contacting the partner Ets1 correlate positively with the partner, rather than with the regions inside the same molecule, the artificial removal of the partner increases the correlations of the intramolecular pairs of these regions. These loops and the H3 helix switch their correlating partner from inside the Ets1 to the neighboring Ets1 by homo-dimerization. In addition, the strongly negative correlations of the &#946;-sheet with the other regions inside the same molecule are moderated by homo-dimerization, which could stabilize the entire structure of Ets1. Furthermore, our mDCC analysis revealed that the important intermolecular contacts are transiently switched by side-chain flipping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112419-g002">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0112419-g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0112419.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Summary of the correlation network in the (Ets1)<sub>2</sub>&#8211;DNA complex.</title><p>The colored bold arrows indicate interactions of important residues that exhibited high Betweenness values.

<bold>Schematic illustration of the differences between the conventional DCC (A) and our new approach, named mDCC (B), for a simple toy-model.</bold> (A) Images of the trajectories of the <italic>i</italic>th and <italic>j</italic>th particles are shown as gray polygonal lines on the left and right sides of the figure, respectively. The magenta crosses indicate averaged coordinates of each particle, which are the bases of the calculations of fluctuation (<italic>&lt;r<sub>i</sub>(t)&gt;<sub>t</sub></italic>). In this figure, the four time points, <italic>t&#8202;=&#8202;t<sub>1</sub></italic>, <italic>t<sub>2</sub></italic>, <italic>t<sub>3</sub></italic>, and <italic>t<sub>4</sub></italic>, are highlighted by arrows representing the displacement of the <italic>i</italic>th particle from its average at <italic>t</italic> (<italic>&#916;r<sub>i</sub>(t)</italic>). The DCC value should be close to zero for this pair of particles, because the <italic>i</italic>th particle drifted along the vertical axis, but the <italic>j</italic>th one fluctuated along the horizontal axis. However, these particles correlatively vibrated along the horizontal direction. The conventional DCC approach cannot find such correlations of rapid fluctuations hidden in a large drifting motion. (B) Our new approach, mDCC, tackles this problem by considering multi-modal distributions of coordinates. A pattern recognition technique is applied to find modes of motions as the Gaussian mixture distributions. The centers of two modes of the <italic>i</italic>th particle marked with the magenta crosses (here we refer to them as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e036.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e037.jpg"/></inline-formula>), and the displacements from these two centers at the time <italic>t</italic> are shown as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e038.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e039.jpg"/></inline-formula>. A mDCC value is defined for each pair of modes; <italic>i.e.</italic>, correlations for pairs of <italic>k<sub>1</sub>&#8211;l<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>k<sub>2</sub>&#8211;l<sub>1</sub></italic> are calculated in this case. At <italic>t&#8202;=&#8202;t<sub>1</sub></italic> or <italic>t&#8202;=&#8202;t<sub>2</sub></italic>, the first particle is likely to be assigned to the mode <italic>k<sub>1</sub></italic>, because the particle is located near the center of the mode <italic>k<sub>1</sub></italic> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e040.jpg"/></inline-formula>). The contributions from these snapshots are more heavily considered for the calculation of the <italic>k<sub>1</sub>&#8211;l<sub>1</sub></italic> correlation than that of <italic>k<sub>2</sub>&#8211;l<sub>1</sub></italic>. Precisely, the weighted values were decided in terms of the ratio of probability density functions, as Eqs. (5) and (6) in the main text. In the same way, deviations from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e041.jpg"/></inline-formula> were significantly considered at later times (<italic>t&#8202;=&#8202;t<sub>3</sub>, t<sub>4</sub></italic>). As a result, this approach characterizes the motion of the <italic>i</italic>th atom as fluctuations along the horizontal axis centered at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e042.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e043.jpg"/></inline-formula> for the first and last half of the trajectory, respectively. The mDCC approach can find correlating small fluctuations during non-correlating large drifting motions. (C) The spatial distributions of the particle coordinates in the simulation on the toy-model.

The pattern recognition technique defined two Gaussian functions that correspond to the first (mode <italic>k<sub>1</sub></italic>) and last (mode <italic>k<sub>2</sub></italic>) half of the trajectory, in order to model the spatial distribution of the first particle, respectively. The motion of the other particle was recognized as a uni-modal distribution (mode <italic>l<sub>1</sub></italic>). As a result, the mDCC values for both pairs <italic>k<sub>1</sub>&#8211;l<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>k<sub>2</sub>&#8211;l<sub>1</sub></italic> showed highly positive correlations (<italic>mDCC(1,2; k<sub>1</sub>, l<sub>1</sub>)</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;0.968, and <italic>mDCC(1,2; k<sub>2</sub>, l<sub>1</sub>)</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;0.968), although the conventional DCC method could not find such a high correlation (<italic>DCC(1,2)</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;0.582). In the mDCC calculation, the trajectory was divided into the two parts: a time range when the first and second particles belong to modes <italic>k<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>l<sub>1</sub></italic>, and that when they belong to modes <italic>k<sub>2</sub></italic> and <italic>l<sub>1</sub></italic>, by the weighting coefficient <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0112419.e045.jpg"/></inline-formula>.

(D) An illustration of the parameters for the mDCC calculation in the toy-model simulation. For the first particle, the assignment to the Gaussian functions (<italic>k<sub>1</sub></italic> or <italic>k<sub>2</sub></italic>) at each step was determined by the y-axis coordinates, and the particle was assigned to mode <italic>k<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>k<sub>2</sub></italic> in the first and last half of the trajectory, respectively (the left-top and right-top plots).

They are ordered by the sequence along the counter-clockwise direction, beginning at the bottom, and the black filled circles adjoined the nodes are drawn for every ten residues (Asp310, Val320, Thr330, &#8230;, His430). Nodes with higher Betweenness values are filled by darker colors. The border colors of them mean the secondary structure: green, orange, and cyan mean the &#945;-helix, &#946;-sheet, and others. The edges are drawn between nodes with the contacts (&lt;5.0 &#197;) and positive correlations (mDCC &#8805;0.5), and the color gradation of edges indicates mDCC values from 0.5 to 1.0. The edges shown as zigzag lines indicate transiently correlated residue pairs (DCC&lt;0.5).
