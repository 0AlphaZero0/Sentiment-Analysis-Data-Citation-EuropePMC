</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>During the past decade, extensive efforts in the field of molecular biology have shed light on the paramount importance of non-coding regions in the human genome, which were traditionally considered as “junk”. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In particular, an unexpectedly huge amount of regulatory elements have been found by recent studies [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Currently, the mechanistic details of gene expression regulation through these elements are not well understood, especially at the atomistic level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Since regulatory elements conduct their functions through specific binding with a certain class of proteins, i.e., transcription factors (TFs), the molecular interactions between TFs and DNA are the keystone to gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The DNA binding affinity of a TF is dynamically modulated by a variety of biochemical phenomena, such as post-translational modifications [2], ordering or disordering of disordered regions [3], and cooperative binding of one or more other TFs [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>As an interesting example, the v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 1 product (Ets1), which plays essential roles in a wide range of important biological processes, such as cancer and immunity, has been extensively studied [5]–[9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>A highly conserved region named the ETS domain consisting of a winged helix-turn-helix motif specifically recognizes the GGA(A/T) signature sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Many regulatory elements control the transcriptional activity of their target genes by binding with Ets1 and other partner TFs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>For example, the TCRα/β gene is regulated by the cooperative binding of three TFs: the Ets1, the runt-related TF 1 (Runx1), and the core-binding factor β (CBFβ) [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Regulation of the mb-1 gene is established by the cooperative binding of Ets1 and paired box 5 (Pax5) to the promoter region [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The stromelysin-1 gene is regulated by the Ets1 homo-dimer [12]–[14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The partner TFs are considered to affect the stability of the “inhibitory module” of Ets1, which consists of short helices upstream of the ETS domain (HI1 and HI2 helices) and downstream from it (H4 and H5 helices). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the HI1 region adopts a helix conformation only when Ets1 is free from DNA; in other words, the formation of the inhibitory module with ordered HI1 inhibits DNA binding by Ets1 [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Although these phenomena have been proven by experiments, the details of the molecular mechanisms by which the partner TFs affect the Ets1–DNA binding stability are still largely unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Here, we have focused on the Ets1 homo-dimer with the Stromelysin-1 gene promoter [12], as an example of the cooperative binding of Ets1, to investigate the effects of an Ets1 molecule on the binding of the other Ets1 with the regulatory element at the atomistic level. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The molecular dynamics (MD) method, which simulates a time evolution of atomic coordinates based on the Newtonian mechanics, is a promising method toward illuminating the atomistic details of such complicated processes in molecular systems from the 3D structure data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>It has been applied to analyze Ets1–DNA binding [16]–[18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Reddy et al. analyzed binding specificity of the signature sequence with simulations of Ets1–DNA complexes with different sequences [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Kamberaj and van der Vaart showed that Leu337–DNA interactions works as a conformational switch of Ets1 by using the DCC analysis [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Karolak and van der Vaart also simulated the stability of the inhibitory module by applying the replica exchange method [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>While the MD method provides fruitful information about atomic motions, and today’s supercomputers are able to perform long-term MD simulations of large molecular systems, extracting knowledge from a huge amount of data generated by simulations is not straightforward. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>For analyzing communications among separate parts of a molecular system, e.g., communication among two Ets1 molecules and DNA, the dynamic cross correlation (DCC) analysis has been extensively applied to quantify the correlation coefficients of motions between atoms [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The DCC between the ith and jth atoms is defined by the following equation,(1)where r i(t) denotes the vector of the ith atom’s coordinates as a function of time t,  means the time ensemble average and . </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>While the DCC analysis can provide insight into the correlative motions of atoms, it could overlook some kinds of correlative motions, due to its reliance on displacements from the uniquely determined average coordinate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Namely, the DCC has a definitive meaning if an atomic coordinate behaves under a uni-modal distribution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Atoms may perform multi-modal behaviors over a long time period, especially for the side-chains of amino acids, which rapidly move with flipping motions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Although the DCC has usually been applied for analyses of backbone fluctuations and domain motions by focusing on only the Cα atoms, observations of side-chain interactions are also important for our purposes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we developed a new method to extend the conventional DCC, by explicitly including the multi-modal motions of atoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>We call the method “multi-modal DCC” (mDCC). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>In addition, we used techniques in the field of complex network analyses for visualization and investigation of communications among molecules, via the atomic correlative motions in a molecular assembly. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>In this article, we first introduce our new method to analyze atomic correlative motions on the MD trajectory, mDCC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>We then report the results of MD simulations on the crystal structure of the (Ets1)2–DNA complex (PDB ID: 3MFK) and three other models constructed from this crystal structure: the single Ets1–DNA complex constructed by removing an Ets1 (chain B), the model with the N380A mutation in the both Ets1 molecules, and the isolated double-stranded DNA extracted from the crystal structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>In total, 900 ns trajectory data (200 ns for each, and an additional 100 ns run of the (Ets1)2–DNA model with another set of initial atomic velocities) were analyzed by using the mDCC method, and the results were visualized as heatmaps, the 2D and 3D network diagrams. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Here, we introduce a new method, named mDCC, that quantifies the correlation of motions between atoms moving under multi-modal distributions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>In this approach, we first build a spatial distribution of atomic coordinates sampled from a MD trajectory by a Gaussian mixture distribution, which is a linear combination of Gaussian functions,(2) (3)where r i denotes a coordinate of the ith atom, N is a three-dimensional Gaussian function, and πk is a weighting coefficient. µ k and Σ k indicate the parameters for the kth Gaussian element: a 3D vector of mean coordinate, and a symmetric, positive-definite 3×3 matrix, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>By imposing conditions  Eq. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>(2) represents a probability density function for the event that the ith atom is observed at the position r i. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the conventional DCC analysis, which uses only one averaged coordinate, our approach decomposes the atomic motions into K modes, or Gaussian functions, and calculates deviations from the individual K “averages.” These parameters πk, µ k, and Σ k were learned from a trajectory by applying a pattern recognition technique based on a variational Bayesian approach [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>In this approach, the assignments of each data point r i to the Gaussian functions and the estimations of parameters of the Gaussian mixture distributions were iteratively updated in order to obtain the parameter values with the maximum likelihood, which is based on a variational approximation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The k-means clustering was employed with randomly generated initial assignments in order to generate an initial guess of the assignments for the variational Bayesian approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Here, the maximum number of modes of each atom (the parameter K) was set to five. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>If an atomic motion was likely to behave under a smaller number of modes than five, then the weighted value πk of excess modes should be close to zero in the learning process (we omitted minor modes with πk&lt;0.01). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Second, on the basis of the inferred Gaussian mixture distributions, the correlation,  between the fluctuation of the ith atom from the kth mode () and that of the jth atom from the lth mode () is defined by the following equation,(4) (5) (6)where  and  Here, pk( r i) can be considered as the degree of the assignment of the ith atom coordinate to the kth mode, for which  holds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Eq. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>(4) is different from Eq. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>(1) in several respects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>First, it does not use just the single average , but instead uses a number of “averages,” viz., several modes , in order to distinguish atomic fluctuations from the individual mode, each of which can be viewed as a quasi-stable position. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Second, Eq. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>(5) introduces a weight,  to observe the relationship between the two atom motions for which the ith atom is near  and the jth atom is near  by emphasizing the specific simulation duration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Namely,  is mainly calculated from the time ranges when the ith and jth atoms simultaneously belong to modes k and l, respectively, by using the coefficient  weighting these time ranges. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>For aiming this emphasizing effect, we use the common weight,  for the two terms in the denominator of Eq. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>(4), although it may seem to be peculiar from the viewpoint of the basic definition of a correlation coefficient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>However, it should be noted that the normalized property,  is ensured, since  measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors in  one is  and the other is  where T is the total number of the time ensemble. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>The mDCC can compensate for the weakness in the DCC analyses by detecting hidden information about the multi-modal behaviors of atomic motions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>In practice, when K and L Gaussian functions with  and  were found for the ith and jth atoms, respectively, then the K×L mDCC values were defined for this atom pair. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we mainly analyze the maximum value of mDCC for each pair of atoms or residues, and mode pairs with  were omitted because of the very few co-occurrences of these pairs of fluctuation modes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>To illustrate the characteristic features of the mDCC and its advantages over the conventional DCC, a simple toy model consisting of two oscillating particles was analyzed by the mDCC method, and the results are shown in Fig. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>We performed the MD simulation of the (Ets1)2–DNA model, prepared from the crystal structure (PDB ID: 3MFK) consisting of two Ets1 molecules (chain A and B) and a double-stranded DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>The sequences of the DNA strands are 5′-GCAGGAAGTGCTTCCT-3′ (chain C) and 5′-CAGGAAGCACTTCCTG-3′ (chain D), and we refer to each base by the residue ID defined in the PDB file, that is from G1 to T16 and from C101 to G116 for chains C and D, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Then, the simulation trajectory was analyzed by using the mDCC method. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>As a result of a pattern recognition process for each 3D spatial distribution of 2,887 heavy atoms, 6,886 Gaussian functions (or modes) were found. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate robustness of the mDCC analysis, we calculated the mDCC maps from the following four different conditions: (i) the parameter K = 10, (ii) use of backbone atoms for calculating mDCC values of residue pairs, (iii) use of some different time windows in the trajectory, and (iv) another initial guess of the pattern recognition process. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>The results of the mDCC analysis suggest that the effects from the partner are propagated via two pathways: (i) direct protein–protein interactions at the HI2–H1 and H2–H3 loops, such as the hydrogen bond between the Asn380 side-chain and the Gly333 backbone (the pink arrows), and (ii) the pathway through DNA (the cyan arrow). </plain></SENT>
