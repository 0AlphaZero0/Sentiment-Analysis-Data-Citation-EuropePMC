</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neurotransmitter interactions regulate brain reward circuitry that result in the release of dopamine (DA) in the major loci for feelings of well-being and reward, the nucleus accumbens (NAc) part of the mesolimbic system of the brain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The inter-relationship of at least four important neurochemical pathways: serotonergic, endorphinergic, GABAergic, and dopaminergic constitute the “brain reward cascade” (see Fig. 1) a natural sequence of events that produce feelings of well being. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These activities including: the synthesis, vesicle storage, metabolism, release, and function of neurochemicals [1] are regulated by genes, and their expression, in terms of messenger RNA-directed proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Thus, genetic testing is a potential window that can be used to identify the specific neurochemistry of individuals and formulate the best treatment options for them [1–13].Fig. 1Brain Reward Cascade [14, 15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In this cascade, stimulation of the serotonergic system in the hypothalamus leads to the stimulation of delta/mu receptors by serotonin to cause a release of enkephalin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Activation of the enkephalinergic system induces an inhibition of GABA transmission at the substania nigra by enkephalin stimulation of mu receptors at GABA neurons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This inhibitory effect allows for the fine-tuning of GABA activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This provides the normal release of dopamine at the projected area of the NAc [14, 15] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>DA is a neurotransmitter with multiple important functions including behavioral effects such as “pleasure” and “stress reduction.” Simply stated, without the normal function of this substance, an individual will suffer from cravings and have an inability to cope with stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Thus, genetic hypodopaminergic brain function predisposes individuals to seek substances and or behaviors that can be used to overcome this craving state by activating the mesolimbic dopaminergic centers [4, 13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Psychoactive substances like alcohol, psychostimulants and opiates, and risky behaviors like gambling, overeating and thrill seeking [16] induce the release of neuronal DA into the synapse at the NAc, to overcome the hypodopaminergic state of that individual. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Temporary relief from the discomfort and a pseudo sense of well-being is the product of this self-medication [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, chronic abuse of psychoactive substances leads to inactivation, or a downregulation, like for example, inhibition of neurotransmitter synthesis, neurotransmitter depletion, formation of toxic pseudo neurotransmitters, and through structural receptor dysfunction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Therefore, substance-seeking and pathological behaviors are both used as a means of providing a feel-good response (a “fix”) to lessen uncontrollable cravings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Individuals who possess reward gene polymorphisms or variations, will, given environmental insult be at risk for impulsive, compulsive, and addictive behaviors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) is a term used to embrace and characterize these genetically induced behaviors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Any and all of these pathological behaviors, as well as psychoactive drug-abuse, are candidates for addiction including tolerance and dependence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The behavior or drug of choice by the individual is a function of both genes and environmental factors like availability and peer pressure. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Brain Reward Cascade Explanation </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>DA is crucial to the maintenance of natural rewards while the release of DA into NAc synaptic sites is a somewhat complex cascade of reactive activity that involves neurotransmitters and structures in the limbic system [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Blum and Kozlowski first proposed the concept of a “brain reward cascade” in 1990 as a cascade of interactive events and mesolimbic function that produces the net release of DA [1] (see Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Simply, the interaction of activities in the separate subsystems of the brain’s reward circuitry combine into the much larger global system, and reveal the cascade of neurotransmission, which merges simultaneously and in a specific sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>When these systems work normally, they result in a feeling of pleasure, well-being, and peace; an imbalance, or deficiency, on the other hand, will cause the system to function abnormally, displacing the sense of well-being with negative feelings like anxiety, anger, and low self-esteem. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The need to mask these negative feelings leads to the use of substances such as alcohol and narcotics, meaning that excessive desires are spurred by the need for DA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The DA pathway arises in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and culminates in the DA D2 receptors on neurons located in the cell membranes of in the hippocampus and the NAc. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Blum and Kozlowski [1] describe a process that begins in the hypothalamus, where the excitatory activities of 5-HT-releasing-neurons cause the release of met-enkephalin, an opioid peptide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The opioid peptide regulates the activity of neurons responsible for the release of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) the inhibitory neurotransmitter at the substantia nigra. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>When DA-containing neurons in the VTA, and in certain parts of the hippocampus via the amygdala, are disinhibited, DA is allowed to be released into the NAc, permitting the completion of the cascade. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>If the cascade is functioning correctly, the reward sensation, or the feeling of well-being, is experienced, provided certain basic genetic conditions are fulfilled (see Fig. 1) [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>However, when the genes that govern the function of the brain reward cascade have polymorphic variations, these risk alleles provide the basis for therapeutic targets. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The development of a blueprint for identifying certain candidate genes and polymorphisms that could negatively impact DA release is based on this understanding of the brain reward cascade [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Many genes are involved, and it has been adequately established in association studies and animal research literature that, for example, polymorphisms of the serotonergic-2 A receptor (5-HTT2a), DA D2 receptor (DRD2), and the catechol-O-methyl-transferase (COMT) genes (see Genetic Addiction Risk Score (GARS) test), predispose individuals to aberrant RDS behaviors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>These behaviors include craving not only for drugs and alcohol but eating and other addictive behaviors such as pathological gambling (see Table 1) [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Gene polymorphisms of both 5-HT and DA can result in significantly lower than normal receptor densities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>A COMT gene polymorphism can result in increased catabolism of synaptic DA and subsequent reduction of DA function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>These are three examples of how the identification of polymorphisms on these three genes can provide a window into an impaired brain reward cascade, and the identification of individuals at high risk can be accomplished. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Based on a published [11] mathematical Bayesian approach, it was found that individuals who carry the Taq A1 polymorphisms of the DRD2 have a 74.4 % chance of developing RDS behaviors, given an environmental insult and epigenetic effects (see Table 1).Table 1Reward deficiency syndrome behaviors (linked with DSM 5) </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>In general, inconsistencies in the literature involving association studies using single gene analysis prompted Conner [4] and others to evaluate a number of dopaminergic gene polymorphisms as predictors of drug use in adolescents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>We cannot ignore the importance of neurochemical mechanisms involved in drug-induced relapse behavior, as suggested by Bossert et al. [5] for understanding the interaction of multiple genes and environmental elements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Using a drug relapse model previously shown to induce relapse by re-exposing rats to heroin-associated contexts, these investigators found that after extinction of drug-reinforced responding in different contexts, re-exposure reinstated heroin seeking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>This effect was diminished by inhibition of GABA transmission in the VTA and medial accumbens shell and components of the mesolimbic DA system; this process enhances net DA release into the NAc. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Indeed, this fits well with Li’s Knowledgebase for Addiction-Related Genes (KARG) addiction network map [6] (see Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Li et al. [6] also stressed the view that drug addiction is a serious problem worldwide with strong genetic and environmental influences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>And that a variety of technologies were used to discover genes and pathways that underlie addiction however, each individual technology can be biased and incomplete. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Li and his colleagues integrated evidence from peer-reviewed publications 2,343 items between 1976 and 2006 that inked genes and chromosomal regions to addiction by single-gene strategies, microarray, proteomics, or genetic studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>They identified 1,500 human addiction-related genes and developed the first molecular KARG (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://karg.cbi.pku.edu.cn/">http://karg.cbi.pku.edu.cn</ext-link>), with a friendly web interface and extensive annotations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Their meta-analysis of 396 genes, each supported by two or more independent items of evidence, leads to the identification of 18 molecular pathways that were statistically significant and covered both upstream signaling events and downstream effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>For four different types of addictive drugs and five significant molecular pathways including two new ones; GnRH signaling pathway and gap junction were identified as common pathways that may underlie shared rewarding and addictive actions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>In a hypothetical common molecular network for addiction, they connected the common pathways which linked all of these genes, to both the glutaminergic and dopaminergic pathways.Fig. 2KARG an addiction network map [6] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Following the initial finding of Blum et al. in 1990 [7] showing a positive association of the single gene DRD2 polymorphism in chromosome 11 and severe alcoholism, replication, although favorable has, to date, been fraught with inconsistent results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>This has also been true for other complex behaviors [9] when gene-gene and gene-environment interactions are tested the idea that complex gene-relationships may account for inconsistent findings across many different single gene studies is supported [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The reasons for inconsistencies in trying to predict drug use are many and varied: they include single gene analysis, poorly screened controls, stratification of population, personality traits, co-morbidity of psychiatric disorders, gender-base differences, positive and negative life events, and neurocognitive dysfunctioning and epigenetic effects [6, 7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>In order to gain a more complex but stronger predictive set of genetic antecedents rather than continue to evaluate single gene associations, we embarked on a study to evaluate multiple candidate genes, especially those linked to the Brain Reward Cascade to predict future drug abuse [1] and identify risk for hypodopaminergic functioning. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Although exploratory, the goal is to develop an informative panel based on numerous known risk alleles to provide treatment facilities a means of stratifying patients entering treatment as having a high, moderate, or low, genetic risk prediction. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>As noted above, an association between dopaminergic gene polymorphisms and addictive, compulsive, and impulsive behaviors classified as RDS has been revealed in numerous studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>We evaluated subjects derived from two families for a potential association with polymorphisms of the DA D2 receptor gene (DRD2), DA D1 receptor gene (DRD1), DA transporter gene (DAT1), and DA beta-hydroxylase gene (DBH). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>This association if found would demonstrate the relevance of a generalized RDS behavior set, as the phenotype. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>An experimental group derived from up to five generations of two independent multiple-affected families n = 55 were genotyped and compared to very rigorously screened controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>In addition to these subjects, data related to RDS behaviors was collected from 13 deceased family members. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>The genotyped family members carried the DRD2 Taq1 allele at 78 % the DAT1 10/10 allele at 58 %, the DBHB1 allele at 66 %, and the DRD1 A1/A1 or the A2/A2 genotypes at 35 %. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, all probands (n = 32) from Family A genotyped for the DRD2 gene carried the TaqA1 allele (100 %). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>The experimental positive rate for the DRD2 Taq1 allele with an odds ratio of 103.9 (12.8, 843.2) was significantly greater (X2 = 43.6, P &lt; 0.001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>The experimental positive rate for the DAT1 10/10 allele with an odds ratio of 2.3 (1.2, 4.6) was also significantly greater (X2 = 6.0, P &lt; 0.015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Between the experimental and control positive rates of the DBH, DRD1 A1/A1, or A2/A2 genotypes no significant differences were observed [18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Patients genetic risk for drug-seeking behavior needs to be evaluated prior to, or upon entry to chemical dependency programs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>The importance of genotyping to establish genetic severity for patients undergoing treatment and in danger of relapse is described below in the, as yet, unpublished results from a study of the data from Comprehensive Analysis of Reported Drugs (CARD). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>We have followed up by evaluating a panel of genes and associated polymorphisms termed GARS in patients with RDS behaviors attending two treatment centers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>In this and other studies, we use the GARS for purposes of study identification and commercial testing [9–11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>To determine risk severity of 72 addicted patients, the percentage of prevalence of selected risk alleles was calculated to provide a severity score. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>We genotyped the patients using a nine reward genes and their polymorphisms (F = 18 alleles; M = 17 alleles). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>This panel included: DRD 2, 3, 4; MOA-A; COMT; DAT1; 5HTTLLR; OPRM1; and GABRA3 genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>The three severity ratings were: Low severity = 1–36 %; moderate severity = 37–50 %, and high severity = 51–100 %. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>We studied two distinct treatment populations: Group 1 consisted of 37 addicts from a holistic addiction treatment center in North Miami Beach, Florida, and Group 2 consisted of 35 addicts from Malibu Beach Recovery Center [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>We are in the process of analyzing 393 subjects using a multi-centered approach across the USA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>However, in the following unpublished experiment, we found risk stratification of the 72 genotyped patients to be as follows: 27 % low risk; 74 % moderate risk, and 4 % severe risk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>We are exploring potential risk correlation with the Addiction Severity Index (ASI). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Preliminary statistical analysis reveals that with N = 277, we found a significant trend whereby allelic risk above the means score associated with the ASI Alcohol Risk Severity Score at P &lt; 0.07 (one sided P). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Unlike CARD, the GARS could provide potential correlations to ASI to at least the alcohol risk composite score. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>If this finding is upheld through larger populations, it unequivocally demonstrates that objective genetic polymorphisms could predict clinical outcomes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>We are cognizant that, as the next steps in identifying candidate gene polymorphic associations with RDS as the overall phenotype, we must carefully dissect epigenetic effects such as miRNA and subsequent methylation and/or deacetylation of attached chromatin markers leading to altered gene expression in spite of DNA polymorphisms. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>The primary reason to include some brief information regarding CARD is to provide a clear indication that genetic testing may provide valuable information about the risk that drives relapse. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>In an unpublished study but submitted article from our laboratory, a statistical analysis of unidentifiable data from a computer-based program called CARD was used to evaluate treatment adherence in a large clinical cohort from across a number of eastern states in America. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>This study consisted of 5,703 patients and 11,403 specimens, in various treatment settings across six eastern states. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>We found significant levels of both non-compliance and lack of abstinence (risk for relapse) during treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>The CARD engine addresses issues of metabolism as well as contaminants in the production processes of some formulations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>It addresses multi-faceted scenarios within and across drug classes, often involving the state of multiple analytes in order to reach a conclusion for each self-reported or prescribed drug. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>It evaluates thousands of rule sets to determine if the statement associated with each rule set is applicable to the specimen test results and reported drugs that are analyzed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>We are proposing a paradigm shift on the basis of these studies, whereby the predisposition to a risk for RDS (the true phenotype) can be accurately determined by utilizing GARS, and treatment outcome can be assessed by utilizing CARD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>These results confirm the putative role of dopaminergic polymorphisms in RDS behaviors. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>The family-based study [18] demonstrates the importance of a nonspecific RDS phenotype and informed an understanding of how evaluating single subset of RDS behaviors, like for example, Tourette’s may lead to spurious results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Rather, the adoption of a nonspecific reward phenotype may be useful in future association and linkage studies involving neurotransmitter gene candidates as utilized in GARS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>The putative role of dopaminergic polymorphisms in RDS behaviors is supported by the results [18], although linkage analysis is necessary and the sample size was limited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>We believe that using a nonspecific reward phenotype in future association and linkage studies that involve dopaminergic polymorphisms and other neurotransmitter gene candidates may be a necessary paradigm shift. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>This underscores the problem concerning appropriate controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>While thousands of studies have associated the various reward gene risk polymorphisms for all types of addictive behaviors (including drugs, smoking, alcohol, gambling, sex, shopping) against putative controls, there remains a real need to develop super controls whereby the true phenotype is not just drug addiction per se but the absence of any RDS behavior. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>To suggest that researchers can provide accurate data by enlisting comparison individuals who are from an unscreened general population as controls, is fraught with an inappropriate and potentially inaccurate assessment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>In one, example, assessing the DRD2 A1 allele, we found that while screened controls (eliminating drug and alcohol abuse) in over 3,000 subjects showed a prevalence of approximately 26 %; when we eliminated all RDS behaviors in the probands and family surprisingly we found the DRD2 A1 allele prevalence to be only 3 % [19]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Thousands of studies in peer reviewed scientific journals have revealed significant associations between certain reward genes, with reward circuitry imbalances in the brain and risk for high substance seeking behavior. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>The predictive value for just one gene such as the DA D2 receptor gene is as high as 74.4 % as described by Blum et al. [12]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="545" pm="."><plain>Reynolds et al. [169] correctly suggest that specific genes for neurotransmitter receptors and transporters have provided strong candidates in pharmacogenetic research in psychiatry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="546" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there are many inconsistencies between candidate gene and GWAS studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="547" pm="."><plain>Reynolds further suggests that consistencies have accumulated through candidate gene studies involving the dopamine D2 receptor; serotonin transporter; and GABA dysfunction in mental illness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="548" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Han et al. [170] reported that following GWAS, functional enrichment analysis revealed specific genes to underlie alcohol risk such as cation transport, synaptic transmission, and transmission of nerve impulses representing meaningful biological processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="549" pm="."><plain>In agreement, Uhl et al. [171] suggest that following GWAS, clusters of SNPs within selected genes display 10(−2) &gt; P &gt; 10 (−8) associations with dependence in many independent studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="550" pm="."><plain>Importantly, along these lines, specific candidate genes associated with substance dependence phenotypes, for example, in Native Americans, these include OPRM1, CRN1, COMT, GABA2, MAOA, and HTR3-B [172]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="551" pm="."><plain>In a cross-species GWAS study to access risk genes, in alcoholism, it was found that 47 genes associated including GABA, signaling pathway and cell communication [173]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="552" pm="."><plain>In one study using GWAS and factor analysis, Agrawal et al. [174] found a high loading (0.89) for alcohol craving and convergence resulted in an association of SNPs in DRD3 and craving. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="553" pm="."><plain>While there are many more examples showing promising convergence between GWAS and candidate gene analyses, albeit others showing no convergence, Li et al. [175] performed a meta-analysis of addiction candidate gene association studies and GWAS to investigate functional mechanisms linked to addiction risk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="554" pm="."><plain>When they compared the lists of genes identified by molecular biological studies of drug-related genes and those by association studies, they observed significantly higher participation in the same gene interaction networks than expected by chance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="555" pm="."><plain>This work is underscored by Li’s earlier work, the KARG analysis that evaluated 1,500 human genes regulating addictive behaviors and found that these genes significantly impact glutaminergic and dopaminergic pathways [176]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="556" pm="."><plain>GWAS studies in psychiatry frequently fail to explain a large proportion of variance and non-replication of individual SNPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="557" pm="."><plain>Derringer et al. [177] utilizing a “selective scoring” whereby variants (273 SNPs) from eight dopamine-related genes for association with cocaine dependence were considered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="558" pm="."><plain>They identified a four SNP score significantly associated with the variance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="559" pm="."><plain>They suggested that (1) limiting SNPs to genes of theoretical importance improves the chances of identifying replicable effects (2) utilizing this scoring approach which considers top-associated SNPs in the aggregate can reveal replicable effects that are too small to be identified at the level of individual SNPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="560" pm="."><plain>Along with these precautions we also propose the utilization of “super controls” to eliminate cross contamination of having a control phenotype that also carries the associated disorder especially when considering the complex nature of RDS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="561" pm="."><plain>Also in developing GARS we are cognizant that the proposed test only provides risk stratification and not actual diagnosis of any disorder including RDS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="562" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, full comprehension of “psychiatric pharmacogenomics” will undoubtedly involve epigenetic factors, such as DNA histone modifications, for example, methylation and or acetylation that can affect responses to drugs and polymorphic antecedents for either vulnerability or resilience to reward behaviors like RDS, as well as, GWAS convergence to candidate genes [178–185]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="563" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the utilization of GARS in the clinic has benefits other than just risk stratification, such as, potential therapeutic targets, reduced denial, medical monitoring, for example, in terms of pharmacogenomic tagging [186]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="564" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we are cognizant that certain ethnic groups will have different rates of polymorphic genes as well different rates of gene polymorphic frequencies [187], and we are developing an algorithm to address this issue involving weighting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="565" pm="."><plain>In addition, we are analyzing additional data including a total of 393 subjects derived from 9 treatment centers of which 320 have taken the Addiction Severity Index (ASI). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="566" pm="."><plain>The problem of GWAS is that a general conclusion from GWAS is that most polymorphisms confer little risk increments and explain a small portion of heritability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="567" pm="."><plain>One example is that 40 loci have been associated with human height, with a known heritability of about 80 %, but those total variants explain only 5 % of the phenotypic variance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="568" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that a main problem with GWAS is the need for a level of multiple statistical comparisons that are unprecedented in biology, with stringent analyses to achieve genome-wide significance [186]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="569" pm="."><plain>In fact, Belcher et al. [188] suggest there is clear evidence to support a genetic basis for SUD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="570" pm="."><plain>While these authors consider personality as an appropriate endophenotype, we argue that the real endophenotype is RDS as we suggested in the generational study [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="571" pm="."><plain>Certainly, there are a number of studies showing enhanced relapse with specific polymorphisms such as carriers of the DRD2 A1 allele as only one example [189]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="572" pm="."><plain>Finally, as we pointed out herein, there are fairly recent studies showing GWAS convergence to candidate genes suggesting the continued importance of the candidate approach to identify genetic risk [166–177]. </plain></SENT>
