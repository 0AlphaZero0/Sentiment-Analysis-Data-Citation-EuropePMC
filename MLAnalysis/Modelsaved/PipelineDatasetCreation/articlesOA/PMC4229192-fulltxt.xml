The research reported here is aimed at investigating the aggregating behavior of &#947;-crystallin proteins in various incubation conditions. Thioflavin T binding assay, circular dichroism spectroscopy, 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid fluorescence spectroscopy, intrinsic (tryptophan) fluorescence spectroscopy, light scattering, and electron microscopy were used for structural characterization. Molecular dynamics simulations and bioinformatics prediction were performed to gain insights into the &#947;D-crystallin mechanisms of fibrillogenesis. We first demonstrated that, except at pH 7.0 and 37&#176;C, the aggregation of &#947;D-crystallin was observed to be augmented upon incubation, as revealed by turbidity measurements. Next, the types of aggregates (fibrillar or non-fibrillar aggregates) formed under different incubation conditions were identified. We found that, while a variety of non-fibrillar, granular species were detected in the sample incubated under pH 7.0, the fibrillogenesis of human &#947;D-crystallin could be induced by acidic pH (pH 2.0). In addition, circular dichroism spectroscopy, 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid fluorescence spectroscopy, and intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy were used to characterize the structural and conformational features in different incubation conditions. Our results suggested that incubation under acidic condition led to a considerable change in the secondary structure and an enhancement in solvent-exposure of the hydrophobic regions of human &#947;D-crystallin. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations and bioinformatics prediction were performed to better explain the differences between the structures and/or conformations of the human &#947;D-crystallin samples and to reveal potential key protein region involved in the varied aggregation behavior. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that the initiation of amyloid formation of human &#947;D-crystallin may be associated with a region within the C-terminal domain. We believe the results from this research may contribute to a better understanding of the possible mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of senile nuclear cataract.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the grants from the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (MOST 102-2221-E-002-161 and MOST 103-2221-E-002-208 to SSW, and NSC 101-2113-M-166-001-MY2 and MOST 103-2113-M-166-001-MY2 to JWW).

Protein aggregation arises from a common mechanism whereby the normally folded proteins change conformation and results in partially unfolded intermediates that eventually aggregate by auto assembly to form either amorphous and/or fibril species <xref rid="pone.0112309-Dobson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112309-Fink1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Not only is protein aggregation a major problem in biotechnology products relating to protein expression, purification, and storage <xref rid="pone.0112309-Chennamsetty1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, it is also responsible for more than 40 human protein-deposition diseases that have been well documented to this day <xref rid="pone.0112309-Chiti1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Among these so called protein conformational diseases is cataract, a major cause of visual impairment worldwide. Based on the World Health Organization (2011), cataract makes up 33% of global visual impairment (next to uncorrected refractive errors at 43%) and is the leading cause of blindness in middle and low-income countries <xref rid="pone.0112309-Organization1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>Cataract is the opacification of the eye&#8217;s crystalline lens due to aggregation and precipitation of the crystallin proteins <xref rid="pone.0112309-Shearer1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112309-Santhoshkumar1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In the normal eye, the lens is a transparent refractive structure that serves to focus light onto the retina. It is capable of retaining transparency owing to a high concentration of crystallins that are arranged into short-range order. The absence of cellular organelles in the mature lens fiber cells also helps to minimize light scatter <xref rid="pone.0112309-Oyster1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Additional contribution to lens transparency is provided by the unique structural and functional properties of the crystallins themselves. There are three types of crystallins in the mammalian lens: &#945;-, &#946;-, and &#947;- crystallins. &#945;-Crystallin is a heat shock protein that function as a molecular chaperone to prevent other proteins from aggregating and insolubilizing under stressful conditions <xref rid="pone.0112309-Horwitz1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112309-Meehan1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. To stay true to its chaperone function, the protein has adopted high conformational flexibility and structural disorder to accommodate its interactions with target proteins, which includes the &#946;- and &#947;- crystallins. Both &#946; &amp; &#947;-crystallins belong to the same superfamily and are considered structural proteins that, when maintained in their native globular state and arranged in densely-packed fashion, are responsible for preserving clarity of the crystalline lens. As the eye lens ages, structures of the crystallin proteins begin to change due to a variety of environmental factors, hence disrupting the orderly arrangements of protein packing that kept the lens in its transparent state.</p><p>Several theories on the mechanisms of cataract formation at the molecular level have been put forth. As the lens ages, crystallins are subjected to environmental insults that result in structural modifications or damages, leading to incorrect interactions, unfolding, oligomerization, and aggregation of proteins. Processes that can occur in the aging lens and have detrimental effects on the native structures of lens proteins include photooxidation (by UV radiation), deamidation, disulfide bond formation, and cleavage <xref rid="pone.0112309-Hanson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Oxidative damage is the process whereby reactive oxygen species are coupled with photooxidation and/or conversion of sulfhydryl groups to form half-cystine disulfide groups <xref rid="pone.0112309-Takemoto1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. It has been found to be a major contributor to cataract formation in aged lens in which the level of glutathione is significantly reduced <xref rid="pone.0112309-Truscott1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Another common process that causes damages to the crystallins is deamidation, where negative charge is introduced at the site of glutamine and asparagine causing the proteins to form cataractous aggregates <xref rid="pone.0112309-Hains1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Protease cleavage of crystallins that involves calpains has also been observed to be associated with senile nuclear cataract <xref rid="pone.0112309-Biswas1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The consequence of the above-mentioned mechanisms of cataractogenesis is the disruption of the orderly arrangement within the crystalline fiber cells and the development of opacity in the once transparent lens structure, hence cataract.</p><p>Of the crystallin proteins, &#947;-crystallin has the simplest structure, existing as a monomer of four Greek key motifs rich in anti-parallel &#946;-sheets. The molecular weight of the protein is approximately 20 kDa (173 amino acids), with a fold akin to many immunoglobulins <xref rid="pone.0112309-Crabbe1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112309-KosinskiCollins1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Human gamma D-crystallin (H&#947;D-crys) is the third most commonly expressed &#947;-crystallin in the human lens <xref rid="pone.0112309-Horwitz1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. It is highly stable at neutral pH, but like many proteins, can form aggregation under certain conditions. Although the main form of aggregates found in the cataractous lens is of the amorphous type, H&#947;D-crys has recently been observed to form amyloid fibrils as well. <italic>In</italic>
<italic>vitro</italic> aggregation of H&#947;D-crys has been noted in guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) under physiological temperature and pH <xref rid="pone.0112309-KosinskiCollins1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, as well as under acidic pH <xref rid="pone.0112309-Papanikolopoulou1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Low pH condition, without the presence of denaturant, leads to partially or fully unfolded species that form amyloid fibrils. These fibril aggregates have previously been characterized by various biophysical methods (e.g., Congo red, FTIR, X-ray diffraction, TEM, and 2D-IR) <xref rid="pone.0112309-Meehan1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112309-Papanikolopoulou1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112309-Moran1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In any case, both full protein and (to a lesser extent) isolated C-terminal and N-terminal domains of H&#947;D-crys are capable of forming amyloid fibrils under acidic pH condition <xref rid="pone.0112309-Papanikolopoulou1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The above-mentioned findings are proofs of concept demonstrating that despite high structural stability, H&#947;D-crys (like many other proteins) also has the potential to reorganize and form amyloid structure in destabilizing conditions. Therefore, it has been suggested that this pathway may be an additional process contributing to the development of cataract with aging <xref rid="pone.0112309-Meehan1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Of the various hypotheses that have been proposed on the mechanisms behind the development of age-related cataract, one that has not been fully explored is the possibility of low pH-induced cataract. Currently, two views exist in regards to acidic pH and cataractogenesis. One involves the possibility of partially degraded H&#947;D-crys forming fibrillar aggregates in the low pH environment of lysozomal compartment during lens fiber cell differentiation, which may be involved in the early stages of cataract formation <xref rid="pone.0112309-Papanikolopoulou1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Another hypothesis has to do with the decreased pH in the lens nucleus overtime leading to loss of &#945;-crystallin chaperone capability to protect H&#947;D-crys from aggregation, thus resulting in senile nuclear cataract formation <xref rid="pone.0112309-Eckert1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112309-Poon1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Regardless of the mechanisms of cataract formation, the only accepted form of treatment currently available is the surgical removal of the opaque lens and replacement with an artificial lens. However, such procedure is not without risks of complications and is often inaccessible in low and middle-income countries. Therefore, in order to seek for other potential therapeutic strategies to treating cataract, a more thorough understanding of the crystallin aggregation process leading to cataractogenesis is imperative.</p><p>The current study is aimed at a more extensive investigation into H&#947;D-crys aggregation in neutral and low pH. We first demonstrated that, except at physiological condition of pH 7.0 and 37&#176;C, the aggregation of H&#947;D-crys was observed to be augmented upon incubation, as revealed by turbidity measurements. Next, the types of aggregates (fibrillar or non-fibrillar aggregates) formed under different incubation conditions were identified using ThT fluorescence spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We found that H&#947;D-crys can be induced to form amyloid fibrillar species at acidic pH but not neutral pH. In addition, a number of spectroscopic techniques including far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid (ANS) fluorescence spectroscopy, and intrinsic or tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy, were used to characterize the structural and conformational features in different incubation conditions. Finally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to gain some insights into the molecular mechanism of the initial stage in the process of H&#947;D-crys fibril formation. Not only does our work compare H&#947;D-crys aggregation under different pH and temperature conditions, it is also the first to fully characterize its fibrillogenesis under low pH setting and brings all past studies of its kind into perspective.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Materials</title><p>Salts, tryptone, yeast extract, and chromatography columns were purchased from Sigma (USA).

<xref rid="pone.0112309-Sandilands1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. Using the wild-type bovine &#945;-, &#946;-, and &#947;-crystallins as the models, Meehan and coworkers experimentally examined the in vitro fibrillogenic/aggregative properties of these proteins upon exposure to denaturing/destabilizing conditions. They observed that the full-length bovine &#945;- and &#946;-crystallins assembled to form amyloid fibrils, whereas fibrils derived from bovine &#947;-crystallin proteins were composed of both full-length and fragmented bovine &#947;-crystallin proteins <xref rid="pone.0112309-Meehan1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In addition, it has been shown that mutant crystallin protein has a higher propensity for amyloid fibril formation than its wild-type counterpart <xref rid="pone.0112309-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. Further experimental evidence originating from recent studies using individual &#947;-crystallins and/or their subunits has demonstrated that H&#947;D-crys and human &#947;C-crystallin (H&#947;C-crys) are prone to fibrillate in the acidic environment <xref rid="pone.0112309-Papanikolopoulou1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.

<italic>vitro</italic> may imply a potential role in the pathogenesis of cataract.</p><p>Based on one theory, amyloid fibril formation of H&#947;D-crys under acidic pH is highly relevant to the low pH lysosomal compartment of differentiating lens fiber cells where damaged H&#947;D-crys are degraded <xref rid="pone.0112309-Papanikolopoulou1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Under such condition, the damaged proteins, which may have the potential of being amyloidogenic partially-unfolded intermediates, can serve as nucleating centers for fibril formation. This phenomenon has also been described for other proteins such as transtherytin <xref rid="pone.0112309-Colon1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. Thus, the process initiates the early stages of cataract by disrupting the fiber cell organization causing light scatter and image degradation at the retina. It may take decades for this process to begin and develop into cataract on the macroscopic scale, thus in order to achieve a more thorough understanding of how H&#947;D-crys behaves under the different aggregated states relevant to cataractogenesis, pH 2 was chosen as the setting to procure the fibril form of aggregation. Although the physiological pH within the cell (even within the lysosomal compartment) does not go as low as pH 2, this pH was chosen because we found it to be the optimal pH condition that will promote fibrillogenesis of H&#947;D-crys, thus allowing for a full comparison with the aggregation behavior under physiological pH. After testing out various pH settings (data not shown), we found that pH 2 procures the most favorable condition for amyloidogenesis of H&#947;D-crys; thus, providing the basis for our subsequent experiments.</p><p>H&#947;D-crys with 6&#215;His tag was purified and used in this study. Although there may be a concern that the fusion partner may interfere with the outcome of the experiments performed, it was previously reported that the presence of 6&#215;His tag on recombinant H&#947;D-crys neither affect the expression of the protein itself nor the ability of the protein to fold into the native state during the purification process. Moreover, analyses using fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopies revealed almost no difference in the structures between H&#947;D-crys with and without 6&#215;His tags <xref rid="pone.0112309-KosinskiCollins2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. We also conducted experiments, in which the N-terminal 6&#215;His tag was first removed using dipeptidyl aminopeptidase I (DAPase-I), the enzyme that was reportedly utilized to cleave His-tag from recombinant proteins <xref rid="pone.0112309-Block1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112309-Kingsbury1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref> The untagged H&#947;D-crys was then purified. The structural features of the resulting untagged H&#947;D-crys and its 6&#215;His-tagged counterpart were further compared. Our results showed that both the His-tagged and untagged H&#947;D-crys gave almost identical CD spectra (data not shown) and intrinsic fluorescence spectra (data not shown), suggesting that the inclusion of 6&#215;His tag has negligible influence on the secondary and tertiary structures of H&#947;D-crys <xref rid="pone.0112309-Wen1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, which further supports the previous report.</p><p>Due to the highly stable nature of the Greek key motifs in H&#947;D-crys, it may take a long time for the protein to form aggregation if left alone under physiological condition (pH 7.0 and 37&#176;C). Therefore, in order to better understand and compare the differences in aggregation behaviors of H&#947;D-crys under varied pH in a reasonable time frame, we sped up the process by thermally inducing aggregation at the temperature of 55&#176;C. Although we could have arbitrarily picked any temperature that is higher than the physiological 37&#176;C for our comparison, we settled on 55&#176;C because this was the temperature that allows the extent of aggregation in H&#947;D-crys under both pH conditions to reach similar states within the 2-day time period tested (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112309-g001">Figure 1</xref>), thus enabling us to perform a thorough comparison of the effects of varied environment on the structural changes/aggregation behavior of H&#947;D-crys protein. As seen in our TEM results, elevating the incubation temperature did not alter the aggregation pathways that the proteins were predestined for in the different pH settings. Under neutral pH, H&#947;D-crys forms granular aggregates of various sizes ranging from &#8764;25&#8211;50 nm with hydrophobic sites buried within the tightly packed protein structures. Based on our turbidity measurements, the aggregation process is slower under neutral environment than acidic environment, again signifying the inherent stability of the native H&#947;D-crys conformation in physiological pH. Whereas H&#947;D-crys aggregation is of the amorphous kind in neutral pH, low pH induced amyloidosis with partially unfolded structure of increased solvent-exposed hydrophobic regions. This is reminiscent of the H&#947;D-crys fibrous aggregates induced by guanidinium hydrochloride <xref rid="pone.0112309-KosinskiCollins1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>It is known that the bulk of protein material removed from cataractus lens is in the form of amorphous aggregates <xref rid="pone.0112309-AlGhoul1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112309-Gilliland1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>. This may not come as a surprise when one considers that the lowest pH of 6.5 detected in the nucleus <xref rid="pone.0112309-Eckert1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112309-AlGhoul1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref> is not too different from the neutral pH of 7.0 explored by our study, which also induces amorphous aggregation in H&#947;D-crys. While our experimental condition is an over simplified model of what&#8217;s going on in the lens, it is undeniable that the inherent aggregation property of H&#947;D-crys under neutral pH is of the amorphous kind. However, as previously mentioned, fibrils that may form in the lysozomal compartments of lens cortex during lens cell development and maturation may eventually move into the lens nucleus if they are not completely degraded before the lens cells mature and become devoid of their intracellular organelles. It is possible that remnants of these fibrils in the cells become precursors that provide the seeds to initiate the formation of amorphous aggregates under close to neutral pH of the lens nucleus. As the line dividing amorphous and fibrous aggregation is a thin one <xref rid="pone.0112309-Rousseau1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>, the possibility is there that one form may trigger the mass production of another when the condition is right.</p><p>It was found previously that, in certain cases, global structural unfolding is unnecessary for the initiation of protein aggregation <xref rid="pone.0112309-Brubaker1" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0112309-Sahin1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>. Simply altering the environment, thus changing the solvent exposure of certain aggregation-prone regions in the native protein, is enough to allow protein-protein interactions to commence leading to massive aggregation formation <xref rid="pone.0112309-Chiti1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112309-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. Thus, localized regions can serve as nucleation sites for &#946;-amyloid formation in near native proteins. Although the Greek key motifs in H&#947;D-crys are predominantly &#946;-structures, we hypothesize that a possible reorganization of localized region(s) leads to the formation of exposed &#946;-structures capable of initiating aggregation. This is consistent with the findings of a recent study that examined the structure of acid-induced H&#947;D-crys amyloid fibrils by two-dimensional (2D) IR spectroscopy. The results from the study showed that nucleation and extension of fibrils were mainly contributed by part of the protein&#8217;s Ctd <xref rid="pone.0112309-Moran1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. According to the structural model suggested by Moran <italic>et.al</italic>. (2012), each protein molecule provides two &#946;-strands from the Ctd to form &#946;-sheets of the amyloid fibril core, while rest of the protein&#8217;s secondary structure assumes a disordered state of loops and coil. As the main structural fold of H&#947;D-crys is in the form of four homologous Greek-key motifs comprised of antiparallel &#946;-sheets, the native conformation is already dominated by &#946;-structures. Therefore, in the process of amyloid fibrillogenesis, localized structural reorganization may require majority of the native &#946;-sheets to unfold and allow certain regions to reform into &#946;-sheets characteristics of amyloid fibrils, as suggested by the IR spectroscopy study. This is also consistent with our far-UV CD results showing an overall decrease in &#946;-structures and increase in unordered structure in the process of H&#947;D-crys fibril formation.</p><p>Despite the fact that previous 2D IR spectroscopy study has revealed that Ctd forms &#946;-sheets of the acid-induced H&#947;D-crys fibril, specific region(s) within the domain involved in the fibril formation is still unknown. We, therefore, performed bioinformatic prediction and MD simulations to give us further insights into this matter. From the results obtained through our computational approaches, we speculate that a region in Ctd motif 4 corresponding to residues 153&#8722;160, which forms anti-parallel &#946;-strands during our simulation under low pH setting, may play an important role in the initiation of amyloid fibril formation. Further analysis is warranted to understand how it contributes to the mechanism of acid-induced H&#947;D-crys fibrillogenesis and its implication in the formation of age-related nuclear cataract.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0112309.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
