P-selectin expression in the presence of adenosine 0.5, 1 and 2 mmol/L was inhibited from 32&#177;4 to 27&#177;2 (p&lt;0.05), 14&#177;3 (p&lt;0.01) and 9&#177;3% (p&lt;0.001), respectively. At the concentrations tested, only inosine to 4 mmol/L had effect on platelet P-selectin expression (p&lt;0.05). Adenosine and inosine inhibited platelet aggregation and ATP release stimulated by ADP and collagen. Adenosine and inosine reduced collagen-induced platelet adhesion and aggregate formation under flow. At the same concentrations adenosine inhibited platelet aggregation, decreased the levels of sCD40L and increased intraplatelet cAMP. In addition, SQ22536 (an adenylate cyclase inhibitor) and ZM241385 (a potent adenosine receptor A<sub>2A</sub> antagonist) attenuated the effect of adenosine on platelet aggregation induced by ADP and intraplatelet level of cAMP. Adenosine and inosine significantly inhibited thrombosis formation <italic>in vivo</italic> (62&#177;2% occlusion at 60 min [n&#8202;=&#8202;6, p&lt;0.01] and 72&#177;1.9% occlusion at 60 min, [n&#8202;=&#8202;6, p&lt;0.05], respectively) compared with the control (98&#177;2% occlusion at 60 min, n&#8202;=&#8202;6). A<sub>2A</sub> is the adenosine receptor present in platelets; it is known that inosine is not an A<sub>2A</sub> ligand. Docking of adenosine and inosine inside A<sub>2A</sub> showed that the main difference is the formation by adenosine of an additional hydrogen bond between the NH<sub>2</sub> of the adenine group and the residues Asn253 in H6 and Glu169 in EL2 of the A<sub>2A</sub> receptor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Therefore, adenosine and inosine may represent novel agents lowering the risk of arterial thrombosis.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the CONICYT REGIONAL / GORE MAULE / CEAP / R09I2001, Interdisciplinary Excellence Research Program on Healthy Aging (PIEI-ES), and supported by grant no. 1130216 (I.

For murine model we used the same mice species (C57BL/6) and gender (male) for both in control and experimental groups. Briefly, mice (12&#8211;16 weeks old) were anesthetized with a combination of tribromoethanol (270 mg/kg) and xylazine (13 mg/kg), before anesthetizing the animals; the mice were carefully handled to minimize stress and quickly anesthetized. Twenty-four hours prior to surgery, systolic blood pressure was measured using a noninvasive blood pressure meter (BP-98A, Softron Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) in awake mice and during thrombosis. Throughout the procedure, animals were kept on a heating pad maintained at 37&#176;C. After the administration of anesthesia, the mice were placed in the supine position and the mesentery was exposed by central incision in the abdomen, permitting visualization of thrombus development in mesenteric artery. The mice were injected with rose bengal through tail vein injection in a volume of 0.1 mL at a concentration of 50 mg/kg.

Two recent observations may explain these findings showing that intraplatelet cAMP levels downregulate P2Y1R expression <xref rid="pone.0112741-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> and contribute to maintaining GPVI in a monomeric form on resting platelets <xref rid="pone.0112741-Loyau1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>.

We can see that Asn253 is conserved in all the adenosine receptors. However, the FED motif in adenosine receptor A2A that contains Glu169 is different in other adenosine receptors. The FED motif is optimal for including adenine, but not optimal for including hypoxanthine. The phenylalanine forms the pi-pi stacking with the purine ring, glutamate forms the HB interaction with NH<sub>2</sub> of adenine, and aspartate is at the entrance of the pocket (it could be involved in the attraction of the ligand). The phenylalanine is conserved in all the adenosine receptors. However, the glutamate is not conserved in the A<sub>3</sub> receptor. Since there is no glutamate in the A<sub>3</sub> receptor, the negative density of the carbonyl oxygens in the hypoxanthine does not perceive a negative charge that prevents its binding. On the other hand, the aspartate at the entrance is mutated by asparagine in the A<sub>2B</sub> receptor (a neutral amino acid), and by a lysine in the A<sub>1</sub> receptor (positively charged amino acid). The lysine could contribute to the attraction of the hypoxanthine ring (due to the negative density of hypoxanthine). Summarizing, the changes in FED motif in A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>3</sub> receptors could explain why inosine is at least a weak agonist for these receptors, but there is no evidence that A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>3</sub> receptors are in platelets.</p><p>Platelet aggregation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of arterial thrombosis <xref rid="pone.0112741-Barrett1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>.
