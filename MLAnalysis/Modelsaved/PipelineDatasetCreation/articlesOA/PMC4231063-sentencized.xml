<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>At the concentrations tested, only inosine to 4 mmol/L had effect on platelet P-selectin expression (p&lt;0.05). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>At the same concentrations adenosine inhibited platelet aggregation, decreased the levels of sCD40L and increased intraplatelet cAMP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In addition, SQ22536 (an adenylate cyclase inhibitor) and ZM241385 (a potent adenosine receptor A2A antagonist) attenuated the effect of adenosine on platelet aggregation induced by ADP and intraplatelet level of cAMP. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (i.e., acute myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease and peripheral arterial thrombosis) have increased significantly in recent years [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The major and independent risk factors for CVD are cigarette smoking, elevated blood pressure, elevated serum total cholesterol and diabetes, among others [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Platelet hyper-aggregability is associated with risk factors for CVD [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Thus platelets from patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes exhibit enhanced platelet aggregation activity early [6], [7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Platelet accumulation at vascular injury sites is the primary event in arterial thrombosis and its activation is a critical component of atherothrombosis [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Patients with unstable complex lesions had a fivefold higher expression of platelet activation than patients with stable angina, indicating an intense thrombogenic potential [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Also platelets could be directly involved in the unstable plaque through the production and release of pro-inflammatory molecules, including a variety of cytokines, such as TGF-β, IL-1β and sCD40L, among others [10], [11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Antiplatelet therapy has been used for a long time in an effort to prevent, as well as to treat, thrombotic diseases [12]–[14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The multiple pathways of platelet activation limit the effect of specific receptor/pathway inhibitors, resulting in limited clinical efficacy [15], [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In this way, the best-known inhibitor and turn off signaling in platelet activation is cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) [17], [18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Adenosine is a key endogenous molecule that regulates tissue function by activating four G-protein-coupled adenosine receptors: A1, A2A, A2B and A3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Both A2 adenosine receptors, A2A and A2B, are coupled to Gs, leading to stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and consequent elevation of cAMP [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Adenosine is also recognized as one of the most important endogenous molecules able to prevent tissue injury in ischemia-reperfusion [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Inosine is another endogenous purine nucleoside, which is formed during the breakdown of adenosine by adenosine deaminase [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Inosine potently inhibited the production of the proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-12) and its effect was partially reversed by blockade of adenosine A1 and A2 receptors [22]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Given the high structural similitude between adenosine and inosine, the main aim of this work was to investigate the relative contribution of these two molecules on platelet activation and thrombus formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we performed docking experiments on the adenosine receptor A2A in order to explain their differential biological effects at a molecular level. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have demonstrated that adenosine and inosine display in vitro and in vivo antiplatelet activities and reduce platelet release of atherosclerotic-related inflammatory mediator (sCD40L). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>This inhibitory effect of adenosine and inosine was demonstrated with the use of different agonists (ADP and collagen) and this inhibition was directly proportional to the concentrations used. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Adenosine is a natural product and endogenous nucleoside with antiplatelet activity [34]–[36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Adenosine through G-protein linked receptors activate adenylate cyclase and increase cellular cAMP levels, showing inhibition of platelet function [37], [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Studies have established that the inhibitory effect of adenosine on platelet aggregation disappears after the addition of adenosine-deaminase [39], [40], and converts the purine nucleoside into inosine [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>However, our results show that inosine possesses antiplatelet activity in vitro by significantly inhibiting platelet function (activation, secretion, aggregation and adhesion), releasing sCD40L and for the first time we have demonstrated prevention of thrombus growth in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>In addition, another study has established that inosine markedly inhibited platelet activation in vitro and in vivo, as well as cerebral ischemia [42]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Platelet-derived P-selectin seems to contribute to atherosclerotic lesion development and arterial thrombogenesis by forming large stable platelet-leukocyte aggregates [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Our results show that adenosine and inosine inhibited P-selectin expression on human platelets induced by ADP/collagen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>In this sense, adenosine and inosine could inhibit platelet-leukocyte conjugate formation [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that the increase of cAMP levels regulates P-selectin expression via activation of PKA [38], [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>In fact, we have recently demonstrated that an increase in intraplatelet cAMP by adenosine markedly increases the phosphorylation of PKA in human platelets [46]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>When platelets adhere to collagen, a ligand-binding–induced signal is generated, leading to platelet spreading that render adherent platelets resistant to shear forces at the site of vascular damage [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we found that under conditions of arterial shear, adenosine and inosine significantly reduced platelet adhesion and aggregation to collagen as compared with the negative control. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>In the last decade several lines of evidence have supported the notion that the secretion of platelet pro-inflammatory molecules (sCD40L, RANTES, sP-selectin, among others) plays a pathogenic role in both the onset and progression of the atherosclerotic process as well as in thrombotic occlusion of the vessels [48], [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Platelets interact with monocytes via a CD40-CD40L-mediated pathway that causes their adherence to the inflamed endothelial layer [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Thus, high levels of sCD40L have been associated with platelet activation, suggesting a prognostic marker in patients with advanced atherosclerosis [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates for the first time that adenosine and inosine, among its antiplatelet activities, decreases the inflammatory component of activated platelets, by reducing the release of sCD40L. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>In this study, ZM241385 (adenosine receptor A2A antagonist) and SQ22536 (adenylyl cyclase inhibitor) were able to attenuate the effect of adenosine on ADP-induced platelet aggregation, but failed to affect the platelet aggregation induced by ADP [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that inhibition of platelet aggregation by adenosine is mediated by the stimulation of adenosine receptor A2A/adenylate cyclase with increased intraplatelet cAMP concentrations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Adenosine increased cAMP levels and significantly inhibited platelet aggregation stimulated by ADP and collagen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Two recent observations may explain these findings showing that intraplatelet cAMP levels downregulate P2Y1R expression [53] and contribute to maintaining GPVI in a monomeric form on resting platelets [54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Thus, adenosine through elevation of cAMP suppresses the sCD40L release due to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase inhibition [46], [55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>However, ZM241385 and SQ22536 were not able to attenuate the effect of inosine on ADP-induced platelet aggregation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Thus inosine by intraplatelet signaling pathways inhibits platelet function (phospholipase C activation rather than PKC) [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>In this sense, different mechanisms may underlie the antiplatelet activity of adenosine and inosine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>In fact, different biological functions of both nucleosides have also been demonstrated [56]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Previously, it has been suggested that adenosine is a natural ligand for the four receptors of the family (A1, A2A, A2B and A3), while inosine is only a weak agonist for the A1 and A3 adenosine receptors [57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>In addition, A2A and A2B receptors are naturally expressed in platelets [58], [59]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>The adenosine receptor A2A has a structure consisting of seven transmembrane helices (H1–H7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>The binding modes of adenosine and other adenosine receptor A2A agonists have been reported recently [60]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>Despite the high structural similitude and antiplatelet activity between adenosine and inosine, the latter is ineffective at adenosine receptor A2A [60]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>We performed docking experiments in order to explain this paradigm at a molecular level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>The main difference is that adenosine forms an additional HB between the NH2 of the adenine group and the residues Asn253 in H6 and Glu169 in EL2 of the adenosine receptor A2A, whereas the hypoxanthine group of inosine cannot create these interactions, therefore losing its activity on the receptor and without an effect on cAMP levels. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>In Figure 6 we have also included the alignment of the adenosine receptor A2A sequence motifs that include the A2AR residues Glu169 and Asn253 to explain why inosine is not an adenosine receptor A2A ligand, but it is at least a weak agonist for A1 and A3 adenosine receptors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>We can see that Asn253 is conserved in all the adenosine receptors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>However, the FED motif in adenosine receptor A2A that contains Glu169 is different in other adenosine receptors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>The FED motif is optimal for including adenine, but not optimal for including hypoxanthine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>The phenylalanine forms the pi-pi stacking with the purine ring, glutamate forms the HB interaction with NH2 of adenine, and aspartate is at the entrance of the pocket (it could be involved in the attraction of the ligand). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>The phenylalanine is conserved in all the adenosine receptors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>However, the glutamate is not conserved in the A3 receptor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Since there is no glutamate in the A3 receptor, the negative density of the carbonyl oxygens in the hypoxanthine does not perceive a negative charge that prevents its binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the aspartate at the entrance is mutated by asparagine in the A2B receptor (a neutral amino acid), and by a lysine in the A1 receptor (positively charged amino acid). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>The lysine could contribute to the attraction of the hypoxanthine ring (due to the negative density of hypoxanthine). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>Summarizing, the changes in FED motif in A1 and A3 receptors could explain why inosine is at least a weak agonist for these receptors, but there is no evidence that A1 and A3 receptors are in platelets. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>Platelet aggregation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of arterial thrombosis [61]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>Therefore, inhibition of platelet aggregation by drugs has been used extensively for the prevention of thromboembolic events especially in patients with acute coronary syndromes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>In this study, using a murine model of real-time thrombus formation [62], we demonstrated that adenosine and inosine significantly reduced thrombus growth in vivo although to a lesser extent than the effect observed with aspirin. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>Our data supports the notion that the mechanisms underlying antiplatelet activity resulting from the interaction adenosine-adenosine receptor A2A seem to be related to a substantial increase in platelet cAMP levels with inhibition of P-selectin expression, sCD40L release and downregulated downstream signaling pathways of ADP and collagen receptors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, although inosine does not seem to interact with platelet receptors it was capable of significantly inhibiting platelet adhesion and aggregation under flow and thrombus growth in vivo. </plain></SENT>
