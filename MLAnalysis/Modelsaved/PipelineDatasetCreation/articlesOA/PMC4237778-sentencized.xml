</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rapid molecular typing of bacterial pathogens is critical for public health epidemiology, surveillance and infection control [1,2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two key goals of such activities are: (1) to detect the presence of genes linked to clinically relevant phenotypes - including virulence genes, antimicrobial resistance genes or serotype determinants; and (2) to classify isolates into clonal groups, via multi-locus sequence typing (MLST [3]) or detection of clone-specific or other epidemiological markers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Whole genome sequencing (WGS) or ‘genomic epidemiology’ is increasingly being adopted for these tasks and has the potential to replace current techniques which are mainly based on PCR and/or restriction enzyme digestion coupled with sequencing or size separation via electrophoresis [1,4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>WGS is particularly attractive as: (1) it can be applied simultaneously to large numbers of bacterial isolates of any species with no need for organism- or target-specific reagents; and (2) the resulting data are readily shareable, can be compared easily with past and future data sets, and are informative for both routine surveillance (monitoring genes and clones) and detailed outbreak investigation (genome-wide phylogenies for transmission analysis) [2,4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>WGS has revolutionised pathogen research, and its potential to revolutionise the practice of public health epidemiology, surveillance and infection control has been recognised for some time [4-10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Despite the enthusiasm and several demonstration studies [11-16], the routine use of WGS poses significant challenges for public health and diagnostic laboratories, foremost of which is a lack of solutions for the rapid and reproducible extraction of informative, interpretable and shareable data from raw sequence data [1,17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Currently available methods rely on assembling short reads into longer contiguous sequences (contigs), which can be interrogated using BLAST or other search algorithms to identify genes or alleles of interest (for example, ARG-Annot [18]; ResFinder, PlasmidFinder and MLST typer [19-21]; BIGSdb [22,23]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The reliance on assembly introduces efficiency and sensitivity problems due to the data, time and computational requirements for generating high quality assemblies of bacterial genomes from short reads. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>There are several assemblers (for example, Velvet [24], SPAdes [25]) that can produce a bacterial genome assembly in minutes to hours with a few gigabytes of memory. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, the production of high quality assemblies with these tools requires quality filtering and other preprocessing of reads as well as optimisation of kmer length and other parameters which in practice requires several alternative assemblies to be generated and compared [26,27], thus multiplying by an order of magnitude the amount of computational time and memory required to produce each genome prior to typing analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Further, the quality of even highly optimised assemblies remains highly variable, even for closely related genomes sequenced together in multiplex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Hence assembly-based analyses of genomes sequenced with short-read technology are very difficult to standardise and quality control, which is important to ensure robust, reliable and reproducible assays for use in public health and infection control. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a new tool for genomic epidemiology, SRST2, which performs fast and accurate detection of genes and alleles direct from WGS short sequencing reads. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>SRST2 can type reads using any sequence database(s) and can calculate combinatorial sequence types defined in MLST-style databases [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate its utility for routine molecular typing in public health and hospital laboratories via automated MLST and typing of virulence, antimicrobial resistance and plasmid genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>SRST2 is named after our earlier tool SRST (Short Read Sequencing Typing) which performed MLST on short reads [28], however the SRST2 code is entirely novel and uses different read mapping, scoring and reporting algorithms to SRST, is more stable and robust, and is designed for gene detection and allele typing as well as MLST. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="Sec2"><title><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Implementation </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Given a read set and database of reference allele sequences, SRST2 is designed to perform two key tasks: (1) detect the presence of a gene or locus; and (2) determine the precise or closest matching allele for that locus, among a set of possible reference allele sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The approach is illustrated in Figure 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>A database of reference sequences must be provided in fasta format, in which the fasta headers indicate both the locus (so that alleles of the same locus can be compared) and a unique name for each allele. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In the case of MLST data an additional database of ST profiles is provided as tab-delimited text, which assigns STs to unique combinations of alleles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Current MLST data (allele sequences and profile definitions) can be downloaded from pubmlst.org automatically using the getmlst.py script supplied with SRST2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>For most MLST schemes, these files are compatible with SRST2 and can be used without modification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Improperly formatted databases, or other private sequence databases, can be easily formatted for use with SRST2 using the scripts supplied with the program. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Any number of sequence databases can be analysed in a single run, allowing for simultaneous typing of MLST, resistance genes and virulence genes.Figure 1Summary of SRST2 approach. Inputs are reads (fastq format) and one or more databases of reference allele sequences for typing (fasta format). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Reads are aligned to all reference sequences (using bowtie2) and each alignment processed (using SAMtools). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>At each position in each alignment, the number of matching and mismatching bases is determined and a binomial test is performed to assess the evidence against the reference allele; resulting in a set of P values for each reference allele sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>To determine which of all known reference alleles is most likely present at a given locus, the P value distributions for known alleles are compared as described in the text. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Briefly, for each allele the P values expected if the reads were derived from the reference allele in the presence of a given level of sequencing error (set to 1% of bases by default) are regressed on those actually observed, similar to a Q-Q plot; the slope of the fitted line, which increases with the strength of evidence against the reference allele, is calculated and taken as the score for that allele. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The scores file (optional output) contains the scores for each allele at each locus, along with additional information about the alignments for each allele including percent coverage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>For each locus, the allele with the lowest score is accepted as the closest matching allele (small arrows) and reported in the output table. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>In MLST mode, sequence type (ST) definitions are provided as input and used by SRST2 to calculate STs for each read set. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>For each input database, reads are aligned using bowtie2 [29] v2.1.0 or above with the ‘--very-sensitive-local’ and ‘-a’ settings, and all alignments are reported to a file in SAM format. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Mapping sensitivity can be fine-tuned by specifying to SRST2 any of the parameters available within the bowtie2-align command or a maximum number of mismatches per read (default 10 mismatches allowed). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Flags in the resulting SAM file are modified so that each read is included in the pileup for every allele to which it is aligned. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Pileups are generated using SAMtools v0.1.18 [30] mpileup and parsed by SRST2 to determine percent coverage, divergence, and mismatches as well as to calculate a score for each possible allele. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Allele scoring </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>An overview of the scoring approach is given in Figure 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>We begin with an alignment of reads from sample s to a reference sequence r. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>At each position i in the reference sequence r (ri), let si be the set of reads in sample s that align to ri. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Let ai be the total number of reads in si, and let bi be the number of reads in si in which the aligned base does not match the reference base at ri. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>If sample s contains the precise sequence r, then the probability of a mismatched base at any position in an aligned read is equal to the per-base error rate of the sequencing technology ei, which for Illumina is taken to be 0.01, although this can vary depending on what preprocessing steps are implemented [31,32]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>To quantify the evidence against the presence of the reference sequence r in s, we perform a Binomial test at each position ri, to generate a one-sided P value Pi to assess the probability of observing ai-bi successes in ai trials, with a probability of success of 1-ei. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Any change at position ri - including a base substitution, an insertion of any size or a deleted base - is treated as a mismatch, incrementing bi by 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>For large deletions that result in an absence of any aligned reads (including truncations of the end of the sequence), ai = 0 and no binomial test is possible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>In this case, the evidence for the deletion is provided by the reads which align adjacent to the deletion but do not align across the deletion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Hence we calculate the average number of reads aligned to the two bases preceding the deletion, di, and conduct the binomial test with ai = bi = di. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>We then utilise a non-parametric approach to score each allele by considering the set of all P values calculated for reference sequence r. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>First, to minimise artefacts associated with fluctuation in read depths, we (a) set Pi = 1 where bi = 0, and weight Pi by the relative read depth (that is, weight of evidence) at position ri compared to those of other positions in r:\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document} $$ \mathrm{weighted}{P}_i\left({P}_{i,w}\right) = {P}_i*\ \left({a}_i/{r}_{max\ depth}\right) $$ \end{document}weightedPiPi,w=Pi*ai/rmaxdepth </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>We then compare the sorted -log10(Pi) values versus those of the theoretical distribution of -log10(xj/n) where n = length(r) and xj= 1,2,…n, analogous to a quantile-quantile (QQ) plot (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>A linear model is fitted to the two probability distributions and the resulting slope is taken as the score for reference sequence r, scorer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Here we leverage a common criticism of linear models to our advantage: the susceptibility to outliers at the tails of the distribution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>In this case, outliers are typically SNPs or indels relative to the sequence r which, because they result in low P values in the binomial test and thus very high values of -log10(P), are at the end of the observed distribution (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Thus when a linear model is fitted, its slope increases with the number of well-supported SNPs and indels compared to the reference. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>As a result, among reference alleles of the same locus, the sequence r with the lowest scorer (flattest slope in the QQ plot) is the most likely match for sample s. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title><text><SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Reporting outputs </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>For each sample s and each locus or gene cluster, SRST2 output tables report the lowest scoring allele sequence r, the average read depth of s across r and indicators of any evidence against a precise match with r (including mismatches supported by &gt;50% of aligned reads, or read depth falling below a cutoff). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Only matches passing the user-set coverage and divergence cutoffs (by default, &gt;90% coverage and &lt;10% divergence) are reported. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>For MLST data, STs are calculated according to the MLST profiles database provided, based on the closest matching alleles at each locus. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Normally, an exact match between r and s would be assigned if (a) r has the lowest scorer among the set of alleles of the same locus or gene cluster, and (b) there are no SNPs or indels between r and s. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>If (a) holds but (b) does not, this is indicative of a novel allele and SRST2 will flag the result in output tables. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>In such cases, we recommend that users who are interested in defining novel alleles should inspect the raw sequence data (which may be assisted by the alignments, pileups and consensus fastq files generated by SRST2). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Optionally, SRST2 can report the full details of scoring s against all reference sequences r, to enable users to parse and interpret the results to suit specific needs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>These include average depth of s across r, average depth across the first and last two bases of r, the number of positions in r in which the majority of aligned reads in s show a mismatch against r (with SNPs, insertion/deletions and truncations reported separately), the depth of bases neighbouring truncations and, for the position with the greatest proportion of mismatching reads, the total aligned reads, total mismatching, proportion mismatching, and binomial P value. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title><text><SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Major differences between SRST and SRST2 </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>SRST2 is new code and takes an entirely different approach to read mapping, scoring alignments and reporting results than SRST [28], which was designed solely for MLST and is unsuitable for detection of acquired genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>In SRST, bwa was used for global alignment of reads to MLST loci and their flanking sequences; in SRST2, bowtie2 is used for local alignment of reads to any locus, without need for flanking sequences, allowing detection of acquired genes as well as MLST. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>SRST scores were calculated in an entirely different way and were not designed to take into account deletions/truncations or the relative weight of evidence provided by each position in the alignment (differences in read depth). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>SRST2 allows finer control of mapping and scoring parameters and provides more detailed reports than SRST. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>SRST2 is also faster (2 to 5×) and slightly more reliable than SRST for MLST analysis (see below). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>With seven loci in each MLST scheme, this yielded 3,801 allele calls across 35 loci to assess call rate and false positive rate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>The read sets represented a wide range of average read depths, with 90% in the range 12× - 130× and 50% between 20× - 60× (Table 1). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Median run time was 6 min per sample (interquartile range, 4 to 10 min) and increased linearly with number of reads (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Efficiency can be easily improved or standardised, without data preprocessing, by instructing SRST2 to map the first N reads only.Figure 2 Run times for MLST analysis with SRST2.

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>SRST2 call rates and true positive rates increased with average read depth, stabilizing with depths ≥15× (Figure 3a, Additional file 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>For comparison, we also assembled each read set using Velvet [24] and VelvetOptimiser [48] and used nucleotide BLAST to identify MLST alleles (assembly + BLAST method; Methods). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>At read depths ≥15×, SRST2 made significantly more allele calls than assembly + BLAST (call rates 99.9% vs. 95.9%, respectively; P &lt;1 × 10-15), with equivalent accuracy (0.46% vs. 0.22% of allele calls incorrect; P = 0.16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>The heuristic information provided by SRST2 (that is, confident mismatches, insertions, deletions or truncations reported from read mapping) was a strong indicator of accuracy in the result: where an exact match was reported (98% of calls with depth ≥15×), 0.2% of allele calls were incorrect; where an inexact match was reported, 11.7% of allele calls were incorrect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Hence, the key difference between the two methods was the ability of SRST2 to make correct calls where assembly + BLAST could not make any call: for read depths ≥15×, SRST2 made a call with the correct allele 99.4% of the time, compared to only 95.7% for assembly analysis (P &lt;1 × 10-15 for difference in frequencies of correct allele calls). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>At sequence type (ST) level, the difference was even greater: SRST2 achieved accurate ST assignment for 98% of isolates with average depth ≥15×, whereas assembly + BLAST correctly identified only 79%. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Rapid and reliable extraction of clinically relevant genomic information will be essential for the adoption of WGS for infection control and public health surveillance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>SRST2 was designed specifically to generate clinically informative genomic profiles of bacterial pathogens - encompassing sequence type, antibiotic resistance genes and virulence genes - direct from raw sequence data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>It out-performs alternative approaches, including assembly-based approaches and our earlier mapping-based MLST software SRST, in terms of both speed and accuracy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Here we have validated the use of SRST2 for MLST of L. monocytogenes in a public health laboratory, and demonstrated its utility in the hospital setting for both infection control investigations and the identification of antibiotic resistance mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
