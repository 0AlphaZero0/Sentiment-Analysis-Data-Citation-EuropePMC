Specific support of PNR could be achieved by neurotrophic factor delivery within the nerve conduits via nanotechnology or stem cell engineering and transplantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Here, we comparatively investigated the bioactivity of selected neurotrophic factors conjugated to iron oxide nanoparticles (np-NTFs) and of bone marrow-derived stem cells genetically engineered to overexpress those neurotrophic factors (NTF-BMSCs). The neurite outgrowth inductive activity was monitored in culture systems of adult and neonatal rat sensory dorsal root ganglion neurons as well as in the cell line from rat pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cell sympathetic culture model system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We demonstrate that np-NTFs reliably support numeric neurite outgrowth in all utilized culture models. In some aspects, especially with regard to their long-term bioactivity, np-NTFs are even superior to free NTFs. Engineered NTF-BMSCs proved to be less effective in induction of sensory neurite outgrowth but demonstrated an increased bioactivity in the PC-12 cell culture system. In contrast, primary nontransfected BMSCs were as effective as np-NTFs in sensory neurite induction and demonstrated an impairment of neuronal differentiation in the PC-12 cell system.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results evidence that nanotechnology as used in our setup is superior over stem cell engineering when it comes to in vitro models for PNR. Furthermore, np-NTFs can easily be suspended in regenerative hydrogel matrix and could be delivered that way to nerve conduits for future in vivo studies and medical application.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>iron oxide nanoparticles</kwd><kwd>conjugated neurotrophic factors</kwd><kwd>bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells</kwd><kwd>genetic cell engineering</kwd><kwd>neurite outgrowth</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tissue engineering of peripheral nerves is an active field in research and development. Tissue-engineered nerves could become a valuable alternative to autologous nerve grafts, which are used as the gold standard for peripheral nerve reconstruction surgeries.<xref rid="b1-ijn-9-5289" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> This type of surgery is indicated whenever complete transection injuries of a peripheral nerve cannot be repaired by tension-free end-to-end coaptation of the severed nerve ends.<xref rid="b2-ijn-9-5289" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Tissue engineering of peripheral nerves in order to bridge nerve defects and provide an optimized regenerative milieu is a complex effort that can only be achieved in a multidisciplinary setting.<xref rid="b3-ijn-9-5289" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> One important task is the delivery of regeneration-promoting molecules such as neurotrophic factors (NTFs) into the nerve defect or, more specifically, their application together with the artificial nerve graft. The main drawback in NTF application is the short half-life time, causing minimal efficacy of single NTF application at the time of reconstructive surgery or systemic application. Different ways to ensure extended availability of added NTFs at the site of nerve reconstruction have been attempted in recent years, including gene therapy via transplanted Schwann cells<xref rid="b4-ijn-9-5289" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> or nanotechnology approaches.<xref rid="b5-ijn-9-5289" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Ex vivo gene therapy can be used to genetically induce the overexpression of selected NTFs in cells that are later transplanted as part of tissue-engineered nerve grafts.<xref rid="b6-ijn-9-5289" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The usefulness of this approach has been proven already for transplanted Schwann cells overexpressing different isoforms of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) in the rat sciatic nerve model.<xref rid="b7-ijn-9-5289" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-ijn-9-5289" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Schwann cells are crucially involved in successful peripheral nerve regeneration (PNR), but they are not easy to harvest and propagate for cell transplantation strategies. Therefore, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been addressed as an easy to access and potentially unlimited cell source for tissue-engineered nerve grafts.<xref rid="b9-ijn-9-5289" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In this study, we performed stem cell engineering by nonviral genetic modification of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), resulting in overexpression of selected NTFs. Another option to ensure availability of NTFs within an artifical nerve graft is the conjugation of the proteins to nanoparticles and their delivery within a hydrogel matrix for axonal regeneration. This strategy was also evaluated in the current work as an alternative strategy to cell-based delivery of NTFs.</p><p>Three well-defined NTFs have been analyzed in the presented study.

To reach the spinal cord, the vertebral bodies were cut off and removed. Using fine scissors, the vertebral canal was opened through a double cut on both sides of the vertebral bodies. On both sides of the spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) were reached along the posterior roots and extracted from the intervertebral foramina. Harvested DRGs were maintained in Leibovitz&#8217;s medium (Invitrogen, Monza, Italy) for 1 hour under sterile conditions. The connective tissue capsules were then mechanically reduced and the explants were half cut. The DRG explants were cultured on matrigel-coated (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA, USA) glass coverslips in serum-free medium (SFM<xref rid="b16-ijn-9-5289" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>): 50% (v/v) F12 nutrient mixture, 50% (v/v) Basal Medium Eagle, 2&#215;10<sup>&#8722;3</sup> M glutamine, 0.5% (v/v) 100&#215; penicillin&#8211;streptomycin&#8211;neomycin antibiotic mixture (all Invitrogen), 10 mg/mL bovine albumin serum, 1&#215;10<sup>&#8722;4</sup> M putrescine, 0.1 mg/mL transferrin, 3&#215;10<sup>&#8722;8</sup> selenium, 0.005 mg/mL insulin, 3.8&#215;10<sup>&#8722;5</sup> M vitamin C, 7.5 mg/mL glucose (all Sigma, Milan, Italy) in culture-grade water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-9-5289">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate the stability of NTF bioactivity in vitro, free recombinant GDNF (Peprotech, Hamburg, Germany) and np-GDNF were selected, and adult DRG explant cultures were either incubated with fresh or preincubated pure SFM or supplemented with either GDNF type.

NVR-Gel is composed of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid (3&#215;10<sup>6</sup> Da, BTG Polymers, Kiryat Malachi, Israel) and laminin (Sigma, Rehovot, Israel). For cell cultivation, hyaluronic acid of 1% was further diluted 1:1 either with N2 cell culture medium (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-9-5289">Figure 1B</xref>) or PC12 differentation medium (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-9-5289">Figure 1C</xref>) to a final concentration of 0.5%. Laminin was then added (10 ng/mL) to complete the NVR-Gel composition. For bioactivity assays, NVR-Gel was either left pure or enriched with 50 ng/mL of single free recombinant NTF (NGF, Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany; FGF-2 and GDNF, Peprotech, Hamburg Germany) or single np-NTFs or a pool of either the free NTFs or np-NTFs (50 ng/mL each). In the alternative setting, nontransfected BMSCs or BMSCs overexpressing selected NTFs (see next section) were seeded into the NVR-Gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-9-5289">Figure 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Harvest and culture of rat BMSCs</title><p>Isolation and culturing of rat BMSCs from the femur bone marrow of adult Hannover Wistar rats were performed as described.<xref rid="b18-ijn-9-5289" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Therefore, BMSCs were cultured in noncoated cell culture flasks in Minimum Essential Medium Alpha (Gibco, Darmstadt, Germany) supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum (FCS) (PAA Laboratories GmbH, C&#246;lbe, Germany) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (pen/strep, Gibco).

A probability value lower than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Np-NTFs demonstrate a prolonged bioactivity in vitro in comparison with free NTFs</title><p>To evaluate whether the bioactivity of NTFs is improved by conjugation of the proteins to nanoparticles in comparison with free recombinant proteins, we cultured adult rat DRG explants over 3 days in the presence of fresh and preincubated medium formulations prepared with 50 ng/mL of free NTFs or NTFs conjugated to iron oxide nanoparticles (np-NTFs) and determined the numbers of extending neurites at certain distances from the DRG explant. GDNF was selected as reference NTF because it has demonstrated high bioactivity on adult DRG explant cultures, although with levels below NGF treatment (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-ijn-9-5289">Figure S2A</xref>). This made GDNF a candidate NTF to also detect minimal changes in bioactivity over time. As is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijn-9-5289">Figure 2</xref>, incubation of adult DRG explant cultures for 3 days with fresh free GDNF or np-GDNF induced significantly increased numeric neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijn-9-5289">Figure 2A</xref>) and extension of neuritic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijn-9-5289">Figure 2B</xref>) in comparison with control conditions with fresh medium without GDNF supplementation. Representative photomicrographs are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijn-9-5289">Figure 2C</xref>. Fresh free GDNF additionally demonstrated an increased bioactivity over that of fresh np-GDNF. While the neurite outgrowth was not significantly affected after 1-week preincubation of medium formulations (data not shown), prolonged bioactivity of np-GDNF compared with free GDNF was clearly detectable after a 2-week preincubation period. After this period, free GDNF no longer increased numeric neurite outgrowth when compared with control conditions, and we detected a significant reduction of bioactivity by 65% of the bioactivity of fresh free GDNF. In contrast, np-GDNF revealed its bioactivity also after a 2-week preincubation period, as demonstrated by the maintained neurite outgrowth inductive activity, which was then still significantly increased over control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijn-9-5289">Figure 2A and B</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, we demonstrated that at a certain dosage, all np-NTFs tested (np-NGF, np-FGF-2<sup>18kDa</sup>, and np-GDNF) significantly increased adult sensory neurite outgrowth over the values seen in control cultures (cultured in SFM medium alone). All np-NTFs further demonstrated a dose dependency of their neurite inductive effects.

NVR-Gel is composed of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid and laminin and has been described as regenerative matrix for nervous system repair.<xref rid="b17-ijn-9-5289" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b23-ijn-9-5289" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The next experiment was performed in order to determine whether the suspension of np-NTFs in the regenerative NVR-Gel matrix still allows them to exert inductive effects on neurite outgrowth, as seen for their suspension in medium. Therefore, the in vitro neurite outgrowth assay was analyzed after placing dissociated neonatal DRG drop cultures into 0.5% NVR-Gel supplemented with np-NTFs. To further elucidate whether conjugation of NTFs to iron oxide nanoparticles has an impact on the bioactivity of the NTF proteins, we compared in this experiment the effects of np-NTFs with those of free recombinant NTF proteins. As is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-9-5289">Figure 3</xref>, the supplementation of NVR-Gel with either free NTF or np-NTF resulted in significant effects on neurite outgrowth induction from neonatal DRG drop cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-9-5289">Figure 3A, C, and E</xref>). Both free NGF and np-NGF induced significantly higher numeric neurite outgrowth in distances up 700 &#956;m from the center of the DRG drop culture than the other NTFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-9-5289">Figure 3A and B</xref>). However, analysis of the ten longest neurites extending from each DRG drop culture did not reveal any significant difference among all treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-9-5289">Figure 3G</xref>). No statistically significant difference was detectable between the neurite outgrowth inductive effects of np-NTFs compared with free NTFs, suggesting that when incorporated into a regenerative hydrogel matrix, np-NTFs are able to exert the same bioactivity as free NTFs. Interestingly, for FGF-2<sup>18kDa</sup>, an even slightly increased neurite inductive potential over short distances was visible for np-FGF-2<sup>18kDa</sup> in comparison with free FGF-2<sup>18kDa</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-9-5289">Figure 3C and D</xref>). The opposite was seen when comparing np-GDNF with free GDNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-9-5289">Figure 3E and F</xref>).</p><p>Because we could demonstrate that np-NGF exerts the most prominent neurite inductive effect in both adult DRG explant cultures and neonatal DRG drop cultures, we were interested in whether this effect could be further increased by a possible synergistic effect of the other np-NTFs. Therefore, all three np-NTFs (np-NGF + np-FGF-2<sup>18kDa</sup> + np-GDNF) were mixed to an np-NTF pool.

Successful genetic modification was monitored in Western blot analysis from cell lysates and cell culture supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-9-5289">Figure 4</xref>). Cell lysates of engineered BMSCs reveal strong expression of the respective FGF-2<sup>18kDa</sup>-Flag or pro-GDNF-Flag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-9-5289">Figure 4A</xref>).

The maximum neurite lengths were almost not affected by the presence of nT-BMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-9-5289">Figure 5C</xref>) in comparison with control levels (CTR), while engineered BMSCs (FGF-2<sup>18kDa</sup>-BMSCs and GDNF-BMSCs) demonstrated nonsignificant impairment of distance outgrowth, which was most prominent in the presence of GDNF-BMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-9-5289">Figure 5B</xref>).

However, it is noteworthy that while nT-BMSCs had a very similar effect on maximum neurite lengths as np-NTFs, co-culture with engineered BMSCs, especially GDNF-BMSCs, significantly impaired distance outgrowth of neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijn-9-5289">Figure 6B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Neurite formation by PC-12 cells is supported to a higher extent in the presence of FGF-2<sup>18kDa</sup>-BMSCs than in the presence of np-FGF-2<sup>18kDa</sup></title><p>In order to directly compare the neurite inductive potential of np-NTFs and engineered NTF-BMSCs again in another cell system, we utilized the PC-12 cell neuronal differentiation assay as a third in vitro model. PC-12 cells are highly sensitive for treatment with NGF or FGF-2<sup>18kDa</sup>. Therefore, free NGF, np-NGF, free FGF-2<sup>18kDa</sup>, np-FGF-2<sup>18kDa</sup>, or FGF-2<sup>18kDa</sup>-BMSCs were incorporated in NVR-Gel together with PC-12 cells.

The first was the nanotechnology approach of conjugation of NTFs with iron oxide nanoparticles, which was supposed to increase the stability of the conjugated NTFs, but also to ensure local and slow release of NTFs in the lumen of nerve conduits.<xref rid="b5-ijn-9-5289" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The second approach we studied was stem cell engineering. Here, we induced NTF overexpression in BMSCs with nonviral genetic modification. The genetically engineered BMSCs could potentially be transplanted within tissue-engineered nerve conduits, as has been successfully done before with genetically engineered Schwann cells.<xref rid="b4-ijn-9-5289" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>In order to compare the feasibility of optimized NTF delivery increasing the neurite outgrowth in vitro, we utilized adult DRG explant organotypic cultures as well as neonatal DRG drop cultures. The DRG neurite outgrowth model is widely used to assess the neurite outgrowth in a specific environment.<xref rid="b24-ijn-9-5289" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25-ijn-9-5289" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>Using adult DRG explant cultures, we demonstrate that the bioactivity of np-NTFs is comparable with that of free NTFs when incorporated into a regenerative hydrogel matrix. The latter is a good prerequisite for future in vivo application. From previous studies, we already have proof that NTFs conjugated to iron oxide nanoparticles demonstrate prolonged stability over free NTFs.<xref rid="b14-ijn-9-5289" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Here, we clearly demonstrate that not only the stability of the proteins but also, most importantly, their bioactivity is stabilized by conjugation of NTFs to nanoparticles. Our study comparing the neurite inductive potential of fresh with preincubated medium formulations evidenced that only minimal reduction of bioactivity occurs for np-GDNF during a 2-week preincubation period, while free GDNF lost its neurite inductive activity in the same time span.</p><p>We could further demonstrate that np-NTFs are able to stimulate neuronal outgrowth in a dose-dependent manner and that np-NTFs have similar bioactivity as free NTFs when suspended in a regenerative hydrogel matrix. The latter system mimics a way to apply np-NTFs with nerve conduits for peripheral nerve reconstruction surgery. As hydrogel matrix, we used NVR-Gel, which has been described before as a suitable matrix for neuronal cultures<xref rid="b17-ijn-9-5289" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and which seemed to be appropriate as luminal filler for artificial nerve conduits. Using neonatal DRG drop cultures we demonstrate that np-NTFs are effective in inducing the numeric neurite outgrowth activity also when suspended in NVR-Gel. In NVR-Gel enriched with np-NTFs, the elongation of neurites, however, seems not to be stimulated. We suppose that the presence of the gel slowed down neurite elongation, but further analysis using long-term cultures is necessary to elucidate how neurite distance outgrowth is influenced by NVR-Gel.</p><p>With regard to potential in vivo application of np-NTFs, another finding from our study has to be considered. The dose dependency of np-NTF-induced sensory neurite outgrowth varied among the NTFs investigated. While 50 ng/mL of np-NGF or np-GDNF induced maximal neurite outgrowth among the concentrations chosen, the lower concentration of only 10 ng/mL np-FGF-2<sup>18kDa</sup> showed a trend to be more efficient than higher concentrations (data presented as supplementary material). All np-NTFs investigated, however, demonstrated an induction of neurite outgrowth activity at the concentration of 50 ng/mL, which can be concluded as a useful concentration for future in vivo application. From the acquired in vitro data, it cannot be finally decided which np-NTFs would give maximum support of axonal regeneration in vivo. DRG neuron populations are heterogeneous with regard to the quality of sensory transmission, and different growth factors act selectively on different subpopulations of DRG neurons.<xref rid="b26-ijn-9-5289" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b29-ijn-9-5289" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Therefore, an emerging concept in the field of artificial nerve graft development is to use a combination of NTFs with the aim to obtain a widespread effect on all sensory, motor, and sympathetic neuronal subpopulations.<xref rid="b30-ijn-9-5289" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b32-ijn-9-5289" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> It is, however, still under debate which NTF combination will result in the most successful support of PNR while simultaneously avoiding negative influences in the process.<xref rid="b33-ijn-9-5289" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Therefore, we also investigated the effect of an np-NTF pool on the neurite outgrowth activity in adult DRG explant and neonatal DRG drop cultures. In our hands, an np-NTF pool of np-NGF, np-FGF-2<sup>18kDa</sup>, and np-GDNF did not demonstrate higher efficiency in promoting neurite outgrowth than 50 ng/mL np-NGF alone. This indicates that there is no synergistic effect among these three selected NTFs. However, considering the limits of an in vitro approach, it is possible that in our culture systems, 50 ng/mL np-NGF treatment already induced the maximum neurite outgrowth with no possibility to demonstrate a synergy for the additionally added np-FGF-2<sup>18kDa</sup> or np-GDNF.</p><p>Evaluation of the second innovative approach of NTF delivery to nerve conduits and stem cell engineering showed that primary nT-BMSCs have a higher potency to induce sensory neurite outgrowth than engineered NTF-BMSCs. The basis for this may be the secretome of BMSCs that provides a variety of growth factors to the co-cultured neurons.<xref rid="b34-ijn-9-5289" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> We assume that the secretome has, to some extent, been negatively influenced by the genetic modification during BMSC engineering. Further analysis is needed to elucidate this in more detail prior to potential in vivo application, but, although only seen in one out of three independent analyses, the Western blot analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-9-5289">Figure 4B</xref> already indicates that the GDNF expression might be altered between nT-BMSCs and genetically engineered empty-BMSCs.</p><p>When comparing the two innovative approaches of nanotechnology and stem cell engineering with regard to sensory neurite outgrowth, however, np-NTFs have demonstrated a slightly increased bioactivity over NTF-BMSCs. Additionally, using a different neuronal differentiation model,<xref rid="b22-ijn-9-5289" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b35-ijn-9-5289" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> the PC-12 cell neurite outgrowth induction assay, NTF-BMSCs demonstrated an increased bioactivity over np-NTFs. We therefore assume that the secretome together with the overexpressed FGF-2<sup>18kDa</sup> was, in this setting, specifically supportive for PC-12 cell sympathetic neurite outgrowth.</p><p>One last point has to be considered when thinking of future in vivo application of nanotechnological NTF delivery to peripheral nerve guidance conduits. The conduits will be sutured between the transected nerve ends and, especially the distal nerve end, will undergo Wallerian degeneration. As this process will provide Schwann cell ingrowth into the nerve conduits, we were also interested in whether Schwann cell migration is modified in our in vitro models. The data are not shown because we have no hints that Schwann cell migration is modified by adding np-NTFs or BMSCs to the system. Whether synergistic effects would develop for np-NTFs delivered within the conduits and those additionally liberated during Wallerian degeneration of the distal nerve end, is only accessible in vivo and must be the subject of future studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both approaches demonstrated their potential to induce neurite outgrowth in different neuronal models. They may be chosen specifically in the context of peripheral nerve tissue engineering. However, the variability of the BMSC secretome upon genetic engineering of the cells needs to be studied in more detail prior to their in vivo application. Our comparative in vitro study provides evidence that np-NTFs have long-term bioactivity and reliably support neurite outgrowth in vitro also after periods when free NTFs have already lost their bioactivity. With regard to their therapeutical use, iron oxide nanoparticles are considered to be nontoxic and are already in use for various biomedical applications, such as diagnostics, cell labeling, magnetic resonance imaging, and X-ray contrast agents, and for hyperthermia.<xref rid="b5-ijn-9-5289" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Therefore, np-NTFs are good candidates for the in vivo evaluation of their PNR-promoting potential in future studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary materials</title><sec><title>Neurotrophic factors conjugated to iron oxide nanoparticles induce a dose-dependent neurite outgrowth from adult dorsal root ganglion explants</title><p>Adult rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) explants were cultured over 3 days in the presence of increasing amounts of neurotrophic factors conjugated to iron oxide nanoparticles (np-NTFs), and the numbers of extending neurites measured at certain distances from the DRG explant.

maintained for 3 days in SFM at 37&#176;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and sister cultures were stimulated with three different quantities (10 ng/mL, 50 ng/mL, or 100 ng/mL) of each single np-NTF (np-NGF, np-FGF-2<sup>18kDa</sup>, or np-GDNF) or with a pool of the three np-NTFs (final concentration of each np-NTF 30 ng/mL or 50 ng/mL). (<bold>B</bold>, upper row) Neonatal DRGs were dissociated and seeded as a drop (2,500 neurons in 5 &#956;L medium) into a layer of 800 or 1,000 &#956;L of NVR-Gel (pure or supplemented with either single free recombinant NTFs or np-NTFs or a pool of either the free NTFs or np-NTFs). (<bold>B</bold>, lower row) In addition, DRG drop cultures were seeded into NVR-Gel containing nontransfected BMSCs or BMSCs overexpressing selected NTFs at a density of 40&#215;10<sup>4</sup> cells/1,000 &#956;L of 0.5% NVR-Gel. Cultures were maintained for 1 day. (<bold>C</bold>) A density of 30&#215;10<sup>4</sup> EGFP-PC-12 cells was mixed with either np-NTFs or 40&#215;10<sup>4</sup> nT-BMSCs or FGF-2<sup>18kDa</sup>-BMSCs in a volume of 1 mL 0.5% NVR-Gel (containing PC-12 cell differentiation medium) and transferred into a 24-multiwell culture well. Cultures were maintained for 5 days.</p><p><bold>Abbreviations:</bold> np, nanoparticle; NTFs, neurotrophic factors; DRG, dorsal root ganglion; SFM, serum-free medium; NGF, nerve growth factor; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; GDNF, glia-derived neurotrophic factor; BMSCs, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; PC-12 cells, cell line from rat pheochromocytoma cells; PSN, penicillin&#8211;streptomycin&#8211;neomycin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DMEM, Dulbecco&#8217;s Modified Eagle&#8217;s Medium; MEM, Minimum Essential Medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; pen/strep, penicillin/streptomycin.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ijn-9-5289Fig1"/></fig><fig id="f2-ijn-9-5289" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Conjugation of NTFs to iron oxide nanoparticles maintains their bioactivity over 2 weeks in vitro.</p><p><bold>Notes:</bold> (<bold>A</bold>) Bar graph depicting the number of neuritic extensions from adult DRG explants (at distance 0 &#956;m) treated with free GDNF or np-GDNF.
