</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Tissue engineering of peripheral nerves is an active field in research and development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Tissue-engineered nerves could become a valuable alternative to autologous nerve grafts, which are used as the gold standard for peripheral nerve reconstruction surgeries.1 This type of surgery is indicated whenever complete transection injuries of a peripheral nerve cannot be repaired by tension-free end-to-end coaptation of the severed nerve ends.2 Tissue engineering of peripheral nerves in order to bridge nerve defects and provide an optimized regenerative milieu is a complex effort that can only be achieved in a multidisciplinary setting.3 One important task is the delivery of regeneration-promoting molecules such as neurotrophic factors (NTFs) into the nerve defect or, more specifically, their application together with the artificial nerve graft. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The main drawback in NTF application is the short half-life time, causing minimal efficacy of single NTF application at the time of reconstructive surgery or systemic application. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Different ways to ensure extended availability of added NTFs at the site of nerve reconstruction have been attempted in recent years, including gene therapy via transplanted Schwann cells4 or nanotechnology approaches.5 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Ex vivo gene therapy can be used to genetically induce the overexpression of selected NTFs in cells that are later transplanted as part of tissue-engineered nerve grafts.6 The usefulness of this approach has been proven already for transplanted Schwann cells overexpressing different isoforms of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) in the rat sciatic nerve model.7,8 Schwann cells are crucially involved in successful peripheral nerve regeneration (PNR), but they are not easy to harvest and propagate for cell transplantation strategies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Therefore, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been addressed as an easy to access and potentially unlimited cell source for tissue-engineered nerve grafts.9 In this study, we performed stem cell engineering by nonviral genetic modification of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), resulting in overexpression of selected NTFs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Another option to ensure availability of NTFs within an artifical nerve graft is the conjugation of the proteins to nanoparticles and their delivery within a hydrogel matrix for axonal regeneration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>This strategy was also evaluated in the current work as an alternative strategy to cell-based delivery of NTFs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Three well-defined NTFs have been analyzed in the presented study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Nerve growth factor (NGF) is known as the neurotrophin with the strongest effect on sensory neurite outgrowth with regard to both axonal elongation and sprouting.10 The second neurotrophin analyzed was glia-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), which exerts the most prominent effects on regenerating motor neurons.11 The growth factor FGF-2, in particular its low molecular weight isoform FGF-218kDa, has demonstrated significant support on axonal elongation along with reduced sprouting.12 For the study presented, all three NTFs named were conjugated to iron oxide nanoparticles while overexpression of exclusively FGF-218kDa or GDNF was induced in BMSCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Sensory neurite outgrowth assays as well as the cell line from rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC-12) neuronal differentiation assay were utilized to quantitatively analyze the regeneration-promoting potential of NTF-overexpressing BMSCs or nanoparticle-conjugated NTFs in comparison with free recombinant NTF proteins. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Our study comparing the neurite inductive potential of fresh with preincubated medium formulations evidenced that only minimal reduction of bioactivity occurs for np-GDNF during a 2-week preincubation period, while free GDNF lost its neurite inductive activity in the same time span. </plain></SENT>
