Tacrolimus has a narrow therapeutic index and displays large pharmacokinetic variability <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Individualizing the tacrolimus dosage regimen to optimize the therapeutic effect and minimize adverse effects is essential <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. The dose required to achieve targeted whole blood concentrations of tacrolimus varies considerably between patients, as well as with time after transplantation <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Two distinct challenges exist for individualizing tacrolimus dosing in transplant recipients: Predicting the initial dose of tacrolimus prior to any known concentration&#8211;time data on a particular patient and adjusting the doses over time after transplantation.</p><p>Information needed for dosage individualization can be obtained through population pharmacokinetic modelling <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. An appropriate population pharmacokinetic model can be used to assist in predicting the optimal initial dose, prior to any available concentration&#8211;time measurements, based on population standard values and identified covariates. Furthermore, a population pharmacokinetic model can be used to assist with dosage adjustments by using Bayesian revised dosage predictions based on known concentration&#8211;time data in each individual <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Numerous population pharmacokinetic models have been developed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus in adult kidney transplant recipients <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. However, the suggested covariates and their functional forms in the models are inconsistent between studies, leading to uncertainty as to which covariates are clinically important and how tacrolimus dosage should be adjusted with different covariate values. Passey <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> proposed a model for initial dosing that was found to be imprecise during external evaluation <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. Models externally evaluated for Bayesian dose adjustments have been found imprecise in the first weeks post-transplant <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. Six of the available models were evaluated for their ability to predict the tacrolimus area under the concentration&#8211;time curve in independent patients and were found unacceptably imprecise unless at least two individual concentrations within the dosing interval were known <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. The available models to date have identified covariates mainly through empirical investigation.</p><p>Combining data from multiple studies to increase the number of subjects for population pharmacokinetic modelling may improve our ability to detect reliable and clinically useful covariate influences <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. Furthermore, including covariate effects based on theoretical mechanisms rather than empirically identifying relationships should lead to more consistent results. Mechanism- or theory-based covariate selection differs from empirical covariate selection in that it allows incorporation of relationships linking the parameters and covariates based on a fundamental understanding of pharmacokinetic processes rather than on the available data alone. Such models are expected to improve predictive performance in patients independent of the model building dataset <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we combined data from two previous studies, which independently developed population pharmacokinetic models of tacrolimus in adult kidney transplant recipients in Australia <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and Norway <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. The primary aim of this study was to use the combined data to develop a new population pharmacokinetic model using a theory-based approach to covariate inclusion in contrast to the empirical approaches in the previous studies. The secondary aim was to evaluate the predictive performance of the theory-based model and the previous models in an independent patient cohort during the first 21 days post-transplant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients and dataset combination</title><p>Data were combined from two previous population pharmacokinetic analyses, involving 242 adult kidney transplant recipients. Of these, 173 subjects were from the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane, Australia <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and 69 subjects were from Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet in Oslo, Norway <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. A total of 3100 whole blood tacrolimus concentration&#8211;time points were available for model development: 791 (26%) were obtained as part of full pharmacokinetic profiling (&gt;eight concentrations per dosing occasion), 1277 (41%) were obtained as part of limited pharmacokinetic profiling (four&#8211;five concentrations per dosing occasion) and 1032 (33%) represented trough concentrations measured as part of routine clinical practice (one concentration per dosing occasion). Data were predominantly from the first 3 months post-transplant (median 20 days, range 4 days to 15 years). There was a median of eight tacrolimus concentrations per patient (ranging from 4 to 52).</p><p>For the external model evaluation dataset, tacrolimus trough concentration&#8211;time points from the first 3 weeks post-transplant were obtained from 72 patients who underwent kidney transplantation at Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet in 2011/2012. A total of 837 tacrolimus measurements were collected retrospectively from patient medical records. The exact time of drug intake was not known, and it was assumed that doses were taken every 12 h with trough concentrations measured immediately pre-dose. Patients were excluded if they received multiple organ transplants, received grapefruit juice or if required covariate data were missing.</p><p>Demographic, clinical and pharmacogenetic characteristics of the participants involved in model development and external evaluation are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>.

At both centres, induction therapy generally consisted of high dose intravenous methylprednisolone (250 or 500 mg) and intravenous basiliximab (20 mg on the day of transplant and on the fourth day post-transplant). The maintenance immunosuppressive regimen included tacrolimus as described, fixed dose oral mycophenolate mofetil (1 g twice daily in Brisbane and 0.75 g twice daily in Oslo) and oral prednisolone, initiated at a dose of 0.3 mg kg<sup>&#8722;1</sup> ideal body weight daily (maximum 30 mg daily) in Brisbane and 20 mg daily (up to 80 mg in selected patients) in Oslo.

The first measured tacrolimus concentration after transplantation for each patient in the independent cohort was predicted based on the actual given dose, population pharmacokinetic standard values and covariates.

The published models included covariate relationships established through empirical investigation. Empirical models without a mechanistic basis are more likely to show poor predictive performance in patients not included in model development <xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>. To test this expectation, we present a model using mainly theory-based covariate relationships: Allometric scaling to fat free mass, accounting for binding of tacrolimus to red blood cells, altered clearance and bioavailability in CYP3A5 expressers and reduced tacrolimus bioavailability through an inductive effect of prednisolone on CYP3A/P-glycoprotein expression. The model was externally evaluated for its predictive performance and was found superior to two previously published empirical models for prediction of tacrolimus concentrations immediately following kidney transplantation. The theory-based model was developed from a larger dataset, which may also have contributed to the improved predictive performance.</p><p>A novel characteristic of our model is that the pharmacokinetic parameters are estimated from implicit plasma concentrations rather than from the measured whole blood concentrations. This approach is appealing because it reduces the confounding effect of haematocrit variability in predicting tacrolimus concentrations <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>. Tacrolimus plasma clearance/bioavailability (CL<sub>p</sub>/<italic>F</italic>) was estimated to be 811 l h<sup>&#8722;1</sup> for a CYP3A5 non-expresser with 60 kg fat free mass, which may be compared with previously reported values based on measured plasma concentrations in liver transplant recipients (695 l h<sup>&#8722;1</sup>

This observation may be related to the methylprednisolone bolus given to all patients during surgery, as methylprednisolone may inhibit CYP3A/P-glycoprotein, decreasing the presystemic metabolism and efflux of tacrolimus <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>. However, a similar bioavailability increase was not seen in seven patients in this study who received methylprednisolone later after transplantation for treatment of acute rejection. Other events that may theoretically increase tacrolimus bioavailability post-operatively include surgery-related inflammation, anaesthesia or opioids affecting gut motility and/or reduced food intake <xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>. Although we could not establish a single theoretical explanation, accounting for this observation when using the first measured concentration as feedback for dose revision was important. A model that ignored this factor during external evaluation significantly underpredicted the tacrolimus concentrations measured on the first day post-transplant and overpredicted the subsequent revised concentration. We present this as an empirical association to stimulate further exploration for a mechanistic explanation of factors affecting bioavailability around the time of transplantation.</p><p>Several reports have described time-dependent changes in tacrolimus pharmacokinetics <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>.

However, subsequent to the initial prediction during external evaluation, both empirical models tended to overpredict tacrolimus concentrations until day 14, indicating that the empirical use of &#8216;time after transplantation&#8217; as a covariate does not extrapolate well to new patients. In contrast, our theory-based model incorporated haematocrit and prednisolone dose, two factors known to change systematically with time post-transplant, and appeared to perform well in new patients. In addition, the pcVPCs indicated that the theory-based model performed well over the range of different covariates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>). A pattern of increasing tacrolimus whole blood concentration predictions with increasing haematocrit was however not seen in the pcVPC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2A</xref>). This is likely to be due to the design differences in the Brisbane and Oslo study. The subjects transplanted in Brisbane were sampled more frequently during the early post-transplant week when haematocrit tends to be low <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Moreover, these subjects were sampled mainly during the first 4 h after dose. Thus, the observed and predicted concentrations at the lower end of the haematocrit range are over-represented by concentrations measured close to the peak. In contrast, the concentrations in the Oslo data were mainly trough concentrations, and the influence of haematocrit increases would therefore have been masked by the early Brisbane observation design. The corresponding pcVPCs stratified by centre show an increase in whole blood concentration as a function of haematocrit in the Oslo data (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd2">S2</xref>).</p><p>A more complex covariate-based initial dosing strategy only slightly improved achievement of concentrations within the suggested acceptable range (37%) compared with simpler, weight-based dosing (32%) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4A</xref>). Bayesian dose adaptation would be expected to improve target achievement further, and did so (65%). However, BOV ultimately determines the percentage of concentrations that can be expected to lie within an acceptable range even when the optimal individual dose is used. We estimated BOV in bioavailability to be 23%, similar to the estimate of 22% in a previous study <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. To devise a dosing regimen that achieves at least 90% of concentrations within an 80&#8211;125% range, variability in BOV needs to be 13.6% or less <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>. BOV in bioavailability estimated in this study is clearly too large for this to be achieved. Based on estimated BOV, 65% of tacrolimus concentrations will in theory lie within an 80&#8211;125% range. This is consistent with the 65% value calculated during the Bayesian dose adaptation simulation.</p><p>During external evaluation of the theory-based model, the 90% prediction error interval remained stable between &#8722;18 to &#8722;32% and +22 to +32% at time points subsequent to day 7 post-transplant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref>), a persistent error likely to be mostly due to BOV in bioavailability. The error was however somewhat smaller than what would be expected from the estimated BOV. This might be because each concentration was predicted using the occasion-specific individual parameters updated from the previous occasion, indicating that the bioavailability is likely to vary less between two consecutive dosing occasions within a patient. There is currently a general interest in establishing genetic variables that may further characterize pharmacokinetic variability associated with tacrolimus therapy <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>. While genetic information may be useful in improving prediction of initial doses, it can only help to explain BSV, which is also readily accounted for by feedback from measured concentrations. Future studies should aim to understand and predict BOV associated with tacrolimus oral bioavailability.</p><p>A limitation of our study was that the external evaluation dataset consisted only of retrospectively observed trough concentrations. Individual pharmacokinetic parameter values estimated from trough concentrations alone will likely shrink towards population mean values <xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, reducing the ability to identify patients with pharmacokinetic parameters that deviate greatly from standard values. Taking a second sample within the dosing interval should improve individual parameter estimation and subsequent dosing prediction. Another limitation was that the exact time of dose administration relative to the time of drug concentration measurement was not known. Trough concentrations collected from the patient medical records were assumed to be measured 12 h after dose, but may have been measured after intake of the subsequent morning dose in some cases. Moreover, there was no way to confirm whether the patients were adherent to their prescribed dosage regimen. Tacrolimus concentrations were measured using multiple analytical methods. Converting immunoassay concentrations to corresponding LC-MS/MS values may have introduced uncertainty into the analysis.</p><p>The theory-based model included concentration-dependent binding of tacrolimus to erythrocytes. Removing the non-linear part of the current model (i.e. reducing Equation <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="m3">3</xref> to <italic>C</italic><sub>wb</sub> = <italic>C</italic><sub>p</sub> + <italic>C</italic><sub>p</sub> &#215; B<sub>max</sub> &#215; <italic>f</italic><sub>HCT</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>) increased the OFV by 2.7 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.10), providing no supportive evidence for non-linearity in the range of observed tacrolimus concentrations. A simple method to account for haematocrit differences in the interpretation of tacrolimus whole blood concentrations is to standardize concentrations to a haematocrit (HCT) of 45%: (<italic>C</italic>std<sub>HCT45</sub> = <italic>C</italic><sub>wb</sub> &#215; 45%/HCT <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Haematocrit-standardized concentrations maintain a stable ratio with therapeutically active unbound concentrations (assumed proportional to <italic>C</italic><sub>p</sub>) no matter what the haematocrit fraction (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">S1</xref>). Including concentration-dependent binding of tacrolimus to erythrocytes in the modelling allows us to account for haematocrit differences in the interpretation of tacrolimus whole blood concentrations without the need to measure tacrolimus plasma concentrations.</p><p>During simulations we used a target haematocrit-standardized average concentration of 14.2 &#956;g l<sup>&#8722;1</sup> to examine various dosing strategies, a value derived from observed tacrolimus AUC(0,12 h) in kidney transplant recipients. It should however be noted that there are currently no randomized controlled trials to support the recommendation of a specific tacrolimus target concentration or AUC(0,12 h) <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>. In the Oslo and Brisbane cohorts, the average tacrolimus concentration standardized to a haematocrit of 45% on day 7 post-transplant was 12.2 and 19.9 &#956;g l<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, respectively (calculated from individual CL<sub>wb, HCT45</sub>/<italic>F</italic> estimates, haematocrit values and actual doses), illustrating local differences in targeted tacrolimus exposure. The population model described here may be used to control haematocrit-independent tacrolimus exposure during a randomized concentration-controlled trial and potentially help to further characterize a target concentration.</p><p>In conclusion, we evaluated population pharmacokinetic models of tacrolimus in kidney transplant recipients using an external dataset and found that a model including theory-based covariates led to improved predictive performance as compared with two previously developed empirical models. The model appeared suitable to aid prediction of initial and Bayesian revised tacrolimus doses to achieve a tacrolimus target concentration independent of changes in haematocrit early after kidney transplantation. However, even with ideal dose adjustment with an average concentration exactly on target, 35% of concentrations in a typical patient will be outside the suggested acceptable range. To reduce this out of range percentage, efforts should be directed to reducing the between occasion variability associated with the oral bioavailability of tacrolimus.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Competing Interests</title><p>All authors have completed the Unified Competing Interest form at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf">http://www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf</ext-link> (available on request from the corresponding author) and declare: NHGH had salary support from University of Auckland, ES had salary support from the South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority and SH, TKB, StB, SaB, KM, A&#197; and CS have nothing to disclose.
