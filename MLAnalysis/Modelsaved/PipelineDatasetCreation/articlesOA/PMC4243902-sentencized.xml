</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressive agent widely used following kidney transplantation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Tacrolimus has a narrow therapeutic index and displays large pharmacokinetic variability 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Individualizing the tacrolimus dosage regimen to optimize the therapeutic effect and minimize adverse effects is essential 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The dose required to achieve targeted whole blood concentrations of tacrolimus varies considerably between patients, as well as with time after transplantation 1,3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Two distinct challenges exist for individualizing tacrolimus dosing in transplant recipients: Predicting the initial dose of tacrolimus prior to any known concentration–time data on a particular patient and adjusting the doses over time after transplantation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Information needed for dosage individualization can be obtained through population pharmacokinetic modelling 4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>An appropriate population pharmacokinetic model can be used to assist in predicting the optimal initial dose, prior to any available concentration–time measurements, based on population standard values and identified covariates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a population pharmacokinetic model can be used to assist with dosage adjustments by using Bayesian revised dosage predictions based on known concentration–time data in each individual 5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Numerous population pharmacokinetic models have been developed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus in adult kidney transplant recipients 6–16. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, the suggested covariates and their functional forms in the models are inconsistent between studies, leading to uncertainty as to which covariates are clinically important and how tacrolimus dosage should be adjusted with different covariate values. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Passey et al. 10 proposed a model for initial dosing that was found to be imprecise during external evaluation 17,18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Models externally evaluated for Bayesian dose adjustments have been found imprecise in the first weeks post-transplant 19,20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Six of the available models were evaluated for their ability to predict the tacrolimus area under the concentration–time curve in independent patients and were found unacceptably imprecise unless at least two individual concentrations within the dosing interval were known 21. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The available models to date have identified covariates mainly through empirical investigation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Combining data from multiple studies to increase the number of subjects for population pharmacokinetic modelling may improve our ability to detect reliable and clinically useful covariate influences 22. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, including covariate effects based on theoretical mechanisms rather than empirically identifying relationships should lead to more consistent results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Mechanism- or theory-based covariate selection differs from empirical covariate selection in that it allows incorporation of relationships linking the parameters and covariates based on a fundamental understanding of pharmacokinetic processes rather than on the available data alone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Such models are expected to improve predictive performance in patients independent of the model building dataset 23. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>In this study, we combined data from two previous studies, which independently developed population pharmacokinetic models of tacrolimus in adult kidney transplant recipients in Australia 6 and Norway 7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The primary aim of this study was to use the combined data to develop a new population pharmacokinetic model using a theory-based approach to covariate inclusion in contrast to the empirical approaches in the previous studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The secondary aim was to evaluate the predictive performance of the theory-based model and the previous models in an independent patient cohort during the first 21 days post-transplant. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Tacrolimus plasma clearance/bioavailability (CLp/F) was estimated to be 811 l h−1 for a CYP3A5 non-expresser with 60 kg fat free mass, which may be compared with previously reported values based on measured plasma concentrations in liver transplant recipients (695 l h−1 47 and 473 l h−1 35) for 70 kg total body weight patients. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>A model that ignored this factor during external evaluation significantly underpredicted the tacrolimus concentrations measured on the first day post-transplant and overpredicted the subsequent revised concentration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>We present this as an empirical association to stimulate further exploration for a mechanistic explanation of factors affecting bioavailability around the time of transplantation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Several reports have described time-dependent changes in tacrolimus pharmacokinetics 3,12,15. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>The empirical models evaluated in this study used ‘time after transplantation’ as an independent covariate on CLwb or F. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>However, subsequent to the initial prediction during external evaluation, both empirical models tended to overpredict tacrolimus concentrations until day 14, indicating that the empirical use of ‘time after transplantation’ as a covariate does not extrapolate well to new patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>In contrast, our theory-based model incorporated haematocrit and prednisolone dose, two factors known to change systematically with time post-transplant, and appeared to perform well in new patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>In addition, the pcVPCs indicated that the theory-based model performed well over the range of different covariates (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>A pattern of increasing tacrolimus whole blood concentration predictions with increasing haematocrit was however not seen in the pcVPC (Figure 2A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>This is likely to be due to the design differences in the Brisbane and Oslo study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>The subjects transplanted in Brisbane were sampled more frequently during the early post-transplant week when haematocrit tends to be low 6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these subjects were sampled mainly during the first 4 h after dose. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Thus, the observed and predicted concentrations at the lower end of the haematocrit range are over-represented by concentrations measured close to the peak. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the concentrations in the Oslo data were mainly trough concentrations, and the influence of haematocrit increases would therefore have been masked by the early Brisbane observation design. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>The corresponding pcVPCs stratified by centre show an increase in whole blood concentration as a function of haematocrit in the Oslo data (Figure S2). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>A more complex covariate-based initial dosing strategy only slightly improved achievement of concentrations within the suggested acceptable range (37%) compared with simpler, weight-based dosing (32%) (Figure 4A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Bayesian dose adaptation would be expected to improve target achievement further, and did so (65%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>However, BOV ultimately determines the percentage of concentrations that can be expected to lie within an acceptable range even when the optimal individual dose is used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>We estimated BOV in bioavailability to be 23%, similar to the estimate of 22% in a previous study 16. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>To devise a dosing regimen that achieves at least 90% of concentrations within an 80–125% range, variability in BOV needs to be 13.6% or less 42. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>BOV in bioavailability estimated in this study is clearly too large for this to be achieved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Based on estimated BOV, 65% of tacrolimus concentrations will in theory lie within an 80–125% range. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the 65% value calculated during the Bayesian dose adaptation simulation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>During external evaluation of the theory-based model, the 90% prediction error interval remained stable between −18 to −32% and +22 to +32% at time points subsequent to day 7 post-transplant (Figure 3), a persistent error likely to be mostly due to BOV in bioavailability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>The error was however somewhat smaller than what would be expected from the estimated BOV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>This might be because each concentration was predicted using the occasion-specific individual parameters updated from the previous occasion, indicating that the bioavailability is likely to vary less between two consecutive dosing occasions within a patient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>There is currently a general interest in establishing genetic variables that may further characterize pharmacokinetic variability associated with tacrolimus therapy 17,43,49. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>While genetic information may be useful in improving prediction of initial doses, it can only help to explain BSV, which is also readily accounted for by feedback from measured concentrations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Future studies should aim to understand and predict BOV associated with tacrolimus oral bioavailability. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>A limitation of our study was that the external evaluation dataset consisted only of retrospectively observed trough concentrations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Individual pharmacokinetic parameter values estimated from trough concentrations alone will likely shrink towards population mean values 50, reducing the ability to identify patients with pharmacokinetic parameters that deviate greatly from standard values. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Taking a second sample within the dosing interval should improve individual parameter estimation and subsequent dosing prediction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Another limitation was that the exact time of dose administration relative to the time of drug concentration measurement was not known. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Trough concentrations collected from the patient medical records were assumed to be measured 12 h after dose, but may have been measured after intake of the subsequent morning dose in some cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there was no way to confirm whether the patients were adherent to their prescribed dosage regimen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Tacrolimus concentrations were measured using multiple analytical methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Converting immunoassay concentrations to corresponding LC-MS/MS values may have introduced uncertainty into the analysis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>The theory-based model included concentration-dependent binding of tacrolimus to erythrocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Removing the non-linear part of the current model (i.e. reducing Equation 3 to Cwb = Cp + Cp × Bmax × fHCT/KD) increased the OFV by 2.7 (P = 0.10), providing no supportive evidence for non-linearity in the range of observed tacrolimus concentrations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>A simple method to account for haematocrit differences in the interpretation of tacrolimus whole blood concentrations is to standardize concentrations to a haematocrit (HCT) of 45%: (CstdHCT45 = Cwb × 45%/HCT 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Haematocrit-standardized concentrations maintain a stable ratio with therapeutically active unbound concentrations (assumed proportional to Cp) no matter what the haematocrit fraction (Figure S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Including concentration-dependent binding of tacrolimus to erythrocytes in the modelling allows us to account for haematocrit differences in the interpretation of tacrolimus whole blood concentrations without the need to measure tacrolimus plasma concentrations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>During simulations we used a target haematocrit-standardized average concentration of 14.2 μg l−1 to examine various dosing strategies, a value derived from observed tacrolimus AUC(0,12 h) in kidney transplant recipients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>It should however be noted that there are currently no randomized controlled trials to support the recommendation of a specific tacrolimus target concentration or AUC(0,12 h) 3,51. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>In the Oslo and Brisbane cohorts, the average tacrolimus concentration standardized to a haematocrit of 45% on day 7 post-transplant was 12.2 and 19.9 μg l−1, respectively (calculated from individual CLwb, HCT45/F estimates, haematocrit values and actual doses), illustrating local differences in targeted tacrolimus exposure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>The population model described here may be used to control haematocrit-independent tacrolimus exposure during a randomized concentration-controlled trial and potentially help to further characterize a target concentration. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we evaluated population pharmacokinetic models of tacrolimus in kidney transplant recipients using an external dataset and found that a model including theory-based covariates led to improved predictive performance as compared with two previously developed empirical models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>The model appeared suitable to aid prediction of initial and Bayesian revised tacrolimus doses to achieve a tacrolimus target concentration independent of changes in haematocrit early after kidney transplantation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>However, even with ideal dose adjustment with an average concentration exactly on target, 35% of concentrations in a typical patient will be outside the suggested acceptable range. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>To reduce this out of range percentage, efforts should be directed to reducing the between occasion variability associated with the oral bioavailability of tacrolimus. </plain></SENT>
