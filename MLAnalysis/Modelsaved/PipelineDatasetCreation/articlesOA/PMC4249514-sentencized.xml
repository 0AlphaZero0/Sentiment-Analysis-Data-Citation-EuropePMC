<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is active against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including many multiply drug-resistant strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CHL is produced by several Gram-positive soil actinomycetes, but its biosynthesis has been analyzed mostly in Streptomyces venezuelae strain ATCC 10712 (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The initial stages of CHL biosynthesis utilize the shikimate pathway that leads to the production of chorismic acid. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The conversion of chorismic acid to PABA occurs via 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate the precursor for the pathway dedicated to chloramphenicol biosynthesis (3). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>The genome mining of Streptomyces sp. strain OH-4156 (25), which does not produce CHL, indicated a high level of nucleotide sequence similarity with the genome of S. venezuelae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The alignment of the Streptomyces sp. strain OH-4156 Solexa contigs on the S. venezuelae genome sequence in the region of the CHL biosynthetic gene cluster revealed the presence of seven genes (sven0909–sven0915) adjacent to the previously identified CHL biosynthetic gene cluster (sven0916–sven0928) that were absent in the nonproducing strain (Fig. 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>To gain insight into whether any of these newly identified genes might play a role in CHL production, we compared their transcriptional profiles with those of established CHL biosynthetic genes in the microarray data from submerged cultures of S. venezuelae and several of its developmental mutants that are deficient in sporulation. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>New developments in next-generation sequencing combined with bioinformatic analysis greatly facilitate the comparison of genome sequences of related bacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>We have taken advantage of these advances and combined them with microarray analysis to identify four new members of the CHL biosynthetic gene cluster: sven0913, encoding a transcriptional activator; sven0914, encoding a putative PPTase; sven0915, encoding a putative ion antiporter; and sven0925, encoding a putative ACP. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>For reasons we do not understand, while the transcription of the CHL biosynthetic gene cluster can be detected by microarray analysis in our wild-type isolate of S. venezuelae (Fig. 1A), albeit at a low level, we were unable to detect CHL production, despite using a range of culture media. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>However, the constitutive expression of sven0913 resulted in readily detectable levels of antibiotic production, further highlighting the value of ectopically expressing cluster-situated regulatory genes to activate natural product biosynthesis (for an example, see reference 27). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>The deletion of either sven0914 or sven0915, which appear to be cotranscribed, decreased CHL production by approximately 60%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Production was restored to wild-type levels when each mutant strain was complemented with the respective gene, demonstrating that the phenotype of the Δsven0914 mutant is not simply the result of a polar effect of the deletion of sven0915 and that both genes play a role in CHL production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Sven0914 is predicted to encode a PPTase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>PPTases are responsible for the conversion of the inactive apo form of an ACP or peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) to the active holo form by covalent attachment of a coenzyme-A-derived phosphopantetheine group to a specific serine residue (28). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>The posttranslational phosphopantetheinylation of the apo-ACP/PCP domains is essential for the activities of many multienzyme synthases and synthetases responsible for the generation of a variety of natural products, most notably polyketides and nonribosomally synthesized peptides (29). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Sven0914 contains all of the conserved motifs found in the F/KES subfamily of Sfp-type PPTases (30, 31). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>While many members of this subfamily utilize PCPs as substrates, there are exceptions, most notably the Sco6673-like PPTase of Streptomyces ambofaciens, which is able to accept both ACP and PCP domains as substrates (32) and which shares 53% amino acid sequence identity with Sven0914. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Consequently, we cannot reliably predict whether Sven0914 is involved in the modification of the PCP domain of Sven0922 (see below), the ACP Sven0929, or both. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, not all natural products that require the activity of a PPTase for their synthesis contain the corresponding gene within their biosynthetic gene clusters, and instead, they utilize a PPTase encoded elsewhere in the genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Consequently, it is not too surprising that the deletion of sven0914 reduced but did not abolish CHL production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the CHL biosynthetic gene cluster of M. carbonacea ATCC 39149 (33) (GenBank accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="GG657738">GG657738</ext-link>) lacks a sven0914 homologue, although all of the other genes required for CHL production are present and arranged in precisely the same manner as in S. venezuelae (see Fig. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>A BLASTp search to find the possible homologues of Sven0914 in the heterologous host S. coelicolor identified Sco6673, with 54% amino acid sequence identity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>A Pfam database search (34) identified a PPTase domain within the C-terminal region of Sco6673 and may explain why the deletion of sven0914 still results in some CHL production in the heterologous host (the Sco6673 and the Sco6673-like proteins of S. ambofaciens share 83% identity). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Divergently transcribed from sven0915 is sven0916, which is predicted to encode an efflux permease from the major facilitator superfamily, and it is presumably involved in CHL export. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>These efflux pumps are often involved in multidrug resistance, exporting toxic compounds to the outside of the cell, and they are usually driven by the energy stored in ion gradients to catalyze the transport of drugs across the membrane. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Our transcriptional profiling suggests that CHL biosynthesis occurs at the end of rapid vegetative growth in S. venezuelae, when proteolytic degradation of existing proteins may provide an intracellular amino acid pool for continued morphological development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Such a source of aromatic amino acids might act to inhibit the expression and/or activity of the primary metabolic DAHP synthase and thus restrict the precursor pool for CHL biosynthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>We speculate that the existence of a gene, cmlE, within the CHL biosynthetic gene cluster that encodes a DHAP synthase homologue may serve to ensure sufficient flux through the shikimate pathway for sustained CHL biosynthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the presence of a 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate synthase homologue, cmlB, in the CHL biosynthetic gene cluster may act to direct flux toward CHL biosynthesis rather than continued aromatic amino acid production. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Although the functions of many genes can be assigned with certainty or a high level of confidence, the roles of those involved in the dichloroacetylation of the CHL precursor remain obscure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Partly by a process of elimination, these genes are likely to include sven0925 (cmlM), sven0926 (cmlJ), sven0927 (cmlK), and sven0929 (cmlT), as well as sven0928 (cmlS), encoding a flavin-dependent halogenase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>All five of these genes are clustered together and may well be contained in a single operon, consistent with a common function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Based on the similarity of CmlK to the adenylating enzymes PchD and DhbE, which utilize salicylic acid and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid as substrates, respectively, Piraee, White, and Vining (9) speculated that dichloroacetylation occurs through CmlK-mediated adenylation of an aromatic carboxylic acid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>The recognition of the putative ACP CmlM in this study suggests that CmlM may also be a substrate for CmlK, tethering the carboxylic acid prior to halogenation (Fig. 6). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, microarray analyses revealed that the expression of the CHL biosynthetic gene cluster was markedly enhanced in bldM, whiI, bldN, and whiG (data not shown) mutants of S. venezuelae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>BldM and WhiI are both orphan atypical response regulators that play a crucial role in morphological differentiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Recent work has demonstrated that BldM and WhiI can form a heterodimer that activates transcription from so-called group II promoters, presumably integrating signals from two distinct developmental pathways (37). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) analysis by the same authors failed to reveal binding of either protein to any of the potential promoter regions in the CHL biosynthetic gene cluster, nor did we find a sequence motif corresponding to the consensus recognition sequence for group II promoters anywhere in the gene cluster. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>It thus seems unlikely that a BldM-WhiI heterodimer can directly repress CHL gene expression in the wild-type strain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>The elevated levels of CHL gene transcription observed in both bldM and whiI mutants may thus reflect the existence of an as-yet-unidentified gene that negatively regulates CHL production and whose expression is dependent on the BldM-WhiI heterodimer. bldM is transcribed from two promoters, one of which (p1) is directly activated by BldN at the onset of development (23, 38), and thus the effect of deleting bldN on CHL gene transcription is presumably mediated through decreased levels of bldM transcription. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the transcription of whiI is activated from a single WhiG-dependent promoter (39), presumably explaining the effect of mutation of whiG on cml gene transcription. </plain></SENT>
