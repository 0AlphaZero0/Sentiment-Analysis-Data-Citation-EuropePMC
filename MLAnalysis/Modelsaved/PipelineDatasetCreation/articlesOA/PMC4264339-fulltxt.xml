Due to the diversity and propensity for inter-species transmission, AIVs present a challenge for vaccine developers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. RNA interference (RNAi) has been shown to provide an effective antiviral defense in animals, and several studies have focused on harnessing small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to inhibit viral infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. An siRNA-based microbicide has been shown to protect mice from lethal herpes simplex virus 2 infection or transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and siRNAs specific for conserved regions of influenza virus genes prevented and even treated influenza viral infection in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In 2011, Lyall et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] reported that transgenic expression of an RNA hairpin molecule was capable of inhibiting influenza viral polymerase activity in the chicken.</p><p>ScFvs, another effective countermeasure against animal virus, are among the most widely used recombinant antibodies (rAbs) as they have been successfully modified into a number of different Ab formats and are easily expressed by several expression systems. Since they contain the complete antigen binding site, specific scFvs can bind to and neutralize viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Ascione et al.

Additionally, a high-affinity human scFv antibody against the recombinant H5N1 virus hemagglutinin ectodomain (HA1) showed satisfactory antiviral effects against challenge with H5N1 viruses in embryonated chicken eggs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we report that use of siRNA targeting the NP protein, in combination with single chain variable fragments (scFvs) of anti-HA protein antibody, has a synergistic inhibitory effect on the propagation of avian influenza virus H5N1. Two antiviral genes were expressed in the DF-1 chicken fibroblast line such that an siRNA was stably expressed in the cells in combination with scFvs that were continuously secreted into the extracellular fluid. We show that the infectious titer and copy number of virus particles were both significantly reduced in infected cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Selection of scFvs using the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) method</title><p>Initially, high yields of chicken immunoglobulin VH and VL gene fragments were obtained by PCR amplification.

The library titer was 6.53&#215;10<sup>9</sup> cfu/ml. Before the Y2H experiments, it was first confirmed that pGBKT7-HA+pGADT7-BD and pGADT7-ScFv+ pGBKT7-blank had no autoactivator activity in yeast, and that growth of yeast cells did not impact the expression of pGBKT7-HA. Following incubation for 20 h to permit mating of pGBKT7-HA and pGADT7-ScFv in YDPA/Kana<sup>+</sup>, the appearance of a cloverleaf structure formed by yeast clustering confirmed that the mating was successful. Fourteen colonies positive for scFvs were identified by their blue color resulting from X-gal staining of &#946;-galactosidase activity (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Yeast two-hybrid assay and chromogenic results.

Three-dimensional structures of the HA protein and scFvs were constructed by DiscoveryStudio software.

Binding affinities between the 13 scFvs and an HA protein were predicted by the ZDOCK module of the DiscoveryStudio package.

The 3 lowest binding energies were shown by Nos. 1, 2 and 6 which mean they had the highest affinities for the HA protein. These three scFvs (named scFv1-3) were chosen for the next functional tests. Docking results showed that they bound to separate conformational epitopes (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). The Y2H results showed good reproducibility and all were expressed in the mating yeast (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C and D).

Their advantages are high antigen binding activity, expression efficiency, strong penetrability and a short <italic>in vivo</italic> half-life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The scFvs producted by murine hybridoma cell lines are capable of binding target antigens with an affinity similar to that of the parent mAb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In addition, the single VH and VL region of the chicken immunoglobulin gene simplifies building a library, in contrast to that of mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. We generated VH and VL fragments from AIV H5N1 FJ13 immunized chickens. Assembly of VH, VL and linker fragments by overlap extension PCR yielded a library with a titer of 6.53&#215;10<sup>9</sup> cfu/ml, high enough for the Y2H screen.</p><p>For generating synthetic scFvs, several different molecular display formats have been described, including phage-display, ribosome display and cell-surface display [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The yeast two-hybrid system is a simple, cost-effective technique to screen for the scFv library, and antibodies synthesized in this system generally exhibit good expression levels and specific binding activities in eukaryotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In a comparative study using the same immune scFv cDNA library, yeast display was shown to sample the immune antibody repertoire considerably more fully than phage display, selecting all the scFv identified by phage display and twice as many novel antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, Y2H library screening also generates a significant number of false-positive interactions, including &#8220;biological&#8221; false-positives: protein&#8211;protein interactions that occur in yeast cells, but do not occur <italic>in vivo</italic> in the organism of study, and &#8220;technical&#8221; false-positives: protein&#8211;protein interactions identified in Y2H screens due to technical limitations of the system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. It is very important, therefore, that a verification test be conducted to confirm the specificity of scFvs binding to the HA protein. The number of positive clones screened by Y2H is too large and difficult to verify individually, and using bioinformatics software for further screening greatly reduced the labor intensity. By ZDOCK software analysis, we chose the three with lowest HA binding energy from the 14 Y2H positive ones. The results of functional verification indicated Y2H combined with ZDOCK software analysis was reliable and effective.</p><p>To detect the co-antiviral effect induced by siRNA in combination with scFv1, NP-604 cells were transiently transfected with the scFv1 expression plasmid. Virus titers in the culture supernatants of NP604 cells transfected with scFv1 were reduced by 70-fold compared with titers in NP604 cells or scFv1 cells alone at 60 h post inoculation. Our study opens a new approach to influenza prevention and treatment by using scFv and siRNA together. We predict this concept can also provide a basis for breeding transgenic AIV-resistant chickens. As transgenic siRNAs would be stably expressed in all body cells, they will be present to interfere with NP synthesis and limit viral replication upon viral invasion. Since scFvs are secreted into the blood after expression, they will bind to the HA of circulating virus, thereby preventing viral infection and spread. If they are efficiently expressed, the result might be significant inhibition of virus at the earliest stage of infection, before an acquired immune response can be mounted.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Three scFvs binding to the HA protein of AIV FJ13 strain with high affinity were selected by the yeast two-hybrid system and molecular docking technology.

Plasmid pGBKT7-HA was prepared by cloning RT- PCR fragments of the FJ13 virus genome RNA into pGBKT7 vector. The AH109 yeast strain was co-transfected with the bait construct and empty pGADT7 vector to test and exclude auto-activation of reporter genes. After verification, the Y187 yeast strain was transfected with pGBKT7-HA. The Y2H screen was performed on HA and scFvs gene libraries using pGBKT7-HA and pGADT7-ScFv (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Briefly, the pre-transformed scFvs library in the AH109 yeast strain was mixed and mated with Y187 containing pGBKT7-HA. After 24 h, the culture was spread on SD/-Leu/-Trp plates and the surviving colonies were further verified on SD/-Leu/-Trp/-His/-Ade medium. After 3 days, the colonies were streak cultured on a new SD/-Leu/-Trp/-His/-Ade plate for 2 days. A sterile filter paper was fitted closely over the plate which had previously been dipped into Zbuffer/X-gal (Sino-American, China). The positive clones gradually turned blue between 30 min and 8 h.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Homology modeling and molecular docking</title><p>Both computational predictions were performed with DiscoveryStudio package with default settings.
