<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>An siRNA-based microbicide has been shown to protect mice from lethal herpes simplex virus 2 infection or transmission [9], and siRNAs specific for conserved regions of influenza virus genes prevented and even treated influenza viral infection in mice [6]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>ScFvs consist of VH and VL chains joined via a flexible peptide linker. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Their advantages are high antigen binding activity, expression efficiency, strong penetrability and a short in vivo half-life [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>The scFvs producted by murine hybridoma cell lines are capable of binding target antigens with an affinity similar to that of the parent mAb [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>In addition, the single VH and VL region of the chicken immunoglobulin gene simplifies building a library, in contrast to that of mammals [17,18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>We generated VH and VL fragments from AIV H5N1 FJ13 immunized chickens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Assembly of VH, VL and linker fragments by overlap extension PCR yielded a library with a titer of 6.53×109 cfu/ml, high enough for the Y2H screen. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>For generating synthetic scFvs, several different molecular display formats have been described, including phage-display, ribosome display and cell-surface display [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>The yeast two-hybrid system is a simple, cost-effective technique to screen for the scFv library, and antibodies synthesized in this system generally exhibit good expression levels and specific binding activities in eukaryotic cells [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>In a comparative study using the same immune scFv cDNA library, yeast display was shown to sample the immune antibody repertoire considerably more fully than phage display, selecting all the scFv identified by phage display and twice as many novel antibodies [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>However, Y2H library screening also generates a significant number of false-positive interactions, including “biological” false-positives: protein–protein interactions that occur in yeast cells, but do not occur in vivo in the organism of study, and “technical” false-positives: protein–protein interactions identified in Y2H screens due to technical limitations of the system [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>It is very important, therefore, that a verification test be conducted to confirm the specificity of scFvs binding to the HA protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>The number of positive clones screened by Y2H is too large and difficult to verify individually, and using bioinformatics software for further screening greatly reduced the labor intensity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>By ZDOCK software analysis, we chose the three with lowest HA binding energy from the 14 Y2H positive ones. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>The results of functional verification indicated Y2H combined with ZDOCK software analysis was reliable and effective. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>To detect the co-antiviral effect induced by siRNA in combination with scFv1, NP-604 cells were transiently transfected with the scFv1 expression plasmid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Virus titers in the culture supernatants of NP604 cells transfected with scFv1 were reduced by 70-fold compared with titers in NP604 cells or scFv1 cells alone at 60 h post inoculation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Our study opens a new approach to influenza prevention and treatment by using scFv and siRNA together. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>We predict this concept can also provide a basis for breeding transgenic AIV-resistant chickens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>As transgenic siRNAs would be stably expressed in all body cells, they will be present to interfere with NP synthesis and limit viral replication upon viral invasion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Since scFvs are secreted into the blood after expression, they will bind to the HA of circulating virus, thereby preventing viral infection and spread. </plain></SENT>
