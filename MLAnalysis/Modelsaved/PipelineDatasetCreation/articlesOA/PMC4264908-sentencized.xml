</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follicular dendritic cells (FDC) are a unique population of non-migratory, non-phagocytic stromal cells.1–3 These cells have long dendrites that are used to form large networks within the B-cell follicles and germinal centres (GC) of secondary lymphoid tissues such as the spleen and lymph nodes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>FDC express complement receptors (CR; CR1/CD35 and CR2/CD21) and immunoglobulin Fc receptors (e.g. FcγRIIb), which they use to capture antigen in the form of immune complexes (antigen–antibody and/or opsonizing complement components) on their surfaces.4 Antigens are retained on FDC in a native state for long periods of time to promote immunoglobulin-isotype class switching, the positive selection of B cells with high antigen affinity and the maintenance of immunological memory.5,6 The up-regulation of adhesion molecules by FDC further facilitates interactions between B cells and the FDC-retained antigens.7 The competitive binding of antigen on the FDC surface in the GC allows those B cells with the highest specific antigen affinity to receive pro-survival signals from FDC via cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-15, whereas those with low antigen affinity are targeted for their clearance via apoptosis.8,9 In addition, FDC also secrete the chemokine CXCL13, which stimulates the chemotaxis of CXCR5-expressing B cells into follicles and GC.10,11 The secretion of milk fat globule epidermal growth factor-like factor 8 (MFGE8) by FDC mediates the engulfment of apoptotic B cells within the GC by tingible body macrophages.8 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the secondary lymphoid tissues FDC develop from precursors cells surrounding the blood vessels and they require further stimulation from lymphoid tissue inducer cells and lymphotoxin (LT) for expansion.2 FDC and their precursor cells express the LTβ receptor (LTβR) and stimulation through this receptor by B-cell-derived LTα1β2 maintains FDC in their differentiated state. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the absence of constitutive LTβR-mediated stimulation FDC rapidly de-differentiate.12,13 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs are short, non-coding RNA species, approximately 18–25 nucleotides in length, that act by targeting partially complementary sequences within mRNAs and most commonly lead to translational repression and/or degradation of the target mRNAs.14 There are over 1000 different microRNAs expressed in human tissues and each microRNA is thought to target hundreds of genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Consequently, microRNAs are predicted to regulate the activity of approximately 50% of all known protein-coding genes in mammals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs are most commonly transcribed as independent genes or from protein-coding genes, and microRNA genes may be clustered within specific genomic regions.14 MicroRNA transcripts are processed into stem-loop microRNA precursors by the RNAse III endonuclease DROSHA, and then exported to the cytoplasm where a second endonuclease, Dicer, cleaves the pre-microRNA into the mature form. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Mature microRNAs are assembled into ribonucleoprotein complexes where they interact with specific mRNA targets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs are often transcribed in a tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific manner,15 and a small number have been described as master regulators of developmental processes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Abundant expression of microRNAs has been described in many immune cell populations and has been shown to be involved in the regulation of a number of immune functions.16–18 For example, studies in mice show that within the GC microRNAs play a role in the regulation of gene expression by B cells and follicular helper T cells.19 Although available data suggest that human FDC-like cells (HK cells) may induce the expression of certain microRNAs in GC B cells to promote survival,20 information on the expression of microRNAs by FDC has not previously been reported. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Similarly, nothing was known of the effects of LTβR stimulation on microRNA expression in the spleen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in the current study in vivo and in vitro systems were used to identify potential microRNAs that may modulate gene expression in FDC. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>In mice IL-6 plays a physiologically relevant role in generating optimal GC reactions, and promoting antibody responses, and somatic hypermutation and class-switch recombination in the immunoglobulin genes of GC B cells.40,41 As immune complex-activated FDC have been shown to produce IL-6,43 it is plausible that mmu-miR-100-5p may play a role in control of the GC reaction by regulating their expression of Il6 mRNA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Toll-like receptor 4 binds bacterial lipopolysaccharide, and signalling through this receptor promotes the expression of many pro-inflammatory genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Oxidized phospholipids, such as those generated during apoptosis, can also act as TLR4 ligands and have been detected in FDC-containing GC.3 Activated FDC in mice express TLR4, and stimulation through this receptor either via lipopolysaccharide or oxidized phospholipids up-regulates their expression of adhesion molecules and Fc receptors.3,42 The absence of TLR4 expression on FDC led to a decrease in both the number and size of GC, a reduced frequency of FDC–GC B-cell interactions, reduced somatic hypermutation and a decrease in high-affinity antibody responses.3,42 Furthermore, the absence of TLR4 function on FDC alters their transcriptome impairing their expression of Ltbr, the adhesion molecule gene Icam1 and cytokine genes involved in the GC reaction and antibody responses (ll6 and Il15).3 Data presented here suggest that mmu-miR-100-5p indirectly down-regulates the expression of Tlr4 mRNA in FL-YB cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Hence it is plausible that the modulation of Tlr4 mRNA by mmu-miR-100-5p in FDC may play an important role in regulating the GC reaction. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>For example, its expression by FDC in association with follicular helper T-cell-derived IL-21 plays a role in the negative selection of GC B cells.9 Cyclooxygenase 2 (encoded by Ptgs2) converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2, which can then be subsequently converted into different prostaglandins and prostacyclin.47 Inhibition of mmu-miR-100-5p in FL-YB cells significantly increased their expression of Ptgs1/2 mRNA, providing a further example of how the expression of this microRNA may help to regulate the GC reaction. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Although data presented here suggest that mmu-miR-100-5p modulates the expression of Il6, Ptgs1/2 and Tlr4 mRNA, a range of target prediction algorithms failed to identify any plausible target genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Little is known of the genes targeted by mmu-mir-100-5p, although predictions from individual algorithms include the gene encoding the mammalian target of rapamysin (Mtor) where this microRNA is considered to play a role in neovascularization in endothelial vascular smooth muscle cells in mice48 and certain tumours in humans.49 In the current study the expression level of Mtor was unchanged in the spleen after LTβR-blockade and was undetectable in FL-YB cells (data not shown), suggesting that the effects on gene expression described above were unlikely to be due to the targeting of Mtor mRNA by mmu-mir-100-5p. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>No likely binding sites for mmu-miR-100-5p were identified in the sequences of Il6, Ptgs1/2 and Tlr4, suggesting that this microRNA may be indirectly influencing the expression of these genes by targeting another gene upstream of their expression. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this microRNA was confirmed to be expressed in the FDC-like cell line, FL-YB, and specific inhibition of mmu-miR-100-5p in this cell line significantly enhanced the expression of Il6, Ptgs1/2 and Tlr4 mRNA. </plain></SENT>
