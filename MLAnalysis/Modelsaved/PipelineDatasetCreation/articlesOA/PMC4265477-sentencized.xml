</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Arthritis is one of the most prevalent musculoskeletal disorders, currently affecting 15% of people aged 15 years and older (~4.6 million Canadians), with an economic cost of $33 billion annually in Canada [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The most common form is knee osteoarthritis (OA), affecting 16% of adults over the age of 45 [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by degeneration of the knee joint cartilage, leading to severe pain, stiffness and swelling [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Commonly, symptoms will be severe enough to cause long-term disability [5, 6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Currently, the gold standard treatment for severe OA is total joint arthroplasty (TJA) [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>However, the majority of OA patients may be more suited for conservative management of OA, to either minimize symptoms in the short term, or ultimately prevent progression of OA to avoid the need for TJA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Attention has been directed toward biomechanical interventions as they are generally low cost and relatively easy to implement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Biomechanically, cross-sectional and prospective studies have suggested that knee OA development and progression are related to increased peak external knee adduction moments (KAMs) during the single-leg support phase of walking [4–6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>This increased KAM is believed to induce large stress in the medial compartment of the knee, which, over time, contributes to cartilage degeneration, pain and ultimately OA [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Supporting this concept, increased KAMs have been positively correlated with higher Kellgren Lawrence grades, and cartilage loss over 12 months (KAM impulses), and negatively correlated with tibial cartilage thickness [5, 6, 9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Thus, a focus for knee OA prevention and management has been to reduce these KAMs [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Across 13 international clinical guidelines for management of knee OA, wedged insoles (i.e. insoles that elevate either the lateral or medial aspect of the foot) have been consistently recommended for disease management since they can influence KAMs [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>On average across patients, laterally wedged insoles have been shown to reduce KAMs and reduce pain, while medially wedged insoles tend to increase KAMs; [4, 11] however, when considering subject specific reactions, 15-43% of patients, depending on the study, receiving either a medial or lateral wedge will experience KAM changes that are completely opposite to the group average result [12, 13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>This means that every year, thousands of North Americans with knee OA are being prescribed an incorrect wedge resulting in increased KAMs, and possibly accelerating and worsening their OA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, when reviewing past literature of major randomized trials for knee OA, no study has actually ensured that all patients experienced a reduction in KAMs in the experimental insole group, and this has likely had a large bias on study results [14, 15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is no surprise that a recent review has highlighted that large variability exists across studies in terms of the effectiveness of lateral wedge insoles [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Essentially, we still do not truly understand how or if wedged insoles and reduced KAMs can benefit patients with knee OA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Therefore a randomized trial is urgently needed that assigns wedged insoles on a personalized basis to ensure that KAMs are being reduced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Thus, the primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a personalized wedged insole intervention on pain in patients with medial knee OA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Specifically, KAMs must be measured for each participant to ensure KAM reduction occurs with the intervention insole, rather than providing all patients with the exact same insole and assume a constant KAM effect as previous trials have done. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>This approach of ensuring KAM reduction has never been attempted before and so the results from this study will help evaluate the true clinical benefit of KAM reduction, and also the true effectiveness of wedged insoles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>It is hypothesized that patients in the experimental group, where KAMs have been reduced using an individually prescribed wedged insole, will overall have greater improvements in pain and physical function over 3 months compared to the control group. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The trial will have two parallel groups, where participants are randomly assigned to a waitlist control or experimental arm for a study duration of 3 months (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Patients with painful radiographic medial knee osteoarthritis will be recruited from either the University of Calgary Sport Medicine Centre patient population (a Knee Osteoarthritis clinic is part of the services provided by this centre) or the Alberta Hip and Knee Arthroplasty clinics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Identified patients will be approached for inclusion into the study based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria described below. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>If recruitment is too slow to meet study timelines, advertisements of the project will be put into local newspapers and to other media. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>In these cases, a phone assessment of the volunteer will be undertaken for preliminary screening, and the individual will be invited for a detailed assessment by the study physician to determine their eligibility.Figure 1 Flow of participants through the study.  </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>All patients considered eligible for the study must have physician-diagnosed knee OA primarily localized to the medial tibiofemoral compartment, based on the American College of Rheumatology clinical and radiographic diagnostic criteria [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Patients showing lateral compartment or patellofemoral OA in addition to medial knee OA will still be considered eligible as long as the medial compartment is the primary disease location and symptoms are attributed to the medial compartment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients must be between the ages of 40–85 years of age, have no history of viscosupplement injections within the past 6 months, cortisone injection within the past 3 months, narcotic pain medication within the past 3 months, or use of other footwear insoles or unloader knee braces within the past 2 months, and must have a Kellgren-Lawrence grade (a measure of OA severity) of 1 to 3, as determined by a clinician, to avoid inclusion of end-stage OA patients that may be more appropriate for surgery [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Patients may continue to use anti-inflammatory medication or acetaminophen for mild pain management if needed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Those who meet the intrarticular injection criteria must also be willing to not undergo further treatment during the 3-month study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Patients must also present with a KOOS pain subscale score of 75 points or lower. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>This will help ensure that all participants have at least mildly painful knee OA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Any participant with recent (within 2 months) musculoskeletal or neuromuscular injury to the lower extremity that could bias pain assessments or gait analysis will not be considered eligible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>For this reason, patients who typically use a cane will also be excluded. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Footwear insole interventions </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Two footwear insole interventions will be utilized within the experimental arm of this study: (1) the first is a medial wedge insole placed within the participants own shoe. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>The insole will be developed using a 3D printer, where the wedge thickness is 0.5 mm on the lateral edge, and 6.5 mm on the medial edge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The insole will taper at the metatarsal heads to a thickness of 4.5 mm to ensure a comfortable fit within the participant’s shoe. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>A wedge thickness of about 6 mm has been used previously and has been shown to be large enough to influence knee mechanics, yet small enough to maintain comfort [14, 19–21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>During testing and long term use, this insole will be placed under the existing sock liner of the participant’s shoe. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>(2) The second condition is a lateral wedge insole placed within the participants own shoe. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>The insole will be developed using a 3D printer, where the thickness of the medial edge is 0.5 mm and the thickness of the lateral edge is 6.5 mm, tapering to 4.5 mm beyond the metatarsal heads. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>During testing and long term use, this insole will be placed under the existing sock liner of the participant’s shoe. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>For construction of the medial and lateral wedge, the wedge will extend along the full length of the foot, creating approximately 5–6 degree medial and lateral wedges [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>All insoles will be produced by New Balance Athletic Shoe Inc. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>(Boston, MA). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>The material utilized for the insoles is stiff in compression, such that the wedge shape will be maintained throughout the 3 month study; however, the material is also flexible to ensure comfort within the shoe during flexion of the metatarsal joints. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>The authors must emphasize the relationship between the intervention we intend to utilize (wedged insoles), and the mechanical effect we aim to achieve (reduced KAMs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>It is this mechanical result (reduced KAMs) that is suggested in the literature to affect knee OA – not wedged insoles on their own. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Thus it is critical to bear in mind that the wedged insoles are simply a means to achieve the desired mechanical outcome. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has been reported by a meta-analysis that future knee OA trials should utilize a flat insole as a control condition [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>The motivation for this claim was based on the notion that this would control for placebo effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>However, recent evidence has suggested that even flat insoles can alter pressure distributions under the foot during gait [23], and thus it remains a possibility that KAMs could be influenced as well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Therefore, while flat insoles may control for placebo effects, they may not control for gait biomechanics, which is the primary concern of our trial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the control condition for our study will be the participant’s own footwear, as this will control for gait biomechanics changes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Therefore, for biomechanical reasons, the trial will not be placebo controlled. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>In effort to ensure recruitment, compliance and participant retention in our control condition, we will utilize a waitlist control strategy, where we will indicate that a 3 month wait is required prior to providing an insole. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>After 3 months, we will provide control participants with access to a wedged insole, and continue to monitor them for safety. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>In the KAM-R group, participants will be given either a medial or lateral wedge insole (whichever insole reduces KAMs more for each individual participant) to put inside their own shoe and use for 3 months. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>In the waitlist control group, participants will be asked to continue using their own shoes for a period of 3 months, and following this will be provided with access to a wedged insole (whichever reduces KAMs more based on baseline data collection). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Participants will be randomized using a multi-block-randomization procedure into either the KAM-R or waitlist control group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Specifically, a separate block sequence will be used for males and females to ensure an even sex distribution across groups. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>The one exception to this block randomization procedure is that if neither wedged insole produces a KAM reduction, the participant will be excluded from the main study altogether. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>This scenario will not be common, as most people do experience a large change in KAMs with one of the two wedged insole types, but this strategy will ensure that all participants in the KAM-R and waitlist control groups are all biomechanically suitable for a wedged insole intervention. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Thus, neither group will contain biomechanical non-responders to wedged insoles. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of the participant’s KAM change is required to ensure that the study sample consists entirely of those who experience a reduction in KAMs with at least one insole type. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>After collecting biomechanical data, KAM results will be assessed to verify that the participant experienced a KAM reduction in at least one wedged insole type. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>As described previously, in cases where the participant does not experience a KAM reduction with either insole, they will be excluded from the main study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Thus our knowledge of KAM changes will not affect our initial randomization, and only be used as a verification tool. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Although researchers will be aware of each participant’s study group following randomization (in order to assign the participants in the KAM-R group an insole to take home), the researchers will be blinded during future survey data collection and data analysis as identifying information will be stripped by an independent researcher and replaced with unique patient ID numbers and numerical values for group allocation. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>The primary goal of this randomized controlled trial is to identify the influence of reduced KAMs on management of knee OA symptoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>In this study, wedged footwear insoles will be used as the intervention to induce reduced KAMs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Wedged insoles are a relatively inexpensive and easy-to-use intervention, and have been a recommended management strategy in numerous international clinical guidelines for OA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>However, some randomized trials conducted on wedged insoles have shown inconsistent results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>The primary reason for this is that previous studies used exclusively a lateral wedge insole and did not test each participant’s biomechanics to ensure that the lateral wedge actually reduced KAMs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Indeed, it has been found in numerous studies that lateral wedges may in fact increase KAMs during gait for some participants, which could induce OA worsening, and wash out any actual treatment effects of reduced KAMs that may be observed in other participants [12, 13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Thus, in our study, we are testing both medial and lateral wedge insoles, and prescribing the insole that reduces KAMs the most. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>This will ensure that all participants in our KAM-R group experience reduced KAMs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Another reason why other wedged insole studies have shown mixed results on OA management is that these studies used inadequate control interventions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Specifically, some studies have given all control participants a flat neutral insole. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Other studies have provided a new shoe to all participants as a control condition [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>While in theory this is appropriate as an attempt to protect against placebo effects and provided a method for blinding, it does carry the possibility that some participants will experience altered KAMs during gait. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>For instance, McCormick et al. [23] have shown that control insoles alter pressure distributions relative to a no insole condition, and this pressure shift could affect KAM magnitude [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in our study, we have chosen to utilize the participant’s own shoe as a control condition to ensure biomechanics remain unchanged. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Our regression analyses will provide some insight into whether placebo effects do exist with wedged insoles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>For instance, if the slope of the line of best fit is not near zero, it would suggest that change is pain is related to a reduction in KAM regardless of whether a placebo effect exists or not. </plain></SENT>
