This syndrome is characterized by developmental delay and/or learning problems in most cases (&gt;90%). Behavioral abnormalities such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been described as well. Congenital heart disease is found in about 25% of cases. Mild dysmorphism such as arched eyebrows, broad nasal bridge, upturned nares, and prominent forehead are found in some patients. In addition macrocephaly and cleft lip and/or palate have been reported.</p><p>The core duplicated interval in the syndrome comprises 26 HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) and four micro RNA (MIR) genes. Of the HGNC genes four appear to be dosage sensitive, i.e. GATA-binding protein 4 (<italic>GATA4</italic>, OMIM*600576), Tankyrase, TRF1-Interacting, Ankyrin-Related ADP-Ribose Polymerase (<italic>TNKS1</italic>, OMIM*60330), SRY-box 7 transcription factor (<italic>SOX7</italic>, OMIM*612202), and XK, Kell Blood Group Complex Subunit-Related Family, Member 6 (<italic>XKR6</italic>). Increased expression of these genes is thought to account for features observed in the 8p23.1 duplication syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. <italic>TNKS1</italic> is implicated in behavioral anomalies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], <italic>SOX7</italic> in developmental delay, and <italic>GATA4</italic> in concert with <italic>SOX7</italic> might cause congenital heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The role, if any, of <italic>XKR6</italic> is not known in the 8p23.1 duplication syndrome. Furthermore, MIR genes <italic>MIR124-1</italic> and <italic>MIR598</italic> might contribute to compromised neurocognition in the syndrome. However, nothing is known about their expression level. The other two MIR genes (<italic>MIR597, MIR1322</italic>) within this region are not known to be involved in developmental processes that are disturbed in the 8p23.1 duplication syndrome.</p><p>Here we describe a patient with a 1.80 Mbp <italic>de novo</italic> duplication within 8p23.1 and typical features of the 8p23.1 duplication syndrome. The duplicated region includes <italic>TNKS1</italic> and <italic>SOX7</italic> but not <italic>GATA4</italic> and only a portion of <italic>XKR6</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Case presentation</title><p>The propositus was born at 41&#160;weeks of gestation. His body weight was 2800&#160;g (100&#160;g below 3<sup>rd</sup> centile), length 48&#160;cm (3<sup>rd</sup> percentile) and head circumference 35.5&#160;cm (25<sup>th</sup> to 50<sup>th</sup> percentile). He is the third child of non-consanguineous healthy parents. A breech necessitated delivery by caesarean section. His older siblings, a brother and a sister, are healthy.</p><p>Muscular hypotonia was noticed during infancy. Motor development was delayed. He started to crawl late and began to walk during the third year of life. Speech development was also delayed. He started to vocalize simple words such as &#8220;mama&#8221; and &#8220;papa&#8221; well after three years of age. A recently performed hearing test was normal. At age 7 his developmental state was assessed according to the Denver Developmental Screening Test. Fine motor skills and speech corresponded to a 6&#160;year old. Social competence and gross motor development were delayed by 1.5&#160;years.</p><p>He is currently 11&#160;years old and attends fourth grade in a school for children with special needs. His concentration span is short and memory retention is reduced as compared to healthy children of the same age. He displays bursts of aggressive behavior usually directed towards his sister. Otherwise he barely interacts with his siblings and classmates. He is able to read and understand simple sentences. While in the office with his mother he concentrated on writing and produced a nonsensical text (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). During the last few years his motor skills have improved markedly. He is now able to swim and ride a bicycle. He is interested in machines and dexterous at performing manual tasks. His appearance is mostly normal. He has a broad nose, a prominent forehead, and a dimple on his chin (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Clinical findings.

All SNPs analyzed were of maternal origin. Thus, the duplication occurred on a maternal chromosome 8.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The patient has typical features of the 8p23.1 duplication syndrome. Both motor and linguistic development are markedly delayed. This is found in &gt;90% of patients. He is intellectually disabled. In addition he displays symptoms of autism spectrum disorder which has not been reported in other cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. He is not able to control his emotions and barely interacts with other children. His self-absorbed writing of a nonsensical text during the office visit further supports the diagnosis autism spectrum disorder (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B).</p><p>The duplicated region in the patient (1.80 Mbp) is about half the size of the previously defined critical interval (3.68 Mbp) delineated in currently 12 thoroughly investigated patients [summarized in 1]. DECIPHER Database currently lists 31 cases with 8p23.1 duplications overlapping the region found in the patient. The newly defined interval includes 7 HGNC and 4 MIR genes. Of the dose sensitive genes it contains <italic>SOX7</italic> and <italic>TNKS1</italic> but not <italic>GATA4. MIR124-1</italic> and <italic>MIR598</italic> that potentially contribute to disease are also within this interval. <italic>XKR6</italic> is only partially included since the proximal duplication breakpoint lies within the gene. The patient carries one truncated (only exons 2 to 3) and two complete copies of this gene. <italic>XKR6</italic> is therefore unlikely to contribute to the phenotype.</p><p>It is noteworthy that the duplication in 8p23.1 duplication syndrome is of maternal origin both in the present patient and in two previously studied cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Given that the patient displays typical features of the 8p23.1 duplication syndrome, the two genes <italic>TNKS1</italic> and <italic>SOX7</italic> might suffice to cause motor and linguistic developmental delay, mild intellectual disability, and minor dysmorphic features. A contributing role of <italic>MIR124-1</italic> and <italic>MIR598</italic> is possible<italic>.</italic> Both genes have been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders and might be a contributing factor to autism spectrum disorder in the patient. However, nothing is known about their function when present in three copies. Consistent with normal expression of <italic>GATA4</italic> that functions in cardiac development the patient does not have congenital heart disease. Other signs and symptoms observed in some cases of the 8p23.1 duplication syndrome are also missing in the present case. These include ADHD, ocular anomalies, cleft lip and palate and seizures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion the finding of a duplication within 8p23.1 half the size of the common duplication in the 8p23.1 duplication syndrome further documents an important pathogenic role of <italic>SOX7</italic> and <italic>TNKS1</italic>. Absence of congenital heart disease is consistent with two copies and thus normal expression of <italic>GATA4</italic> in the patient.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis was performed using the HumanOmniExpress Bead Chip array (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA) according to manufacturer&#8217;s instructions.
