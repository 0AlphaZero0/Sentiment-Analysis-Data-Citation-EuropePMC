analysis. Outbreaks were reported at 4 farms, resulting in the culling of 628 pigs and 1
cattle. Pigs were the only species infected during the outbreak. The incursion of

disease is highly contagious and affects cloven-hoofed animals, notably pigs, cattle, sheep
and goats. Clinically, FMD is characterized by vesicles in the mouth and on the muzzle, feet
and, sometimes, udders. Severe myocarditis causes high mortality among infected newborns.
While the infection in adult animals is rarely lethal, it does results in significant losses
due to both a decrease in production and the ban on international trade of animals and animal
products [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a member of the genus <italic>Aphthovirus</italic>
within the family <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>. The non-enveloped virus contains a
single-stranded, plus-sense RNA genome with a length of approximately 8,500 bases. Seven FMDV
serotypes have been identified: O, A, C, Asia 1, SAT1, SAT2 and SAT3 [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Each serotype also has a number of subtypes. In Asia, prevalent
topotypes of serotype O are Cathay, Southeast Asia (SEA), Middle East-South Asia and PanAsia
[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Two topotypes of FMDV serotype O, namely Cathay and PanAsia, have been identified in Taiwan.
A pig-adapted strain of the Cathay topotype [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>],
designated O/Taiwan/1997, invades in 1997, and the invasion results in a severe epidemic among
the pig farms and a devastating economic loss of 378 million US dollars [<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The O/Taiwan/1999 and O/Taiwan/2000 strains of the PanAsia topotype
[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] were isolated from Chinese yellow cattle, dairy
cattle and goats in 1999 and 2000. The 2 strains are phylogenetically close to FMDVs from the Middle East and India [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Isolates obtained in 2009 are genetically close to the Cathay topotype and may be
a derivative of O/Taiwan/1997 [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we report the identification of the first SEA topotype of the FMDV in
Kinmen Island and infer the incursion of a new topotype of FMDV serotype O into Taiwan&#8217;s
territory.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p><italic>Geography and livestock industry of Kinmen</italic>: Kinmen County comprises 12
islands, including the 2 largest: Kinmen and Lieyu. Kinmen Island is a 150-km<sup>2</sup>
island near the coast of Fujian Province, People&#8217;s Republic of China. This dumbbell-shaped
island spans approximately 20 km east to west and approximately 15 km north to south,
although the narrowest region in the center is only 3 km wide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Map of Kinmen County. The letters represent the locations of the 4 pig farms invaded

outbreak. The bar scale represents 2 km.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-1479-g001"/></fig>).</p><p>Pigs, cattle and meat goats are the major livestock in Kinmen County with populations of
approximately 16,700, 5,900 and 8,800 heads, respectively (Agriculture Statistics Yearbook
2012). Most owners are backyard farmers raising a small number of animals, ranging from only
a few to hundreds.</p><p><italic>Course of the outbreaks</italic>: On January 23, 2012, several porkers on Farm A
(289 pigs, including 2 boars and 10 sows) showed lameness and decreased appetite. On January
26, a local governmental veterinarian from the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection,
Kinmen County (BK), visited the farm, and the FMD vaccine was administered. On January 29,
hoof tissues, nasal swabs and serum samples were collected and submitted to the Animal
Health Research Institute (AHRI). Responding to the clinical observation and the positive
results of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and antibody detection,
on January 30, 74 affected pigs were destroyed, and the remained pigs on the farm were
destroyed on the next day.</p><p>Farm B (241 pigs, including 3 boars and 23 sows) is 200 m southwestern of Farm A. A sow on
Farm B showed fever and anorexia on January 21. On February 1, the owner of Farm B observed
lameness in the pigs and notified the BK. The BK veterinarians observed vesicles and ulcers
on the coronary bands of hooves and detached hooves. On February 3, all the 241 pigs were
destroyed.</p><p>In response to the outbreaks, restriction zones were imposed on a 3-km-radius movement
restriction zones around Farms A and B, and an on-farm investigation was conducted within
the zones. On February 7, typical FMD lesions were observed in sows on Farm C (34 pigs,
composed of 6 sows, 11 weaning pigs and 17 porkers), located 400 m southeastern of Farm A.
The pigs at Farm C were sampled and destroyed on February 7. Clinically FMD-suspected
animals were also observed at 5 other farms, designated S1 to S5 (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Isolates of the foot-and-mouth disease virus employed in the phylogenetic

sampled.</p><p>On February 10, veterinarians observed healing lesions and re-growing hooves in pigs of
Farm D (64 porkers and 1 Chinese yellow cattle), located on the eastern Kinmen Island.
Samples were collected from 15 clinically healthy pigs, 15 pigs with lesions and the cattle
on the farm and shipped to the AHRI. All of the pigs and cattle of Farm D were destroyed on
the same day. Locations of Farms A, B, C and D are marked in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>Sampling</italic>: During the field investigation, diagnostic samples were
collected from animals suspected to be ill and submitted to the AHRI. Blood samples were
collected from external jugular vessels of pigs, external jugular vein or coccygeal vein of
cattle and jugular vein of goats. The sera were collected by centrifugation after sampling
and tested for neutralizing antibodies and antibodies to 3ABC non-structural protein. Swab
samples were collected from the nostrils or throats of suspected animals. Vesicle fluid,
ruptured vesicles and hooves were also sampled from pigs showing visible vesicular lesions,
using appropriate restraint.</p><p>To compare levels of humoral immunity against FMDV between populations in Kinmen County,
319 pig sera, 529 cattle sera and 240 goat sera were collected during an annual surveillance
program from July to December 2011 and tested by virus neutralization test (VNT).</p><p><italic>VNT</italic>: The VNT was used to measure levels of neutralizing antibodies against
FMDV. The test was performed following the Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for
Terrestrial Animals, published by the World Organization for Animal Health. Briefly, serum
samples were serially diluted in 96-well microtiter plates, and a virus suspension
containing 100 TCID<sub>50</sub> of FMDV O/Taiwan/1997 strain was added to each well. After
a 1-hr incubation, a suspension of BHK-21 baby hamster kidney cells was added, and the
plates were incubated at 37&#176;C in a humid incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 2 days. The
neutralizing antibody titer was expressed as the log2 of the reciprocal serum dilution that
protected cells from the cytopathic effect.</p><p><italic>Detection of antibodies to 3ABC non-structural protein</italic>: A commercially
available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit, PrioCHECK FMDV-NS (Prionics
Lelystad B.V., Lelystad, The Netherlands), was used to detect serum antibodies to the 3ABC
non-structural protein of the FMDV. The kit used a blocking ELISA with baculovirus-expressed
3ABC polypeptide [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p><italic>Virus isolation</italic>: Fluid was extracted from the nasal and throat swabs and
sterilized with a membrane filter. Ruptured vesicles and hoof tissues were homogenized and
centrifuged, and their supernatants were filter-sterilized. The filtrate was inoculated into
a baby hamster kidney cell line BHK-21 and an embryonic bovine kidney cell line EBK, and the
cultures were observed daily for 3 days. Whenever a cytopathic effect was observed, the
supernatant of the cell culture was analyzed for the possible presence of FMDV using 1-step
RT-PCR. If cytopathic effect was not exhibited, a blind passage was carried out for an
additional 3 days.</p><p><italic>FMD antigen-detecting ELISA</italic>: When an FMDV was isolated, its serotype was
firstly identified by the Indirect Sandwich ELISA for Detection of Antigens of FMDV and
SVDV, purchased from the Pirbright Institute, U.K. The ELISA was performed in accordance
with the instruction manual.</p><p><italic>RNA extraction</italic>: Viral RNA was extraction from 200 <italic>&#181;l</italic> of
vesicle fluid or supernatant of the inoculated cell culture by the Quick-RNA&#8482; MiniPrep kit
(Zymo Research Corporation, Irvine, CA, U.S.A.). The extracted RNA was dissolved in 100
<italic>&#181;l</italic> of DEPC-treated water.</p><p><italic>RT-PCR</italic>: The full-length VP1 gene of the FMDV was amplified by 1-step
RT-PCR, using a primer pair based on the nucleotide sequences of 1C and 2A genes of
O/Taiwan97/106/112 strain (GenBank Accession No. AY593835, [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]). The sequence of the forward primer FVP1-F was 5&#8242;-AGGGATGGGTCTGTTTGTT-3&#8242;,
corresponding to the O/Taiwan97/106/112 strain nucleotides 3,108 to 3,126; the sequence of
the reverse primer FVP1-R was 5&#8242;-AAGTCGGGTCCGTGTTTCGTT-3&#8242;, corresponding to nucleotides
3,991 to 4,011. A KAPA2G&#8482; Fast PCR Kit (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, U.S.A.) was used
for the RT-PCR and 4 U of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega,
Madison, WI, U.S.A.), and 8 U of RNase inhibitor (Promega) were added to each reaction. The
1-step RT-PCR was carried out using the GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems, Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.) with the following procedure: reverse transcription for
40 min at 42&#176;C, denaturation for 3 min at 94&#176;C, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation for 40
sec at 94&#176;C, annealing for 40 sec at 50&#176;C and extension for 20 sec at 72&#176;C. A final
extension step was performed at 72&#176;C for 5 min. Products of the 1-step RT-PCR were analyzed
by agarose gel electrophoresis. The predicted length of the 1-step RT-PCR amplicon was 904
base pairs.</p><p><italic>Nucleotide sequencing</italic>: Nucleotide sequences of the RT-PCR products were
determined by commercial DNA sequencing service (Mission Biotech, Taipei, Taiwan).</p><p><italic>Phylogenetic analysis</italic>: Phylogenetic relationships between the nucleotide
sequences were analyzed by neighbor-joining method with the software Molecular Evolutionary
Genetics Analysis version 5 or MEGA 5. Nucleotide sequences of FMDV VP1 genes used for the
analysis are listed in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Sequences of

sampled at each of the 4 infected farms. The mean neutralizing antibody titer, measured by
the VNT, of the sampled pigs of the Farms A, B, C and D was 1:18. The 319 pig sera, 529
cattle sera and 240 goat sera sampled from July to December 2011 gave mean neutralizing
antibody titers of 1:37, 1:104 and 1:119, respectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>It was the first identification of the SEA topotype of an FMDV in Taiwan. The nucleotide
comparison demonstrated that the FMDV VP1 nucleotide sequences from Kinmen were 96.9%
similar to the SEA topotype of the FMDV from Hong Kong (Accession No. JF968186). The
phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref>) further revealed that
the Kinmen virus was clustered together with other Asian FMDVs of the SEA topotype,
including those from China, Japan, Korea, Mongolia and Russia. Foot-and-mouth disease
viruses of this topotype were not only endemic in southeastern Asia, but also invaded East
Asian countries recently, as seen in China, Japan, Korea, Mongolia and Russia in 2010&#8211;2011
[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].
The found FMDV in Kinmen, based on the phylogenetic closeness to the East Asian isolates,
was likely a new member of this genetic pool. The outbreaks in Kinmen highlighted the
territorial expansion and the continuous threat of this topotype in East Asian
countries.</p><p>Farms A, B and C may share the same FMDV strain. Farm A, the index case of the outbreak,
was first reported on January 23 and was identified as an FMD affected farm on January 31,
2012. Farms B and C demonstrated clinical symptoms in early February. The 99.8% similarity
between VP1 nucleotide sequences from these 3 farms further supports that the viruses shared
a common ancestor. Additionally, the positive rates of non-structural protein antibodies,
13.3% (4/30) and 37.5% (3/8), implied that Farm A was the first infected farm, because the
non-structural protein antibodies usually appear 1 week after infection [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. With the
geographical proximity, chronological sequence of the disease occurrence and close genetic
relationship, it was considered that the virus first attacked Farm A and later spread to
Farms B and C.</p><p>In contrast, Farm D was considered to be affected earlier than Farm A. The healing lesions
observed in pigs of Farm D on February 10 indicated that the infection may have occurred
about 1 month prior, around early January. A high percentage (43.3%; 13/30) of pigs
possessing non-structural protein antibodies also implied that the invading FMDV had been
actively circulating among the pigs. Accordingly, we considered that Farm D was the first
infected farm, although it was the last identified. Unfortunately, it has not been possible
to establish the relationship between the infection at Farm D and those of Farms A, B and C,
because neither the FMDV was isolated nor its viral RNA was detected from Farm D.</p><p>Insufficient immunity may allow for the entrance of the FMDV. The mean neutralizing
antibody titer of the 4 infected farms was significantly lower than that of the pig
population in Kinmen (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001; <italic>t</italic>-test). Furthermore,
the mean titer of the pig population (1:37) in Kinmen was lower than those of the cattle and
goat populations (1:104 and 1:119, respectively; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) in the same
county. Frequent distribution of neutralizing antibody titers, as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Frequency distribution of titers of neutralizing antibody to the foot-and-mouth

titers in the pigs of the 4 infected pig farms of the 2012 foot-and-mouth disease
outbreak and in the pigs (n=319) sampled in Kinmen between July and December 2011, a
period a half year before the 2012 outbreak; (B) Distribution of titers in 319 pig,
529 cattle and 240 goats sampled in Kinmen between July and December 2011.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-1479-g003"/></fig>, also revealed that the titers in pigs, unlike those in cattle and goats, distributed
evenly, and 46.4% of the pigs possessed a titer of 1:32 or lower before the outbreak. The
finding could explain why the pig was the only suffering species during the outbreak. The
animals with low humoral immunity were not completely protected, possibly giving FMDV more
opportunities of infection to them.</p><p>The way of FMDV transmission between the farms has been unknown. Field investigation
suggested that farm-to-farm visiting and transportation of feeds were not likely to be the
cause of transmission. The prevalent north wind in winter might be a means of introduction,
and the likelihood of long-distance airborne transmission of FMDV has been considered [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Smuggling
of animal products including live livestock could be another mode of transmission,
considering the geographical proximity to China. However, there is minimal evidence to
confirm any route of transmission, as in most of the FMDV incursions.</p><p>In conclusion, the FMDV serotype O that invaded Kinmen in 2012 was identified as the first
SEA topotype in Taiwan&#8217;s territory. Pig was the only infected species during the
outbreak.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Drs. Chun Wang, Tsu-Han Chen and Shu-Chia Hu of AHRI and the
