</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>It was the first identification of the SEA topotype of an FMDV in Taiwan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>The nucleotide comparison demonstrated that the FMDV VP1 nucleotide sequences from Kinmen were 96.9% similar to the SEA topotype of the FMDV from Hong Kong (Accession No. JF968186). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>The phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2) further revealed that the Kinmen virus was clustered together with other Asian FMDVs of the SEA topotype, including those from China, Japan, Korea, Mongolia and Russia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>Foot-and-mouth disease viruses of this topotype were not only endemic in southeastern Asia, but also invaded East Asian countries recently, as seen in China, Japan, Korea, Mongolia and Russia in 2010–2011 [14, 21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>The found FMDV in Kinmen, based on the phylogenetic closeness to the East Asian isolates, was likely a new member of this genetic pool. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>The outbreaks in Kinmen highlighted the territorial expansion and the continuous threat of this topotype in East Asian countries. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Farms A, B and C may share the same FMDV strain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Farm A, the index case of the outbreak, was first reported on January 23 and was identified as an FMD affected farm on January 31, 2012. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Farms B and C demonstrated clinical symptoms in early February. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>The 99.8% similarity between VP1 nucleotide sequences from these 3 farms further supports that the viruses shared a common ancestor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the positive rates of non-structural protein antibodies, 13.3% (4/30) and 37.5% (3/8), implied that Farm A was the first infected farm, because the non-structural protein antibodies usually appear 1 week after infection [6, 16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>With the geographical proximity, chronological sequence of the disease occurrence and close genetic relationship, it was considered that the virus first attacked Farm A and later spread to Farms B and C. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Farm D was considered to be affected earlier than Farm A. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>The healing lesions observed in pigs of Farm D on February 10 indicated that the infection may have occurred about 1 month prior, around early January. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>A high percentage (43.3%; 13/30) of pigs possessing non-structural protein antibodies also implied that the invading FMDV had been actively circulating among the pigs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we considered that Farm D was the first infected farm, although it was the last identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, it has not been possible to establish the relationship between the infection at Farm D and those of Farms A, B and C, because neither the FMDV was isolated nor its viral RNA was detected from Farm D. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Insufficient immunity may allow for the entrance of the FMDV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>The mean neutralizing antibody titer of the 4 infected farms was significantly lower than that of the pig population in Kinmen (P&lt;0.001; t-test). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the mean titer of the pig population (1:37) in Kinmen was lower than those of the cattle and goat populations (1:104 and 1:119, respectively; P&lt;0.001) in the same county. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>Frequent distribution of neutralizing antibody titers, as demonstrated in Fig. 3Fig. 3.Frequency distribution of titers of neutralizing antibody to the foot-and-mouth disease virus serotype O in different species in Kinmen, Taiwan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>(A) Distribution of titers in the pigs of the 4 infected pig farms of the 2012 foot-and-mouth disease outbreak and in the pigs (n=319) sampled in Kinmen between July and December 2011, a period a half year before the 2012 outbreak; (B) Distribution of titers in 319 pig, 529 cattle and 240 goats sampled in Kinmen between July and December 2011., also revealed that the titers in pigs, unlike those in cattle and goats, distributed evenly, and 46.4% of the pigs possessed a titer of 1:32 or lower before the outbreak. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>The finding could explain why the pig was the only suffering species during the outbreak. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>The animals with low humoral immunity were not completely protected, possibly giving FMDV more opportunities of infection to them. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>The way of FMDV transmission between the farms has been unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Field investigation suggested that farm-to-farm visiting and transportation of feeds were not likely to be the cause of transmission. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>The prevalent north wind in winter might be a means of introduction, and the likelihood of long-distance airborne transmission of FMDV has been considered [8, 19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Smuggling of animal products including live livestock could be another mode of transmission, considering the geographical proximity to China. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>However, there is minimal evidence to confirm any route of transmission, as in most of the FMDV incursions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the FMDV serotype O that invaded Kinmen in 2012 was identified as the first SEA topotype in Taiwan’s territory. </plain></SENT>
