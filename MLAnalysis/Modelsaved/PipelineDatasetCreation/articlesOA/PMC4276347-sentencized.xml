</text></title><p id="P2"><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Murine B cell development is a leading developmental system for the analysis of gene-regulatory networks that orchestrate cell fate ‘choice’ and lineage commitment [1–3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Since progenitor cells and discrete developmental intermediates can be isolated and experimentally manipulated, the lymphoid system is particularly well suited for studies involving epigenetic, transcriptional, and protein networks that control cell fate choice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The analyses of early B cell development are thus highly advanced, as regulatory networks of signaling molecules and transcription factors have been elucidated that endeavor to account for the generation of B lineage progeny from multi-potent progenitors (MPP). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Importantly, genetically altered mouse lines that harbor deletions in key B cell development factors exist, enabling ex vivo expansion of cells arrested at discrete points during lymphopoiesis and B cell specification (Figure 1) [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P3"><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Published work suggests that B lymphocytes develop from lymphoid-primed multi-potent progenitors (LMPPs) in the bone marrow that also give rise to myeloid progeny such as macrophages and granulocytes [3,4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Restriction of these LMPPs to the B lineage (B cell specification) is controlled by the coordinate activity of a number of transcription factors, including E2a (Tcf3 [transcription factor 3]) and Ebf1 (early B-cell factor 1) which regulate, among other things, rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) locus and pre-B cell receptor expression (Figure 1) [5–7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The E2a gene encodes two basic helix-loop-helix isoforms, E12 and E47, generated by alternative splicing [8,9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Ebf1 is an atypical helix-loop-helix zinc finger protein which, in the hematopoietic system, is expressed exclusively in B lineage cells [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Targeted inactivation/deletion of either E2a or Ebf1 leads to a blockade of B cell development at the onset of expression of early B lineage genes, which is the stage at which DNA rearrangements occur between the D to J regions of the Igh locus (LMPP or pre-pro-B stage, Figure 1) [11–14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Cells lacking either E2a or Ebf1 can be cultured ex vivo in the presence of Scf (Stem cell factor), Flt3l (Fms-related Tyrosine Kinase 3 Ligand) and Il-7 (Interleukin-7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>E2a and Ebf1 both function to activate transcription of several early B lineage genes (Figure 1), and cells lacking these transcription factors are arrested at the pre-pro-B cell stage and do not express key B cell factors, such as Pax-5 (paired-box 5) or Ikzf3 (Aiolos) [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Rag (Recombination Activating Gene) proteins are necessary for recombination of immunoglobulin genes, and deletion of Rag1 or Rag2 leads to a complete block of Igh rearrangement and a developmental block at the pro-B cell stage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Ebf1-and E2a–initiated programs to specify B cell developmental progression are intact in these Rag deficient pro-B cells [15,16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Specifically, Pax-5, Ikzf3 and other key B cell specification factors are present. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Importantly, these cells no longer rely on Scf or Flt3l for ex vivo survival and the cognate receptors are down-regulated, although they remain dependent on Il-7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Thus, E2a or Ebf1 deletion leads to an early block at the pre-pro-B cell stage, while Rag disruption causes a block at the committed pro-B cell stage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>These two stages of B lymphopoiesis can be compared to discern key regulatory molecules and events that enable specification to the B cell fate, i.e. the transition from a multi-potent progenitor (pre-pro-B) to a committed B lineage cell (pro-B) (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P4"><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Using such genetically arrested cells and a ChIP-seq experimental approach, it has recently been determined how Ebf1 and E2a contribute to an altered epigenetic landscape to specify lymphoid cells to the B cell lineage [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that during the transition from pre-pro-B cell to pro-B cells, enhancers of E2a–regulated genes become mono-methylated on lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the transcription factors Ebf1 and Foxo1 (Forkhead box protein O1) are involved in accumulation of active histone modifications such as tri-methylation on lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3) at promoters of B cell-specifying genes [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In addition, findings from the same laboratory have shed light on Ebf1-mediated epigenetic regulation of its target genes [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Ebf1 targets were classified as ‘activated’, ‘repressed’ or ‘primed’ genes and it was observed that, in pro-B and pre-B cells (a later stage in B cell development), the ‘activated’ genes are enriched in H3K4me3 and acetylation on lysine 9 and 14 of histone H3 (H3ac) active chromatin modifications and show low levels on tri-methylated lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3), a repressive chromatin modification [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In contrast, ‘repressed’ genes show the opposite pattern of histone modifications, while enhancers of ‘primed’ genes are enriched for H3K4me1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Thus, the chromatin state of developmentally regulated genes appears to be coincident with their developmental potential. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In addition, Global Run-On followed by massively parallel sequencing (GRO-seq) data, which measures ongoing transcription of genes performed on both E2a deficient (pre-pro-B) and Rag1 deficient (pro-B) cells has demonstrated differential transcription levels at of key developmental genes between these two cells types [17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P5"><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Te deep-sequencing technologies enabling elucidation of transcription and chromatin linked developmental programs are indeed a boon in understanding complex developmental programs and much has been gleaned from studying differential expression and chromatin status in mediating developmental progression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>There is a recurring theme in such epigenetic studies of regulatory elements, however: the supposition that there is a direct link between the changing chromatin state at the promoters of a set of genes and developmental progression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Indeed, to date, almost all studies in developmental systems have focused on chromatin state alone, mRNA levels alone or, at most, a general intersection of chromatin state data with RNA expression data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that assessing the link between changes in chromatin state of protein-coding gene promoters and changes in protein abundance between two distinct stages of B cell development would yield a more refined picture of the link between the changing chromatin state of promoters and the real developmental programs experienced by the cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>We note that other studies have indicated that promoter activity status does not necessarily indicate a change in steady state RNA [18,19], however, we propose to expand on these previous studies by systematically investigating how well correlated differential promoter chromatin state is with concordant differential ongoing transcription and steady state mRNA levels, as well as differential protein levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>By generating and analyzing relative protein abundance and steady state RNA-seq data from pre-pro-B and pro-B cells, along with previously published chromatin and ongoing transcription data in the same cell types, we investigated the link between ongoing transcription, steady state mRNA, inferred mRNA stability and protein levels relative to promoter chromatin state. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Our data confirm that active chromatin at gene promoters is a good indicator of appreciable levels of transcription and steady state mRNA and that differentially active chromatin states at promoters are generally good indicators of differential transcription and differential steady state mRNA levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>We further show that chromatin state changes at gene promoters frequently lead to changes in protein abundance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>However, many differentially abundant proteins derive from genes whose promoters display active chromatin in both cellular states, generally due to various forms of post-transcriptional regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data shed light on differential regulation of proteins that may impact B cell development, but have been missed by ChIP-seq or RNA-based methods alone. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>We postulated that by using a defined promoter region for each gene and not requiring a ‘peak’ to have a particular shape, this approach would not suffer from some of the issues we encountered when using MACS to identify promoters enriched in these active chromatin modifications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>We identified promoters as within 200 bp (+/−200 bp) of the transcription start site (TSS) of all protein-coding RefSeq genes and then counted the number of reads for H3K4me3 and H3ac in the ChIP-seq data that overlap these regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Summing the values for both active chromatin modifications provides what we are calling the cumulative ChIP RPKM (cRPKM, see Methods), a cumulative index of predicted promoter activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Its cumulative nature should improve analyses since we need to overcome sequencing depth issues as we note that the sequencing depths of the previously published H3K4me3 and H3ac ChIP-seq libraries were 70% lower and 17% lower, respectively, in pre-pro-B cells than in pro-B cells (library depth can be found in Supplemental File 2 and in reference [5]). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P17"><text><SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>As an initial attempt to validate the cRPKM method, we determined the distribution of cRPKM values for promoter regions of all annotated protein-coding genes in RefSeq (cRPKMP) in both pre-pro-B and pro-B cells, and compared that to the distribution of cRPKM values for corresponding regions 2 kb upstream (cRPKMU) and for randomly generated 400 bp genomic intervals (cRPKMR) (Supplemental Figure 2A and B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that a substantial proportion of promoters display higher cRPKM distribution than regions 2 kb upstream or random genomic regions, which uniformly displayed relatively low cRPKM scores (Supplemental Figure 2A and B). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Since only a fraction of all promoters would be expected to be active in pre-pro-B or pro-B cells, and since the distribution of the low cRPKMP scores of promoters reflects the distribution of cRPKMU and cRPKMR scores of regions not selected to be promoters, we infer that this low cRPKMP sub-population of promoters corresponds to ones that are inactive in this cell type. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the high cRPKMP sub-population corresponds to the active promoters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>As shown in the plot in Supplemental Figure 2A (see arrow), a cRPKM value of 8 discriminates these distinct populations of active from inactive promoters. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>This was expected because H3K4me3 and H3ac modifications have previously been demonstrated to be enriched on transcriptionally active promoters [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>We employed the Genometricorr package [30], using relative distance tests to determine whether the random genomic intervals with cRPKMR &gt; 8 and with cRPKMR &lt; 8 are positioned closer to or further away from RefSeq TSSs than expected by chance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Both the Jaccard similarity coefficient and the projection statistical test (Genometricorr’s name for a binomial test of query positions compared to reference intervals) indicate that the random genomic intervals of cRPKMR &gt; 8 showed significantly more overlap with RefSeq promoters than expected by chance (Supplemental Figure 3A and B; p &lt; 0.01), and conversely that the random genomic intervals of cRPKMR &lt; 8 were depleted in these regions (Supplemental Figure 3C and D; p &lt; 0.01). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Using the Genomic Hyper browser to perform analogous statistical tests yielded similar results (Supplemental Figure 3E) [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Given that these H3K4me3 and H3ac chromatin modifications reside on the 5’ region of active genes, the cRPKMP &gt; 8 cut-off predicts active promoters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Gratifyingly, this new cRPKMP method to assess RefSeq protein-coding promoter regions is able to accurately capture representative active promoter elements that were missed using the MACS peak-calling algorithm (Supplemental Figure 1, gray bars). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Thus, we will use cRPKMP &gt; 8 to predict active promoters for our subsequent main analyses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P19"><text><SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>We next used the new cRPKMP method with a cut-of of 8 to identify active or inactive promoters and grouped them into four classes according to their predicted differential activity between pre-pro-B and pro-B cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>The ‘active in both’ and ‘inactive in both’ classes represent a similar number of promoters (11,767 and 12,666, respectively) (Figure 3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>As expected, the exclusively active classes contain much lower numbers of promoters, with 325 identified as exclusively active in pre-pro-B cells (‘exclusively pre-pro-B’) and 1,656 as exclusively active in pro-B cells (‘exclusively pro-B’) (Figure 3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>However, those precise numbers might be affected by the depth of the ChIP-seq libraries, as addressed below. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Very few genes displayed only H3K4me3 or only H3ac modifications on their promoters and all of these were the result of a single spurious amplicon skewing the number of reads observed, so those promoters were considered to be ‘inactive’. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Importantly, this new cRPKMP method correctly categorizes known differentially active genes, examples of which are shown in Figure 3B–E. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>As expected, the E2a promoter is classified as ‘active in both’, while the promoter of the muscle-specific MyoD gene [9] is classified as ‘inactive in both’ (Figure 3B and E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>An example of a gene with a promoter representing the ‘exclusively pre-pro-B’ class is Cd34, which is known to be expressed in early hematopoiesis, including in multi-potent cells (Figure 3C) [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Also as expected, the developmentally regulated Ikzf3 (Aiolos) promoter is in the ‘exclusively pro-B’ class, in agreement with previous data and its well documented transcription status during B cell development (Figure 3D and Figure 1) [33]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P20"><text><SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Using the now-verified cRPKMP method to determine active promoters, we revisited our initial comparison of differentially active promoters with differential protein abundance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>We again plotted the distribution of relative protein levels [log2(iTRAQpro-B/pre-pro-B)] from promoters that were predicted to be exclusively active in pro-B cells (cRPKMP method with a cut-off of 8, Figure 2B) and again we expected a substantial sub-population displaying higher protein abundance in pro-B than pre-pro-B cells (skewed to the right). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>This indeed was observed (Figure 2B), indicating that our cRPKMP method yields a better correlation between predicted differential promoter activity and differential protein abundance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>However, even using the cRPKM method to predict exclusively active pro-B promoters, an appreciable fraction does not display higher protein levels in pro-B cells (Figure 2B), contrary to expectation from a naïve strictly transcriptional regulatory model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>An analogous comparison performed for genes with promoters predicted by cRPKM to be exclusively active in pre-pro-B cells also revealed an appreciable fraction that does not have higher protein levels in pre-pro-B cells (data not shown). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>We next endeavored to investigate the coupling of chromatin regulation with the transcriptional and post-transcriptional steps of gene expression during these stages of B cell development by assaying the differential regulation occurring between pre-pro-B and pro-B cell stages by monitoring ongoing transcription (GRO-seq) through steady state mRNA levels (RNA-seq) and differential protein abundance (iTRAQ), relative to promoter chromatin status. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>To this end, we used publicly available global run-on-deep-sequencing (GRO-seq) data generated in murine pre-pro-B and pro-B cells (GEO accession: GSE40173) [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>We aligned these strand-specific reads to a custom genome consisting of all gene loci that correspond to protein-coding RefSeq entries, and quantified the alignments to obtain reads per kilobase per millions reads (RPKM), as in [25]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>As a group, the highly transcribed genes in the top quartile of GRO-seq values clearly have higher cRPKMP values than the lowly transcribed genes in the bottom quartile (Supplemental Figure 4A and B), and the cRPKMP cut-of of 8 is validated as it discriminates between these groups. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P22"><text><SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>We next examined the interrelationship between our promoter classes and ongoing active transcription. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>To enable such an analysis, we plotted RPKM values of the four predicted promoter classes (described above), both as quartile distributions in box-and-whisker plots (Figure 4A and B) and as frequency distributions of log10(RPKM) (Figure 4C and D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>We would expect that genes with promoters in the predicted ‘exclusively pre-pro-B’ class would be enriched for high RPKM values in pre-pro-B cells (Figure 4A) but should not be enriched for high RPKM values in pro-B cells (Figure 4B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>The converse should also be true for genes whose promoters are in the predicted ‘exclusively pro-B’ class. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Also, genes with promoters in the ‘active in both’ and ‘inactive in both’ classes should, consistently in both cell types, display higher and lower RPKM values, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>We do indeed find that if a promoter is classified as either ‘active in both’ or ‘exclusively pre-pro-B’, that gene is much more likely to have a higher RPKM value by GRO-seq in pre-pro-B cells (Figure 4A and C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>The same holds true for the ‘active in both’ and ‘exclusively pro-B’ classes in pro-B cells (Figure 4B and D). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P23"><text><SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>In considering the above data, we note that the numbers of RefSeq genes represented in the ‘inactive in both’ (12,666) and ‘active in both’ (11,767) predicted promoter classes are substantially higher than the exclusively active classes (325 for pre-pro-B and 1,656 for pro-B), so the sum of the distribution of the GRO-seq values for ‘inactive in both’ and ‘active in both’ predicted promoter classes represents the general distribution of GRO-seq values. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Given this, we note that the distribution of GRO-seq values form two quite distinct populations, one that is transcribed two to three orders of magnitude lower than the other and that our cRPKMP &gt; 8 cut-off discriminates between these two populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>In fact, we find that while approximately one quarter of the genes with predicted ‘inactive in both’ promoters had an RPKM of zero (and therefore are not represented in Figure 4C and D), the remaining three quarters did show expression, primarily at very low levels (Figure 4C and D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>This expression may represent transcription in only a very small fraction of the cells at any one time, and when assayed by ChIP-seq, these promoters may well not have appreciable active chromatin modifications yielding cRPKM &lt; 8 scores. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Some of these RNAs could also reflect initiation from TSSs that were not annotated by RefSeq. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>In addition, while genes in both ‘exclusively active’ promoter classes have markedly different RPKM distributions between the two cell types, the distinctions between these classes are less pronounced than those between the ‘inactive in both’ and ‘active in both’ classes (Figure 4A–D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>The cause of this discordance is unclear but could be due to many possible causes, including to a potential temporal discordance between alterations in active transcription and acquisition of promoter chromatin modifications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses using the Wilcoxen-Mann-Whitney test (WMW or U-test), a non-parametric analog of the t-test used in determining significance between skewed or non-normally distributed populations [33,34], revealed that all four predicted promoter classes were significantly different from each other, in both cell lines (p &lt; 0.0001). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P24"><text><SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>We found that the ‘active in both’ predicted promoter class contained not only numerous housekeeping and pleiotropic genes, as expected, but also genes previously shown as being involved B cell and early progenitor stage identity. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is important to note that some of these genes do display differential expression, even though they are in the ‘active in both’ class, indicating a co-transcriptional means of regulation uncoupled from changing promoter chromatin status as assayed by these two modifications (see later sections). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Specifically, we plotted RPKM (ongoing transcription) versus FPKM (steady state mRNA) for both cell types, scoring each promoter class separately as well as all genes together (Supplemental Figure 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>These data were divided into quadrants to more easily separate active and relatively inactive genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>As expected, genes with promoters in the predicted ‘active in both’ class display the densest distribution in the upper right quadrant for both cell types, i.e., high RPKM and high FPKM values (Supplemental Figure 7A and B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Conversely, genes with promoters in the predicted ‘inactive in both’ class display the greatest density in the lower left quadrant, i.e., low RPKM and low FPKM (Supplemental Figure 7C and D), with the majority of the genes in this promoter class not represented on these plots as they did not have measurable RPKM and/or FPKM values. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>For genes with promoters in the exclusively active predicted classes, one would expect the high density signal to be in the upper right quadrant (high RPKM and FPKM) for the cognate cell type and in the lower left quadrant for the alternate cell type (low RPKM and FPKM). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>This is indeed the case for genes with promoters in the predicted ‘exclusively pre-pro-B’ class (Supplemental Figure 7E and F) and for genes with promoters in the predicted ‘exclusively pro-B’ class in pro-B cells (Supplemental Figure 7H). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>However, genes with promoters in the predicted ‘exclusively pro-B’ class in pre-pro-B cells show a significant deviation from this pattern, with two obvious populations, not only the expected low RPKM and low FPKM population but also an appreciable amount of a high RPKM and high FPKM population (Supplemental Figure 7G). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>That population could potentially be explained if the lower ChIP-seq library depth in pre-pro-B cells, which was noted above, led to under-calling of promoters with activating chromatin modifications in this cell type. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>This would cause some promoters that should really be in the ‘active in both’ class to be mis-classified as ‘exclusively pro-B’. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, there is a clear enrichment of differentially active genes based upon our predictions in both ‘exclusively pre-pro-B’ and ‘exclusively pro-B’ classes, compared to the distribution of all genes (Supplemental Figure 7I and J) and the ‘active in both’ and ‘inactive in both’ classes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P29"><text><SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>A small but obvious minority of the genes in each promoter class, but especially the ‘active in both’ predicted promoter class, have much lower FPKM (steady state RNA) than RPKM (ongoing transcription) levels (bottom portion of the graphs in Supplemental Figure 7A and B and highlighted in Supplemental Figure 8A and B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the transcripts of these genes may be markedly unstable and that RNA stability of these genes could possibly play a significant role in early B cell development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>To examine whether the genes displaying this apparent RNA instability are the same or different between the two cell types, we specifically compared their differential expression values in the two cell types by plotting the differential steady state mRNA abundance [log2(FPKMpro-B/FPKMpre-pro-B)] on the Y axis and differential ongoing transcription [log2(RPKMpro-B/RPKMpre-pro-B)] on the X axis, color-coding these data for the two cell types (Supplemental Figure 8C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>There are three discrete sub-populations, with the majority of these genes exhibiting large positive or negative differential levels of steady state mRNA level between the two cell types but minimal differential levels of ongoing transcription. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Color-coding the genes to indicate ones that are in this low-FPKM sub-population only in pre-pro-B cells (orange), only in pro-B cells (burgundy) or in both cell types (blue) shows that a large proportion of these genes exhibit this striking instability only in pre-pro-B cells or only in pro-B cells, although some genes exhibit the same differential in both cell types (Supplemental Figure 8C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, several genes encoding transcription factors and chromatin modifiers (along with many others) previously implicated in B cell development were identified to be amongst these differentially unstable mRNAs, including [(DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a) and cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein 1 (Creb1)] [40,41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>These analyses also identified genes encoding many zinc finger proteins (Zfp) and zinc finger and BTB (Zbtb) transcription factors of unknown import to B cell development (Zfp27, Zfp94, Zfp120, Zfp275, Zfp710, Zfp821, Zbtb3, Zbtb25, Zbtb43, Zbtb44) as potentially being regulated post-transcriptionally through a mechanism that affected RNA stability (see supplemental file 3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P30"><text><SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Since we observed that certain populations of genes could have such dramatic cell type specific differential between steady state mRNA levels and ongoing transcription levels, we explored the global relationship between our predicted promoter classes and mRNA stability—specifically asking if promoter status may somehow be linked to this type of post-transcriptional regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>By taking the ratio of FPKM (steady state mRNA) and RPKM (ongoing transcription) values for all protein-coding RefSeq genes, we generated an inferred measure of stability for each transcript. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>While the frequency distributions of these calculated ratios for the two exclusively active predicted promoter class appears quite similar in both cellular state (Figure 6A and B), and when compared between cellular states (Figure 6C), statistical analyses reveal that these actually represent different populations (WMW p &lt; 0.0001), with the ranked means of the active classes being larger than the inactive classes (i.e. active groups appear to generate more stable mRNAs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the modifications on active promoters (in this case H3K4me3 and H3ac) not only affect the transcriptional on/off state, but also transcript stability, perhaps through their reported role in facilitating elongation [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>This same analysis performed with the MACS-based promoter prediction strategy showed no striking global differences (Supplemental Figure 9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data show that a number of genes display differential stability in a developmental stage specific manner. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>The above mentioned iTRAQ-based proteome quantification from pre-pro-B cells and pro-B cells generated in our laboratory yielded 27,662 peptides which mapped to 3,129 unique proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>While most proteins displayed no differential abundance, we identified 337 differentially abundant proteins between the cell types (based on +/−1.5 fold change) (Figure 7A–D, unshaded area). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>A number of these agree with previously published results, verifying our analyses and appropriate differential expression of these genes in our model system. Ikzf3 (Aiolos), Pou2af and Irf4 , genes previously shown to be up-regulated in pro-B cells, are in our ‘exclusively pro-B’ predicted promoter class and are up-regulated in our proteome data (Figure 3, Supplemental File 3) [33,39,42,43]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, our data identify a number of additional proteins that display lower abundance levels at the pro-B cell than pre-pro-B cell stage, consistent with a role in the earliest stages of B cell specification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>One example is Cst7 (leukocystatin), which is known to regulate effector serine proteases in thymocytes (T cells) and natural killer cells (NK cells) [44], and we find is ~7 fold down-regulated in pro-B cells at the protein level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Since pre-pro-B cells are a common lymphoid progenitor with the capacity to differentiate towards many immune cell lineages, Cst7 may be in a poised state in pre-pro-B cells, to be up-regulated if the differentiation cascade follows a T cell or NK cell pathway or down-regulated if the differentiation cascade proceeds down the B cell pathway. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>The largest number of iTRAQ identified proteins come from genes with unchanging predicted promoter classes, almost all of these are from the predicted ‘active in both’ promoter class (2,808 proteins). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>However, a few are from the predicted ‘inactive in both’ class (189 proteins); they could derive from gene products with TSSs that are not annotated, genes that are only active in a very small fraction of the cells or for a very small fraction of the time but give protein products that yield peptides that are favored for detection by our LC-MS/MS strategy, or from genes with mis-classified promoters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>As expected, the vast majority of the proteins encoded by the genes in the ‘active in both’ and ‘inactive in both’ classes do not have significant differential abundance values (Figure 7A and B, shaded area). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Conversely, when focusing on the proteins from the predicted exclusively active promoter classes, a substantial number display differential abundance (Figure 7C and D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>This is especially striking for the ‘exclusively pre-pro-B’ class (Figure 7C); the data for the ‘exclusively pro-B’ class (Figure 7D) may appear less dramatic because the low ChIP-seq library depth for the pre-pro-B cells could cause this predicted chromatin class to be contaminated with promoters that are truly ‘active in both’, as noted above. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, the majority of the differentially abundant proteins do not appear to come from promoters that are predicted to be differentially active by our cRPKMP method, suggesting post-chromatin regulation, and likely post-transcriptional regulation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Due to the limited dynamic range of our quantitative proteomic data, we were not able to use the classical 2-fold cut-off to define the most differentially abundant — even using a less-stringent cut-off of 1.5-fold resulted in limiting these analyses to the top 7–15% differentially expressed proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>A large fraction of genes with predicted exclusively active promoters exhibit corresponding changes at the ongoing transcription, steady state mRNA, and protein levels (Supplemental Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the vast majority of genes with predicted ‘active in both’ promoters do not exhibit differential ongoing transcription, steady state mRNA, or protein levels (Supplemental Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>While this analysis is certainly a broad view, and the precise placement of genes into the regulatory combinations is in part subject to the precise cutoffs for differential abundance, a significant fraction of genes appear to display potentially unexpected regulatory combinations with differential RNA expression but not substantially differential protein levels as detected by iTRAQ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>These remain to be further investigated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>To further interpret and summarize these data, we established broader regulatory groupings: 1) differential protein abundance (iTRAQ) with supporting differential transcription (GRO-seq) and steady state mRNA levels (RNA-seq), 2) differential protein abundance evidently due to post-transcriptional mechanisms (no change in ongoing transcription (GRO-seq), irrespective of mRNA steady-state levels), 3) undetermined or ambiguous inter-relationships, and 4) no called changes in protein abundance, irrespective of the ongoing transcriptional and steady state mRNA data (Supplemental Table 1). Table 1 summarizes the percent of genes that fall into these broader regulatory groupings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, for genes displaying high confidence differential protein abundance, not parsed out by predicted promoter class, over half appear regulated predominantly by post-transcriptional mechanisms (Table 1, ‘DE genes’ 52.5%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>Approximately 1/3 of them appear to be regulated at the steady state RNA level (possibly due to differential efficiencies of RNA maturation or differential RNA stability), while approximately 2/3 of them appear to be regulated at a subsequent step (possibly due to differential efficiencies of translation or differential protein stability) (Supplemental Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Parsing out the genes that display high confidence differential protein abundance (above the 1.5 fold cut-off for protein differential) into predicted chromatin classes, post-transcriptional regulation is also the predominant regulatory mode in the ‘active in both’ and ‘inactive in both’ classes (58% and 54.9%, respectively) (Table 1), again about 1/3 at the steady state RNA level and 2/3 at a subsequent step (Supplemental Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the vast majority of the genes in the ‘exclusively pre-pro-B’ and ‘exclusively pro-B’ classes with differentially abundant proteins follow a transcriptional regulatory mode (Table 1, Table 87% and 71%, respectively), as expected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>We find these observations to be striking: that chromatin modifications leading to a direct transcription based model of differential protein expression account for less than half of the observed high confidence protein differential between these developmental stages. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P34"><text><SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>We next asked whether transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms yielded, in general, larger changes in protein levels in our developmental system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>A box and whiskers plot indicates that the magnitude of differential expression was substantially larger for genes that are transcriptionally regulated than genes that are post-transcriptionally regulated when assessed at the steady state mRNA level, as expected (Supplemental Figure 11A), and apparently also larger when assessed at the protein level (WMW p &lt; 0.0001) (Supplemental Figure 11B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Thus, while transcriptional regulatory mechanisms accounted for less than half the differential protein levels noted, regulation by post-transcriptional mechanisms yielded more genes with changes in protein levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Further interrogating our multi-omics data set confirmed that many genes previously implicated in stage-specific expression patterns in our developmental model and mentioned above are regulated by transcriptional mechanisms, as expected (Supplemental Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>This is not surprising since networks of transcriptional regulation and changing chromatin state are clearly important for driving the B cell developmental program. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, 2410004B18Rik displays no differential ongoing transcription (GRO-seq), steady-state RNA (RNA-seq), or inferred stability levels (Figure 8A), possibly suggesting regulation at the level of translation or protein stability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>To investigate the regulatory mechanism(s) that mediate such a dramatic change in 2410004B18Rik protein levels, without affecting transcriptional and steady state mRNA levels, we explored the possibility of microRNA-mediated regulation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Based on published evidence that miR-139-5p can regulate protein levels independent of corresponding mRNA transcript levels, predicted interactions of miR-139-5p with the 3’ UTR of 2410004B18Rik by four miR: mRNA interaction databases, and an up-regulation of miR-139-5p that is reciprocal to 2410004B18Rik protein level down-regulation in pro-B cells relative to pre-pro-B cells, we propose that miR139-5p could act to down-regulate 2410004B18Rik protein levels independent of changes in transcript levels. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>Using existing and new data from an early B cell developmental model system, we addressed how gene expression is regulated from the chromatin state to the protein level and how these inter-relationships may affect B cell development. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P37"><text><SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>In this systems biology approach, we determined whether gene expression is regulated by chromatin, ongoing transcription, transcript steady state, and/or post-transcriptionally, using differential protein levels as the end point measure of gene expression—the end point that actually is an effector of cellular state. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>We affirm that active chromatin modifications at promoters can in general be used to predict genes that are actively transcribed (Figure 4) and have significant steady state mRNA accumulation (Figure 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>We further show that developmentally differential promoter-proximal chromatin modifications also predict differential protein levels for an appreciable fraction of their assessed proteins (Figure 7C and D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>However, we show that such predictions of activity from chromatin state miss many proteins that are differentially abundant, largely due to post-transcriptional regulation (Table 1; Supplemental Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Indeed, our analysis confirms the striking finding that over half of all differentially abundant proteins appear to be regulated by some post-transcriptional mechanism (Table 1; Supplemental Table 1) [55,56]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>However, the distribution between transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation is dramatically different for the various predicted promoter classes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>Although transcriptional regulation is the predominant mode to modulate protein abundance in genes whose promoter is predicted to be exclusively active in one of the cell types, we notably demonstrate that changes in protein levels from genes harboring non-differentially active promoters are largely post-transcriptional and therefore uncoupled from active chromatin state (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>Evidently about 1/3 of those instances are regulated at mRNA steady-state abundance and about 2/3 at a subsequent stage (Supplemental Table 1). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p id="P38"><text><SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>To enable these analyses, we introduce a new robust cRPKMP method of analyzing ChIP-seq data (Figure 3) that appears more efficient at identifying active chromatin modifications at promoters, and thus at predicting gene activity, than is the MACS algorithm as we used it (Supplemental Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>We showed that a number of genes that are implicated as hallmarks of our differentiation model agree with previous observations (Supplemental Table 2), and our collective integrated data can be mined at the gene level to uncover gene expression patterns that are involved in differentiation (e.g., Supplemental Table 1). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>Moreover, with further advancement of proteomics tools, such as stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and iTRAQ, the next generation of such analyses will likely uncover more developmentally important proteins that are regulated post-transcriptionally and thus provide further examples where the dynamic epigenome is uncoupled from protein expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>Finally, we submit this type of data integration should be of great use in elucidating relationships between miRNAs and their potential targets on a genome-wide scale, as the GRO-seq data provide a means to rule out transcriptional regulation in modulation of mRNA levels. </plain></SENT>
