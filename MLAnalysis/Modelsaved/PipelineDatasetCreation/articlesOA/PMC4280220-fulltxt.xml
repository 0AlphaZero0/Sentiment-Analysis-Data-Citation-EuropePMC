Maternal blood and placental samples collected from participants in the Peruvian Abruptio Placentae Epidemiology study were genotyped using Illumina&#8217;s Cardio-Metabochip platform. We examined 118,782 genome-wide SNPs and 333 SNPs in 32 candidate genes from mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation pathways in placental DNA from 280 PA cases and 244 controls. We assessed maternal-placental interactions in the candidate gene SNPS and two imprinted regions (IGF2/H19 and C19MC). Univariate and penalized logistic regression models were fit to estimate odds ratios. We examined the combined effect of multiple SNPs on PA risk using weighted genetic risk scores (WGRS) with repeated ten-fold cross-validations. A multinomial model was used to investigate maternal-placental genetic interactions. In placental genome-wide and candidate gene analyses, no SNP was significant after false discovery rate correction. The top genome-wide association study (GWAS) hits were rs544201, rs1484464 (CTNNA2), rs4149570 (TNFRSF1A) and rs13055470 (ZNRF3) (p-values: 1.11e-05 to 3.54e-05). The top 200 SNPs of the GWAS overrepresented genes involved in cell cycle, growth and proliferation. The top candidate gene hits were rs16949118 (COX10) and rs7609948 (THRB) (p-values: 6.00e-03 and 8.19e-03). Participants in the highest quartile of WGRS based on cross-validations using SNPs selected from the GWAS and candidate gene analyses had a 8.40-fold (95% CI: 5.8&#8211;12.56) and a 4.46-fold (95% CI: 2.94&#8211;6.72) higher odds of PA compared to participants in the lowest quartile. We found maternal-placental genetic interactions on PA risk for two SNPs in PPARG (chr3&#8758;12313450 and chr3&#8758;12412978) and maternal imprinting effects for multiple SNPs in the C19MC and IGF2/H19 regions. Variations in the placental genome and interactions between maternal-placental genetic variations may contribute to PA risk. Larger studies may help advance our understanding of PA pathogenesis.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (R01HD059827) and the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (K01HL10374).

Briefly, PAPE study participants were recruited and enrolled among patients admitted for obstetrical services to the Hospital Nacional Dos de Mayo, Instituto Especializado Materno Perinatal, and Hospital Madre-Ni&#241;o San Bartolom&#233; in Lima, Peru, between August 2002 and May 2004 and between September 2006 and September 2008. Hospital admission and delivery logs were monitored daily to identify PA cases among new admissions to antepartum, emergency room, and labor and delivery wards of participating hospitals. PA was diagnosed based on evidence of retroplacental bleeding (fresh blood) entrapped between the decidua and the placenta or blood clots behind the placenta and any two of the following: (i) vaginal bleeding in late pregnancy not due to placenta previa or cervical lesions; (ii) uterine tenderness and/or abdominal pain; and, (iii) non-reassuring fetal status or death. Controls were selected from among pregnant women who delivered at participating hospitals during the study period and did not have a diagnosis of PA in the current pregnancy. For the current study, investigating associations of placental genome with risk of PA, 280 PA cases and 244 controls who provided placental samples at delivery were included. A subset of these cases and controls that also provided blood samples (222 PA cases and 198 controls) were also included in the maternal-placental genetic interaction investigations.</p><p>Ethical approval for the study was granted by the Institutional Review Boards (IRB) of Hospital Nacional Dos de Mayo, Instituto Especializado Materno Perinatal, Hospital Madre-Ni&#241;o San Bartolom&#233; in Lima, Peru and the IRB of Swedish Medical Center, Seattle, WA. All participants provided written informed consent in accordance with the principles of the declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Data collection</title><p>Standardized structured questionnaires administered by trained research personnel were used to collect information on socio-demographic characteristics (including maternal age, marital status, employment status during pregnancy, and smoking and alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy), and medical history.

Medical records were reviewed to abstract information on course and outcomes of the pregnancy. At delivery, placental samples were collected for DNA extraction and genotyping as described below.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Placental sample collection, DNA extraction, and genome-wide genotyping</title><p>Placentas were collected immediately after delivery. Placentas were weighed, double bagged and transported in coolers. The chorionic plate and overlying membranes were stripped and tissue biopsies (approximately 0.5 cm<sup>3</sup> each) were obtained from 8 sites (4 maternal and 4 fetal). For this study, biopsy samples taken from the fetal side were sampled for genomic DNA extraction. Biopsies were placed in cryotubes, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at &#8722;80&#176;C until analysis. The Gentra PureGene Cell kit for DNA preparations (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used to extract DNA from placental samples. Genotyping was conducted using the Illumina Cardio-Metabochip (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA) platform <xref rid="pone.0116346-Moore1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, a high-density custom array designed to include 217,697 SNPs that represent DNA variations at regions previously related to diseases and traits relevant to metabolic and atherosclerotic-cardiovascular endpoints <xref rid="pone.0116346-Lyssenko1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116346-Voight1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.

For the maternal-placental genetic interaction study, 325 of these SNPs that also passed quality control in maternal blood genomes, as well as SNPs in imprinted regions (5 SNPs in IGF2/H19 and 33 SNPs in C19MC) included in the Cardio-MetaboChip were analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Data quality control</title><p>Quality control and preprocessing were performed on the genotype data. Individuals with genotyping failure in more than 10% of SNPs were removed (n&#8202;=&#8202;2). SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) less than 1% or that failed to be genotyped in more than 10% of the study samples were removed (n&#8202;=&#8202;77, 276), as well as SNPs not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) among controls (n&#8202;=&#8202;667). After these quality control procedures, a total of 118,782 genome-wide SNPs were examined among 280 PA cases and 244 controls. Similar quality control procedures were performed on the maternal blood genotype data, resulting in 222 PA case and 198 controls among maternal-placental pairs.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Univariate logistic regression model was used to estimate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) relating each SNP with risk of PA, in the genome-wide and candidate gene analyses. For multiple testing correction, a false discovery rate (FDR) procedure was used <xref rid="pone.0116346-Benjamini1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Functions and functional relationships of genes represented by the top 200 genome-wide SNPs were obtained by pathway analysis using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Ingenuity Systems, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ingenuity.com">www.ingenuity.com</ext-link>) software. Gene-enrichment network score based on a modified Fisher's exact test were calculated to rank biological significance of networks in relation to PA.</p><p>In multivariable analyses, we applied penalized logistic regression models to identify sets of SNPs that are jointly associated with the risk of PA. These penalized approaches have previously been applied in the context of GWAS and have shown promising results <xref rid="pone.0116346-Ayers1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0116346-Hoggart1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. These methods allow the selection of relevant variables or groups of variables and the estimation of their regression coefficients <xref rid="pone.0116346-Tibshirani1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The number of selected variables is guided by a penalty parameter: the larger the parameter, the smaller the selected subset. A 20-fold cross-validation approach was performed to select the penalty parameter and the value yielding the smallest prediction error was used. For the genome-wide SNP analysis, we applied a lasso regression <xref rid="pone.0116346-Tibshirani1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. One characteristic of lasso regression is that it selects a single variable among a set of correlated variables. To circumvent this, SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium with a selected SNP were also considered using an r<sup>2</sup> threshold of 0.8 within 500 kb. For SNPs in the candidate gene analyses, a group penalty approach was used to account for the membership in a gene <xref rid="pone.0116346-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Furthermore, we considered a bi-level selection approach that uses a composite minimax concave penalty <xref rid="pone.0116346-Breheny1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116346-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> to select candidate genes associated with PA as well as relevant SNPs within those genes. These penalized regression methods do not accommodate missing values and the software BEAGLE version 3.3.2 <xref rid="pone.0116346-Browning1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> was used to impute missing genotypes.</p><p>For weighted genetic risk score (WGRS) analyses <xref rid="pone.0116346-Kundu1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, a 10-fold cross-validation procedure was implemented to protect against model over-fitting, which arises from using the same data to estimate the regression parameters used in computing WGRS and to evaluate the association between PA risk and WGRS <xref rid="pone.0116346-Burgess1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. The procedure consisted of randomly partitioning the data into 10 equal size subsamples, using nine of the subsamples as training set and the left-out one as validation set, with each subsample being used in turn as a test set. For each fold, a multivariate logistic regression model was fit on the training set using the SNPs selected from multivariate analyses. A weighted approach was then used to compute Genetic Risk Scores (GRS) in the validation set by multiplying the number of risk allele for each locus by its associated effect size estimated from the training set. Once the WGRS were obtained for all individuals, the subjects were categorized into four groups defined by the quartiles in the control. A logistic regression model was then fit to examine the association of the WGRS with PA risk using the lowest quartile (Group 1) as a reference and adjusting for infant sex and population admixture. This 10-fold cross-validation procedure was repeated 1000 times to account for the variability in randomly partitioning the data into subsamples. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve for each of the replicates was evaluated. The estimated effect sizes and AUCs over the 1000 replicates were used to obtain the respective point estimates and confidence intervals.</p><p>Maternal-placental interaction analyses (for candidate genes and imprinted regions) were performed using a multinomial model proposed by <xref rid="pone.0116346-Ainsworth1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> and implemented in the EMIM and PREMIM software tools <xref rid="pone.0116346-Howey1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. The method requires some biological assumptions, such as Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), random mating, and rare disease. For each SNP, four models were considered and a model selection procedure based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) was applied. The four models correspond to allele effects operating only at the fetal level (Model F), allele effects operating only at the maternal level (Model M), an additive effect of maternal and fetal effects (Model M+F), and a model that includes a maternal-placental interaction effect (Model I). For the latter, we used a parametrization that introduces two interaction terms capturing incompatibility between maternal and placental genotypes; the interaction effects operate when the infant has one copy and the mother has either zero or two copies of the risk allele <xref rid="pone.0116346-Ainsworth1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116346-Sinsheimer1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Maternal imprinting effect, which corresponds to the factor multiplying the disease risk if the infant inherits a risk allele from the mother, was tested using a likelihood ratio test <xref rid="pone.0116346-Ainsworth1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116346-Weinberg1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>.</p><p>Adjustment for the first four principal components was done for all univariate and multivariable logistic regression models to take into account population stratification.

However, a number of SNPs among the top hits deserve mention. Of note, the top 10 SNPs represented five known genes including CTNNA2, TNFRSF1A, ZNRF3, ACSL1, and LIPA. The CTNNA2 gene codes for a protein linking cadherin adhesion receptors with the cytoskeleton. The SNP we identified in this gene, <italic>rs1484464</italic>, has been investigated in relation to a number of phenotypes, including tobacco use disorder, smoking cessation, coronary artery disease, lipid metabolism (HDL, total cholesterol, triglycerides) disorders, waist-hip ratio, CRP, glucose levels, insulin resistance, body mass index, blood pressure, and interleukin levels; however, significant associations have not been reported <xref rid="pone.0116346-Uhl1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0116346-Melzer1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. The TNFRSF1A is a gene member of the TNFR superfamily that activates the transcription factor NF-KB, mediates apoptosis, and functions as regulators of inflammation.

While findings from these haplotype based interaction analyses are encouraging, caution is warranted in interpreting these results due to uncertainties in the haplotype estimation process and the simplified model that considers diplotypes rather than evaluating all haplotypes using a reference.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0116346-t012" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0116346.t012</object-id><label>Table 12</label><caption><title>Results of haplotype-haplotype interaction analysis for haplotype blocks in PPARG gene.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0116346-t012-12" xlink:href="pone.0116346.t012"/></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt111"><label/><p>Diplotypes shown as maternal_placental.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>This study expands the literature concerning the genetics of PA in a number of respects. We evaluated placental genetic variations, assessed interactions between maternal and placental genetic variations and examined placental imprinting effects on PA risk. However, several study limitations should be considered when interpreting our findings. First, our GWAS study has limited power to examine associations between genetic variations and disease risk, particularly for SNPs that have low to very low minor allele frequencies. Similarly, our statistical power to detect SNP-SNP interactions on PA risk was limited. To the extent possible we have tried to employ approaches that involve genetic risk scores to assess placental genetic variations contributions to PA risk. Second, many of the identified top hits of our analyses, both in the main effect and interaction models, have not been previously described either in genetic epidemiology or basic science investigations. Therefore, an important next step, along with replication efforts, should involve characterization of functional effects of these variations. Third, our imprinting effect assessment was based on mother-offspring dyad data and could benefit from triad data that also has information on fathers. Fourth, our GRS-based analyses, because of limited statistical power, did not involve independent training and testing sets, which would have been ideal for evaluating their predictive power, but rather relied on repeated ten-fold cross-validations. The WGRS will provide a summary estimate of effects of multiple SNPs, and can provide specific hypotheses that can be tested in future studies. Finally, findings from our study need to be cautiously generalized to other populations with different genetic make-up, population admixture, and environmental risk factors.</p><p>In sum, we found that variations in the placental genome and interactions between maternal-placental genetic variations may contribute to PA risk. We reported several novel loci where placental genetic variations may be associated with PA risk as well as several novel loci for maternal-placental genetic interactions on PA risk. Future larger investigations may help advance our understanding of PA pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0116346.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><p>
