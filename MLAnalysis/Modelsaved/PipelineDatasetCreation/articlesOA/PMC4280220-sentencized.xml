</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Placental abruption (PA), the premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall prior to delivery of the fetus, complicates about 1% of pregnancies and is an important cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality [1]–[7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Evidence from studies conducted during the last three decades suggests that hypertensive disorders, advanced maternal age, grand-multiparity, thrombophilia, cigarette smoking, illicit drug use and external trauma to the abdomen are associated with an increased risk of PA [8]–[13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In addition, other putative risk factors have also been recently described for PA, including maternal iron deficiency anemia, hyperhomocystinemia, mood and anxiety disorders, migraine and headache disorders, maternal infection and/or inflammation [4], [14]–[21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in PA include uteroplacental underperfusion, chronic hypoxemia, uteroplacental ischemia and infarctions, and thrombosis [5], [13], [22]–[23]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>As a multi-factorial disorder of complex origin, PA aggregates in families of women with the condition [24], suggesting a strong role for genetic predisposition, a thesis supported by a number of candidate gene studies [25]–[29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Findings from recent PA-related genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and candidate gene association studies (mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation pathway genes) in the maternal genome by our group provided suggestive evidence supporting associations of variation in maternal cardiometabolic genes with risk of PA [30], [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Given these findings indicative of the importance of genetic susceptibility factors in PA and the evidence highlighting the central role of placental pathology in PA [5], [28], [32], we hypothesized that genetic variations in the placental genome, particularly those variants in mitochondrial biogenesis (MB) and oxidative phosphorylation (OP) pathways, are associated with PA risk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Further, using data from both maternal and placental genomes, we examined interactions between placental and maternal genetic variations (in MB-OP pathway genes and imprinted regions) on risk of PA. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Briefly, PAPE study participants were recruited and enrolled among patients admitted for obstetrical services to the Hospital Nacional Dos de Mayo, Instituto Especializado Materno Perinatal, and Hospital Madre-Niño San Bartolomé in Lima, Peru, between August 2002 and May 2004 and between September 2006 and September 2008. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Hospital admission and delivery logs were monitored daily to identify PA cases among new admissions to antepartum, emergency room, and labor and delivery wards of participating hospitals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>PA was diagnosed based on evidence of retroplacental bleeding (fresh blood) entrapped between the decidua and the placenta or blood clots behind the placenta and any two of the following: (i) vaginal bleeding in late pregnancy not due to placenta previa or cervical lesions; (ii) uterine tenderness and/or abdominal pain; and, (iii) non-reassuring fetal status or death. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Controls were selected from among pregnant women who delivered at participating hospitals during the study period and did not have a diagnosis of PA in the current pregnancy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>For the current study, investigating associations of placental genome with risk of PA, 280 PA cases and 244 controls who provided placental samples at delivery were included. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>A subset of these cases and controls that also provided blood samples (222 PA cases and 198 controls) were also included in the maternal-placental genetic interaction investigations. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Univariate logistic regression model was used to estimate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) relating each SNP with risk of PA, in the genome-wide and candidate gene analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>For multiple testing correction, a false discovery rate (FDR) procedure was used [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Functions and functional relationships of genes represented by the top 200 genome-wide SNPs were obtained by pathway analysis using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Ingenuity Systems, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ingenuity.com">www.ingenuity.com</ext-link>) software. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Gene-enrichment network score based on a modified Fisher's exact test were calculated to rank biological significance of networks in relation to PA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analyses, we applied penalized logistic regression models to identify sets of SNPs that are jointly associated with the risk of PA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>These penalized approaches have previously been applied in the context of GWAS and have shown promising results [37]–[38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>These methods allow the selection of relevant variables or groups of variables and the estimation of their regression coefficients [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>The number of selected variables is guided by a penalty parameter: the larger the parameter, the smaller the selected subset. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>A 20-fold cross-validation approach was performed to select the penalty parameter and the value yielding the smallest prediction error was used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>For the genome-wide SNP analysis, we applied a lasso regression [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>One characteristic of lasso regression is that it selects a single variable among a set of correlated variables. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>To circumvent this, SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium with a selected SNP were also considered using an r2 threshold of 0.8 within 500 kb. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>For SNPs in the candidate gene analyses, a group penalty approach was used to account for the membership in a gene [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we considered a bi-level selection approach that uses a composite minimax concave penalty [41], [42] to select candidate genes associated with PA as well as relevant SNPs within those genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>These penalized regression methods do not accommodate missing values and the software BEAGLE version 3.3.2 [43] was used to impute missing genotypes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>For weighted genetic risk score (WGRS) analyses [44], a 10-fold cross-validation procedure was implemented to protect against model over-fitting, which arises from using the same data to estimate the regression parameters used in computing WGRS and to evaluate the association between PA risk and WGRS [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>The procedure consisted of randomly partitioning the data into 10 equal size subsamples, using nine of the subsamples as training set and the left-out one as validation set, with each subsample being used in turn as a test set. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>For each fold, a multivariate logistic regression model was fit on the training set using the SNPs selected from multivariate analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>A weighted approach was then used to compute Genetic Risk Scores (GRS) in the validation set by multiplying the number of risk allele for each locus by its associated effect size estimated from the training set. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Once the WGRS were obtained for all individuals, the subjects were categorized into four groups defined by the quartiles in the control. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>A logistic regression model was then fit to examine the association of the WGRS with PA risk using the lowest quartile (Group 1) as a reference and adjusting for infant sex and population admixture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>This 10-fold cross-validation procedure was repeated 1000 times to account for the variability in randomly partitioning the data into subsamples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve for each of the replicates was evaluated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>The estimated effect sizes and AUCs over the 1000 replicates were used to obtain the respective point estimates and confidence intervals. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Maternal-placental interaction analyses (for candidate genes and imprinted regions) were performed using a multinomial model proposed by [46] and implemented in the EMIM and PREMIM software tools [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>The method requires some biological assumptions, such as Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), random mating, and rare disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>For each SNP, four models were considered and a model selection procedure based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) was applied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>The four models correspond to allele effects operating only at the fetal level (Model F), allele effects operating only at the maternal level (Model M), an additive effect of maternal and fetal effects (Model M+F), and a model that includes a maternal-placental interaction effect (Model I). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>For the latter, we used a parametrization that introduces two interaction terms capturing incompatibility between maternal and placental genotypes; the interaction effects operate when the infant has one copy and the mother has either zero or two copies of the risk allele [46], [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Maternal imprinting effect, which corresponds to the factor multiplying the disease risk if the infant inherits a risk allele from the mother, was tested using a likelihood ratio test [46], [49]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for the first four principal components was done for all univariate and multivariable logistic regression models to take into account population stratification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>The various statistical analyses were conducted using a combination of software tools: PLINK, PREMIM, EMIM, Haploview, and R. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>As for multivariable approaches the R packages ncvreg and grpreg were used [41], [50]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>We evaluated placental genetic variations, assessed interactions between maternal and placental genetic variations and examined placental imprinting effects on PA risk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>However, several study limitations should be considered when interpreting our findings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>First, our GWAS study has limited power to examine associations between genetic variations and disease risk, particularly for SNPs that have low to very low minor allele frequencies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Similarly, our statistical power to detect SNP-SNP interactions on PA risk was limited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>To the extent possible we have tried to employ approaches that involve genetic risk scores to assess placental genetic variations contributions to PA risk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Second, many of the identified top hits of our analyses, both in the main effect and interaction models, have not been previously described either in genetic epidemiology or basic science investigations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Therefore, an important next step, along with replication efforts, should involve characterization of functional effects of these variations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Third, our imprinting effect assessment was based on mother-offspring dyad data and could benefit from triad data that also has information on fathers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Fourth, our GRS-based analyses, because of limited statistical power, did not involve independent training and testing sets, which would have been ideal for evaluating their predictive power, but rather relied on repeated ten-fold cross-validations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>The WGRS will provide a summary estimate of effects of multiple SNPs, and can provide specific hypotheses that can be tested in future studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Finally, findings from our study need to be cautiously generalized to other populations with different genetic make-up, population admixture, and environmental risk factors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>In sum, we found that variations in the placental genome and interactions between maternal-placental genetic variations may contribute to PA risk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>We reported several novel loci where placental genetic variations may be associated with PA risk as well as several novel loci for maternal-placental genetic interactions on PA risk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Future larger investigations may help advance our understanding of PA pathogenesis. </plain></SENT>
