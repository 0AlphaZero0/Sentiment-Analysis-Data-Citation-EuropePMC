</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Vibrio parahaemolyticus, autochthonous to estuarine, marine, and coastal environments worldwide, is the causative agent of food-borne gastroenteritis disease and even death [1]. V. parahaemolyticus was first identified in 1950 in Osaka, Japan, where an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis following the consumption of semidried juvenile sardines sickened 272 and killed 20 individuals [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>To date, more than eighty V. parahaemolyticus serotypes have been described on the basis of the somatic (O) and capsular (K) antigens [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Epidemic V. parahaemolyticus O3:K6 emerged in Calcutta, India in 1996 [3], was subsequently isolated in many Asian countries, and recently reported in Europe, Africa and America [1,4], arguing a pandemic of V. parahaemolyticus worldwide. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>V. parahaemolyticus is a Gram-negative bacterium that is able to grow at pH 5–11, 1%–7% NaCl, 22–42 °C [5,6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Once consumed with raw, undercooked or mishandled seafood, V. parahaemolyticus is challenged with the extremely low pH environment in the human stomach (pH of the human stomach normally ranges from 1–3 but can rise above 6.0 after food consumption) [7,8], before reaching the human gastrointestinal tract where it elicits gastroenteritis [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanisms of acid stress response in some Gram positive and Gram-negative bacteria (e.g., Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica) have been reported, such as the pumping out of protons, production of ammonia and proton-consuming decarboxylation reactions, as well as modifications of the lipid content in the membrane (for a review, see [10]). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>To date, the general stress response of Vibrionaceae-related bacteria under detrimental acid conditions remains largely unknown, despite their great significance in human health and economy in aquaculture industry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Some studies have revealed that Vibrios have a similar lysine-decarboxylation pathway in response to acid stress as E. coli, which consists of a lysine decarboxylase (CadA) and a lysine/cadaverine antiporter (CadB). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The cadA and cadB genes were transcribed at low constitutive levels in an acid-independent manner and induced during infection and acid tolerance in Vibrio cholerae [11], and the genes were activated sequentially by two transcriptional regulators AphB and CadC of Vibrio vulnifus in acid stress [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Short preadaptation to a 6% salt concentration increased survival of the wild-type strain but not that of a cadA mutant of V. parahaemolyticus under lethal acid conditions [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Previous research on specific genes also revealed a few regulatory proteins (e.g., ToxRS and OmpU) involved in V. parahaemolyticus response to acid, bile salts, and sodium dodecyl sulfate stresses (e.g., [14]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In this study, for the first time, we investigated global-level gene expression profiles of V. parahaemolyticus CHN25 in response to artificial gastric fluid (AGF) stress by using full-genome microarray analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The information will facilitate our better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying environmental stresses and pathogenicity of the leading seafood-borne pathogen worldwide. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>To gain an insight into the V. parahaemolyticus CHN25 tolerance to acid conditions, we determined growth curves of the bacterium, recently isolated and identified by Song et al. [15], in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) with the pH range of 1.5–12.5 at 37 °C. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>As illustrated in Figure 1A, V. parahaemolyticus CHN25 grows at pH 5.5–11.5, optimally at pH 8.5, demonstrating it is a moderately basophilic bacterium, consistent with previous studies (e.g., [5]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>No cell growth was observed under more acidic conditions with pH values lower than 4.5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>More detailed tests on the pH range between 4.5 and 5.5 revealed that V. parahaemolyticus CHN25 was able to grow at pH 5.0, but not at pH ≤ 4.9 (Figure 1B), suggesting the latter being a sub-lethal pH condition for V. parahaemolyticus CHN25. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>To investigate the possible effects of the human acidic stomach environment in vivo on V. parahaemolyticus CHN25 survival, we utilized the AGF (pH 4.9) to treat the bacterium in vitro grown to LGP and SGP in TSB (pH 8.5) at 37 °C, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>As shown in Figure 2, V. parahaemolyticus CHN25 cells at LGP displayed relatively lower survival rates when compared to the bacterial cells at SGP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Treating the LGP cells for 15 min resulted in a significantly decreased survival rate (21.6%), and further elevating exposure time (≥30 min) yielded a steep reduction in the survival (≤3.7%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>For the SGP cells, the relative survival rate was 17.0% after exposed to AGF for 30 min, which was 4.6-fold higher than that for LGP cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the SGP cells also showed considerable loss in culturability after 30 min exposure to AGF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Thus, we extracted total RNA of the samples at both growth phases in TSB after treated for 30 min with AGF (pH 4.9) for the further transcriptomic analysis (see below). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>We determined the global-level gene expression profiles of V. parahaemolyticus CHN25 after the AGF treatment by using full-genome microarray chips (see the Experimental Section). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>This analysis revealed a considerable number of differentially expressed genes involved in the response to acid stress in the bacterium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>A total of 1210 genes were significantly changed when V. parahaemolyticus CHN25 grown to LGP in the AGF stress, which represented approximately 25.6% of the expressed genes in the bacterium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Of these, a total of 547 genes showed higher transcriptional levels (change ≥ 2.0-fold), whereas the expression of a total of 663 genes were down-regulated (change ≤ 0.5-fold). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>All the genes were grouped into ninety four gene functional catalogues identified in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>When V. parahaemolyticus CHN25 grown to SGP, the AGF stress only elicited 160 differentially expressed genes, accounting for 3.4% of the expressed genes in the bacterium, which consisted of 52 up-regulated and 108 down-regulated genes falling into twenty two gene functional catalogues (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>A complete list of the differentially expressed genes at both growth phases is available in NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus under the accession number GSE63167, of which 10.9% were annotated as hypothetical proteins with currently unknown functions in the public databases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>To validate the transcriptome data, we chose eleven representative genes for quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The resulting data were correlated with those yielded from the transcriptomic analysis (Table S1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Consistent with previous studies (e.g., [16]), the majority of the expressed genes remained unaltered in SGP cells in the AGF stress, in which substrate metabolism, energy production, and cell division were turned down. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the transcriptome profile at this growth phase indeed provided a comparative mode to investigate growth-phase independent acid stress response in V. parahaemolyticus CHN25. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the transcriptome data revealed forty-one differentially expressed genes that were synchronously elicited from both LGP and SGP cells in the AGF stress, however, approximately half of which coded for hypothetical proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Of these, interestingly, almost half displayed different expression features between the two growth phases, e.g., the genes encoding the fructose-specific Enzyme IIABC subunits and prophage-associated proteins (see below). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Based on gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the transcriptome data against the KEGG database, nine significantly affected metabolic pathways with enrichment test p value below 0.05 were identified in LGP cells after exposed to the AGF stress (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>They included the phosphotransferase system (PTS); galactose, nitrogen, fructose and mannose, and pyruvate metabolisms; ribosome and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis; glycolysis/gluconeogenesis; and oxidative phosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>The significantly changed metabolic pathways have also been reported in some other bacteria under acid conditions (e.g., [16,17,18,19,20]). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent PTS is known as a major sugar transport multicomponent system in bacteria, by which many sugars are transported into bacteria, concomitantly phosphorylated, and then fed into glycolysis [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>In this study, thirteen genes in the PTS were significantly up-regulated in LGP cells in the AGF stress, which coded for glucose-, fructose-, mannitol-, cellobiose-, ascorbate-, and N-acetylglucosamine-specific enzyme II components. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>One of these genes, VPA1424 encoding fructose-specific enzyme II ABC subunits, was strongly up-regulated for 27.97-fold in mRNA level, suggesting extremely active transport and utilization of the fructose in the AGF stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>In addition, interestingly, two genes encoding glucose-specific enzyme II BC subunits were identified in V. parahaemolyticus CHN25, one of which (VP2046) was induced with a minor increase of 2.62-fold, whereas the other (VPA1667) strikingly displayed a 25-fold decrease in expression, implying possible unknown regulation mechanisms underlying the transport of the key sugar in central carbohydrate metabolism in the AGF stress. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Approximately half of the genes linked to nitrogen metabolism were significantly changed by the AGF stress, the majority of which showed higher transcriptional levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, four enzymes: 2-nitropropane dioxygenase (VPA0296) catalyzing nitroalkane to nitrite; NrfBD (VP0987) and NrfAH (VP1989) involved in the conversion of nitrite to ammonia in dissimilar nitrate reduction; and nitrite reductase large subunit (VPA0987) involved in the catalysis of nitrite to ammonia, were significantly up-regulated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the gene encoding a glutamate dehydrogenase (VP1602) that catalyzes l-glutamate to ammonia was up-regulated as well, suggesting possibly increased amount of ammonia in LGP cells that likely combined with intracellular protons to yield the ammonium ion and alkalized intracellular environment in the AGF stress [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the gene (VP0483) involved in the conversions of ammonia to l-glutamine and to l-glutamate was significantly down-regulated, implying perhaps attenuated ammonia utilization in the AGF stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>In addition, a carbonic anhydrase (VP2514) that converts carbon dioxide to HCO3− was notably down-regulated (5.27-fold), suggesting the repressed production of electrically negative acid ions in LGP cells, which may facilitate to maintain intracellular pH homeostasis in the AGF stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, no linking to acid stress of the latter two genes has been described previously. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Similarly, seven components of the small 30S subunit were also up-regulated in expression (2.15–6.13-fold) (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Despite a highly conserved translational machinery with invariable rRNA and protein components, the formation of distinct ribosomal subpopulations has been reported in bacteria when encountered adverse conditions, e.g., the S21, L2 and L20 subpopulations at pH 4.5 urea condition in E. coli [22,23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>In this study, L20 and some other components (S20, L27, L31 and L33) were highly up-regulated for more than 5.0-fold in the AGF stress. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the lldD (VPA1499) gene encoding an l-lactate dehydrogenenase displayed an increase of 8.53-fold in expression, which degrades l-lactate to pyruvate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the conversion of malate to pyruvate catalyzed by a malate oxidoreductase (VP1258) was also enhanced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>The increased amount of pyruvate was actively metabolized by a phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (VPA0372) to produce phosphoenolpyruvic acid that enters into glycolysis. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>This study constitutes the first investigation of Vibrio parahaemolyticus CHN25 response to the AGF under a sub-lethal acid condition using genome-wide microarray analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>The transcriptome data revealed global-level distinct gene expression profiles of the bacterium with considerable variation over growth phases after exposed to the AGF (pH 4.9) for 30 min. Vibrio parahaemolyticus seemed to have evolved a number of molecular strategies for coping with the acid stress in a complex gene regulation network. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Our data in this study will highly facilitate the in-depth research of environmental stresses and pathogenicity of the leading seafood-borne pathogen worldwide. </plain></SENT>
