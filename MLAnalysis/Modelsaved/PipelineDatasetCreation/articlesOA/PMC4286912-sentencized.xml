<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is especially high in Asia, where children younger than 5 years old are the most severely affected [2–5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In Singapore, the incidence of IPD reached 15.2 per 100,000 children &lt;5 years of age in 2008–2010; the most common serotypes were serotypes 6B, 19A, 14, and 23F [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In Malaysia, there is limited information on the incidence of IPD, although a previous study suggested that the incidence of pneumococcal meningitis reached 8.6 per 100,000 children &lt;5 years of age in 2004–2006 [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The most common serotypes in Malaysia in 2008–2009 were serotypes 19F, 6B, 19A, and 14 [6, 8]. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Prevention of pneumococcal infections through vaccination remains the best strategy to reduce the incidence of IPD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>A 10-valent pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV; Synflorix™, GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines), which contains serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F, was licensed in Singapore in March 2010 and in Malaysia in September 2009. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Since eight of the ten pneumococcal serotypes included in PHiD-CV are conjugated to NTHi protein D, this vaccine has the potential to provide additional protection against NTHi diseases [23]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Three primary doses of PHiD-CV given to 2-, 3-, and 5-month-old infants from Malaysia and Singapore were shown to be immunogenic with a clinically acceptable safety profile. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Non-inferiority of the immunogenicity of the PHiD-CV Commercial versus the Phase III Clinical lot was demonstrated for each vaccine pneumococcal serotype and protein D, although antibody GMCs for serotypes 4 and 5 and protein D, and OPA GMTs for serotype 18C, seemed higher in infants who received the Phase III Clinical lot. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, as percentages of infants reaching threshold antibody concentrations and OPA titres for vaccine antigens were high and comparable in both groups, the observed differences in immunogenicity may be of limited clinical relevance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>For each vaccine pneumococcal serotype, post-primary vaccination antibody GMCs seemed in line with those previously measured in Korea and Taiwan [16, 19], and higher than in Europe [15, 18, 21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Although it remains unclear why the magnitude of immune responses to pneumococcal conjugate vaccines varies in different populations, plausible explanations include genetic factors, early exposure to S. pneumoniae, or nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococcal serotypes [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Pre-vaccination antibody concentration, which is influenced by waning maternal antibodies and increasing adaptive immunity due to early exposure to S. pneumoniae, in Asian children was evaluated in a previous study conducted in Taiwan, where for each vaccine pneumococcal serotype the percentage of children with pre-vaccination antibody concentrations ≥0.2 μg/ml ranged from 11.5% to 42.5%, except serotype 14 (61%) [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Vaccine efficacy and effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have been demonstrated in various countries, hence clinical relevance of population differences remains unknown [37–42]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>For each vaccine pneumococcal serotype, antibody GMCs calculated before the booster dose administration were lower than those measured one month post-primary vaccination, but ≥60.8% of toddlers from Singapore had pre-booster antibody concentrations ≥0.2 μg/mL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>The booster dose of the PHiD-CV Commercial lot induced a robust immune response; virtually all toddlers reached antibody concentrations ≥0.2 μg/mL one month post-booster vaccination and antibody concentrations were higher than those measured post-primary vaccination, which suggested that primary vaccination of infants with PHiD-CV induced immunological memory [15, 16, 18, 21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Primary vaccination with either vaccine lot and booster vaccination with the PHiD-CV Commercial lot induced immune responses against cross-reactive serotypes 6A and 19A. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Some functional OPA responses for cross-reactive serotype 19A were observed following primary PHiD-CV vaccination, in-line with previous studies [15, 16, 18, 21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>However, the level of protection against serotype 19A conferred by the immune response induced by PHiD-CV should be further determined [43, 44]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Both PHiD-CV lots induced antibodies against the NTHi protein D carrier, which could potentially provide protection against disease caused by NTHi. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Although a clear correlation between efficacy and anti-protein D antibody concentrations has not been established, efficacy trials with the predecessor 11-valent NTHi protein D-conjugated vaccine and PHiD-CV have suggested that the protein D carrier contributed to the induction of protection against acute otitis media due to NTHi [45, 46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>The co-administered vaccines given simultaneously with primary or booster doses of PHiD-CV were also immunogenic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with other studies and suggests that no clinically relevant interference occurred between PHiD-CV and HRV or DTPa-based vaccines [17, 19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>No SAEs considered causally related to vaccination and no fatal SAEs were reported throughout the study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>The reactogenicity and safety profiles of the Commercial and the Phase III Clinical lots of PHiD-CV were comparable and clinically acceptable, in line with previous studies [20]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>The primary vaccination phase was powered to demonstrate the primary objectives. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Other comparisons should be considered cautiously, since there was no adjustment for multiple comparisons of the various endpoints. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>The clinical relevance of the observed differences remains unknown, especially for antigens with no correlate of protection. </plain></SENT>
