</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) signaling pathways regulate tissue development and morphogenesis in all metazoans [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>RTKs often signal through the conserved Ras-Raf-MAPK cascade, leading to phosphorylation of nuclear transcription factors which then elicit changes in target gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The HMG-box protein Capicua (Cic) has recently emerged as a general nuclear sensor of RTK signaling pathways [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Originally discovered downstream of the Torso RTK in Drosophila embryogenesis, Cic has been subsequently shown to function downstream of other RTKs at multiple stages of fly development [3]–[11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In all cases, Cic represses transcription of RTK-responsive genes in unstimulated cells, whereas activation of RTK signaling results in phosphorylation and downregulation of Cic and this causes derepression of its target genes [7], [10], [12], [13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Cic is highly conserved from cnidarians to vertebrates and is implicated in several human pathologies such as spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) and oligodendroglioma (OD) [14]–[17]; reviewed in [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Indeed, Cic proteins from Drosophila and mammals share many functional and structural properties: they repress transcription by binding to related DNA sites in target genes, appear to be similarly downregulated by RTKs and are expressed as two main isoforms, short (Cic-S) and long (Cic-L), which differ in their N-terminal regions [7], [9], [10], [14], [15], [17]–[19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>However, despite these similarities, it is currently unclear whether all Cic family proteins employ a common mechanism of repression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Studies in mouse and human cells have shown that Cic associates with Ataxin1 (Atxn1), a co-repressor involved in SCA1 [14], [15], [17], [20], [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, previous studies in Drosophila have suggested that Cic functions together with Groucho (Gro) [3], [10], a WD-repeat co-repressor that associates with multiple repressors, including Hairy/Hes, Nkx, Lef/Tcf and Runx family proteins (reviewed in [22], [23]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>However, the functional links between Cic and Gro remain unclear, since no molecular interaction between these proteins has been validated in vivo [2], [24]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigate the mechanism of Drosophila Cic repression and its relationship with Gro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>We find that Cic functions via Gro in the early embryo but not at other developmental stages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The Gro-assisted mechanism depends on a previously unrecognized motif of Cic (N2), which is essential for recruitment of Gro in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, the N2 motif is highly conserved among Cic orthologues in flies and mosquitoes, but is absent in all other species, suggesting that it originated in ancestral dipterans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the N2 domain appears to be a structural innovation associated with the emergence of fly Cic-S isoforms from a pre-existing Cic-L-like isoform. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>This implies that mammalian Cic proteins, which lack the N2 motif, probably function independently of Gro, and that their Cic-S isoforms must have evolved independently of fly Cic-S. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Thus, Cic proteins exhibit context-dependent repressor activities that are partly associated with key structural changes that have occurred during the evolution of this protein family. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Cic and Gro are both essential for repression of two terminal gap genes, tailless (tll) and huckebein (hkb), in central regions of the blastoderm embryo; this repression is normally relieved by Torso RTK signaling at the embryonic termini, thereby enabling localized induction of tll and hkb by broadly distributed activators [3], [4], [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>These shared requirements of Cic and Gro in the terminal system have led to the idea that both proteins act in a common repressor complex (see refs. [2], [24]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>However, we have assayed the requirement of Gro for Cic repressor functions in other developmental contexts and found that Gro is dispensable for such functions (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Specifically, we examined two systems -the developing wing and the ovarian follicular epithelium- where Cic represses specific target genes such as argos and mirror, respectively, under the control of the EGFR pathway [4]–[6], [10]–[12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>In these experiments, we compared the effects caused by the loss of Cic or Gro function using mosaic analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, we found that loss of Gro function does not impair Cic repression in any of those systems, indicating that Cic represses argos and mirror independently of Gro (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>This localized effect of Gro probably reflects its role together with Enhancer-of-split/Hes repressors in refining argos expression [45]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>To this end, we used a transgenic construct containing a minimal hunchback (hb) enhancer linked to a pair of individual Cic binding sites (hbC; ref. [10]) (Fig. 2A). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>As shown in Fig. 2E, we find clear derepression of hbC activity in embryos lacking Gro function, implying that Cic represses hbC via Gro in this assay. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Cic does not contain either of the two previously defined Gro-binding motifs present in known Gro-dependent repressors, the WRPW- and eh1-like peptides [22], and we have not detected direct interactions between functionally important regions of Cic and Gro [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we asked what sequences of Cic mediate its Gro-dependent repressor activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Assuming that those sequences could be evolutionarily conserved, we noted a novel conserved motif present at the N-terminus of the Cic-S isoform (GenBank protein AAF55751), which we designate N2 (Fig. 3A, B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>This motif is encoded in two adjacent exons: a 5′ exon specific of the cic-S transcript and a 3′ exon shared by both cic-S and cic-L transcripts (see also below). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>The sequence encoded by the cic-S-specific exon (LYLQCLL) is conserved in dipteran species (Fig. 3A, B, highlighted in red), whereas the peptide common to Cic-S and Cic-L isoforms (SLSSSRSATP) is conserved from hydra to humans (Fig. 3A, B, highlighted in black). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>To assess the functional significance of N2, we assayed the activity of a Cic-S derivative lacking this motif (CicΔN2). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a different structure, which lacks the first cic-S exon, is apparent across representative species of non-dipteran taxa, including Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera), Tribolium castaneum (Coleoptera), Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera), and Acyrthosiphon pisum (Hemiptera) (Fig. 6A, B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>In this configuration, the two exons encoding the N2-L motif of Cic-L proteins are frequently separated by short (&lt;150 pb) introns, which do not contain the first cic-S exon encoding the N2 repressor motif (LYLQCLL) nor its upstream promoter region (Fig. 6A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Thus, while we cannot rule out the possibility that other short isoforms of Cic exist in non-dipteran species (e.g. expressed from other alternative promoters within cic), a form equivalent to dipteran Cic-S (containing the N2 motif) is clearly absent in those species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the simplest interpretation of these genomic organizations is that the Cic-S isoform and its N2 motif originated after the expansion of the above cic-L intron during the early radiation of dipterans; an alternative scenario, where the Cic-S isoform was already present in early insects, appears much less likely, since this would involve the independent loss of this isoform in each of the non-dipteran branches examined. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>We have shown that Cic proteins exhibit both Gro-dependent and -independent activities, and that this functional diversity is associated with the origin of the Cic-S isoform and the N2 motif in dipterans, approximately 250 million years ago. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>By comparison, other functional attributes of Cic such as their sensitivity to RTK signaling and their binding to specific sites in DNA, are more broadly conserved and therefore probably more ancient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>For example, the MAPK-interacting domain of Drosophila Cic (C2) is clearly recognizable outside the dipterans [7], and Cic is downregulated by RTK signaling in mammalian cells [15], [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Thus, while Cic proteins may have long served as sensors of RTK signaling, their mechanisms of repression appear to have evolved and adapted to fulfill new Cic functions in distinct transcriptional contexts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Below, we discuss the significance and implications of the newly evolved mechanism of Cic repression in fly embryogenesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that prior to the origin of dipterans, Cic was present in insects as a Cic-L-like isoform that lacked the N2 motif. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Clearly, Drosophila Cic-L cannot function in the early embryo unless it carries the N2 motif from Cic-S (Fig. 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>This suggests that evolution of the N2 motif dramatically altered the mechanism of Cic repression by establishing a novel association with Gro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="?"><plain>How, then, did the N2 motif appear? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>The comparison of different insect cic genes suggests that the N2 motif originated along with the Cic-S isoform, possibly through genomic rearrangements of intronic cic-L sequences that created a shorter cic-S transcript and subsequent evolution of a functional N2 motif via random drift. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>In this regard, it has been argued that short peptide sequences such as the WRPW and eh1 Gro-interacting motifs may be particularly easy to evolve by simple drift [29], [30]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>The N2 motif is different from the WRPW and eh1 motifs, and we still do not know its precise mechanism of action. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>By analogy to the WRPW and eh-1 motifs, which bind the central pore of the Gro β propeller, it is possible that N2 also recognizes this region of Gro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>If this is correct, the N2 motif should adopt a conformation across the pore that is insensitive to the MB41 mutation, just like another Gro mutation, MB31, prevents binding of WRPW but not eh-1 to the pore [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Another, non-exclusive possibility is that N2 binds the Gro β propeller with the help of auxiliary proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this idea, the WRPY motif of Runx proteins binds very weakly to Gro and this interaction depends on other accessory proteins in vivo [28], [31], [32]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="185" pm="?"><plain>What could be the functional and evolutionary significance of the new Gro-dependent mechanism of Cic repression? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>It seems logical to assume that Cic employs qualitatively different mechanisms of repression in the embryo (via Gro) than when acting in other contexts (presumably with other corepressors; see below). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the combined activities of Cic-S and Gro may have facilitated the evolution of the complex transcriptional network regulated by Torso signaling in modern fly embryos. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>This network comprises multiple Cic target genes, including tll and hkb, whose boundaries of expression are regulated by Torso-dependent gradients of Cic repression at the embryo poles [9], [10], [33], [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>In this system, Gro itself appears to exert a regulatory function beyond its obvious role as a component of the repression machinery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Indeed, Gro is directly phosphorylated and functionally downregulated in response to Torso signaling [35], [36], and even modest changes in Gro protein levels significantly affect the threshold concentrations at which Cic represses tll and hkb [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>This suggests a model where Torso signaling controls the expression of Cic target genes via coordinate activity gradients of both Cic and Gro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>These overlapping gradients might serve as a fail-safe mechanism to ensure the correct spatiotemporal response of target genes, buffering against random perturbations in either gradient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Gro is a highly versatile corepressor capable of functioning in different contexts of recruitment [22]–[24], [38], which may explain the ability of Cic to regulate multiple targets simultaneously. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>For example, tll and hkb are activated by different mechanisms that are either dependent (hkb) or independent (tll) of Lilliputian, a component of the super elongation complex (SEC) [39], [40], implying that Gro is capable of counteracting both activation mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Thus, the acquisition of Gro-mediated repression by Cic may have facilitated the precise, coordinated regulation of Cic target genes in response to Torso signaling. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Gro is mostly dispensable for other Cic functions in the wing and the follicular epithelium (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>The Cic-S isoform is sufficient for both of these functions [4], [5], [7], raising the possibility that Cic-S acts through other corepressors in those tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>One potential candidate is the Drosophila ortholog of mammalian Atxn1 (dAtxn1; [41]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>In mammals, Atxn1 and the related factor Ataxin1-Like (Atxn1L; also known as Brother of ATXN1, BOAT) potentiate Cic-S repressor activity in cultured cells [14], [42], and directly interact with a short motif of Cic that is conserved in Drosophila Cic-S [14], [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>dAtxn1 has been mainly studied in models of SCA1 pathogenesis [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Thus, future studies should examine whether dAtxn1 also mediates Cic repressor functions in development. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Finally, our results suggest that mammalian Cic proteins probably function independently of Gro, unless they have evolved other specific Gro-interacting motifs different from N2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the mammalian Cic-S isoform must have originated independently of the dipteran Cic-S isoform, resulting in coincidental presence of Cic-S isoforms in both taxa. </plain></SENT>
