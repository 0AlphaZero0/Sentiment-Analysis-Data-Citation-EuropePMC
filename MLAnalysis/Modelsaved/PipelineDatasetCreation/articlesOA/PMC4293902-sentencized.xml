</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The PDC (pyruvate dehydrogenase complex) belongs to the KADH (α-keto acid dehydrogenases), a family of mega-Dalton multi-enzyme complexes comprising multiple subunits of three different enzymes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In mammalian, yeast and nematode PDC, the E2 (dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase) together with the E3BP (E3-binding protein) form the complex core [1–5], whereas in plants and bacteria it is E2 alone that generates the core of the PDC complex [6–8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This core structure forms either a dodecahedral 60-mer, as found in PDC from humans, Gram-positive bacteria and plants, or it generates an octahedral 24-mer as is found in Gram-negative bacteria [7,9–11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>PDC E2 catalyses the transfer of the acetyl group from S-acetyldihydrolipoamide, a covalently attached co-factor of E2, to CoA producing acetyl-CoA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The E1 (pyruvate decarboxylase subunit) of eukaryotes and Gram-positive bacteria is a heterotetramer composed of two subunits, E1α (α subunit of E1) and E1β (β subunit of E1), whereas in Gram-negative bacteria, the enzyme is a homodimer [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>PDC E1 transfers the acetyl group from pyruvate to the thiamine pyrophosphate co-factor, concurrently releasing CO2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The acetyl moiety is transferred from PDC E1 to the lipoamide co-factor of E2 which transfers it to CoA to form acetyl-CoA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>During this reaction the lipoamide co-factor is reduced to DHLA (dihydrolipoamide) and, in order to allow catalysis to proceed, E3 (dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase) re-oxidizes the co-factor, generating NADH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Both E1 and E3 bind to the E2 core to allow substrate channelling, which is facilitated by the so-called ‘swinging arm’, referring to the lipoamide co-factor that is covalently attached to the lipoyl-domains of PDC E2 [13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In eukaryotes, PDC is located in the mitochondria, linking cytosolic glycolysis to the mitochondrial TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle; plants possess mitochondrion- and chloroplast-located PDCs and the plastid-located PDC is vital for providing acetyl-CoA for fatty acid biosynthesis exclusively occurring in the organelle [14]. Plasmodium possesses a single PDC that is found solely in the apicoplast [15], a plastid-like organelle found in most apicomplexan parasites, where it provides acetyl-CoA for fatty acid biosynthesis, similar to plant chloroplast PDC [16,17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>It was found that PDC is essential during late liver stage development in mouse malaria species [16], whereas in Plasmodium falciparum, one of the human infective malaria species, recent studies suggest that PDC and also fatty acid biosynthesis activity are important for the development of infective sporozoites at the end of sexual development in the Anopheles vector [18,19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The multi-enzyme structure of PDC does however make it probable that the loss of one protein will not necessarily interfere with the function(s) of all protein members of the enzyme complex. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Therefore we studied the effects on P. falciparum of the deletion of Pfae3 (Plasmodium falciparum aE3) (PF3D7_0815900), encoding dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, an enzyme that is an essential component of apicoplast PDC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The enzyme may also have an impact on parasite's redox homoeostasis in its own right. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>With the aim of informing future anti-malarial drug discovery against exo-erythrocytic parasite stages, PfaE3 was also recombinantly expressed and its biochemical and biophysical characteristics determined. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Plasmodium possesses a single PDC exclusively found in the apicoplast [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>The three other KADH complexes are mitochondrial [60] and this distribution requires the presence of apicoplast- and mitochondrion-specific dihydrolipoaminde dehydrogenases (E3) that interact with their organelle-specific KADH [20,61]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>In accordance with this distribution, mitochondrial KADH complexes share a single E3 (mE3; PF3D7_1232200), while the apicoplast PDC has its own, apicoplast-located E3 encoded by a separate gene (aE3; PF3D7_0815900) [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Experimental evidence suggests that apicoplast-located PDC is not essential for the survival of intra-erythrocytic Plasmodium yoelii [16] but that the protein is important for late liver stage development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Recently the gene encoding PDC E1α was also deleted in the human malaria species P. falciparum resulting in the arrest of parasite development at the oocyst stage in the Anopheles vector [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained when genes encoding components of the type II fatty acid biosynthesis pathway were deleted from P. falciparum, supporting the hypothesis that, as in plants, the major role of apicoplast PDC is to provide acetyl-CoA for this biosynthetic pathway [16,19,62]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>The potential suitability of PDC as a target for transmission blocking or exo-erythrocytic drug discovery prompted us to recombinantly express PfaE3 and analyse its biochemical properties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Kinetically PfaE3 favours the forward reaction (the oxidation of DHLA and reduction of NAD+), rather than the reverse reaction (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>This suggests that in its physiological environment the enzyme is primarily acting as part of apicoplast PDC rather than undergoing redox reactions to assist in maintaining organellar redox and antioxidant homoeostasis, as has been suggested for other organisms [63,64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>The structural stability of PfaE3 was probed by AUC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>The whole cell weight average molecular mass at infinite dilution of PfaE3 determined by SE was consistent with that expected for a dimeric species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>However during SDS–PAGE PfaE3 migrates as two species, both of which are N-terminally 6-His tagged suggesting that the faster migrating protein may have lost parts of its C-terminus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>Deletion of the C-terminal 14 amino acids of Azotobacter vinelandii E3 led to its inactivation, decreased its thermostability and also negatively affected FAD-binding to the protein [65]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>FAD-binding is required for the correct folding of E3 [66], which, in turn, affects dimer formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>The decrease of molecular size from 64 kDa (computed from the amino acid sequence for 6-His-PfaE3) to the 60–62 kDa observed during SDS–PAGE is consistent with the loss of about 15–34 amino acids and it is possible that this negatively affects PfaE3 co-factor binding and dimerization and thus may modify protein structure and catalytic activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>However, the kinetic parameters of the recombinant protein were comparable with those determined for E3 from other organisms suggesting that only a small proportion of the recombinant protein is negatively affected, which is in agreement with the finding that PfaE3 is stable at high protein concentrations in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>Overall, the protein expression system used here facilitates the generation of milligram amounts of purified protein that is enzymatically active and appears to be structurally stable, provided it is stored at high concentrations (&gt; 10 μM) and thus provides a suitable system to generate sufficient protein for future drug-screening efforts. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>The sedimentation coefficient determined by SV (s020, w of 6.2±0.1 S) is comparable with that determined for the human E3 dimer (5.9 S, [45]) suggesting that the overall solution conformation might be similar. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>However, human E3 has a molecular mass of 106 kDa compared with the 128 kDa of PfaE3, so it would not be unexpected for the sedimentation coefficient to be a little higher. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>The additional loops observed in the PfaE3 model, if real, would serve to somewhat offset the increase in sedimentation coefficient afforded by the additional mass. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>The dimeric nature of PfaE3 is confirmed by SE and by the SAXS data in which the radius of gyration, maximum particle dimension and DAM all are consistent with a dimer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>The positioning of the ‘missing’ loops and N-terminal portions in the proposed model remains undetermined–modelling against one SAXS dataset is inconclusive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>This limitation notwithstanding, the AUC and SAXS data are all consistent with a dimeric structure for PfaE3 and are not inconsistent with the augmented homology model. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>In addition to the two extra loops, the high-resolution model positions a two-stranded anti-parallel β motif in the space that, in the structure of human E3 plus the SBD of E3BP (PDB ID: 2F5Z, [33]), is occupied by the E3BP SBD. PfaE3 does not interact with E3BP SBD, but rather the SBD of PfE2 since the parasite genome does not encode an e3bp homologue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>The presence of this ‘extra’ β motif implies that this interaction may be quite different from that observed for human E3-E3BP, supporting the suitability of PfaE3 as a target for the development of intervention strategies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>To further assess PfaE3 function, we generated Pfae3 null mutants (3D7Δae3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>Our study corroborates that the gene/protein is not essential for intra-erythrocytic development in P. falciparum 3D7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>The deletion of Pfae3 did not affect parasite growth rates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>However, upon careful scrutiny of the intra-erythrocytic development of 3D7Δae3, we observed that the mutant organisms unusually maintained their synchronicity over several growth cycles, while this is not a feature of the wild-type 3D7 line (Figure 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>The causal relationship between this observation and the deletion of Pfae3 is not clear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>A recent study identified PfaE3 to be not only part of PDC but also to be associated with parasite DNA, which possibly suggests a regulatory role for the protein in gene expression, in addition to its function in PDC activity [67]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>Another important finding was that the loss of PDC function upon Pfae3 deletion resulted in an elevation of enzyme levels involved in the generation of acetyl-CoA in the mitochondrion such as BCDH-E2 and mE3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the loss of PDC activity may lead to an increased activity of TCA activity in order to compensate for the loss acetyl-CoA provision, which is in agreement with a recent report showing that mitochondrial acetyl-CoA is generated by the branched chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase [68]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>In order to test whether the lack of PDC activity impacts on the parasites’ ability to defend themselves against oxidative stress, we exposed three 3D7Δae3 clones to pro-oxidants that challenge their redox homoeostasis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the 3D7Δae3 clones showed a differential response to the inhibitors, which suggests that they adapt in different ways to the loss of PfaE3 function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>This is also reflected in our finding that changes in protein levels observed upon ae3 deletion have clonal specificity (Figure 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>Clones 16 and 34 showed an increased susceptibility to the oxidative stressor paraquat and also (less pronounced) to BSO, which was in agreement with their reduced amounts of 1-CysPx and 2-CysPx, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>The susceptibility of clone 21 to these stressors was only marginally reduced and accordingly, the levels of the two antioxidant enzymes were elevated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that PfaE3 may play a role in protecting P. falciparum against oxidative or xenobiotic challenges [69], although the adaptive responses that the parasites mount show clonal differences and this phenomenon requires further investigation to fully appreciate the flexibility of Plasmodium in response to environmental changes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>Overall, the present study has corroborated that PfaE3 is not essential for P. falciparum survival during erythrocytic life, but that the protein plays a role independent of apicoplast PDC in maintaining cellular redox homoeostasis and that it impacts on cell cycle progression during this life-cycle stage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>These phenotypes require further investigation to fully understand the functions of the protein in addition to being a vital component of apicoplast PDC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>In addition, we provide evidence for a dimeric PfaE3 molecule in solution that differs significantly from its human counterpart, thus offering the potential for the development of transmission-blocking or exo-erythrocytic anti-malarial intervention strategies. </plain></SENT>
