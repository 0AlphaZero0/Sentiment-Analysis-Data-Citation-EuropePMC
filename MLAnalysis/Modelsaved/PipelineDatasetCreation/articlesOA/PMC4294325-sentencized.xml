</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the 10th most common cancer worldwide and ranks fourth in cancer-related mortality in the USA and fifth in the UK [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The high incidence of mortality is a consequence of late presentation, frequent inoperability of the cancer and poor response to the currently available pharmacological modalities for PDAC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Nearly all patients diagnosed with PDAC die from the disease, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 5% [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The dismal outcome of current therapies underlines the need to better understand pancreatic cancer biology in order to identify novel approaches. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The histology of pancreatic cancer is notable for a prominent desmoplastic reaction predominantly driven by pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>PSCs, called stellate cells because of their star-shape, can be activated by inflammatory stimuli, injury and cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>When activated, PSCs lose their vitamin A storage droplets, express vimentin and α-smooth muscle actin and release high levels of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and growth factors that promote proliferation, survival and migration of PCCs [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this desmoplastic reaction acts as a physical obstacle to drug delivery and impairs the response to radiotherapy [4, 5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>PSCs were also shown to contribute to the immune suppressive environment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In particular, it was reported that high levels of Galectin-1, secreted by the PSCs, induced apoptosis of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Another recent study showed that PSCs secreted cytokines such as IL-6 that enhanced the differentiation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and promoted their immunosuppressive activity [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, activated PSCs were suggested to act as a physical barrier by blocking access of CD8+ T cells to cancer cells [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms by which PSCs influence the immunoresponse are not completely understood and remain subject of active research [10, 11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Because of the prominent desmoplastic reaction in pancreatic cancer, we designed a study to investigate biologically potent secreted chemokines specifically induced by coculture of hPSC with PCC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>After comparing a panel of 50 factors produced by PSC alone or in coculture with PCC, IP-10 emerged as a cytokine induced by coculture that could have a significant effect on the immunological microenvironment of the tumors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this hypothesis, IP-10 levels correlated with infiltration of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and survival in human PDAC. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>In addition, siRNA knockdown of IP-10 in hPSC abrogated the increase in IP-10 protein levels, while siRNA knockdown in PSN-1 did not affect IP-10 levels in the cocultures (Figure 2C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>These experiments demonstrate that PSCs are the major source of IP-10 in the cocultures and implicate soluble factors derived from the tumor cells in the induction. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Since PSCs are the most prominent cell type in the extensive stromal reaction typical of PDAC, we asked whether we could identify specific factors involved in the interaction between PSCs and PCCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>As an initial approach, we compared the expression of a panel of cytokines and growth factors in the supernatant of PSCs compared to conventional fibroblasts in order to characterize the PSC-specific profile. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Together with other factors already known to be secreted by PSCs such as IL-8, IL-6 and SDF-1α, we found that human PSCs secrete LIF, IL-1Rα, IL-15, GROα, eotaxin and IP-10. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, by comparing the expression of cytokines and growth factors from monoculture and coculture supernatants of PSCs and PCCs, we gained further insights into tumor-stroma interactions establishing that PCCs regulate IP-10 expression by PSCs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>IP-10 was significantly upregulated after coculture of PSCs with five of seven different PCCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>PSCs were the main source of IP-10 in the coculture as its transcription was upregulated specifically in PSCs but not in PCCs, and its secretion was abrogated following knock down of IP-10 in PSCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>IP-10, also called CXCL10, is a chemokine implicated in diverse processes such as inflammation and angiogenesis and it is expressed in patients with a wide range of diseases [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>IP-10 is a known chemoattractant for activated T cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>The effects of IP-10 are mediated through binding to the CXCR3 receptor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>The isoform A of CXCR3 is the receptor for two other IFN-γ inducible chemokines: MIG/CXCL9 and I-TAC/CXCL11 [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>IP-10 together with platelet factor-4/CXCL4 also binds with high affinity to the isoform B of CXCR3 [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>High levels of IP-10 and CXCR3 have been associated with chronic pancreatitis but a role for IP-10 in pancreatic cancer has not been previously reported [27]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Accumulating data implicate CXCR3 signaling in promotion of tumor growth, migration and invasion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>For example, inhibition of CXCR3 signaling by either gene silencing or small molecule inhibitors decreased the number of pulmonary metastases formed by breast cancer cells [17, 28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Activation of CXCR3 signaling was reported to promote tumor growth of glioma and basal cell carcinoma cell lines and to enhance invasion of melanoma and colorectal carcinoma cells [15, 18, 19, 29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Using flow cytometry and western blotting analysis, we detected CXCR3 expression on the plasma membrane of PCCs and both CXCR3-A and –B isoforms were expressed at equivalent levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>However, PCCs did not migrate or proliferate in response to IP-10 stimulation in our experimental setting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, IP-10 stimulation did not induce ERK or Akt activation in PCCs, suggesting that IP-10 may have little direct effects on PCCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>A possible explanation for these different biological outcomes between cancer cell types may rely on the fact that PCCs express equivalent levels of CXCR3-A and CXCR3-B isoforms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Indeed, activation of Ras was shown to downregulate CXCR3-B expression in breast cancer cell lines, which led to upregulation of IP-10 and increased proliferation, likely through activation of the remaining CXCR3-A isoform [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>In prostate cancer cell lines, the ability of CXCR3-binding chemokines to induce migration was also dependent on aberrant expression of CXCR3-A and downregulation of CXCR3-B [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Since most PCCs express CXCR3-B at similar levels as CXCR3-A, this may counteract overall CXCR3 signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Another plausible explanation for our findings is that other chemokines that bind CXCR3, present in pancreatic cancer microenvironment, may mediate migration, invasion and growth of PCCs instead of IP-10. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>It may also be the case that in PCCs, CXCR3 is uncoupled from intracellular signalling and thus IP-10 does not modify the PCCs cellular response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a recent study reported the truncation of 2 amino acids at the N-terminal of IP-10 generated by the dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4 or CD26) [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>The resulting cleaved form of IP-10 is a dominant negative form of the protein, which is capable of binding CXCR3 but does not induce signalling [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>We detected the expression of DPP4 in a number of PCCs (data not shown), hence this may be another possible explanation of why PCCs were not responsive to IP-10 despite the expression of the cognate receptor. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>IP-10 and CXCR3 mRNA levels were upregulated in pancreatic adenocarcinoma of patients obtained from pancreatectomy compared to normal pancreatic tissue, in two independent groups of patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found that IP-10 and CXCR3 levels in human PDAC correlated with higher tumor desmoplasia, suggesting that IP-10 expression may depend on the presence of PSCs in the tumor microenvironment similar to our in vitro model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Importantly, patients with surgically resected PDAC who displayed high intratumoral expression of IP-10 had shorter median overall survival by 18.1 months compared to patients with lower IP-10 levels. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>These data raise questions about the potential mechanisms through which IP-10 may be affecting patient outcome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>In our gene expression analysis of PDAC samples, we found that levels of both IP-10 and its receptor CXCR3 correlated with markers of Tregs (i.e. CD4, FOXP3, CTLA4 and CD39) within PDAC tissue but did not correlate with markers of CD8+ T cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>We also detected high expression of IDO1, a potent immunosuppressive molecule, in association with markers of Tregs and high levels of IP-10 and CXCR3 within PDAC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Tregs can suppress the activity of CD4+ Th1 and effector cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the peripheral tissue where antigen is presented [31, 32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>Tregs can also induce dendritic cells (DCs) to produce IDO1 through the interaction of CTLA4 with CD80 and CD86 molecules expressed by DCs [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>The correlation between IP-10 and markers of Tregs, together with the local expression of IDO1 suggest the presence of an immunosuppressive environment within the PDAC tissues where IP-10 is upregulated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found that CXCR3 expression levels were inversely correlated with PRF1, an effector molecule of CTLs and NK cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is likely that IP-10 and CXCR3 expression may be associated with the presence of functionally active Tregs, which in turn, may contribute to immunosuppression by blocking the cytotoxic activity of CTLs or NK. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we established that IP-10 is a chemoattractant for CXCR3+ CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells as well as CXCR3+ Tregs isolated from blood samples of PDAC patients and healthy volunteers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we also found that IP-10 was capable of recruiting a subset of T cells expressing CD3, CD56 and CXCR3 exclusively in PBMC derived from PDAC patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>These cells are NKT-like cells whose role in tumors remains to be elucidated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Several studies have shown that IP-10 expression correlates with activity of activated T cells or other leukocyte subsets against different tumor types [34–37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>For example, in melanoma samples, IP-10 expression was associated with the number of CXCR3+ lymphocytes and correlated with spontaneous regression of melanoma lesions [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>In colorectal cancer, high levels of IP-10 protein led to increased recruitment of effector CD8+ T cells and predicted longer recurrence-free survival [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>IP-10 was found in 45% of human breast cancers and was associated with CXCR3 expression and lymphocytic infiltration [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Thus, the presence of IP-10 in solid tumors is often considered a good prognostic factor due to their ability to recruit activated lymphocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, a recent study reported that Tregs expressing CXCR3 and the transcriptional factor typical of Th1 immunity T-bet accumulated in response to Th1-type inflammatory stimuli. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>This in turn blocked Th1 immune response in human ovarian cancer ex vivo [39, 40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>It was proposed that CXCR3+ Tregs may respond to CXCR3-ligands to control strong Th1 and CTLs activation, in order to prevent an autoimmune response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis is supported by the fact that in a mouse model of autoimmune hepatitis, adoptive transfer of CXCR3+ Tregs can induce tolerance and ameliorate the disease [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Likewise, other subsets of Tregs expressing Th lineage-specific molecules were shown to suppress the activity of the correspondent Th subset [42,43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>In agreement with previous studies, we found that the presence of Tregs was increased in PDAC compared to normal pancreatic tissue [24, 44, 45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the balance between the ratio of peripheral Tregs and total T cells is altered in pancreatic cancer patients [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Our data show that PDAC patients have on average double the number of Tregs in the peripheral blood compared to healthy controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Thus, increased expression of IP-10 in pancreatic cancer tissue, although would lead to recruitment of CXCR3+ Tregs and CXCR3+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as shown in our in vitro assay, may preferentially contribute to increased infiltration of Tregs in the tumor due to the elevated numbers of circulating Tregs, hence inhibiting tumor immunoresponse. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>It is important to consider that in other tumor types such as breast cancer and melanoma, IP-10 may drive an anti-tumoral response by recruiting CXCR3+ Th1 lymphocytes [34, 35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>These opposing effects could be attributed to an altered balance between CXCR3+ Th1 and CXCR3+ Tregs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>The imbalance between Tregs and CD8+ T cells in the circulation of pancreatic cancer patients could explain the results found in different cancer types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>We have to consider also that CXCR3 is a promiscuous receptor and that, in addition to IP-10, it can bind CXCL11/I-TAC, CXCL9/Mig and CXCL4/PF-4 [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>The presence of these chemokines in the tumour microenvironment could have additional effects on immune cell recruitment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the way different chemokines affect the immune response may vary between tumor entities and even between patients and further experiments are needed to understand the role of this chemokine network in PDAC. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Based on our findings, we propose a model in which stromal expression of IP-10, induced by PCCs, recruits immunosuppressive CXCR3+ Tregs into PDAC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Tregs may then block the stimulation of T effector cells by antigen presenting cells, and/or directly inhibit T effector and NK cells, consequently favoring pancreatic tumor growth and progression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study suggests that IP-10 upregulation in pancreatic cancer stroma may regulate recruitment of lymphocytes and consequently the immunoresponse against the tumor in a context-dependent manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Additionally, it indicates the potential use of IP-10 as a biomarker to predict survival in patients with resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Validation of this model can provide novel insights regarding the physiological and pathological functions of IP-10, and can have important implication for the development of new multimodal therapeutic approaches. </plain></SENT>
