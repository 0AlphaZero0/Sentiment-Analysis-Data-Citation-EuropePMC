</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The mitochondrial electron transport chain, a central component of cellular energy production, relies on the coevolution of mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded genes to function [1,2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Mito-nuclear coevolution is however easily disrupted because genomes have different mutation rates, modes of inheritance, number and speed of recombination events, effective population size and selection pressures [3-5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Such disruption can cause the emergence and maintenance of mito-nuclear incompatibilities (MNIs, among other types of genomic incompatibilities [6-9]) that are described by the Dobzhansky-Muller model [10,11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities have been implicated in intrinsic post-zygotic barriers [8] and involved in mito-nuclear gene interactions in the fruit fly Drosophila [5], the parasitoid wasp Nasonia [12-14], the Atlantic eel Anguilla [15,16] and the marine copepod Trigriopus californicus [4,17,18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Studying reproductive isolation is especially relevant in the marine environment, where many marine organisms have a high fecundity, large population sizes and a high dispersive potential [19], and where physical barriers to dispersal are not readily apparent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Endogenous barriers to gene flow may therefore be an important factor structuring marine populations in this environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In addition, marine taxa can be sensitive to glaciation cycles that can promote the establishment of secondary contact zones and therefore lead to admixture of genetically divergent backgrounds [20]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In this context, the Baltic clam Macoma balthica (Mollusca: Bivalvia: Tellinidae) is a noteworthy model for studying the role of MNIs in structuring marine populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>This infaunal tellinid bivalve occurs on sandy-mud flats from the upper intertidal to the subtidal, in parts of the northern hemisphere. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Its natural European range extends from eastern Russia (Pechora Sea) to southern France (Gironde Estuary). Ma. balthica is characterized by a complex colonization history in Europe. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>With the opening of the Bering Strait, several trans-arctic invasion events of Pacific populations into the Atlantic have occurred, leading to secondary contact of divergent lineages in the Bay of Biscay [21] and in the Baltic and White seas [22], allowing gene flow between previously-isolated populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The long periods of reproductive isolation between these populations (~0.1-1.8 My between Bay of Biscay populations [23]; ~ 2–3.5 My between Ma. balthica balthica and Ma. balthica rubra subspecies [22]) represent strong potential for the accumulation of genetic incompatibilities. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>A recent FST scan based on transcriptome data highlighted outlier loci coding for nuclear subunits of the FOF1-ATP synthase complex (subunits alpha, gamma and O) and a putative isoform of the NADH deshydrogenase [24], which are involved in the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHO) mitochondrial chain [1,2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>These protein complexes are composed of subunits encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial genes [2] and require tight mito-nuclear coevolution to be fully operational. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>They are therefore prime candidates for the establishment of MNIs following secondary contact between previously allopatric populations [6,17], which may constitute endogenous barriers to gene flow. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Sequences from only two mitochondrial genes have been published to date for this species (cox3 [22]; cox1 [21,23]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>To work toward the diagnosis of MNIs in Ma. balthica and further test the hypothesis of mito-nuclear coevolution breakdown among Ma. balthica lineages, additional mitochondrial data are therefore required for comparison with the nuclear transcriptomic data at hand. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Although several mitogenomes have been sequenced for marine bivalves (e.g. [25,26]) only one is currently available for the Tellinidae (Moerella iridescens [26]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>However, mitochondrial sequences of Mo. iridescens are highly divergent from those of Ma. balthica (raw p-distance at cox1 of 17%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>We have therefore set to sequence the mitogenomes of six Ma. balthica individuals spanning two secondary contact zones (i.e. across the Kattegat strait and the Brittany peninsula) to test whether mitochondrial genes interacting with previously-detected nuclear outlier loci show stronger divergence and selection pressures, compared to other mitochondrial genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Our intents were (i) to detect and map protein-coding genes (PCGs) involved in the OXPHO chain, (ii) to estimate the degree of divergence and selection pressures across lineages for all PCGs, and (iii) to map mutations onto predicted secondary structure of mitochondrial membrane-embedded protein to help detect potential incompatibilities among mitochondrial and nuclear OXPHO subunits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>In particular, we characterize a putative atp8 gene and discuss its functionality, as (i) it is absent in about half of the published bivalve mitogenomes, and (ii) its role is potentially relevant to the study of MNIs in Ma. balthica. </plain></SENT>
