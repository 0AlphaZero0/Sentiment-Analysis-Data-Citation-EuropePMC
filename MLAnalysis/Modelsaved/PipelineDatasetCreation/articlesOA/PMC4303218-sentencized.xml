</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Classic galactosemia (OMIM #230400) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the GALT gene, resulting in deficient activity of galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT, EC 2.7.7.12), a key enzyme in galactose metabolism (Fridovich-Keil and Walter 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>GALT catalyzes the second step of the Leloir pathway, converting galactose-1-phosphate (Gal-1-P) and uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose (UDP-Glc) into glucose-1-phosphate and UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal) (Fridovich-Keil and Walter 2008). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In classic galactosemia, acute symptoms generally appear soon after birth upon exposure to milk, and include the following: vomiting, diarrhea, excessive weight loss, lethargy, hypotonia, liver dysfunction, and, in the absence of intervention, can escalate to cataracts, Escherichia (E.) coli sepsis, and eventually to neonatal death (Holton et al. 2001; Bosch 2006; Suchy et al. 2007; Fridovich-Keil and Walter 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>These symptoms generally self-resolve once the patient is placed on a stringent lifelong dietary restriction of galactose, which is the current standard of care (Fridovich-Keil 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>However, despite resolving the acute and potentially lethal symptoms, the dietetic treatment does not prevent the development of serious long-term complications, namely cognitive and neurologic disabilities, and premature ovarian insufficiency in females (Waggoner et al. 1990; Fridovich-Keil and Walter 2008). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Thus far, 266 variations have been described at the GALT locus (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arup.utah.edu/database/GALT/GALT_display.php">http://www.arup.utah.edu/database/GALT/GALT_display.php</ext-link>, last surveyed on December 2013), of which missense mutations constitute the majority (&gt;60%), despite the high allelic heterogeneity (Calderon et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In particular, the c.563A&gt;G transition, originating the p.Q188R variant, is by far the most frequent, accounting for ∼63% of GALT mutant alleles (Elsas et al. 1995; Tyfield et al. 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Its incidence is particularly high in European descendant patients, reaching &gt;90% of mutant alleles in Ireland; it has, however, never been reported in Asian descendant patients (Hirokawa et al. 1999; Fridovich-Keil and Walter 2008; Coss et al. 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Other frequent mutations originate the p.S135L, p.K285N, and, p.N314D variants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The c.404 C&gt;T mutation (p.S135L) affects mostly African descendant patients, ranging from approximately half of mutant alleles in African Americans to ∼90% in South African patients (Elsas et al. 1995; Tyfield et al. 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The second most frequent GALT mutant allele in European descendant patients is c.855G&gt;T (p.K285N), with a higher incidence in Eastern Europe, reaching 34% in Poland (Elsas et al. 1995; Tyfield et al. 1999; Zekanowski et al. 1999; Suzuki et al. 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The c.940A&gt;G mutation (p.N314D) appears to be an evolutionary remnant, as the D314 is actually the ancestral variant that persists nowadays at a pan-ethnic frequency of nearly 10% (Suzuki et al. 2001; Carney et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>This missense variation is associated with two variant forms depending on the presence of additional base changes: the Los Angeles variant, which carries p.N314D in linkage disequilibrium with p.L218L (c.652C&gt;T; CTA→TTA) (Langley et al. 1997); and the Duarte variant, which carries p.N314D in linkage disequilibrium with three intronic variations (c.378-27G&gt;C, c.507+62G&gt;A, c.508-24G&gt;A), and a deletion in the GALT promoter (c.-119_-116delGTCA) (Elsas et al. 2001; Trbusek et al. 2001; Carney et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Functional studies revealed that the translation favorable codon TTA from p.L218L (Langley et al. 1997) and the promoter deletion (Trbusek et al. 2001) are respectively responsible for the altered activities of the Los Angeles and Duarte variants, and that the p.N314D variation is actually not a disease-causing mutation and is better considered a polymorphism. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Notwithstanding the several studies on the molecular basis of these mutations' pathogenicity (Reichardt et al. 1991; Fridovich-Keil and Jinks-Robertson 1993; Fridovich-Keil et al. 1995a,b; Lai et al. 1996, 1998, 1999; Langley et al. 1997; Wells and Fridovich-Keil 1997; Lai and Elsas 2001; Riehman et al. 2001; Chhay et al. 2008), a characterization of these variants focusing on different structural features is still missing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>To date, there is no solved three-dimensional structure of the human GALT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>However, based on the availability of the E. coli GalT structure (Wedekind et al. 1995) and on the high sequence identity and similarity between the human and the prokaryotic GALT, a three-dimensional model of the human GALT was herein generated (Fig.1A and B), as previously reported (Marabotti and Facchiano 2005), which provided important insights into the structural and functional features of this protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>GALT is a member of the transferase branch of the histidine triad (HIT) family of enzymes; the catalytic site sequence His-Pro-His is conserved in nature, and was firstly identified in the E. coli enzyme at residues 164–166, corresponding to residues 184–186 in the human sequence (Wedekind et al. 1995; Brenner 2002; Leslie 2003; Marabotti and Facchiano 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The reaction displays ping-pong kinetics and a double displacement mechanism, involving an uridylyl-enzyme, in which the nucleophilic histidine at residue 186 is transiently nucleotidylated (Wong and Frey 1974; Field et al. 1989; Wedekind et al. 1995). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The active enzyme is an 86.6-kDa homodimer (Fig.1A), with two active sites, each formed by residues contributed by both subunits (Thoden et al. 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Whereas the E. coli GalT has two mononuclear metal-binding sites (one for zinc and the other for iron) with proposed structural roles, the human GALT lacks two of the zinc ligands, thus it remains to be established whether metal binding in the human protein is comparable to that of the bacterial GalT (Geeganage and Frey 1999). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the conformational impact of the most prevalent mutations, which hampers the design of alternative therapies for this monogenic disorder based on the use of stabilizing low-molecular-weight compounds (Leandro and Gomes 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the aim of this study was to further investigate the structural–functional effects of the most prevalent mutations in the GALT gene, originating the p.Q188R, p.S135L, p.K285N, and p.N314D variants, and of five other clinically relevant mutations (variants p.R148Q, p.G175D, p.P185S, p.R231C, and p.R231H). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>This variant's functional impairment could therefore result from over-stabilization of the substrates and/or products blocking the enzyme active site for further reaction turnover. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Such a disturbed intermediate stabilization had already been proposed by Marabotti and Facchiano (2005), who remarked that this analysis is highly dependent on the accuracy of the predicted location of the R188 side-chain, observed to adopt different geometries among different models (Fig.1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>In addition to the local H-bond network differences, we observed a significant change in the electrostatic surface surrounding this position (Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>S4), consistent with the substitution of a globally neutral amide with the positively charged guanidinium of arginine, which may also affect binding of mostly negatively charged reaction substrates and products. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>It remains to be clarified how this substitution renders this variant insensitive to zinc-induced destabilization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these observations demonstrate how local subtle changes can propagate into other regions of the protein with dramatic global effects. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Besides local changes in the H-bonds and electrostatic interactions resulting from the studied mutations, most studied variants that presented disturbed aggregation kinetics also displayed predicted effects on their surface electrostatic charges, either inverting the polarity of the local charges, or neutralizing them (Figs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>S4–S12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Although this is not a necessary condition to alter the aggregation propensity, it may contribute to stabilize non-native conformations with downstream effects on protein aggregation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Moreover, taking into account the proposal that GALT may assemble with GALE and GALK a supra-molecular structure localized to discrete spots in the cell (Christacos et al. 2000; McCorvie and Timson 2011), surface charge perturbations could hamper the formation of such complexes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Since the structural and molecular modeling studies do not unequivocally explain the disturbed aggregation profiles, it is likely that the subtle structural changes resulting from each mutation have an impact on the protein dynamics, extending the lifetime of conformations with a higher exposure of hydrophobic residues, that could act as nuclei triggering aggregation of the misfolded variants (e.g., Saunders and Bottomley 2009; Kubota et al. 2011). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Several studies have aimed to analyze the functional impairment of the most prevalent mutations in classic galactosemia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>A recent report suggests protein misfolding as the pathogenic mechanism of several GALT missense mutations, as commonly observed for genetic diseases (Gregersen et al. 2006; McCorvie et al. 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>In our functional and structural impact studies on the most frequent variations in classic galactosemia (p.Q188R, p.S135L, p.K285N, and p.N314D) accounting for the vast majority of mutant alleles at a global scale, the most striking and novel observation is that most variants display disturbed aggregation profiles, despite the absence of detectable structural effects on their secondary and tertiary structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>This is particularly relevant for p.Q188R, resulting from the most prevalent mutation, accounting for ∼60% of the mutant alleles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>This observation is extremely important, since at the cellular level, the accumulation of aggregation-prone proteins interferes severely with the cellular homeostasis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Fibroblasts from p.Q188R homozygous patients displayed increased endoplasmic reticulum stress (Slepak et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Moreover, studies on GALT-null galactosemia models revealed increased unfolded protein response (De-Souza et al. 2014) and oxidative stress levels (Jumbo-Lucioni et al. 2013), also suggesting that there is a basal level of protein homeostasis disturbance associated with galactosemia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>There is an increasing awareness that accumulation of damaged or abnormal proteins is the underlying pathogenic molecular mechanism of several diseases, and several studies on inborn errors of metabolism revealed protein aggregation as a more common pathogenic mechanism than previously thought (Pedersen et al. 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>A relevant example concerns the in vivo GALE aggregation in type III galactosemia (Bang et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the results from the structural analyses of the GALT mutants herein characterized strongly suggest that GALT aggregation associated with protein misfolding might be a major pathogenic mechanism in classic galactosemia, setting the basis for future studies on in vivo GALT aggregation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Therefore, an intervention at the level of proteostasis modulation and correction of protein misfolding (by chemical and/or pharmacological chaperones) could not only increase the lifetime of partially active variants, but also prevent the accumulation of protein aggregates and simultaneously alleviate the disease phenotype associated with protein homeostasis disturbances. </plain></SENT>
