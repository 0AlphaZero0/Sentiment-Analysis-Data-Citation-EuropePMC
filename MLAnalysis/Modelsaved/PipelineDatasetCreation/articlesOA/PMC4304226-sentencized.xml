<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Different from eNOS and nNOS, iNOS is not expressed in resting cells but induced upon inflammatory and immunologic stimulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Each NOS protomer consists of an oxygenase and a reductase domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In the catalytic oxygenase domain (NOS oxy), dioxygen (O 2) binds to a central heme prosthetic group, anchored to the polypeptide chain via a proximal cysteine residue ( Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Its thiol sulfur atom accepts a hydrogen bond from an adjacent tryptophan residue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The substrate, L-Arg, is accommodated directly on top of the heme plane in the distal pocket; the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin, H4B, binds along the side of the heme 4– 7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>L-Arg and H4B are linked through an extended hydrogen bonding network mediated by one of the heme propionate groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The reductase domain, NOS red, binds flavin mononucleotide (FMN), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>It provides the electrons for the catalytic reaction proceeding in the oxygenase domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In a first step, L-Arg is converted to N-hydroxy L-Arg (NOHA). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Formation of the very stable ferrous NO complex results in self-inhibition of the enzyme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The probability of forming this product depends on the dissociation rate coefficient of NO from the ferric heme, the likelihood of autoreduction of the ferric NO-bound form to the ferrous derivative with its much stronger NO affinity, and the probability of oxidizing the ferrous NO-bound species to the ferric form plus nitrate by O 2 10. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Deactivation of the enzyme may also occur via nitrosylation of the side chains of two cysteine residues coordinating a zinc ion in the dimer interface, which leads to irreversible dissociation into non-functional monomers 11– 14. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The iNOS isoform has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases; so there is a growing interest in developing potent and highly selective inhibitors 15, 16. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Their targeted design requires detailed insights into the interactions between ligand, substrate and the surrounding protein matrix. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we have investigated ligand and substrate binding in the iNOS oxygenase domain, iNOS oxy, by using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of the stretching vibrations of carbon monoxide (CO) and NO as ligands rather than the physiological ligand O 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>They are of similar size as O 2, which suggests that ligand dynamics within the protein may be comparable for all three ligands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>CO and NO both have excellent properties as infrared (IR) spectroscopic probes 17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>CO has proven to be an attractive heme ligand because the CO bond stretching vibration gives rise to strong mid-IR absorption bands that can be measured with exquisite sensitivity and precision 17, 18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The IR bands are fine-tuned by electrostatic interactions with the environment 19– 21; therefore, CO is frequently utilized as a local probe of protein structure and dynamics 22. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>When bound to the central iron of a heme cofactor, the CO stretching frequency, ν CO, which is typically in the 1900 – 2000 cm -1 spectral range, is susceptible to changes in the iron-ligand bond and the local electric field due to the vibrational Stark effect 24– 29. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>There are two major contributions to the heme iron-CO bond, i.e., σ-donation from a weakly antibonding 5σ MO of CO to the iron 4s and 3d z 2 orbitals and π-backbonding from the iron 3d z orbitals to the strongly antibonding CO 2π* orbital 30. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>A positive charge located near the CO oxygen attracts electron density, causing a decrease in σ-donation and an increase in backbonding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the C–O bond order is reduced and ν CO shifts to lower values 19– 21. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>A negative charge has the opposite effect. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The vibrational bands can reveal changes related to ligand relocation to other sites within the protein 18, 29, 32, 33, rotational motions of the ligand in these sites 25, 34 and protein conformational changes 35. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Often, there are doublets of bands corresponding to opposite orientations of the CO at a particular transient docking site 27, 29, 32, 36– 38. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The bond order and, therefore, ν CO increases if the carbon atom interacts with a hydrogen bond donor, whereas an interaction with the ligand oxygen reduces both the bond strength and the stretching frequency 29. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Unlike CO, which only binds to a ferrous (Fe II) heme iron, NO may coordinate to both the ferrous and the ferric (Fe III) forms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>So far, FTIR studies using NO have remained scarce because of its weaker intrinsic absorption. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there is spectral overlap with the amide bands and ultrafast recombination of a major fraction of proteins even at very low temperatures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Therefore, only small photoproduct yields are obtained in experiments probing longer times such as FTIR, which renders experiments with ferrous NO technically challenging. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Consequently, we have limited ourselves to NO binding to ferric heme in this work. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>For iNOS, this complex is of physiological relevance because the heme iron is in the ferric state after completion of the catalytic cycle. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Here, we have performed FTIR studies on iNOS at cryogenic temperatures, at which ligand rebinding is very slow. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Thus, photoproducts induced by illumination are long-lived and can be conveniently studied by photolysis difference spectroscopy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Moreover, essentially all protein (and solvent) motions are frozen in 39, 40, so the ligands cannot escape to the solvent and can be observed within the protein matrix. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>In the following, we present 4-K FTIR photolysis difference spectra of iNOS oxy-CO and briefly discuss the influence of substrate, substrate intermediate and cofactor on the CO stretching vibration and rebinding. </plain></SENT>

The 4-K absorption difference spectrum of iNOS oxy-CO displays two broad, extensively overlapping A bands at 1945 and 1959 cm –1, indicative of two active site subconformations with significant intrinsic structural heterogeneity ( Figure 2a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Adding the H4B cofactor induces only small changes; the resulting spectrum can be described by a dominant A band centered on 1951 cm -1 and a minor one at 1924 cm -1 ( Figure 2a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>As H4B binds along the side of the heme 4 and, thus, not in the immediate vicinity of the heme-bound CO, it is not expected to modify ν CO to any significant extent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the presence of L-Arg shifts the main A band of iNOS oxy-CO/L-Arg to 1904 cm -1; smaller features are located at 1921 and 1951 cm -1 ( Figure 2a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>The pronounced red-shift of A 1904 arises from the electron-withdrawing effect of the terminal, positively charged NH 2 + moiety of the L-Arg side chain close to the bound CO 4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>The position of the A 1921 band is indicative of an electrostatic interaction of the CO dipole with a less pronounced positive partial charge, most likely the neutral terminal amino group of the L-Arg side chain. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>The crystal structure shows that NOHA binds in the same orientation in the active site as L-Arg, with the side chain pointing towards the heme iron 47. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we suggest that, in those iNOS oxy molecules absorbing within the A 1937 band, a hydrogen bonding interaction exists between the CO ligand and the hydroxyl group of the NOHA side chain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>A 1903 is most likely associated with iNOS oxy molecules, in which the terminal amine of the NOHA side chain is protonated (p K = 8.1 48) and points towards the heme-bound CO. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>With H4B, photoproduct bands appear at 2124 and 2133 cm -1, indicating that the cofactor has an effect on ν CO of the unbound CO. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>In the presence of L-Arg, the absorption bands are centered on 2120 and 2131 cm -1, and there are two additional bands at 2144 and 2150 cm -1. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>The admixture of a ferrous NO species in our samples does not come as a surprise. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Ferric iNOS oxy-NO is unstable and spontaneously converts to a ferrous 6C NO-ligated species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>This conversion may take place during loading and cooling of an FTIR sample, which typically takes ~2 h. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>This species may subsequently evolve further to a five-coordinate (5C) complex by dissociation of the thiolate ligand on time scales of minutes to hours, depending on the iNOS oxy oligomerization state 67, 71– 73. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>Here, we can safely exclude formation of significant amounts of 5C ferrous iNOS oxy-NO because we have not observed the characteristic IR bands of this species at ~1670 cm -1 53. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>NO photodissociation from the 6C adduct is not expected to generate NO photoproduct bands that are of similar strength as the original A 1616 band. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Therefore, there must be yet another species responsible for the strong absorption at ~1820 cm -1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Perhaps, light-induced breakage of the iron-sulfur rather than the iron-NO bond could lead to an alternative photoproduct, considering the strong trans effect exerted by the NO in 6C ferrous heme NO adducts 66. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Indeed, Ibrahim et al. 74 had noticed earlier that laser light passing through solution samples of 6C ferrous model porphyrins adducts during resonance Raman measurements was sufficient to photodissociate the axial thiolate base trans to the NO 75. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>This effect could be suppressed by lowering the temperature to 77 K and reducing the laser power. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we have illuminated the iNOS oxy-NO/L-Arg sample at low laser intensity (0.3 mW at 532 nm). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>This power was still sufficient to photodissociate the NO from the 6C ferric heme adduct (dotted line in Figure 5), photoproduct bands at ~1820 cm -1, however, did not emerge, confirming that the photoproduct was not formed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we propose that illumination of 6C ferrous iNOS oxy-NO with sufficient laser power leads to rupture of the bond between the iron and the proximal Cys194 thiolate, leaving behind a 5C iNOS oxy-NO. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Because the NO is still bound to the heme iron, the intensity of the IR bands at ~1820 cm -1 is comparable to that of other A bands 25, 34. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>The NO stretching frequency of the 5C adduct indicates that the ligand is coordinated to a ferric iron, so that the Cys194 sulfur is negatively charged after photodissociation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Similar NO stretching frequencies were reported for an isolated 5C ferric heme nitrosyl complex (ν NO = 1842 cm -1 76) and for NO-ligated porphyrins with phenyl (ν NO = 1825 cm -1) and pentafluorophenyl (ν NO = 1859 cm -1) substituents on the four meso positions 77. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>If the laser power is sufficiently high (300 mW), it is even possible to photodissociate the NO from the 5C ferric iNOS oxy-NO, leaving behind a four-coordinate, ‘naked’ heme as a ‘secondary photoproduct’ ( Figure 7a). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>L-Arg binding in the active site lowers the yield of ferric 5C iNOS oxy-NO upon laser illumination ( Figures 7a and c) and favors reformation of the iron-sulfur bond as soon as the laser is switched off ( Figures 7b and d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>This effect may result from the competition between the NO ligand and the thiolate for σ charge donation to the heme iron; the higher the donation, the stronger the bond to the donor and the weaker the bond to the opposing heme ligand. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>The σ donor strength of the thiolate is altered by hydrogen bonding interactions to the sulfur atom 66. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Using sulfur K-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, Dey et al. 78 showed that each hydrogen bond reduces the electron-donating power of the thiolate sulfur. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>The NO electron donor ability and, therefore, its repulsive trans effect can be reduced by interactions that draw electron density away from the NO 79, 80, here by the hydrogen bonding interaction with L-Arg, so that the axial iron-sulfur bond is stabilized. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Ferric 5C iNOS oxy-NO. In view of the competition between the NO ligand and the thiolate for σ charge donation to the heme iron, one should expect ν NO of the 5C photoproduct lacking the thiolate ligand to be blue-shifted with respect to ν NO of the 6C adduct because the repulsive trans effect of the thiolate has been removed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>Experimentally, however, the opposite behavior is observed ( Figure 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>To resolve this apparent discrepancy, one has to consider that the 5C ferric form originates from a 6C ferrous species, in which the NO is typically bound at an angle of ~140°. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>In the corresponding 6C ferric derivatives, the Fe – N – O angle is normally ~160°. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>At cryogenic temperatures, the dynamics of the protein matrix is completely arrested 39, 40. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the NO is held in the strongly bent (lower angle) orientation of the 6C ferrous form. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>Based on DFT calculations, Linder et al. 81 reported that reducing the angle from 160° to 150° shifts ν NO in 5C model porphyrins from 1897 to 1857 cm -1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we suggest that the low ν NO of the 5C form is caused by NO binding at a small angle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>We note that the similar ν NO in 5C and 6C ferric iNOS oxy-NO/L-Arg implies that the bound substrate controls the angle at which the NO binds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>Apparently, steric constraints override the bending induced by the trans effects. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>Finally, we point out that, in contrast to the photo-induced 6C ferric → 5C ferric transition observed in the FTIR experiments at cryogenic temperatures, the spontaneous conversion of the 6C ferric NO-bound iNOS oxy derivative at physiological temperatures involves two NO molecules and yields a 5C ferrous species 71, 72, 82. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>After binding the first NO, the ferric 6C iNOS oxy-NO reacts with a second ligand to yield 6C ferrous iNOS oxy-NO. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>This complex immediately converts to the 5C form and a nitrosonium ion (NO +). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>FTIR spectroscopy at cryogenic temperatures, especially in combination with sophisticated illumination and data acquisition temperature protocols, provides quantitative data on protein-ligand interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>Our FTIR-TDS studies on iNOS oxy have shown that CO and NO rebinding involve only a single transient state in iNOS oxy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>The CO is stabilized in well-defined orientations at the docking site by hydrogen bonding interactions and, therefore, gives rise to rather narrow photoproduct bands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>In contrast, photoproduct bands associated with the photolyzed NO cannot be resolved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>The NO appears to be trapped in less specific orientations, which may favor the release of this ligand. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>Under physiological conditions, release of the generated NO from the protein is facilitated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>Upon illumination of 6C ferrous iNOS oxy-NO at cryogenic temperatures, a 5C ferric NO adduct was identified, providing direct evidence for light-induced breakage of the iron-thiolate bond. </plain></SENT>
