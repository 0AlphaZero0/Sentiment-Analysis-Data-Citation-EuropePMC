Low frequency polymorphisms existed in all individuals (mean = 5.8%). Most nrDNA positions (91%) were polymorphic in at least one individual, with polymorphic sites being less frequent in subunit regions and loops. Highly polymorphic sites existed in each individual, with highest abundance in the &#8220;noncoding&#8221; ITS regions.

The use of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) soon became a popular choice for phylogenetic inference (<xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">Hamby &amp; Zimmer, 1988</xref>; <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">Hillis &amp; Dixon, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Baldwin, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Baldwin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">&#193;lvarez &amp; Wendel, 2003</xref>). Nuclear ribosomal DNA offered several advantages over other loci: the combination of highly conserved and variable regions allowed phylogenetic inference across a broad range of evolutionary time scales; conserved regions allowed the use of &#8220;universal&#8221; PCR primers applicable to a wide range of taxa; the high copy number of nrDNA repeats allowed reliable amplification from lower quality DNA extractions; and the process of concerted evolution ensured that these copies were similar within individuals (<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Baldwin et al., 1995</xref>). The use of nrDNA, particularly the variable internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions, became widespread, to the extent that many studies were based exclusively on ITS data (<xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">&#193;lvarez &amp; Wendel, 2003</xref>).</p><p>However, nrDNA loci have been shown to harbor limitations in their phylogenetic utility. Nuclear ribosomal DNA copies are assembled as tandem repeats at one or more loci in the genome, with each locus being known as an array. The number of repeats present within an array is labile, as is the number and location of arrays (<xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">&#193;lvarez &amp; Wendel, 2003</xref>). The process of nrDNA copy homogenization from homologous recombination or unequal crossing over is thought to occur much more frequently within than among arrays (<xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">Schl&#246;tterer &amp; Tautz, 1994</xref>). Thus, differing nrDNA alleles may become fixed in different arrays within a genome, creating paralogy that, if unrecognized, may confound phylogenetic inference (<xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">&#193;lvarez &amp; Wendel, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, these events can create pseudogenes which, freed from selective pressures, may evolve through processes quite different from the functional loci and provide misleading evidence for between-individual genetic divergences if compared to functional copies (<xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">Buckler, Ippolito &amp; Holtsford, 1997</xref>). These events may occur at a greater rate than inter-array homogenization via concerted evolution (<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Karvonen &amp; Savolainen, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Gernandt &amp; Liston, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Due to the technical difficulty of systematically sequencing individual nrDNA loci because of their high copy number, studies characterizing the abundance and patterns of intragenomic nrDNA polymorphisms have been rare. Recently, studies utilizing whole-genome shotgun sequencing have begun to reveal levels of intragenomic polymorphism in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">Stage &amp; Eickbush, 2007</xref>), nematodes (<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Bik et al., 2013</xref>), and fungi (<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Ganley &amp; Kobayashi, 2007</xref>). However, these studies included a small number of species (12, 6, and 5, respectively) and did not attempt to place patterns of polymorphism in a phylogenetic context. <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Song et al. (2012)</xref> examined the ITS2 region of 178 plant species via pyrosequencing, finding nearly ubiquitous intragenomic variation, with most ITS2 copies within a genome represented by a few major variants. Other studies have used intragenomic nrDNA polymorphisms to identify populations of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Simon et al., 2012</xref>) and infer intraspecific phylogenies of <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> (<xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr">West et al., 2014</xref>). Studies of intragenomic nrDNA polymorphism patterns across many species within the same genus have not been performed in plants (but see <xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">Straub et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>This study utilizes high throughput technology to survey many species and individuals in the angiosperm genus <italic>Asclepias</italic> (Apocynaceae) in order to characterize levels of intragenomic nrDNA polymorphism and place these within a phylogenetic context. The methods presented here are expanded from those we have previously developed as part of the Milkweed Genome Project (<xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Straub et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">Straub et al., 2012</xref>), and generalized for use with a large number of taxa and any high-copy locus, such as those that may be obtained from a genome-skimming or Hyb-Seq study (<xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">Straub et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr">Weitemier et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Sampling and sequencing</title><p>One hundred twenty-five individuals representing 90 <italic>Asclepias</italic> species and subspecies were sampled (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table-1">Table 1</xref>) and sequencing libraries were produced as described in <xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">Straub et al.

Samples were multiplexed in approximately equimolar ratios, with up to 21 individuals per lane, and sequenced with 80 bp single-end reads on an Illumina GAIIx instrument (Illumina, San Diego California, USA). <italic>Asclepias subverticillata</italic> was multiplexed in a lane with 32 samples and sequenced with 101 bp paired-end reads on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument, with reads analyzed as though they were single-end. One individual of <italic>A. syriaca</italic> was sequenced at higher coverage: this individual was sequenced in a single lane on an Illumina GAIIx with 40 bp single-end reads (<xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Straub et al., 2011</xref>). To allow more efficient assembly downstream, read pools were filtered to remove plastid reads (using the custom script sort_fastq_v1.pl modified to retain Ns; <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Knaus, 2010</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table-1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.718/table-1</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Polymorphic site abundance in <italic>Asclepias</italic>.</title><p>Polymorphic site abundance in <italic>Asclepias</italic> taxa.</p></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="peerj-03-718-g006"/></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table-1fn"><p>

The nontranscribed spacer and external transcribed spacers from each end were removed due to the presence of internal repeats, and the more conserved 18S and 26S subunits used as the boundaries of the alignment. The resulting reference sequence contained 5,839 bp.</p></sec><sec><title>Individual consensus sequences</title><p>Read pools were examined prior to consensus assembly and reads that were exact duplicates were reduced to a single representative, retaining the highest average quality score (using the custom script fastq_collapse.py, available at <uri xlink:href="https://github.com/listonlab">https://github.com/listonlab</uri>). Sequences for each individual were constructed via reference-guided assembly, with <italic>A. syriaca</italic> as the reference, using Alignreads ver. 2.25 (<xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Straub et al., 2011</xref>). Alignreads is a pipeline that includes the short-read assembler YASRA (<xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Ratan, 2009</xref>), utilities from the MUMmer ver. 3.0 suite (<xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">Delcher et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">Kurtz et al., 2004</xref>), and custom scripts. Parameters were selected to ensure high identity of reads mapping to the nrDNA reference (95%), but allow the reconstructed sequence to differ from the reference. In addition to assembling the individual consensus sequence, Alignreads outputs a file associating each position in the group reference with those in the individual consensus.</p></sec><sec><title>Read mapping</title><p>Prior to mapping reads from an individual onto its consensus, reads with an average quality (Phred) score below 20 were removed, and bases in the remaining reads with a score below 20 were converted to Ns using FASTX-Toolkit ver. 0.0.13 (<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Gordon, 2008</xref>). Read mapping was performed with the program BWA ver. 0.5.7 (<xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">Li &amp; Durbin, 2009</xref>), and output files processed with the SAMtools ver. 0.1.13 utilities (<xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Reads were mapped onto the consensus sequence using the default mapping parameters in BWA. These allow up to 3 mismatches against the consensus in an 80 bp read and 4 mismatches in a 100 bp read, with long insertions or deletions excluded. In order to test the effect of relaxed mapping parameters on the abundance of polymorphisms detected, reads were mapped allowing 4 or 5 mismatches in an 80 or 100 bp read, respectively (the <monospace>-n flag</monospace> in <monospace>bwa aln</monospace> set to 0.015). The abundance of intragenomic indels was found by mapping reads using the default mismatch parameters, but allowing indels up to 5 bp long (<monospace>bwa aln -e 4</monospace>).</p></sec><sec><title>Polymorphism counting</title><p>A perl script was developed to tally the number of reads differing from the consensus at each position (polymorphic_read_counter_bwaPileup.pl ver. 3.03b, available at <uri xlink:href="https://github.com/listonlab">https://github.com/listonlab</uri>). For example, a base covered by 10 reads might have 7 reads with a G in that position and 3 with a C. In this case the consensus would have called a G at that position, with 30% of the reads differing. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1">File S1</xref> for exact parameters and a pipeline of commands used.</p><p>Positions with 2% or more of reads differing from the consensus base were considered polymorphic. This cutoff is the same used by <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Straub et al. (2011)</xref> and comparable to that used by <xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">Nguyen et al. (2011)</xref> under a similar quality-filtering scheme. The control <italic>PhiX</italic> lane of the higher coverage <italic>A. syriaca</italic> individual was examined by <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Straub et al.</xref> (<xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, Additional file 1 from that study) and found to have an error rate much less than 2%, indicating that the cutoff used here may be somewhat conservative. In addition to counting positions that were polymorphic, positions were recorded as &#8220;highly polymorphic&#8221; if 10% or more of the reads differed from the consensus.</p><p>In order to keep homologous bases aligned across individuals, only those positions that were present in the <italic>A. syriaca</italic> (group) reference were kept in the analysis (i.e., insertions relative to the reference were discarded). Note that deletions (relative to the reference) fixed within an individual are also not considered because zero reads called a base at that position.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RNA structure determination</title><p>The secondary structure of each subunit and spacer region was predicted for the <italic>A. syriaca</italic> reference from the minimum free energy structure found by the program RNAfold for the 18S, ITS1, and ITS2 regions and RNAcofold for the 5.8S + 26S regions (<xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">Lorenz et al., 2011</xref>). Program default model parameters were used (37 &#176;C, unpaired bases can participate in up to one dangling end).

In the first method, the total length of the tree (parsimony steps) in terms of changes in number of polymorphic positions was compared to a distribution of tree lengths created by 10,000 permutations of polymorphic positions across tips. In the second method, a likelihood ratio test (LRT) was performed between models where character evolution followed a Brownian motion model across the tree. In the first model, the parameter lambda (describing how well the phylogeny correctly predicts the covariance among taxa for a trait) was found that maximized the model&#8217;s likelihood (<xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">Pagel, 1999</xref>). This was compared to the likelihood found when lambda was held at zero, representing phylogenetic independence among species for that trait.

When considering only positions that are highly polymorphic, <italic>Asclepias</italic> exhibits slightly higher rates (mean = 28.4 positions) than fungi and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, but much lower rates than nematodes. However, these comparisons may be misleading: First, the number of nrDNA copies varies greatly between these taxa, estimated to range from about 50&#8211;180 in the fungal species, 200&#8211;250 in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, 56&#8211;323 in the nematodes, and about 960 in <italic>Asclepias</italic> (<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Ganley &amp; Kobayashi, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">Stage &amp; Eickbush, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Straub et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Bik et al., 2013</xref>). Second, polymorphic base pair counts are confounded by differing criteria for scoring polymorphism (i.e., methods for excluding sequencing errors). The levels listed for the fungal species include both &#8220;high-confidence&#8221; and &#8220;low-confidence&#8221; polymorphisms, based primarily on sequence quality (<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Ganley &amp; Kobayashi, 2007</xref>). The levels listed for <italic>Drosophila</italic> are polymorphisms present in &#8805;3% of loci (<xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">Stage &amp; Eickbush, 2007</xref>). <xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Bik et al. (2013)</xref> tallied read counts using a method similar to the method presented here, but called positions polymorphic when the count of differing reads exceeded what would be expected for a single copy locus. Third, sequencing depths of the fungal and <italic>Drosophila</italic> studies were much lower than those used here and with the nematodes (<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Ganley &amp; Kobayashi, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">Stage &amp; Eickbush, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Bik et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, given that <italic>Asclepias</italic> has absolute counts of polymorphic positions at least 33% higher than the other organisms studied, and that the sequencing depth was nearly two orders of magnitude greater in the nematodes than in <italic>Asclepias</italic> (6.3&#8211;10&#215; per nrDNA copy in nematodes, vs. &#8764;0.1&#215; in <italic>Asclepias</italic>; <xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Bik et al., 2013</xref>), it is likely that <italic>Asclepias</italic> harbors greater rates of intragenomic polymorphism within the nrDNA cistron than the organisms studied to date.</p><sec><title>Polymorphism patterns across the nrDNA cistron</title><p>Spacer regions (ITS1, ITS2) had higher frequencies of polymorphic positions than subunit regions (18S, 5.8S, 26S; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2</xref>). However, positions with low polymorphism frequencies are distributed much more evenly across the nrDNA cistron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2A</xref>) than highly polymorphic positions, which show strong differentiation between the subunit and spacer regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2B</xref>). The lower frequency of highly polymorphic positions within the subunit regions suggests that these regions are under selection to remain homogenous within individual genomes. The lower difference in low polymorphism frequency between subunit and spacer regions suggests that this selection pressure is positively correlated with the proportion of nrDNA copies that differ from the majority. These findings contrast with those reported for nematodes (<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Bik et al., 2013</xref>), where the subunit regions had much higher levels of polymorphism abundance than the spacer regions.</p><p>Positions in stem regions were more likely to be polymorphic than loop positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3</xref>). This was strongly significant for all polymorphic positions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table-2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-3">3A</xref>) and moderately significant for highly polymorphic positions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table-3">Table 3B</xref>). This would seem to contradict the hypothesis that stem sites in general should be more highly conserved in order to maintain a functional RNA secondary structure. Indeed, this finding agrees with those from <xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">Rzhetsky (1995)</xref>, who not only found that trees estimated from stem regions contained longer branch lengths than those from loop regions, but that those stem sites least likely to affect secondary structure tended to be less conserved. Loop sites, on the other hand, contain a large proportion of the sites critical to ribosomal function (<xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">Rzhetsky, 1995</xref>), and may be under stronger stabilizing selection than stem sites.</p><p>Among the subunit regions, the 26S region harbored the highest frequency of highly polymorphic positions. This agrees with <xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">Stage &amp; Eickbush (2007)</xref> who showed the <italic>Drosophila</italic> 28S region to have a higher mutation rate than the other subunit regions. However, in that study the 28S region also had a lower frequency of polymorphic base pairs. <xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">Stage &amp; Eickbush (2007)</xref> hypothesize that this is due to the action of two retrotransposable elements found in many <italic>Drosophila</italic> 28S copies, with instances of aborted insertions causing the cell to repair the region using a nearby template and thereby homogenize the copies. They predict that levels of polymorphism will be higher in the 28S region of organisms lacking the retrotransposable elements, as seen here in the homologous angiosperm 26S region.</p><p>Within the subunit regions, highly polymorphic positions may be more common within expansion regions of the RNA gene (less conserved regions that tend to incorporate sequence insertions without affecting functionality; <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al., 1984</xref>). This is strongly implied by the recovery of clusters of highly polymorphic sites near <italic>A. syriaca</italic> positions 4,440 and 5,020, which are directly within the 26S expansion regions seven and eight, respectively (<xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">Kolosha &amp; Fodor, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>). This agrees with results found in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">Stage &amp; Eickbush, 2007</xref>). However, this may not be true for all highly polymorphic sites, as the high peak at position 4,172 is not within an expansion region.</p></sec><sec><title>Phylogenetic context</title><p>Mapping the number of polymorphic positions onto the phylogeny of <italic>Asclepias</italic> demonstrates strong and significant phylogenetic signal when counting all polymorphisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4</xref>), but this signal is not significant when only counting highly polymorphic positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5</xref>). While this study demonstrates phylogenetic signal in polymorphism abundance, it remains unknown whether abundance within a lineage is influenced by selection or purely neutral causes. Different demographic histories across clades could create this effect via neutral causes, while selection against organisms that retain too many variant nrDNA copies could be variable across the genus. Polymorphisms present in a high proportion of nrDNA copies may be uniformly selected against, while low polymorphism sites are tolerated at varying levels. This could explain the lack of phylogenetic signal at the highly polymorphic sites, and its presence when including all polymorphic sites.</p><p>These results have implications for phylogenetic inference based on nrDNA data. As previously cautioned, it cannot be assumed that all copies of nrDNA are identical within a genome. This is especially true for the spacer regions, but also for the subunit regions (<xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">&#193;lvarez &amp; Wendel, 2003</xref>). The discovery of phylogenetic signal in intragenomic polymorphism abundance demonstrates that those positions likely to lead to ambiguities are not distributed evenly across the phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4</xref>). In addition to topology, variable polymorphism rates among lineages may affect the estimation of branch lengths on a tree. This may become especially problematic when nrDNA is used to date phylogenies. Recently developed methods of phylogenetic inference incorporating information about polymorphic positions may be able to alleviate difficulties in tree building caused by uneven levels of polymorphism abundance (<xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">Potts, Hedderson &amp; Grimm, 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of mixed ancestry</title><p>Characterization of intragenomic nrDNA polymorphisms may allow for the identification of hybrid offspring between parents with differing nrDNA sequences (<xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr">Zimmer, Jupe &amp; Walbot, 1988</xref>), and may be able to provide an estimate of the number of generations since hybridization. This is especially true for early generation hybrids, as nrDNA homogenization can occur in a small number of generations (<xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Kovarik et al., 2005</xref>), and mosaic <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> genomes have been identified based on intragenomic polymorphism abundance (<xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr">West et al., 2014</xref>). Neither of the polymorphism profiles for the two wild-collected putative hybrid individuals in this study strongly indicate that they are early generation hybrids. This is in contrast to evidence from nuclear gene sequences that show heterozygosity consistent with inheritance of divergent alleles from the putative parents in the <italic>A. albicans</italic> &#215; <italic>A. subulata</italic> hybrid (B Haack and M Fishbein, 2013, unpublished data). Detection of mixed ancestry may be hampered in this case by a lack of fixed differences between parental haplotypes. Consensus sequences for the <italic>A. albicans</italic> and <italic>A. subulata</italic> individuals in this study show no fixed differences, while one difference is found between the <italic>A. syriaca</italic> and <italic>A. speciosa</italic> consensus sequences. Unexpectedly, this position is monomorphic in the hybrid, while the positions with minor allele frequencies &gt;0.3 are in positions not shown to differ between <italic>A. syriaca</italic> and <italic>A. speciosa</italic>. This likely indicates ancestry from an unsampled nrDNA haplotype.</p><p>Individuals of the same species with dramatically different polymorphism profiles may indicate the presence of cryptic diversity. Differing demographic histories between populations within a species may lead to individuals from those populations possessing different levels of intragenomic polymorphisms. As with the interspecific hybrids discussed above, early generation hybrids between populations within a species could also possess inflated levels of intragenomic polymorphisms.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Nuclear ribosomal DNA copies within individuals of <italic>Asclepias</italic> are not identical, with intragenomic polymorphisms present at a higher rate than reported for other organisms. Polymorphism frequencies across the genus vary by more than an order of magnitude and demonstrate strong phylogenetic signal. Stem positions of ribosomal subunits are more likely to be polymorphic than loop positions. Distribution of polymorphic sites across the nrDNA cistron are consistent with strong selection on nrDNA subunits, with polymorphic sites being more frequent in the spacer regions, and this difference being amplified for sites that are highly polymorphic. These results reinforce the need for caution when using nrDNA for phylogenetic inference, especially when using the spacer regions or for applications requiring the precise estimates of branch lengths or divergence times.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="supplemental-information"><title>Supplemental Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="supp-1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.718/supp-1</object-id><label>File S1</label><caption><title>Command pipeline for tallying polymorphic positions</title><p>This file contains the commands used to tally polymorphic positions for each sample.
