</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>With the advent of DNA sequencing technology to infer phylogenetic relationships, investigators began searching for genetic loci that were both phylogenetically informative and readily sequenced in most organisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The use of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) soon became a popular choice for phylogenetic inference (Hamby &amp; Zimmer, 1988; Hillis &amp; Dixon, 1991; Baldwin, 1992; Baldwin et al., 1995; Álvarez &amp; Wendel, 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Nuclear ribosomal DNA offered several advantages over other loci: the combination of highly conserved and variable regions allowed phylogenetic inference across a broad range of evolutionary time scales; conserved regions allowed the use of “universal” PCR primers applicable to a wide range of taxa; the high copy number of nrDNA repeats allowed reliable amplification from lower quality DNA extractions; and the process of concerted evolution ensured that these copies were similar within individuals (Baldwin et al., 1995). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The use of nrDNA, particularly the variable internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions, became widespread, to the extent that many studies were based exclusively on ITS data (Álvarez &amp; Wendel, 2003). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>However, nrDNA loci have been shown to harbor limitations in their phylogenetic utility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Nuclear ribosomal DNA copies are assembled as tandem repeats at one or more loci in the genome, with each locus being known as an array. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The number of repeats present within an array is labile, as is the number and location of arrays (Álvarez &amp; Wendel, 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The process of nrDNA copy homogenization from homologous recombination or unequal crossing over is thought to occur much more frequently within than among arrays (Schlötterer &amp; Tautz, 1994). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Thus, differing nrDNA alleles may become fixed in different arrays within a genome, creating paralogy that, if unrecognized, may confound phylogenetic inference (Álvarez &amp; Wendel, 2003; Song et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these events can create pseudogenes which, freed from selective pressures, may evolve through processes quite different from the functional loci and provide misleading evidence for between-individual genetic divergences if compared to functional copies (Buckler, Ippolito &amp; Holtsford, 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>These events may occur at a greater rate than inter-array homogenization via concerted evolution (Karvonen &amp; Savolainen, 1993; Gernandt &amp; Liston, 1999). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Due to the technical difficulty of systematically sequencing individual nrDNA loci because of their high copy number, studies characterizing the abundance and patterns of intragenomic nrDNA polymorphisms have been rare. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Recently, studies utilizing whole-genome shotgun sequencing have begun to reveal levels of intragenomic polymorphism in Drosophila (Stage &amp; Eickbush, 2007), nematodes (Bik et al., 2013), and fungi (Ganley &amp; Kobayashi, 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>However, these studies included a small number of species (12, 6, and 5, respectively) and did not attempt to place patterns of polymorphism in a phylogenetic context. Song et al. (2012) examined the ITS2 region of 178 plant species via pyrosequencing, finding nearly ubiquitous intragenomic variation, with most ITS2 copies within a genome represented by a few major variants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Other studies have used intragenomic nrDNA polymorphisms to identify populations of Arabidopsis (Simon et al., 2012) and infer intraspecific phylogenies of Saccharomyces (West et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Studies of intragenomic nrDNA polymorphism patterns across many species within the same genus have not been performed in plants (but see Straub et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>This study utilizes high throughput technology to survey many species and individuals in the angiosperm genus Asclepias (Apocynaceae) in order to characterize levels of intragenomic nrDNA polymorphism and place these within a phylogenetic context. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The methods presented here are expanded from those we have previously developed as part of the Milkweed Genome Project (Straub et al., 2011; Straub et al., 2012), and generalized for use with a large number of taxa and any high-copy locus, such as those that may be obtained from a genome-skimming or Hyb-Seq study (Straub et al., 2012; Weitemier et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>As previously cautioned, it cannot be assumed that all copies of nrDNA are identical within a genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>This is especially true for the spacer regions, but also for the subunit regions (Álvarez &amp; Wendel, 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>The discovery of phylogenetic signal in intragenomic polymorphism abundance demonstrates that those positions likely to lead to ambiguities are not distributed evenly across the phylogeny (Fig. 4). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>This is especially true for early generation hybrids, as nrDNA homogenization can occur in a small number of generations (Kovarik et al., 2005), and mosaic Saccharomyces genomes have been identified based on intragenomic polymorphism abundance (West et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Neither of the polymorphism profiles for the two wild-collected putative hybrid individuals in this study strongly indicate that they are early generation hybrids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>This is in contrast to evidence from nuclear gene sequences that show heterozygosity consistent with inheritance of divergent alleles from the putative parents in the A. albicans × A. subulata hybrid (B Haack and M Fishbein, 2013, unpublished data). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Nuclear ribosomal DNA copies within individuals of Asclepias are not identical, with intragenomic polymorphisms present at a higher rate than reported for other organisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Polymorphism frequencies across the genus vary by more than an order of magnitude and demonstrate strong phylogenetic signal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Stem positions of ribosomal subunits are more likely to be polymorphic than loop positions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Distribution of polymorphic sites across the nrDNA cistron are consistent with strong selection on nrDNA subunits, with polymorphic sites being more frequent in the spacer regions, and this difference being amplified for sites that are highly polymorphic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>These results reinforce the need for caution when using nrDNA for phylogenetic inference, especially when using the spacer regions or for applications requiring the precise estimates of branch lengths or divergence times. </plain></SENT>
