</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Morquio A syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis [MPS] IVA, OMIM #253000) is a lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (GALNS) due to a mutation in the GALNS gene located on chromosome 16q24.3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This deficiency results in accumulation of the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) chondroitin-6-sulfate and keratan sulfate (KS) in a variety of tissues [Neufeld and Muenzer, 2001]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The disease is extremely rare, with incidence rates ranging from 1 in 640,000 live births in Western Australia to 1 in 76,000 live births in Northern Ireland [Nelson, 1997; Nelson et al., 2003]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Infants with Morquio A syndrome usually appear normal at birth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, due to the accumulation of storage material in tissues and organs, leading to cellular dysfunction, they progressively develop profound skeletal and joint abnormalities and an array of non-skeletal manifestations including respiratory disease, spinal cord compression, cardiac disease, impaired vision, hearing loss, dental problems, and to a lesser extent hepatomegaly [Montaño et al., 2007; Harmatz et al., 2013; Hendriksz et al., 2013a]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Morquio A can be distinguished from other types of MPS disorders by the typical short-trunk dwarfism with short neck (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The skeletal manifestations are generally more extensive and severe than in other types of MPS disorders. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Hypermobility of joints is very characteristic for Morquio A syndrome and distinguishes this disease from other types of MPS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In contrast to most other types of MPS disorders, Morquio A syndrome has not been associated with cognitive impairment [Davison et al., 2013]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The most common gene mutation is present in &lt;9% of the Morquio patients, giving rise to a wide heterogeneity with regard to clinical presentation, severity of disease, and rate of progression [Tomatsu et al., 2011]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Whereas most patients present with the classical phenotype, associated with short stature and severe skeletal and joint abnormalities, some patients do not have this characteristic appearance but may show severe impairment in other domains such as cardiorespiratory disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The specific disease manifestations depend grossly on the residual GALNS activity and the accumulation rate and location of storage material in tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Studies have shown similar clinical manifestations in siblings with Morquio A syndrome, providing some evidence for genotype-phenotype associations [Tylki-Szymańska et al., 1998; Rekka et al., 2012]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The accumulation of GAGs throughout the body ultimately leads to premature death in most instances, with a life expectancy ranging from 10 to 20 years of age to almost normal in some patients [Tomatsu et al., 2011]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Because of the heterogeneous and progressive nature of the disease, the management of patients with Morquio A syndrome is challenging and requires a multidisciplinary approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>However, due to the rarity of the disease, most clinicians are not familiar with the special needs of these patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we developed international guidelines for the management and treatment of Morquio A syndrome based on the outcome of two expert meetings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>On August 2–3, 2013, an international panel of 26 specialists in pediatrics, genetics, orthopedics, pulmonology, cardiology, and anesthetics with experience in Morquio A gathered in Amsterdam for an expert meeting sponsored by BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>During this meeting, existing literature and clinical data on different aspects of Morquio A syndrome were reviewed and discussed and preliminary management and treatment guidelines were prepared. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>These were discussed in more detail by a consensus panel of nine experts during a second meeting in Barcelona on September 1, 2013. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Multiple observations in Morquio A resulted in the determination that patients cannot be classified into different subgroups based on clinical presentation, severity of disease, and/or rate of progression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>These included the observed genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity, the limited data on natural history and pathophysiology of the disease and the observation that patients may show severe disease in one domain, but not in another (e.g., severe respiratory disease, but normal height). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Because patients cannot be classified into different subgroups, management differs depending on the clinical manifestations of the patient. </plain></SENT>

</text></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ajmg0167-0011-f2"/></fig></SecTag><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Obtaining a diagnosis of Morquio A remains a challenge due to the rarity of the disease and similarities with other LSDs and skeletal dysplasias. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Specifically, patients that have been diagnosed with, or are undergoing evaluation for spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, pseudoachondroplasia, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia or bilateral Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease should have Morquio A excluded because of the similarities between these diseases and Morquio A, unless there is a family history of any of these diseases [Mendelsohn et al., 2013; Lachman et al., 2014]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Also, diagnosis of Morquio A syndrome may be delayed in patients that do not exhibit the classical initial signs of the disease such as kyphosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>For example, patients with a more attenuated disease course may first present with atypical signs such as hip stiffness and pain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, screening tests for Morquio A disease are subject to false negative results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Total urinary GAG may not be elevated in Morquio A patients, especially as patients grow older, because KS levels decrease naturally with age and can reach levels consistent with the upper range reported in unaffected individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Moreover, as not all Morquio A patients have elevated KS levels and as KS may also be elevated in other disorders, KS measurements should not be used as a diagnostic tool for Morquio A syndrome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is optional to perform an enzyme activity assay in DBS in addition to urinary GAG measurement in patients suspected of having the disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Noteworthy, the outcome of enzyme activity testing in DBS depends on the stability of the enzyme and the storage conditions of the sample [Camelier et al., 2011]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Based on these considerations, it is recommended to proceed to enzyme activity testing in leukocytes or fibroblasts not only when screening is positive or doubtful, but even when it is negative and the clinical-radiological data are suggestive of Morquio A. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>In fact, if there is strong clinical suspicion, an enzyme activity test could be performed immediately, without prior urinary GAG or DBS screening. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>When enzyme activity analysis in fibroblasts or leukocytes is inconclusive, the test should be repeated and/or genetic analysis should be performed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>In these cases with inconclusive enzyme results, identification of two known pathogenic mutations on separate alleles is required for definitive diagnosis [Wood et al., 2013]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Activity testing of other lysosomal enzymes (including β-galactosidase and another sulfatase) in conjunction with GALNS is recommended to rule out the presence of MPS IVB and other enzyme deficiencies which could have GALNS secondary deficiency, such as mucolipidosis II, III, MPS VI, and multiple sulfatase deficiency [Wood et al., 2013]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Obtaining a correct diagnosis is essential given the current availability of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for Morquio A syndrome (see below). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Until recently, treatment of Morquio A syndrome was limited to supportive, symptomatic care, including symptom-based medications, physical therapy, surgery, and rehabilitation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>However, in light of the pathophysiology of the disease, with a deficiency in a single enzyme giving rise to an array of clinical manifestations, a therapy that restores or replaces the deficient enzyme is desirable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Current experience with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), which has shown to be valuable in MPS IH (Hurler syndrome), is very limited and not encouraging for patients with Morquio A syndrome [Tomatsu et al., 2011; Algahim and Almassi, 2013]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>More data are required to provide evidence of its efficacy in these patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>ERT with recombinant human GALNS (elosulfase alfa) has recently been approved for Morquio A syndrome, providing a systemic treatment approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Elosulfase alfa has shown to be effective with a favorable safety profile. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>A multicenter, phase 1/2, open-label, dose-escalation study including 20 Morquio A patients aged 5–18 years showed sustained improvements in endurance, as measured using a 6-min walk test (6MWT) and a 3-min stair climb test (3MSCT), and respiratory function using elosulfase alfa 1.0 mg/kg/week and 2.0 mg/kg/week, which persisted after approximately 2 years of treatment [Hendriksz et al., 2012]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Urinary KS also decreased with treatment, with the largest decreases observed when dosing at 2.0 mg/kg/week. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Based on the outcome of the phase 1/2 study, a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study was performed to assess the efficacy and safety of infusions with elosulfase alfa 2.0 mg/kg every week and every other week (N = 176; aged ≥ 5 years) [Hendriksz et al., 2014a]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>The study showed significant improvement in endurance of 22.5 m in 6MWT distance during 24 weeks of treatment with elosulfase alfa at 2.0 mg/kg/week as compared with placebo (P = 0.0174). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>No significant impact was observed with the every other week dosing regimen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>There was no significant effect of any of the dosing regimens on the number of stairs climbed in a 3MSCT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Both dosing regimens led to rapid and sustained reductions in urinary KS, with the greatest effect seen with the weekly dosing regimen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>The study also showed numerical improvements over placebo after 24 weeks of treatment with elosulfase alfa 2.0 mg/kg/week for most exploratory endpoints, including maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV; P = 0.094) and forced vital capacity (FVC; P = 0.304). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>A composite measure developed by Delphi strategy based on an equal weighting of the change from baseline to week 24 of the z-scores of three component measures, i.e., 6MWT, 3MSCT, and MVV, also showed improvement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Both doses of elosulfase alfa had favorable safety profiles, generally similar to that of other ERTs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Most adverse events were mild or moderate infusion-associated reactions (IARs, occurring after infusion onset and within 1 day after infusion end) such as vomiting and pyrexia (fever), which were generally manageable with symptomatic treatment and/or infusion rate modification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>The frequency of IARs was higher during the first 12 weeks of treatment and tended to occur less frequently with time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>As anaphylactic reactions may occur during infusion, patients should be closely observed during and after administration of elosulfase alfa. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Elosulfase alfa treatment should be implemented as soon as the diagnosis of Morquio A syndrome has been confirmed to replace the deficient GALNs enzyme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>The recommended dose of elosulfase alfa is 2.0 mg/kg/week, administered intravenously over approximately 4 hr. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>The calculated dose should be diluted with saline to a total volume of 100 mL (patients weighing &lt;25 kg) or 250 mL (patients weighing ≥25 kg) at room temperature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Details of reconstitution may be found in the package insert. Supplementary Appendix 1 provides instructions for the infusion of elosulfase alfa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Elosulfase alfa should not be mixed with other infusions aside from saline as compatibility with other products has not been evaluated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Patients should be pre-treated approximately 30–60 min before each drug infusion with an antihistamine with or without antipyretics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Patients with known risk factors for IARs may be pre-treated with additional agents, such as H2 blockers, montelukast sodium, or corticosteroids. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>The diverse spectrum of disease manifestations of Morquio A warrants a multi-disciplinary management approach, involving an array of specialists coordinated by a physician experienced in working with patients with LSDs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>The role of this coordinating physician, usually a pediatrician, metabolic physician, or clinical geneticist, is to continuously monitor the evolution of disease, to refer to a specialist as needed, to assist in coordinating the care/recommendations from the multidisciplinary team, and to serve as a medical home for the patient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>In addition, this coordinating physician needs to regularly educate other health professionals (other specialists, dentists, and physiotherapists) about the disease and discuss the risks and benefits of interventions and necessary precautions with treatments/evaluations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>The coordinating physician should provide guidance to the patient and family and encourage correct follow-up of therapies [Martins et al., 2009]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>In order to stimulate continuity of care, it is also important that patients and families are educated about the disease and its possible complications and risks. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>It is important that the coordinating physician of Morquio A patients organizes an experienced multidisciplinary team of specialists, concentrating all experience in a limited number of physicians per subspecialty. </plain></SENT>
