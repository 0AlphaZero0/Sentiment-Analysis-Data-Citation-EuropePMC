Here, we isolated a R3-MYB gene <italic>GhCPC</italic>, identified by cDNA microarray analysis. The only conserved R3 motif and different expression between TM-1 and fuzzless-lintless mutants suggested that it might be a negative regulator in fiber development.

These results suggested that <italic>GhHOX3</italic> (<italic>GL2</italic>) might be downstream gene of the regulatory complex. Also, overexpression of <italic>GhCPC</italic> in tobacco led to differential loss of pigmentation. Taken together, the results suggested that <italic>GhCPC</italic> might negatively regulate cotton fiber initiation and early elongation by a potential CPC-MYC1-TTG1/4 complex.

Only some cells are committed to form trichomes. The specificity of development and differentiation of the trichome cell makes it a perfect model to study the regulation of cell development and cell fate determination. Trichome development and root epidermal patterning have been studied in depth in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. In Arabidopsis, the R2R3-MYB protein GLABRA1 (GL1) [<xref rid="pone.0116272.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], the basic helix&#8211;loop&#8211;helix proteins GLABRA3 (GL3) or ENHANCER OF GLABRA3 (EGL3) [<xref rid="pone.0116272.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116272.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and the WD40 protein TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1 (TTG1) [<xref rid="pone.0116272.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] form a combinatorial regulatory complex MYB-bHLH-TTG1 to positively regulate trichome patterning. Furthermore, this complex regulates the downstream gene <italic>GL2</italic>, encoding a homeodomain (HD-Zip) protein required for normal trichome development [<xref rid="pone.0116272.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In Arabidopsis, four homologous single MYB proteins, CAPRICE (CPC) [<xref rid="pone.0116272.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], TRIPTYCHON (TRY) [<xref rid="pone.0116272.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and ENHANCER OF TRY and CPC1 and 2 (ETC1 and ETC2) [<xref rid="pone.0116272.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116272.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] have been identified as negative regulators of trichome initiation and patterning. These inhibitory proteins contain a DNA binding domain but no transcriptional activation domain. Protein interaction analysis in yeast has suggested that TRY or CPC can interrupt the functionality of the &#8220;activating&#8221; GL1-bHLH-TTG1 complex through competitive interaction with bHLH [<xref rid="pone.0116272.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116272.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116272.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Therefore, these factors may work as negative transcriptional regulators [<xref rid="pone.0116272.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Fortunately, the development of cotton fibers and Arabidopsis trichomes share a similar regulatory mechanism involving closely related transcription factors as well as a similar lateral inhibition signaling pathway [<xref rid="pone.0116272.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], making these trichomes an excellent system for cotton fiber research.</p><p>Cotton (<italic>Gossypium spp.</italic>) fiber cells are seed trichomes derived from the epidermal layer of the cotton seed coat. The molecular components responsible for regulating fiber cell differentiation have not been fully characterized [<xref rid="pone.0116272.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In cotton, transcription factors also play an important role in regulating fiber elongation. Overexpression of <italic>GaMYB2</italic>, which is homologous to <italic>AtGL1</italic>, rescues trichome formation in the gl1 mutant and induces the production of seed trichomes in Arabidopsis [<xref rid="pone.0116272.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, constitutive overexpression of <italic>GhMYB25</italic> in transgenic tobacco results in an increase in branched long-stalked leaf trichomes [<xref rid="pone.0116272.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Correspondingly, <italic>GhMYB25</italic>-silenced cotton exhibits alterations in the timing of rapid fiber elongation, resulting in short fibers, dramatic reductions in trichomes on other parts of the plant and reductions in seed production [<xref rid="pone.0116272.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], while suppression of <italic>GhMYB25</italic>-like results in cotton plants with fiberless seeds [<xref rid="pone.0116272.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. An HD-Zip IV family transcription factor, <italic>G. barbadense</italic> Meristem Layer 1 (GbML1), interacts with <italic>GhMYB25</italic> and specifically binds to the L1 box of <italic>GbRDL1</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0116272.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. <italic>GbPDF1</italic> is involved in cotton fiber initiation through interacting with three proteins (PPIP1&#8211;PPIP3) [<xref rid="pone.0116272.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, it appears that these transcription factors may require companion proteins to work with.</p><p>Here, we isolated <italic>GhCPC</italic> from <italic>Gossypium</italic> TM-1 0DPA ovules, which is homologous to <italic>AtCPC</italic> and encodes a negative regulator of cotton fiber elongation. Our work aimed to identity whether <italic>GhCPC</italic> could interact with other proteins to form a MYB-bHLH-WD40 complex that regulates fiber elongation. Our results showed that <italic>GhCPC</italic> could interact with a bHLH gene, <italic>GhMYC1</italic>, while <italic>GhMYC1</italic> also interacts with <italic>GhTTG1</italic> and <italic>GhTTG4</italic>. In 35S::CPC transgenic lines, the levels of transcripts of the downstream genes <italic>GhHOX3</italic> and <italic>GhRDL1</italic> were significantly reduced. Using the yeast one-hybrid system, we found that <italic>GhMYC1</italic> could bind the promoter of <italic>GhHOX3</italic>.

Analysis of the bHLH domain of <italic>GhMYC1</italic> and the promoter of <italic>GhHOX3</italic> has shown that this conserved domain could recognize and bind to the E-box <italic>cis</italic>-element. Our yeast one-hybrid data confirmed this speculation.</p><fig id="pone.0116272.g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0116272.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>The potential CPC-MYC1-TTG1 regulatory complex in cotton.</title><p>In this network, CPC-MYC1-TTG4 complex can regulate the expression levels of <italic>GhHOX3</italic> and <italic>GhRDL1</italic> by binding to their promoters. <italic>GhCPC</italic> and <italic>GaMYB2</italic> may have opposite effects on fiber development by completely binding to <italic>GhMYC1</italic>.

In light of the existence of the CPC-MYC1-TTG4 complex, <italic>GhCPC</italic> may have a similar function in regulating the production of anthocyanin. To further investigate the role of <italic>GhCPC</italic> and how conserved this role is across plant species, 35S::CPC was constitutively over expressed in tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic>). In the transgenic lines, alterations in petal color also led to a differential loss of pigmentation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0116272.s007">S7 Fig.</xref>). The results also indicate that <italic>GhCPC</italic> is involved in regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis, also possibly via the MYB-bHLH-WD40 complex. Further direct evidence of the function of this complex in regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis should be obtained in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec004c"><title>Differences in the trichome/fiber regulatory mechanism between cotton and Arabidopsis</title><p>Elucidating the regulatory pathway of <italic>GhCPC</italic> opens up new avenues for understanding the existence and importance of the CPC-MYC1-TTG1/4 complex in regulating fiber elongation and raises many questions about this regulatory network. Although they are both unicellular epidermal hairs, cotton fibers are distinct from Arabidopsis trichomes, while cotton fibers are produced in the seed and are unbranched and extremely elongated [<xref rid="pone.0116272.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In this study, we also found that the regulatory system of cotton is not entirely identical to that of Arabidopsis. <italic>GhCPC</italic> overexpression produces seeds with shorter fibers in cotton, but no significant changes were found in leaf or stem trichomes, besides changes in the fibers of transgenic cotton and fiberless mutants (XZ142 FLM and MD17 FLM). We also found that there was no tissue-specific expression pattern for <italic>GhCPC</italic>. The silenced <italic>GhMYB25-like</italic> transcripts cotton produced fiberless seeds, but normal trichomes elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0116272.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], whereas <italic>GhHD-1</italic> silenced cottons were almost completely glabrous (hairless) and showed a delay but later normal seed fiber initiation [<xref rid="pone.0116272.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesize that the development of cotton fibers and leaf (or stem) trichomes is regulated by a similar model, but some genes suited for cotton fibers but not for leaf (or stem) trichomes. Here, we expounded the potential mechanism of <italic>GhCPC</italic> in regulating fiber development, although the findings of this study are similar to the Arabidopsis model, but the development of cotton fibers is much more complex than that of Arabidopsis trichomes. Compared to the complex and enormous regulatory network, short of enough evidences blocked the confirmation of the complex in fiber development. Elucidating the differences between these systems may further explain the specificity of the molecular regulatory mechanism of plant trichome development.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec005"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0116272.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Sequence alignment of <italic>GhCPC</italic> homologous genes.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0116272.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0116272.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Conserved CPC domain in different species.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0116272.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0116272.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>No difference in the fiber lengths between antisense transgenic lines and wild type.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0116272.s003.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0116272.s004"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><title>Trichome phenotypes of leaves and stems of <italic>CPC</italic> overexpression transgenic cotton and wild type.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0116272.s004.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0116272.s005"><label>S5 Fig</label><caption><title>Nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of full-length <italic>GhMYC1</italic> cDNA.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0116272.s005.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0116272.s006"><label>S6 Fig</label><caption><title>Protein sequence alignment of <italic>GhMYC1, GhDEL61</italic> and <italic>GhDEL65</italic>.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0116272.s006.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0116272.s007"><label>S7 Fig</label><caption><title>Clear phenotypic change in petal pigmentation in CPC overexpression T0 lines.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0116272.s007.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0116272.s008"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Oligonucleotides used in this study.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0116272.s008.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Prof. Dr. Wangzhen Guo for his support and comments during the preparation of this manuscript.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0116272.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
