</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Trichomes are epidermal hairs found in most land plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Only some cells are committed to form trichomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The specificity of development and differentiation of the trichome cell makes it a perfect model to study the regulation of cell development and cell fate determination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Trichome development and root epidermal patterning have been studied in depth in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In Arabidopsis, the R2R3-MYB protein GLABRA1 (GL1) [1], the basic helix–loop–helix proteins GLABRA3 (GL3) or ENHANCER OF GLABRA3 (EGL3) [2, 3] and the WD40 protein TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1 (TTG1) [4] form a combinatorial regulatory complex MYB-bHLH-TTG1 to positively regulate trichome patterning. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this complex regulates the downstream gene GL2, encoding a homeodomain (HD-Zip) protein required for normal trichome development [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In Arabidopsis, four homologous single MYB proteins, CAPRICE (CPC) [6], TRIPTYCHON (TRY) [7] and ENHANCER OF TRY and CPC1 and 2 (ETC1 and ETC2) [8, 9] have been identified as negative regulators of trichome initiation and patterning. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>These inhibitory proteins contain a DNA binding domain but no transcriptional activation domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Protein interaction analysis in yeast has suggested that TRY or CPC can interrupt the functionality of the “activating” GL1-bHLH-TTG1 complex through competitive interaction with bHLH [3, 7, 10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these factors may work as negative transcriptional regulators [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Fortunately, the development of cotton fibers and Arabidopsis trichomes share a similar regulatory mechanism involving closely related transcription factors as well as a similar lateral inhibition signaling pathway [12], making these trichomes an excellent system for cotton fiber research. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Cotton (Gossypium spp.) fiber cells are seed trichomes derived from the epidermal layer of the cotton seed coat. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The molecular components responsible for regulating fiber cell differentiation have not been fully characterized [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In cotton, transcription factors also play an important role in regulating fiber elongation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of GaMYB2, which is homologous to AtGL1, rescues trichome formation in the gl1 mutant and induces the production of seed trichomes in Arabidopsis [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Moreover, constitutive overexpression of GhMYB25 in transgenic tobacco results in an increase in branched long-stalked leaf trichomes [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, GhMYB25-silenced cotton exhibits alterations in the timing of rapid fiber elongation, resulting in short fibers, dramatic reductions in trichomes on other parts of the plant and reductions in seed production [16], while suppression of GhMYB25-like results in cotton plants with fiberless seeds [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>An HD-Zip IV family transcription factor, G. barbadense Meristem Layer 1 (GbML1), interacts with GhMYB25 and specifically binds to the L1 box of GbRDL1 [18]. GbPDF1 is involved in cotton fiber initiation through interacting with three proteins (PPIP1–PPIP3) [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it appears that these transcription factors may require companion proteins to work with. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Here, we isolated GhCPC from Gossypium TM-1 0DPA ovules, which is homologous to AtCPC and encodes a negative regulator of cotton fiber elongation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Our work aimed to identity whether GhCPC could interact with other proteins to form a MYB-bHLH-WD40 complex that regulates fiber elongation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that GhCPC could interact with a bHLH gene, GhMYC1, while GhMYC1 also interacts with GhTTG1 and GhTTG4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>In 35S::CPC transgenic lines, the levels of transcripts of the downstream genes GhHOX3 and GhRDL1 were significantly reduced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Using the yeast one-hybrid system, we found that GhMYC1 could bind the promoter of GhHOX3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that cotton fiber elongation may be regulated by a similar regulatory complex to that of Arabidopsis trichome development. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>Since gel mobility shift experiments and yeast one-hybrid assays have previously shown that AtCPC does not bind to DNA [41], it is also unlikely that GhCPC represses GhHOX3 by directly binding to its cis-elements sites to repress gene transcription. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Elucidating the regulatory pathway of GhCPC opens up new avenues for understanding the existence and importance of the CPC-MYC1-TTG1/4 complex in regulating fiber elongation and raises many questions about this regulatory network. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Although they are both unicellular epidermal hairs, cotton fibers are distinct from Arabidopsis trichomes, while cotton fibers are produced in the seed and are unbranched and extremely elongated [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>In this study, we also found that the regulatory system of cotton is not entirely identical to that of Arabidopsis. GhCPC overexpression produces seeds with shorter fibers in cotton, but no significant changes were found in leaf or stem trichomes, besides changes in the fibers of transgenic cotton and fiberless mutants (XZ142 FLM and MD17 FLM). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>We also found that there was no tissue-specific expression pattern for GhCPC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>The silenced GhMYB25-like transcripts cotton produced fiberless seeds, but normal trichomes elsewhere [17], whereas GhHD-1 silenced cottons were almost completely glabrous (hairless) and showed a delay but later normal seed fiber initiation [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we hypothesize that the development of cotton fibers and leaf (or stem) trichomes is regulated by a similar model, but some genes suited for cotton fibers but not for leaf (or stem) trichomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Here, we expounded the potential mechanism of GhCPC in regulating fiber development, although the findings of this study are similar to the Arabidopsis model, but the development of cotton fibers is much more complex than that of Arabidopsis trichomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Compared to the complex and enormous regulatory network, short of enough evidences blocked the confirmation of the complex in fiber development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Elucidating the differences between these systems may further explain the specificity of the molecular regulatory mechanism of plant trichome development. </plain></SENT>
