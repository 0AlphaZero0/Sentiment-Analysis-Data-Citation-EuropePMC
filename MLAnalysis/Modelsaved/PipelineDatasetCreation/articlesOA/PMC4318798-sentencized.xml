<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, the reasons that Ctp1(CtIP,Sae2) deficiencies alter biological responses remain unclear. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P3"><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>An early step in the onset of HR-mediated DSB repair is nucleolytic processing, which generates 3′ single strand DNA (ssDNA) tails to initiate strand invasion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Ctp1(CtIP,Sae2) is required for resection, although there may be differences between “clean” and “dirty” DSBs12–15. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Also, Ctp1(CtIP,Sae2) is required for removal of proteins attached to the 5′-end of DSBs16–18, including Topoisomerase 2 DNA–protein conjugates induced by anticancer drugs such as Etoposide18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with a reported Mg2+-dependent endonuclease activity of Sae2 (ref. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>24), which derives a consensus disorder prediction from an array of protein order prediction algorithms (Fig. 1a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Both approaches suggest that Ctp1 harbors a structurally ordered region at its N-terminus (Fig. 1a), but is otherwise comprised of expanded stretches of low complexity, commonly referred to as intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs)25. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>To validate in silico protein order predictions for Ctp1, we purified recombinant full-length S. pombe Ctp1 (Ctp1) (Fig. 1b) and mapped structured domains with limited trypsin proteolysis (Fig. 1c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Purified recombinant Ctp1 migrated aberrantly in SDS-PAGE (&gt; 38 kDa , predicted MW of 33.1 kDa) (Fig. 1b), a hallmark of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs)26. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Consistent with protein disorder predictions, Ctp1 was highly susceptible to limited proteolytic cleavage, but contains a trypsin-resilient N-terminal core domain (residues 9–57) (Fig. 1c). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P6"><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Analysis of Ctp1 molecular mass using size-exclusion chromatography with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) showed Ctp1 is predominantly tetrameric (SEC-MALS molecular mass = 129.1 kDa, Ctp1 monomer mass = 33.1 kDa) in solution (Fig. 1d, Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis revealed the Ctp1 tetramer is a highly elongated molecule with a maximum particle dimension (Dmax) of 260 Å (Fig. 1e, Supplementary Fig.1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>SAXS and SEC-MALS data are consistent with Ctp1 containing extended regions of low structural complexity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Similarly, circular dichroism (CD) measurements of Ctp1 exhibited low abundance of α or β secondary structure (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Table 1). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>In contrast, an amino-terminal fragment Ctp1–60 has ~89 % alpha-helical content by CD (Fig. 1f, Supplementary Table 1), consistent with predictions that the Ctp1 N-terminus contains coiled-coil structure5,22. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P7"><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Both Ctp11–60 and its maltose binding protein (MBP) fusion equivalent (MBP-Ctp11–60) are tetrameric, indicating that Ctp11–60 harbors minimal determinants of Ctp1 oligomerization (Fig. 1d, Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>However, despite having ~50 % larger MALS molecular mass than Ctp1 (Table 1), MBP-Ctp11–60 migrated as an apparently smaller species in SEC (Fig. 1d) and had a decreased SAXS maximum particle dimension (Dmax= 140 Å) as compared to Ctp1 (Dmax= 260 Å). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Here, splaying of the dimeric coiled-coil facilitates tetramerization by an array of hydrophobic side chains at the N-terminus of helix α1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Seven residues (W12, V15, Y16, L19, L22, L23 and Y26) form the core of the N-terminal tetrameric interface, burying ~2900 Å2 of solvent accessible surface area. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The four intertwined helices resemble two linked fishhooks with Trp12 and Tyr16 making up the “aromatic-hook”. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p id="P11"><text><SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>To test if the Ctp1 N-terminus is critical for Ctp1 tetramerization, we generated a deletion mutation (ΔN14, Ctp115–60), removing the first helical turn of α1 but retaining the Ctp1 dimeric coiled-coil region (residues 27–57). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Consistent with predictions from the X-ray structure, MBP-Ctp115–60 is dimeric (Fig. 1d, Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>By comparison, deletion of the N-terminal 60 residues of Ctp1 encompassing the THDD (Ctp161–294) yielded a monomeric protein (Supplementary Fig. 4a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>SAXS analysis of MBP-Ctp115–60 further affirmed observations from SEC-MALS, demonstrating the decreased size of MBP-Ctp115–60 (Dmax= 115 Å), compared to MBP-Ctp11–60 (Dmax= 140 Å). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>To validate roles for the aromatic-hook in mediating Ctp1 oligomerization, we generated a triple mutant (H11A W12A Y16A) that disrupts key inter-subunit tetramer contacts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Ctp1 (H11A W12A Y16A) also exhibited defective oligomerization (Supplementary Fig. 4b). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Ctp1 favored binding to DNA forks and exhibited a preference for branched DNAs containing dsDNA-ssDNA junctions over dsDNA or ssDNA alone (Supplementary Fig. 5a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>In addition to a preference for DNA secondary structures, Ctp1 displayed a preference for DNA length. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed weak sub-micromolar DNA binding by the isolated THDD (Ctp11–60), suggesting this region of Ctp1 contributes to Ctp1–DNA binding (Fig. 3d). </plain></SENT>
