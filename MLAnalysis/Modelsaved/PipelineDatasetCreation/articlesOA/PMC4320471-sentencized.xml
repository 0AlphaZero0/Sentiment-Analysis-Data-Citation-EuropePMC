</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Ovarian carcinoma is the sixth leading malignancy diagnosed in women and fourth leading cause of cancer mortality in Silesia, a southern province of Poland [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Poland belongs to the countries with high morbidity rates for ovarian carcinoma - epidemiologic data show steady rise of ovarian carcinoma incidence [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Mortality rates differ for different continents and geographic regions, countries, races and ethnic groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Malignancies of the ovary are diagnosed frequently in advanced stage in postmenopausal women, contributing to a relatively high mortality and little progress in improving survival rates within the past few decades [3,4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>These facts emphasize the necessity of developing better methods of treatment, diagnosis and prevention. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Unfavorable statistics in ovarian cancer patients reflects in part poor understanding of molecular pathogenesis and progression of the disease [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The strongest risk factor of developing ovarian cancer is the family history of breast and ovarian cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>About 15% of ovarian cancer patients in Polish population carry germline mutation in BRCA1/2 genes [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>A small number of patients with inherited predisposition to ovarian carcinoma is also connected with Lynch syndrome and germline mutations in mismatch repair genes, such as hMLH1, hMSH2, hMSH6, PMS1 and PMS2 [7,8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>However, the common genetic polymorphisms can also influence the risk of developing ovarian carcinoma. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In this study we wanted to evaluate the effects of polymorphic variants of the genes connected with progesterone activity, cell cycle control, and transport systems on ovarian cancer risk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Besides frequent occurrence of germline mutations in BRCA1/2 genes, ovarian carcinoma is sometimes accompanied by breast carcinoma, so we divided the group of ovarian cancer patients under study into four groups: all patients, patients without BRCA1 mutation, patients with germline mutation in BRCA1 gene and patients who developed both breast and ovarian carcinoma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The aim was to find out whether there were differences in cancer risk among these groups. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>This analysis was done for the group of sporadic ovarian cancer patients (BRCA1-) to avoid the strong influence of mutated BRCA1 gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>The polymorphisms, which in univariate analysis were modulating ovarian cancer risk, were included in the groups of risk reductors (favorable genotypes) or risk enhancers (unfavorable genotypes). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>After stepwise regression analyses, two (p.Arg72Pro in TP53 and p.Arg952Lys in ATP7B gene) and three (p.Ile1145 = in ABCB1, p.Asp1853Asn in ATM and p.Ser406Ala in ATP7B gene) polymorphisms remained in the respective models for each group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>The results of analyzing favorable genotypes showed strong significant reduction of ovarian cancer risk in the presence of both variants (OR 0.50; 95% CI 0.30-0.83; p = 0.008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>In the analysis of cumulative unfavorable effects we found that ovarian cancer risk progresses in the presence of chosen SNPs, resulting in the highest risk for carriers of all three polymorphisms (OR 7.47; 95% CI 2.08-26.85; p = 0.002) (Table 3).Table 3 Cumulative effect of favorable and unfavorable genotypes on ovarian cancer risk Statistically significant analyses are in bold. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>The top SNPs related to cancer risk were subjected to survival analysis for the group of ovarian cancer patients treated with paclitaxel and cisplatin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>In the univariate analysis two polymorphisms tended to influence overall survival. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Heterozygotes for p.Arg72Pro in the TP53 gene appeared to have better survival and lower risk of death, when compared to major homozygotes (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>An opposite effect was noted for PGR p.Val660Leu variant, for which minor homozygotes appeared to cause shorter overall survival and higher risk of death (Figure 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>However, none of these polymorphisms was a significant prognostic factor after adjustment to FIGO and tumor histotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>As for the progression-free survival, multivariate model adjusted to FIGO and ovarian cancer histotype, we identified two variants as independent factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Higher risk of disease progression was associated with presence of genotypes lacking a major p.Ser893Ala/Trp polymorphism (HR 2.14; 95% CI 1.07-4.28; p = 0.031) in the G allele of ABCB1 and with the presence of major homozygote GG of p.Asp1853Asn in the ATM gene (HR 2.32; 95% CI 1.06-5.10; p = 0.036) (Table 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>For these high-risk genotypes we performed the analysis of cumulative progression risk in order to calculate the gene dosage effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>The results had shown significant shortening of PFS (Figure 1C) for the carriers of one and both mentioned variants; also, the accumulation of both risk factors was responsible for higher risk of ovarian cancer progression in comparison with persons who did not carry any of the unfavorable genotypes (HR 3.81; 95% CI 1.38-10.51; p = 0.010).Figure 1 Survival analysis of ovarian cancer-related SNPs.

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>The influence of low-penetrance common genetic variants selected for this study on ovarian cancer risk and survival was not extensively studied yet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Here, in a case–control study we analyzed 12 polymorphic variants and two deletions in nine genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>The case group reflected consecutive cancer cases which included patients with germline mutation in BRCA genes and persons who also developed breast cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Both groups under study belonged to Slavic ethnic group with specific founder mutations in BRCA1/2 genes [18,19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Multicenter analyses [20-22] including our own results are done on much larger groups but they often show inconsistent results for the different populations included in the study and in our analysis we wanted to avoid this problem even though the population under study was smaller. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>The protein product of progesterone receptor gene (PGR) participates in the regulation of epithelial cell proliferation and thus plays an important role in ovarian carcinogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Its expression levels vary several fold in different histological types of ovarian cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>We wanted to find out whether polymorphic variants of this gene could modulate the risk of ovarian cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Previous studies had shown that polymorphic variants of PGR were connected with significant increase of ovarian cancer risk (overall [23,24], or limited only to the endometrioid histotype [20]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>We chose 2 SNPs (p.Val660Leu and rs474320) from PROGINS allele and one in the promoter region of this gene (rs10895068). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>In our analysis none of them significantly altered the ovarian cancer risk in the groups under study, except for the BRCA1+ group where, for heterozygotes for p.Val660Leu polymorphism, a significant increase of cancer risk was found. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>This result indicates that p.Val660Leu effect is specific only for carriers of germline mutations in BRCA genes, and this finds support in the actual differences between ER and PGR gene expression in sporadic and hereditary breast cancers, the origin of which has not been elucidated yet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Ovarian cancer is also a hormone-dependent malignancy, so the role of PGR gene in BRCA1+ and BRCA1- ovarian cancers can be different as well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>There is also the possibility that the PROGINS variant is co-inherited with the BRCA1 mutant haplotype [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Similar results were also obtained for the rare heterozygotes TA of p.Ser893Ala/Trp polymorphism in ABCB1 gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>They had a 5-fold higher risk of developing ovarian cancer when compared to the reference homozygotes. ABCB1 gene product transports a wide range of substrates and it confers resistance to a vast array of clinically and toxicologically relevant compounds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>The altered function of ABCB1 gene product among carriers of rare allele seems to alter the efflux of potentially cancerogenic xenobiotics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Such modification could increase the risk of developing cancer, especially in the group of persons affected by germline mutation in BRCA1 gene, which affects the DNA repair. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Similar associations between the common genetic variants (SNPs) and high-penetrance germline mutations, which additionally modify the risk of developing ovarian cancer, were also found in genome-wide association studies carried out on large cohorts [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>The authors did not exclude the existence of other modifying risk variants of other genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Earlier, similar associations with other genes were also found in breast cancer patients also carrying germline mutations in BRCA1/2 genes [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>However, analyses done on small groups brought conflicting results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Jakubowska et al. found no significant association between the PGR gene polymorphisms and the ovarian cancer risk in the group of 146 ovarian cancer patients carrying germline mutation in BRCA1 gene [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Also, in heterozygotes for ABCG2 polymorphism p.Gln141Lys we found a trend towards decreased risk of ovarian cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Similar effects, or no effects at all, were found in other analyses performed for different types of cancer [29,30]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>In our analysis a significant increase of cancer risk was observed for ATM p.Asp1853Asn heterozygotes which corroborates the finding that missense polypeptides will compete with normal ATM polypeptides in complex formation, and that the functionally abnormal missense polypeptide will sequester key regulators or substrates into nonfunctional complexes, resulting in dominant negative cellular phenotype [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Opposite results were found for TP53 p.Arg72Pro variant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>In heterozygotes, we observed a protective effect against tumorigenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>This means that a lesser number of heterozygotes developed ovarian cancer; moreover, if they were diagnosed with malignancy, their overall survival was better than that of homozygotes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Both effects in ATM and TP53 genes were found only in the total group of patients and the patients without germline mutation in BRCA1 gene, but not in the BRCA1+ group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Similar results were also observed by others for breast cancer patients carrying germline mutation in BRCA1 [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>It can be concluded that variants under study modify sporadic cancer risk and have no effect on familial ovarian cancer [25,33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>The Arg72 variant exists only in humans and is more efficient in inducing apoptosis and suppressing transformation than the Pro72 allele, which can explain the protective effect found in our analysis [34]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>The protective effect of the haplotype GSTT1wt/GSTM1null was observed for all patients and for the sporadic ovarian carcinoma group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>The significant effect for the third glutathione transferase under study, GSTP1, was noted only in the familial ovarian cancer group where the carriers of minor GG homozygote were at higher risk of developing cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Other researchers did not find any correlations between GSTT1, GSTM1 alone or haplotypes and ovarian cancer risk [35-38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>We observed also the deviation from HWE equilibrium in the control group for the GSTP1 gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>This effect was observed in this analysis only, so we hypothesize that it is not connected with genotyping errors, population stratification or some other artifacts but rather with the particular gene under study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>HWE deviations could arise through important biological mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>In particular, genetic variants having a recessive effect on the successful fertilization and/or development of an embryo might be manifested through such deviations in an unselected sample of “control” subjects [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Similar deviation from HWE for GSTP1 was also noted by others [40].]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Glutathione and its transpherases may regulate the ability of each individual to metabolize environmental carcinogens, which is noticed especially well in smoking-related tumors [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Our results show that the genetic variants in glutathione transpherases genes are also able to modify the risk of other cancers which are indirectly related to tobacco use. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Breast and ovarian cancer group shows different behavior from the two groups described earlier. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>The presence of multiple tumors in one patient is associated with a higher likelihood of genetic susceptibility [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>In our study, the only significant associations with ATM p.Asp1853Asn and ATP7B p.Arg952Lys variants indicated the importance of cell cycle and cellular copper metabolism control systems in the cancer-prone phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>However, more than one primary malignancy occurs rarely, so our group under study was small and the results of statistical analyses should be taken with caution. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>In this study we observed several strong gene-dosage effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>The combined impact of the studied SNPs on ovarian cancer risk shows that ovarian carcinoma can be treated as a polygenic disease partially dependent on the accumulation of unfavorable genetic factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>In our analysis, the unfavorable factors which increased ovarian cancer risk over seven times, prevailed over favorable factors which cut the ovarian cancer risk by half. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>We can conclude, that carrying unfavorable variants of low-penetrance polymorphisms can increase (OR 7.47 in our study) the ovarian cancer risk to the level similar to the effect of carrying germline mutation in a high-penetrance gene (OR 8.6 calculated for Canadian population [43]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>As for the survival analyses, it was evident that accumulation of relatively weak genetic variants (ABCB1 p.Ser893Ala/Trp and ATM p.Asp1853Asn) may significantly enhance the risk of progression after paclitaksel/cisplatin treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>The trinucleotide polymorphism in the ABCB1 gene is a widely studied variant linked to altered transporter activity, although the results reported by different authors are inconsistent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>It should be noted that in recent large study performed on over four thousand invasive ovarian cancer patients the p.Ser893Ala/Trp polymorphism had no impact on patients’ survival [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>The ATM variant is believed to be responsible for reduced ATM kinase activity and could be the reason for more efficient cisplatin-related apoptosis [31,44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>It could be also the reason why in our analyses the common homozygote of p.Asp1853Asn variant was connected with higher risk of disease progression in the multivariate model. </plain></SENT>
