Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a particularly severe form of lung fibrosis, is a chronic, progressive, and often fatal interstitial lung disease of unknown etiology with a mean survival of 2&#8211;3 yr from diagnosis (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">ATS/ERS, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Olson et al., 2007</xref>). The hallmark of IPF is the unremitting extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition with minimal associated inflammation (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Noble and Homer, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Wilson and Wynn, 2009</xref>). Although evidence suggests that lung fibrosis is an epithelial-mesenchymal disorder (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Selman and Pardo, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chapman, 2011</xref>), the mechanisms by which injured epithelium activates fibroblasts/myofibroblasts are unclear. Epithelial apoptosis pathways are activated in the lungs of patients with acute lung injury, in part by activation of signaling pathways such as Fas ligand&#8211;Fas and TGF-&#946; (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hagimoto et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, the injured alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) may also be abnormally activated with phenotypic changes (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">King et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kage and Borok, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). The signals required for this activation are unknown. A recent study suggests that injured kidney epithelial cells produce an increased number of TGF-&#946;&#8211;containing exosomes to activate fibroblasts (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Borges et al., 2013</xref>). We hypothesized that injured pulmonary epithelial cells may activate mesenchymal cells by releasing soluble factors to promote a fibrogenic microenvironment.</p><p>Both TGF-&#946; (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Sime et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Gauldie et al., 2007</xref>) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Costello et al., 2010</xref>) play a role in the initiation and progression of fibrosis. They regulate both epithelial cell injury and fibroblast proliferation and transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts at the injury site (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Leask and Abraham, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Selman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Goodwin and Jenkins, 2009</xref>). BMP4 antagonists have been implicated in fibrotic disorders of multiple organs including lung (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Dolan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Patella et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Costello et al., 2010</xref>). The precise mechanisms of TGF-&#946; superfamily members in regulating lung fibrogenesis in specific cell types are largely unclear.</p><p>Follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1), initially identified as a TGF-&#946;&#8211;inducible gene (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Shibanuma et al., 1993</xref>), encodes a small secreted glycoprotein belonging to a group of matricellular proteins. We recently reported that Fstl1 acts as a BMP4 antagonist to play a key role in lung development (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Geng et al., 2011</xref>). The role of FSTL1 in lung fibrosis has not been investigated. In this study, we have interrogated the role of FSTL1-regulated TGF-&#946;/BMP signaling in different cell types during lung injury and fibrosis. We report that FSTL1 mediates epithelial-mesenchymal communication at the cellular level. We found that FSTL1 modulated TGF-&#946; but not BMP signaling, leading to fibroblast activation. We provide evidence that targeting FSTL1 may offer a novel therapeutic approach for patients with progressive tissue fibrosis.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Aberrant expression of FSTL1 in lungs of IPF patients and bleomycin-injured mice</title><p>We first determined whether FSTL1 expression is aberrant in progressive lung fibrotic diseases.

In addition, we examined the expression of Fstl1 using the bleomycin model of lung injury and fibrosis (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Moeller et al., 2008</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 (D and E)</xref>, bleomycin-induced injury stimulated Fstl1 mRNA and protein expressions. We also observed considerably increased FSTL1 immunohistochemical staining in active fibrotic areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>).

Biological assays revealed that the 22B6 mAb blocked the ability of FSTL1 to induce the production of IL-6 in Cos7 cells (Fig. S1 F; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Miyamae et al., 2006</xref>), to antagonize BMP4-induced <italic>SFTPC</italic> expression in A549 cells (Fig. S1 G; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Geng et al., 2011</xref>), and to attenuate hypertrophic actions to phenylephrine (PE) treatment in cultured cardiac myocytes (Fig. S1, H and I; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Shimano et al., 2011</xref>).

Primary cultured lung fibroblasts were administrated with either antibody (22B6) or isotype control antibody (IgG1), followed by TGF-&#946;1 treatment.

Primary lung AECs in the upper chamber were pretreated with 22B6 mAb or anti&#8211;TGF-&#946;1 mAb, followed by TGF-&#946;1 or FSTL1 treatment, respectively. Then the upper chamber was inserted back into the lower plate of the transwell. The activation of fibroblasts cultured in the lower plate was measured after 24-h epithelial-mesenchymal co-culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 D</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 (E&#8211;G)</xref>, TGF-&#946;1&#8211;activated AECs promoted the activation of underlying fibroblasts, as determined by the increased mRNA levels of <italic>&#945;-SMA</italic>, <italic>type I collagen</italic> (<italic>Col1a1</italic>), and <italic>fibronectin</italic> (<italic>Fn1</italic>) in fibroblasts upon 24-h coincubation. FSTL1 increased TGF-&#946;1&#8211;induced AEC activation and subsequent fibroblast activation. As expected, anti&#8211;TGF-&#946;1 mAb blocked TGF-&#946;1 activity and inhibited subsequent fibroblast activation. Notably, 22B6 mAb had less effect on TGF-&#946;1 activity, but blocked FSTL1-promoted TGF-&#946;1 activity. In addition, transwell co-culture assay showed that 22B6 mAb blocked the antagonizing ability of FSTL1 on BMP4 during epithelial-mesenchymal communication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 H</xref>). Collectively, our data demonstrate that neutralizing FSTL1 with 22B6 mAb inhibits FSTL1-disrupted TGF-&#946;/BMP balance and moderates epithelial-mesenchymal communication.</p><p>To determine the therapeutic impact of the administration of FSTL1-neutralizing antibody on lung fibrosis in vivo, we initially treated C57BL/6J mice with 22B6 mAb from day 5 to day 11 after bleomycin injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 B</xref>, collagen content was significantly decreased in the mice treated with FSTL1-neutralizing antibody, compared with those treated with isotype-matched control antibody. Masson&#8217;s trichrome staining displayed a similar result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10, C and D</xref>). We next asked whether 22B6 mAb could prevent further progression of established fibrosis. We treated mice with bleomycin to establish lung fibrosis and with 22B6 mAb from day 8 to day 17 after bleomycin injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 E</xref>). 22B6 mAb significantly reduced lung fibrosis even after fibrotic disease had been established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10, F&#8211;H</xref>). These data further support the concept that the endogenous production of FSTL1 after noninfectious lung injury regulates the fibroproliferative response. Collectively, our data demonstrate that FSTL1 plays a key role in fibrogenesis through regulating TGF-&#946;1&#8211;mediated myofibroblast accumulation and ECM production. As a proof of principle, antibody-mediated neutralization of FSTL1 significantly attenuated TGF-&#946;1&#8211;induced myofibroblast differentiation and ECM production in fibroblasts in vitro and bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice in vivo. These data are encouraging that blockade of FSTL1 would be an attractive strategy for patients with progressive pulmonary fibrosis.</p><fig id="fig10" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p><bold>FSTL1-neutralizing antibody attenuates bleomycin-induced fibrosis in mice.</bold> (A) Intervention dosing regimen at the early stage of lung fibrosis model.

More effective therapies are needed, and one of the hurdles to developing therapeutics is lack of complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis of the disease (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">ATS/ERS, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">King et al., 2011</xref>). The findings reported here add new insights into our understanding of the regulation of pulmonary fibrogenesis and demonstrate a novel role of FSTL1 in promoting fibrosis. We provide data at the cellular, molecular, and animal levels, as well as proof of principle intervention data to support a role of FSTL1 as a therapeutic target for lung fibrosis.</p><p>We offered the following lines of evidence to demonstrate the profibrotic role of Fstl1 in pulmonary fibrogenesis. Targeting deletion of <italic>Fstl1</italic> in mice significantly reduced alveolar injury and attenuated lung fibrosis after bleomycin injury. Fstl1 regulated activation of fibroblasts and differentiation of myofibroblasts and production of matrix proteins. Blockage of FSTL1 with a neutralizing antibody reduced bleomycin-induced fibrosis in mice in vivo. FSTL1 is a member of the secreted protein acidic rich in cysteines (SPARC) family (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bradshaw, 2012</xref>). It has been shown that follistatin blocked both activin and TGF-&#946; actions, leading to attenuated lung fibrosis in mice (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Aoki et al., 2005</xref>). Unlike follistatin, FSTL1 shows more functional similarity to SPARC in promoting bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Trombetta-eSilva and Bradshaw, 2012</xref>).</p><p>We found that Fstl1 regulated lung fibrosis through (a) AEC injury, (b) epithelial-mesenchymal communication, and (c) fibroblast activation and differentiation. Our data demonstrate Fstl1 regulated epithelial cell injury, as deletion of Fstl1 significantly reduced alveolar damage. We further identified that Fstl1 regulates epithelial injury through modulating TGF-&#946;1/BMP signaling. Activation of TGF-&#946;1 (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Sime et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Munger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2011</xref>) and inadequate BMP signaling (but not BMP expression; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Koli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Myll&#228;rniemi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Costello et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Farkas et al., 2011</xref>) have been shown to play roles in regulating tissue fibrosis. In this study, we confirmed the ability of FSTL1 to negatively regulate BMP4 signaling, as we and others have shown in embryonic development (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Geng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, we found positive regulation of FSTL1 on TGF-&#946;1 signaling. The dual role of FSTL1 in regulating TGF-&#946; and BMP4 signaling was further demonstrated in primary lung epithelial cells and cultured A549 cells, suggesting that FSTL1 disrupts TGF-&#946;/BMP balance by facilitating TGF-&#946;1 but inhibiting BMP4 signaling.</p><p>In fibroblast activation, Fstl1 seems to promote TGF-&#946;1 signaling in a BMP4-independent manner. We found similarly reduced phosphorylation of Smad2/3 but comparable levels of phosphor-Smad1 in primary lung fibroblasts from bleomycin-injured <italic>Fstl1<sup>+/&#8722;</sup></italic> lungs relative to WT, suggesting the function of FSTL1 is cell type dependent.</p><p>The current consensus suggests that IPF is initiated by repetitive microinjuries of AECs (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Selman and Pardo, 2002</xref>), which subsequently provoke activation of fibroblasts and differentiation of myofibroblasts (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). Although several studies have shown evidence for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by colocalization of epithelial and mesenchymal markers in IPF lungs and animal models (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Willis and Borok, 2007</xref>), a recent genetic tracing study argues against a role of EMT as a direct source of activated myofibroblasts in fibrotic lung (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Rock et al., 2011</xref>). We identified a population of AECs containing both epithelial and mesenchymal markers in bleomycin-injured mouse lung. Meanwhile, we found that AECs from bleomycin-injured mice had decreased expression of epithelial markers and increased expression of mesenchymal markers. Furthermore, we found that these activated AECs could activate quiescent resident fibroblasts. Our study suggests a notion that expression of mesenchymal markers may simply reflect epithelial injury (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kage and Borok, 2012</xref>) and activation via aberrant epithelial-mesenchymal communication (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Selman and Pardo, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). In this study we prefer to use the term &#8220;epithelial-mesenchymal communication&#8221; rather than EMT, as we suggest that FSTL1 in the matrix regulates epithelial-mesenchymal communication and enhances a fibrogenic milieu.</p><p>Strategies to target the TGF-&#946;1 signaling pathway have been developed for IPF. For example, a clinical trial of GC-1008 (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Gr&#252;tter et al., 2008</xref>), a pan-specific fully human anti&#8211;TGF-&#946;1 mAb, is being developed in patients with IPF (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">du Bois, 2010</xref>). Owing to the pleiotropic nature of TGF-&#946;, blocking TGF-&#946; signaling may also have adverse effects. Alternative strategies have been investigated. Integrin &#945;v&#946;6 binds and activates latent TGF-&#946;1, regulating pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Munger et al., 1999</xref>). A humanized mAb targeting integrin &#946;6 is now in clinical trial for patients with IPF (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Horan et al., 2008</xref>). Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a downstream mediator of TGF-&#946;, was able to confer susceptibility to bleomycin-induced fibrosis in the fibrosis-resistant BALB/c mouse strain (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bonniaud et al., 2004</xref>). A phase 2 trial of human neutralizing antibody against CTGF is under way to assess potential therapeutic benefits in patients with IPF (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01890265). Our findings suggest to us that blocking FSTL1 can be an alternative approach to interfere with TGF-&#946;1/BMP signaling pathways for suppression of fibrogenesis. Our proof of principle neutralizing antibody experiments are encouraging. Because insufficiency of Fstl1 did not have much of an effect on immune response during injury, we think that FSTL1 modulates TGF-&#946;1 signaling at pathological conditions, not homeostatic functions, during lung injury and fibrosis. Therefore, inhibition of FSTL1 with neutralization antibody for IPF treatment may provide an advantage compared with block of TGF-&#946;1 or its receptors directly, similar to the situation with the antibodies to &#945;v&#946;6 integrin (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Horan et al., 2008</xref>). Other approaches to block FSTL1&#8211;TGF-&#946;1 signaling such as mutant FSTL1 proteins are actively pursued in our laboratories.</p><p>In summary, we have demonstrated that FSTL1 plays an important role in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and target deletion of Fstl1 attenuated the pulmonary fibrosis in response to noninfectious lung injury. We postulated that mechanisms of this action are through both protection against epithelial injury and impaired epithelial-mesenchymal communication, leading to limited myofibroblast expansion. FSTL1 exerts its function depending on cell type. FSTL1 differentially regulates TGF-&#946; and BMP signaling, leading to epithelial injury and fibroblast activation. The precise mechanisms by which FSTL1 exerts its function, if and how FSTL1 regulates epithelial apoptosis, fibroblast proliferation/migration, and myofibroblasts&#8217; prolonged survival, are actively pursued in our laboratories. This study and our continuing efforts will provide novel insights into the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of IPF and a novel therapeutic target for patients with pulmonary fibrosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Subjects.</title><p>Lung tissue samples from IPF patients (<italic>n</italic> = 5) obtained from bronchoscopy lung biopsies, used for qRT-PCR analysis of FSTL1 expression, were from the Capital Medical University Tissue Bank (Beijing, China).

For pull-down assay, His-tagged FSTL1 was concentrated by Ni-NTA-agarose beads (QIAGEN), which could capture His-tagged proteins. After washing, the beads were incubated with TGF-&#946;1 solution. The Ni-FSTL1&#8211;bounded TGF-&#946;1 was then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti&#8211;TGF-&#946;1 antibodies. The unspecific IgG antibodies were used as a control. HEK293 cells were transfected with Myc-His&#8211;tagged Fstl1 and HA-tagged type II receptor of TGF-&#946;1 (T&#946;RII) or type I receptor of TGF-&#946;1 (T&#946;RI) with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). In vitro&#8211;translated Myc-His&#8211;tagged FSTL1 was concentrated by Ni-NTA&#8211;agarose beads, and the Ni-FSTL1&#8211;bounded HA receptors were then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibodies. COS-7 cells were transfected with HA-tagged T&#946;RII with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). In vitro&#8211;translated HA-tagged T&#946;RII was immunoprecipitated by HA-agarose and incubated with TGF-&#946;1 and FSTL1 proteins to examine how FSTL1 facilitates the binding of TGF-&#946;1 to T&#946;RII.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression profile dataset and analysis.</title><p>Gene profiling dataset of IPF lungs analyzed for FSTL1 expression was acquired from a previous study (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Pardo et al., 2005</xref>).
