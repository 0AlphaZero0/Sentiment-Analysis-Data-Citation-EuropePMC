<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Epithelial apoptosis pathways are activated in the lungs of patients with acute lung injury, in part by activation of signaling pathways such as Fas ligand–Fas and TGF-β (Hagimoto et al., 2002). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>We offered the following lines of evidence to demonstrate the profibrotic role of Fstl1 in pulmonary fibrogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>Targeting deletion of Fstl1 in mice significantly reduced alveolar injury and attenuated lung fibrosis after bleomycin injury. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>Fstl1 regulated activation of fibroblasts and differentiation of myofibroblasts and production of matrix proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>Blockage of FSTL1 with a neutralizing antibody reduced bleomycin-induced fibrosis in mice in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="343" pm="."><plain>FSTL1 is a member of the secreted protein acidic rich in cysteines (SPARC) family (Bradshaw, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that follistatin blocked both activin and TGF-β actions, leading to attenuated lung fibrosis in mice (Aoki et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>Unlike follistatin, FSTL1 shows more functional similarity to SPARC in promoting bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis (Trombetta-eSilva and Bradshaw, 2012). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>We found that Fstl1 regulated lung fibrosis through (a) AEC injury, (b) epithelial-mesenchymal communication, and (c) fibroblast activation and differentiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate Fstl1 regulated epithelial cell injury, as deletion of Fstl1 significantly reduced alveolar damage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>We further identified that Fstl1 regulates epithelial injury through modulating TGF-β1/BMP signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>Activation of TGF-β1 (Sime et al., 1997; Munger et al., 1999; Zhao et al., 2002; Li et al., 2011) and inadequate BMP signaling (but not BMP expression; Koli et al., 2006; Myllärniemi et al., 2008; Costello et al., 2010; Farkas et al., 2011) have been shown to play roles in regulating tissue fibrosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>In this study, we confirmed the ability of FSTL1 to negatively regulate BMP4 signaling, as we and others have shown in embryonic development (Geng et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we found positive regulation of FSTL1 on TGF-β1 signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="352" pm="."><plain>The dual role of FSTL1 in regulating TGF-β and BMP4 signaling was further demonstrated in primary lung epithelial cells and cultured A549 cells, suggesting that FSTL1 disrupts TGF-β/BMP balance by facilitating TGF-β1 but inhibiting BMP4 signaling. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="353" pm="."><plain>In fibroblast activation, Fstl1 seems to promote TGF-β1 signaling in a BMP4-independent manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="354" pm="."><plain>We found similarly reduced phosphorylation of Smad2/3 but comparable levels of phosphor-Smad1 in primary lung fibroblasts from bleomycin-injured Fstl1+/− lungs relative to WT, suggesting the function of FSTL1 is cell type dependent. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="355" pm="."><plain>The current consensus suggests that IPF is initiated by repetitive microinjuries of AECs (Selman and Pardo, 2002), which subsequently provoke activation of fibroblasts and differentiation of myofibroblasts (Yang et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="356" pm="."><plain>Although several studies have shown evidence for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by colocalization of epithelial and mesenchymal markers in IPF lungs and animal models (Kim et al., 2006; Willis and Borok, 2007), a recent genetic tracing study argues against a role of EMT as a direct source of activated myofibroblasts in fibrotic lung (Rock et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="357" pm="."><plain>We identified a population of AECs containing both epithelial and mesenchymal markers in bleomycin-injured mouse lung. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="358" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, we found that AECs from bleomycin-injured mice had decreased expression of epithelial markers and increased expression of mesenchymal markers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="359" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found that these activated AECs could activate quiescent resident fibroblasts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="360" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests a notion that expression of mesenchymal markers may simply reflect epithelial injury (Kage and Borok, 2012) and activation via aberrant epithelial-mesenchymal communication (Selman and Pardo, 2002; Yang et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="361" pm="."><plain>In this study we prefer to use the term “epithelial-mesenchymal communication” rather than EMT, as we suggest that FSTL1 in the matrix regulates epithelial-mesenchymal communication and enhances a fibrogenic milieu. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="362" pm="."><plain>Strategies to target the TGF-β1 signaling pathway have been developed for IPF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="363" pm="."><plain>For example, a clinical trial of GC-1008 (Grütter et al., 2008), a pan-specific fully human anti–TGF-β1 mAb, is being developed in patients with IPF (du Bois, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="364" pm="."><plain>Owing to the pleiotropic nature of TGF-β, blocking TGF-β signaling may also have adverse effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="365" pm="."><plain>Alternative strategies have been investigated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="366" pm="."><plain>Integrin αvβ6 binds and activates latent TGF-β1, regulating pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis (Munger et al., 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="367" pm="."><plain>A humanized mAb targeting integrin β6 is now in clinical trial for patients with IPF (Horan et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="368" pm="."><plain>Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a downstream mediator of TGF-β, was able to confer susceptibility to bleomycin-induced fibrosis in the fibrosis-resistant BALB/c mouse strain (Bonniaud et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="369" pm="."><plain>A phase 2 trial of human neutralizing antibody against CTGF is under way to assess potential therapeutic benefits in patients with IPF (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01890265). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="370" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest to us that blocking FSTL1 can be an alternative approach to interfere with TGF-β1/BMP signaling pathways for suppression of fibrogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="371" pm="."><plain>Our proof of principle neutralizing antibody experiments are encouraging. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="372" pm="."><plain>Because insufficiency of Fstl1 did not have much of an effect on immune response during injury, we think that FSTL1 modulates TGF-β1 signaling at pathological conditions, not homeostatic functions, during lung injury and fibrosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="373" pm="."><plain>Therefore, inhibition of FSTL1 with neutralization antibody for IPF treatment may provide an advantage compared with block of TGF-β1 or its receptors directly, similar to the situation with the antibodies to αvβ6 integrin (Horan et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="374" pm="."><plain>Other approaches to block FSTL1–TGF-β1 signaling such as mutant FSTL1 proteins are actively pursued in our laboratories. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="375" pm="."><plain>In summary, we have demonstrated that FSTL1 plays an important role in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and target deletion of Fstl1 attenuated the pulmonary fibrosis in response to noninfectious lung injury. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="376" pm="."><plain>We postulated that mechanisms of this action are through both protection against epithelial injury and impaired epithelial-mesenchymal communication, leading to limited myofibroblast expansion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="377" pm="."><plain>FSTL1 exerts its function depending on cell type. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="378" pm="."><plain>FSTL1 differentially regulates TGF-β and BMP signaling, leading to epithelial injury and fibroblast activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="379" pm="."><plain>The precise mechanisms by which FSTL1 exerts its function, if and how FSTL1 regulates epithelial apoptosis, fibroblast proliferation/migration, and myofibroblasts’ prolonged survival, are actively pursued in our laboratories. </plain></SENT>
