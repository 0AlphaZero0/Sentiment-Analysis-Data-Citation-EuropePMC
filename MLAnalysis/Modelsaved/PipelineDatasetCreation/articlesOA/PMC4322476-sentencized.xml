<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While most studies have focused on the effects of warming on arctic vegetation and nutrient cycling, little is known about how belowground communities, such as fungi root-associated, respond to warming. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigate how long-term summer warming affects ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal communities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used Ion Torrent sequencing of the rDNA internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region to compare ECM fungal communities in plots with and without long-term experimental warming in both dry and moist tussock tundra.

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the functional level, our results indicate that warming induces shifts in the extramatrical properties of the communities, where the species with medium-distance exploration type seem to be favored with potential implications for the mobilization of different nutrient pools in the soil. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Soils of the northern circumpolar region cover approximately 16% of the global soil surface and contain an estimated 50% of all soil organic carbon (C) pool (Tarnocai et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Because these regions have been experiencing some of the highest rates of warming (0.06–0.1 °C per year over the past 40 years), a large proportion of this C is increasingly vulnerable to mobilization due to warming-induced melting of permafrost and higher microbial decomposition rates (Anisimov et al., 2007; Hansen et al., 2010; Comiso x0026; Hall, 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This warming is resulting in a suite of climate feedbacks, including changes in sea ice cover and the length of ice-free periods (Arrigo x0026; van Dijken, 2011; Post et al., 2013), a greening of the surrounding land surface, and tree line advancement (Kharuk et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>All of these are altering the albedo of the Arctic (Chapin et al., 2005; Post et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Although many of these feedbacks are positive, some could potentially be negative. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>For example, a greening of the Arctic driven by increases in shrub density (Sturm et al., 2005; Loranty x0026; Goetz, 2012; Tape et al., 2012) could result in greater degrees of C sequestration (Welker et al., 1997; Sistla et al., 2013; Anderson-Smith 2013; Pattison x0026; Welker, 2014), but see Hartley et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>(2012) for counterargument. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Increases in shrub density and canopy growth can further alter the tundra by local snow trapping in winter, increasing soil insulation, causing higher winter, and spring-time soil temperatures, and increasing the rates of nitrogen (N) and C mineralization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Greater rates of winter CO2 emissions, in turn, may enhance the potential for shrub growth and further expansion (Sturm et al., 2001; Schimel et al., 2004; Sturm et al., 2005; Weintraub x0026; Schimel, 2005; Tape et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, whether these changes are accompanied by a simultaneous reorganization of the soil fungal community and whether these responses differ in moist tussock and dry tundra have not been resolved. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Arctic soils have limited availability of nutrients and arctic plants are highly dependent on mutualistic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi for survival (Gardes x0026; Dahlberg, 1996; Hobbie et al., 2009; Bjorbækmo et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>It has been estimated that 61–86% of the N in Arctic tundra plants is obtained through mycorrhizal fungi (Hobbie x0026; Hobbie, 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi are the predominant fungal guild in the Arctic (Gardes x0026; Dahlberg, 1996; Clemmensen et al., 2006; Bjorbækmo et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Recent studies of belowground Arctic ECM fungal communities, revealed higher species richness than what had previously been known from aboveground surveys (Ryberg et al., 2009; Bjorbækmo et al., 2010; Geml et al., 2012; Timling et al., 2012; Timling x0026; Taylor, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>These studies indicated that the most diverse arctic ECM genera are Tomentella (here interpreted as including Thelephora), Inocybe, Cortinarius, Sebacina, Russula, and Hebeloma. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>ECM fungal community composition in the Arctic is generally correlated with soil properties, geology, plant productivity, and climate (Timling et al., 2012, 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>There is also evidence to suggest that ECM plant host identity is not a main driver of ECM fungal community composition in the Arctic (Ryberg et al., 2009; Timling et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Although there are a few studies focused on the molecular diversity of belowground ECM fungal communities in the Arctic (Ryberg et al., 2009; Bjorbækmo et al., 2010; Geml et al., 2012 Timling et al., 2012, 2014), the main drivers at the landscape scale remain largely unresolved, and this hampers our current in-depth comprehension of arctic soil ecology. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Recent evidences, reported from other biomes than the Arctic, suggest that the extramatrical mycelium (EMM) morphology and ECM fungi extracellular enzyme activity are of great relevance to understand the nutrient dynamics of the ECM symbiosis (Cairney x0026; Burke, 1996; Agerer, 2001; Anderson x0026; Cairney, 2007; Hobbie x0026; Agerer, 2010; Peay et al., 2011; Tedersoo et al., 2012; Talbot et al., 2013; Bödeker et al., 2014) that is crucial to understand soil ecology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>ECM fungi produce EMM that grows from the ectomycorrhizae into the surrounding soil with the crucial functions of foraging the litter and/or mineral layers for nutrients, and of seeking new root tips for colonization (Martin et al., 2001; Anderson x0026; Cairney, 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The EMM forms an intricate hyphal network that interconnects plant roots, and paves the way for interplant C and nutrient movements (Selosse et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>EMM of different taxa are known to have distinct anatomical and physiological features that are attributable to various strategies of foraging (Colpaert et al., 1992; Agerer, 2001; Hobbie x0026; Agerer, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Several studies linked the EMM characteristics with the pools of nutrients they explore in the soil, and with their roles in soil-plant interaction, taking into account energetic cost-benefit for both fungi and plant host (e.g., Agerer, 2001; Lilleskov et al., 2002; Hobbie x0026; Agerer, 2010; Lilleskov et al., 2011; Cairney, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The main characteristics to classify the EMM are the mycelium exploration type, presence/absence of rhizomorphs and hydrophobicity of the hyphae (Agerer, 2001; Hobbie x0026; Agerer, 2010; Peay et al., 2011; Lilleskov et al., 2011; Cairney, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Moreover, besides EMM characteristics per se, species with abundant EMM generally showed stronger potential to produce extracellular enzymes than species with scarce EMM (Tedersoo et al., 2012), even though multiple exceptions exist. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>It has been hypothesized that species with EMM of the medium-distance fringe, and long-distance exploration types might have the potential to explore recalcitrant nutrient pools through extracellular enzyme activity, and that species with contact, short, and medium-distance smooth exploration types might be associated with labile nutrient soil pools (e.g., Lilleskov et al., 2002; Hobbie x0026; Agerer, 2010; Lilleskov et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Such functional information is still under investigation, and therefore, currently only available for a limited number of taxa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, this framework constitutes a valuable insight into the ecological functions of ECM fungal community. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The long-term effects of climate change on arctic tundra function and structure have primarily been investigated with respect to aboveground growth, phenology, vegetation composition, and plant and ecosystem C exchange (e.g., Chapin x0026; Shaver, 1985; Arft et al., 1999; Welker et al., 1997, 2000, 2004; Elmendorf et al., 2012; Tape et al., 2012; Cahoon et al., 2012; Sharp et al., 2013; Pattison x0026; Welker, 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Vegetation studies, in the moist tussock tundra at Toolik Lake, Alaska, indicated that long-term experimental summer warming induced significant increases in the abundance and height of Betula nana, Salix pulchra, and graminoids, and in the accumulation of the litter layer (Wahren et al., 2005; Mercado-Díaz, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the bryophytes decreased significantly (Mercado-Díaz, 2011), most likely due to competitive exclusion by shrubs (Cornelissen et al., 2001; Jägerbrand et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>These aboveground vegetation changes are likely correlated with changes below ground, such as soil moisture, soil nutrient pools, fine-root abundance, and root turn-over dynamics, which interplay with ECM fungal community dynamics (e.g., Read et al., 2004; Dickie x0026; Reich, 2005; Dickie et al., 2005; Strand et al., 2008; Toljander et al., 2006; Twieg et al., 2009; Peay et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Even though some studies addressed belowground processes, such as N cycling (e.g., Schimel et al., 2004; Borner et al., 2008; Schaeffer et al., 2013) and microbial community change (e.g., Clemmensen et al., 2006; Campbell et al., 2010; Deslippe et al., 2011, 2012), our knowledge about the compositional and functional changes of arctic communities in response to long-term warming remains rudimentary. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>In this study, we use high-throughput sequencing techniques to study the long-term effects of experimental warming on the ECM basidiomycete community in dry and moist tussock tundra in Northern Alaska. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Our hypotheses were twofold. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>First, we hypothesize that long-term warming induces changes in the ECM fungal community composition, because aboveground changes in the vegetation, including several ECM host plants, have already been documented (Wahren et al., 2005; Mercado-Díaz, 2011) and this is suggestive of changes in belowground processes (Sullivan x0026; Welker, 2005; Sullivan et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Secondly, based on the results from the above vegetation studies and reported warming-induced increases in ECM fungal and fine-root biomass (Clemmensen et al., 2006), we expect that the ECM fungal community of the moist tussock tundra will show a stronger response to warming than the dry tundra. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we expect to find a more diverse ECM community in the warmed moist tussock tundra plots, because Deslippe et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>(2011) reported significant increases in the diversity of arctic ECM fungi associated with root tips of Betula nana as a response to warming. Betula nana is a dominant in our sampling plots and has shown strong, positive response to experimental warming (Wahren et al., 2005; Mercado-Díaz, 2011). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Between July 23 and 25, 2012, we sampled soil from 20 plots representing the dry and the moist tussock tundra. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>In each tundra type, we sampled five plots that were subjected to passively increased summer air temperature by hexagonal open top chambers (OTCs), subsequently referred to as ‘treatment’, and five adjacent areas with unaltered conditions (‘control’). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>The sampling was performed with a soil corer of approximately 2 cm × 20 cm (diameter × depth). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>In each of the 20 plots, five soil cores were taken, thoroughly mixed and kept frozen until lyophilization. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Within the OTCs the summer air temperature increases by a mean daily average of 1.5 °C, while soil temperatures remain the same as in the control plots (Walker et al., 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Every year, since 1994, the OTCs are set up as soon as 50% of the ground area of a given plot was snow free (usually early June) and are removed at the end of August or early September, following the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) protocol (Welker et al., 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>It has been repeatedly shown that OTCs provide a reasonable approximation to the predicted climatic changes in the Arctic as they alter daytime temperature significantly and minimize unwanted ecological effects, such as changes in soil moisture, the influence of wind speed on air temperature (Marion et al., 1997; Sharkhuu et al., 2013; Bokhorst et al., 2013 and references therein). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Due to our deep sequencing efforts, our rarefaction curves indicate that the vast majority of fungal taxa in the sampling sites have been sequenced that, in turn, provides a more solid base for among-site comparisons. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Cortinarius was the only dominant genus with nonsignificant decrease in per-plot OTU richness.

<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>This suggests that most Cortinarius spp in the moist tundra may be resilient and/or adapted to the conditions induced by warming. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>In light of the EMM characteristics, it is interesting to note that, contrary to the other three dominant genera, Cortinarius has an EMM with medium-distance fringed exploration type and hydrophobic rhizomorphs (Agerer, 2001, 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Taking into account that prior evidence point to a lack of effect of warming on ECM colonization ratios and that ECM fungal biomass increases with warming (Clemmensen et al., 2006), it seems reasonable to hypothesize that Cortinarius spp. might have an advantage over other ECM taxa under long-term summer temperature increase. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Lilleskov et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>(2011) suggested that fungi with medium-distance fringed exploration type and hydrophobic rhizomorphs, such as Cortinarius, are likely to have hydrolytic capabilities that would facilitate acquisition and translocation of insoluble proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>It has been postulated for an extended period that most extracellular enzyme secretion is likely to be confined to the hyphae tip close to the apex, where the wall pore size is large enough to be permeable to enzymes of relatively large molecular weight (e.g., Chang x0026; Trevithick, 1974; Unestam x0026; Sun, 1995; Lindahl et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the functional compartmentalization in gene expression between root tips and foraging mycelium (Wright et al., 2005), coupled with the very low activity of enzymes correlated with ECM fungi measured on ECM root tips compared to levels of activity measured in bulk soils (Talbot et al., 2013) support the hypothesis that the EMM have a crucial role in nutrient acquisition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Recently, Bödeker and colleagues (2014) provided compelling evidence supporting the hypothesis that at least, some Cortinarius spp. are directly involved in soil organic matter degradation through extracellular enzymatic activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>This capability coupled with a diffuse mycelium may be advantageous for Cortinarius spp. to colonize recalcitrant and unevenly distributed nutrient soil pools, nutrients uptake, and to translocate them from the soil to the host roots while promoting root connectivity (Hobbie x0026; Agerer, 2010; Lilleskov et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Such functional roles can facilitate plant mineral nutrition resulting in higher plant and leaf N, as well as greater growth and greater leaf photosynthesis as observed in the warmed plots by Welker et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>(2005) and by Pattison x0026; Welker (2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>In exchange the host plant might increase carbohydrates allocation to the root system and EMM as a tradeoff, justifying the high energetic investment by the ECM fungi. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Such mechanisms of soil C accumulation derived from roots and root-associated fungi have been shown to contribute 50–70% of stored C in ECM-dominated boreal forests (Clemmensen et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>This pattern is distinct from that observed in Russula and Inocybe, both of which have a low relative frequency (13% and 19%, respectively) of OTUs present in both the control and the treatment plots. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>A couple of hypotheses can be raised to interpret this trend. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>First, the EMM characteristics of Tomentella spp. are still largely unknown and there is some evidence that EMM morphology varies considerably within this diverse genus. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is possible that the EMM characteristics of the OTUs affiliated with Tomentella are more varied than initially assumed and distinct from the OTUs affiliated with Russula and Inocybe. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>In the moist tussock tundra, all OTUs with EMM of the long-distance type, that has been hypothesized to play an important role in nutrient translocation and new root-colonization (Hobbie x0026; Agerer, 2010; Weigt et al., 2011), were affiliated with Leccinum spp. that is specific to Betula nana in the Arctic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>It has been hypothesized that Leccinum species have proteolyctic capabilities (Nygren et al., 2008; Eaton x0026; Ayres, 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is surprising that the OTU richness with this EMM type decreased significantly in the treatment plots, since we expected a similar pattern as in the species with medium-distance fringe exploration type (for in-depth discussion for potential similar patterns between these two groups consult Hobbie x0026; Agerer (2010)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>However, the significance of this decrease might be influenced by the overall low diversity of taxa with long-distance EMM type in the arctic tundra. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>It is possible that these changes in diversity might not relate to actual differences in overall ecological function, since two of 4 OTUs that represented this EMM type are present in the treatment plots. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>It is important to understand that we do not claim that temperature increase affects the fungi directly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Instead, we argue that the warming induces changes in the entire biotic community and, via the numerous intimate interactions fungi have with other living organisms in these plots, changes are apparent in the ECM fungal community as well, regardless if they are directly or indirectly caused by warming. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Because OTCs minimize unwanted ecological effects while effectively elevating temperature (Marion et al., 1997), it is reasonable to assume that most of the changes in the fungal community composition are induced by increased air and surface temperature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>However, it is unclear if shifts in ECM fungal communities are due to direct effects of temperature on fungal metabolism or caused indirectly, e.g., via changes in plant-fungus interactions, rather than by the direct effect of temperature on fungal metabolism (or, likely, are combinations of the two). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, it is conceivable that other factors (e.g., leaf temperature increase on sunny days) may or may not have some indirect influence on the ECM fungi associated with these plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Due to the lack of information and relevant empirical data, it is difficult to even speculate about possible mechanisms and disentangling such causal relationships are beyond the scope of this paper. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Our results do not show significant differences in either ECM fungal community composition or richness in the dry tundra. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Former vegetation studies on dry tundra community also indicated no effect of warming on plant species richness, but there were significant increases in shrub canopy height and cover, mainly due to increase in evergreen shrubs (Mercado-Díaz, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>These changes in plant community only occurred more than 8 years after initiating the experiment (Walker et al., 1999; Wahren et al., 2005; Mercado-Díaz, 2011) reflecting a less pronounced effect of the warming treatment on the dry tundra than what is reported for the moist tussock tundra (see above). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Contrary to the patterns observed in the moist tundra, the changes in the dry tundra vegetation were mainly in non-ECM plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the absence of significant changes in the ECM fungal community of the dry tundra is in agreement with the lack of compositional changes in the ECM plant hosts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>However, since the significant shifts in the vegetation are in non-ECM hosts (Mercado-Díaz, 2011), we hypothesize that other root-associated fungi, particularly ericoid mycorrhizal fungi, may exhibit stronger response to warming. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Although the NMDS analysis indicated no significant changes in the ECM fungal community composition, we found an interesting pattern in two taxonomic groups at the functional level, i.e., in the EMM types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>For example, in the control plots, the genus Russula was represented by two EMM types: the contact with hydrophilic hyphae and the medium-distance smooth type with varying hydrophobicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, only OTUs with medium-distance type with mainly hydrophilic hyphae were detected in the warmed plots. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the genus Laccaria that has EMM of the medium-distance smooth type with hydrophilic hyphae, was only found in the treatment plots. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>Even though this pattern might result from chance alone, it can also be indicative of slow and/or minute shifts in the community. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>When analyzing the EMM of the OTUs that compose the dry tundra community, it is interesting to note that the contact and short-distance exploration types with hydrophilic hyphae were represented by more than twice as many OTUs as the medium-distance exploration type with hydrophobic rhizomorphs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>The majority of ECM fungi with contact and short-distance exploration types with hydrophilic hyphae have been hypothesized to explore the pools of labile nutrients in the soil, since most of them showed reduced proteolytic capabilities in laboratory experiments (Lilleskov et al., 2002; Nygren et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Recently, Hobbie et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>(2013), using radiocarbon data, provided evidence from natural ecosystems that also support this hypothesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Lilleskov et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>(2011) hypothesized that taxa with this EMM type are predominant in conditions of low below ground C allocation, because they probably have a low C cost to the host. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>This is agreement with previous findings that suggest that the dry tundra has far less productivity than the moist tundra (Gough et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, the scarcity of knowledge on the nutrient acquisition strategies of most ECM fungi prevent us from further speculations about possible warming-induced functional changes in the community and their effects on nutrient cycling. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>This article is the first to study the effects of long-term experimental warming in the ECM fungal community at a habitat-scale of the low Arctic tundra using high-throughput sequencing techniques. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>We provide evidence that (i) long-term summer temperature increases have contrasting effects on various ECM fungal genera; and (ii) these effects are habitat-dependent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>These patterns might be indicative of ecological strategies of various ECM fungi as well as of differences in patterns of C storage and N cycling in these two tundra types (Welker et al., 2000; Schimel et al., 2004; Welker et al., 2005; Pattison x0026; Welker, 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>The nonsignificant changes in richness and composition of the ECM fungal community in the dry tundra (this study) coupled with evidence of nonsignificant changes in the ECM fungal biomass in a subarctic heath tundra, near Abisko, Sweden, (Clemmensen et al., 2006) might indicate that the biogeochemical processes in the dry tundra remain largely unaltered with moderate warming. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>Also, environmental changes other than air and surface temperature, might play a more important role in this tundra type, e.g., changes in snow depth have been reported to influence microbial activity and N cycle (Schimel et al., 2004), which in turn might also affect the ECM fungal community. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>In the moist tundra, the observed changes in the ECM fungal community (this study) coupled with the increase in ECM fungal biomass (Clemmensen et al., 2006) suggest increased capability of N mobilization, which might be derived from recalcitrant soil pools. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>This may favor enhanced C allocation from the plants to the ECM fungi and the rhizosphere, and, therefore, enhanced C storage in the soil biotic community. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Even though these processes might surpass soil organic matter decomposition and microbial respiration rates, and therefore, contribute to positive feedbacks in climate change, this still remains an open question that needs further investigations. </plain></SENT>
