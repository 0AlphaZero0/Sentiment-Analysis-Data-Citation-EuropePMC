It contains a gene encoding CMY-2 &#946;-lactamase (<italic>bla</italic><sub>CMY&#8722;2</sub>), and therefore contributes to extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance. To elucidate the significance of GI-VII-6 on adaptive evolution, spontaneous mutants of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium strain L-3553 were selected on plates containing cefotaxime (CTX). The concentrations of CTX were higher than its minimum inhibition concentration to the parent strain. The mutants appeared on the plates containing 12.5 and 25 mg/L CTX at a frequency of 10<sup>&#8722;6</sup> and 10<sup>&#8722;8</sup>, respectively. No colonies were observed at higher CTX concentrations. The copy number of <italic>bla</italic><sub>CMY&#8722;2</sub> increased up to 85 per genome in the mutants, while the parent strain contains one copy of that in the chromosome. This elevation was accompanied by increased amount of transcription. The <italic>bla</italic><sub>CMY&#8722;2</sub> copy number in the mutants drastically decreased in the absence of antimicrobial selection pressure. Southern hybridization analysis and short-read mapping indicated that the entire 125 kb GI-VII-6 or parts of it were tandemly amplified. GI-VII-6 amplification occurred at its original position, although it also transposed to other locations in the genome in some mutants, including an endogenous plasmid in some of the mutants, leading to the amplification of GI-VII-6 at different loci. Insertion sequences were observed at the junction of the amplified regions in the mutants, suggesting their significant roles in the transposition and amplification. Plasmid copy number in the selected mutants was 1.4 to 4.4 times higher than that of the parent strain. These data suggest that transposition and amplification of the <italic>bla</italic><sub>CMY&#8722;2</sub>-containing region, along with the copy number variation of the plasmid, contributed to the extensive amplification of <italic>bla</italic><sub>CMY&#8722;2</sub> and increased resistance to CTX.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>resistance</kwd><kwd>genomic island</kwd><kwd>insertion sequence</kwd><kwd>gene duplication and amplification</kwd><kwd><italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="23"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="7198"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Non-typhoidal <italic>Salmonella</italic> (NTS) infection causes enterocolitis with diarrhea and/or invasive disease with bacteremia. Extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs) or fluoroquinolones are commonly used as a first-line agent for the treatment of NTS infections, if susceptibilities to antimicrobials are unknown. In particular, ESCs are preferred, because fluoroquinolones are not recommended for use in children (Hohmann, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Therefore, emergence of ESC-resistant NTS poses a threat to public health. Resistance to ESCs among <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovars is attributed to the acquisition of Ambler class A extended-spectrum &#946;-lactamases (ESBLs) and/or Ambler class C cephamycinases (AmpC &#946;-lactamases). Of these, CMY-2, an AmpC &#946;-lactamase encoded by the <italic>bla</italic><sub>CMY&#8722;2</sub> gene, is the most frequently detected enzyme among NTS (Michael et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).</p><p>Human salmonellosis is mainly acquired by the ingestion of animal products, including meat, milk, and eggs (Mead et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). The use of antimicrobials in food-producing animals selects for bacteria resistant to antimicrobials used in humans (Phillips et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). We have continuously monitored the antimicrobial resistance of <italic>S. enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium (<italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium) isolated from cattle in Japan (Tamada et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Since 2004, <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium isolates that are resistant to ESC have been detected in the northern major island, Hokkaido (Tamamura et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Most of these ESC-resistant <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium isolates have been noted to harbor one copy of <italic>bla</italic><sub>CMY&#8722;2</sub> in their chromosome as an element of a 125-kb genomic island, GI-VII-6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). A large proportion of GI-VII-6 (99%) shows a high sequence similarity (&gt;99%) with <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> plasmid, pAR060302 (size, 167 kb). Directly repeated copies of insertion sequence IS<italic>26</italic> were present at both ends of GI-VII-6 (Shahada et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Insertion sequences are the simplest transposable elements and can induce transposition of flanking genes to other replicons with themselves (Mahillon and Chandler, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). In fact, junction region of this genomic island were flanked by an 8-bp direct repeat, suggesting that GI-VII-6 was acquired by transposition involving IS<italic>26</italic> transposase (Shahada et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of oxyimino-cephalosporins against these isolates have been found to be lower than those of other bacteria producing plasmid-encoded CMY-2 &#946;-lactamases or ESBLs (Bonnet, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Jacoby, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Shahada et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The significance of GI-VII-6 on ESC resistance and clonal spread of GI-VII-6 positive isolates is not yet clear.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic view of antimicrobial resistance regions located in GI-VII-6</bold>.

GI-VII-6 were flanked by an 8-bp direct repeat.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fmicb-06-00078-g0001"/></fig><p>Gene duplication and amplification (GDA) is known to be an important adaptive mechanism in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes under the existence of selection pressures such as anitimicrobials and carbon starvation (Andersson and Hughes, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Bacterial genomic regions of up to 300 kb can be selected under antimicrobial selection pressures with the copy numbers of up to 40 (Sandegren and Andersson, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The amplified genes alter the antimicrobial resistance phenotypes of the bacteria. For example, resistance of bacteria to sulfonamides, trimethoprim, and &#946;-lactams can be increased by GDA of genes encoding antimicrobial hydrolytic enzymes, target enzymes, or efflux pumps (Andersson and Hughes, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Sandegren and Andersson, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Although the detailed mechanisms of GDA are still controversial, direct repeats flanking a region can contribute successful amplification (Sandegren and Andersson, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The presence of directly repeated copies of IS<italic>26</italic> flanking GI-VII-6 (Shahada et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) prompted us to investigate whether increased ESC resistance due to GDA occurs in the <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium isolates harboring GI-VII-6. The purpose of the present study is to understand the significance of GI-VII-6 in the adaptive evolution of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium under antimicrobial selection pressure.</p><p>Thus, we selected and analyzed spontaneous mutants of an <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium strain harboring GI-VII-6 on cephalosporin-containing plates. GI-VII-6 was extensively amplified in all of the mutants by GDA mechanisms. However, the amplification pattern was more complex than we initially predicted. Pre-existing or transposed insertion sequences were observed at the junction of the amplified regions. The importance of insertion sequences on the adaptive evolution was highlighted in this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Selection of <italic>S</italic>. typhimurium mutants with increased resistance to cefotaxime</title><p>To select <italic>S</italic>.

Whole-genome sequence of this strain was reported previously (Sekizuka et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The MIC of CTX against this strain was 8 mg/L. This strain was inoculated into 3 ml of Luria&#8211;Bertani (LB) broth (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and incubated at 37&#176;C and 150 rpm for 20 h. The shaking speed employed for broth culture was the same throughout this study. The culture was serially diluted and spread on LB agar plates (Becton, Dickinson and Company) containing 12.5, 25, 50, or 100 mg/L CTX (Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC., St. Louis, MO, USA). In addition, the same culture was spread on LB agar plates without antimicrobials. The frequency of the mutations was estimated from the number of colonies on LB agar plates with CTX divided by that on plates without CTX. Twenty colonies were picked from the CTX-containing plates and inoculated into fresh LB broth with CTX (at the same concentration to that used in the initial selection) and incubated at 37&#176;C for 24 h under constant shaking. Each culture was mixed with same volume of 50% (vol/vol) glycerol and stored at -80&#176;C until further use.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of MIC</title><p>MIC was determined by the agar dilution method using Mueller&#8211;Hinton agar (Becton, Dickenson and Company), according to the procedure recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).

Typhimurium harboring GI-VII-6 under CTX selection pressure is mainly based on the increased copy number of <italic>bla</italic><sub>CMY&#8722;2</sub> gene by GDA mechanisms. This conclusion is elicited from the following evidence. First, the mean coverage of the entire or a part of GI-VII-6 was greater than five times higher than that of other chromosomal regions (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3</xref>). Second, <italic>bla</italic><sub>CMY&#8722;2</sub>-positive fragments that were 30&#8211;125 kb in size were observed after XbaI digestion of the genomic DNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>), suggesting a tandem array of the amplified regions. In addition, a <italic>bla</italic><sub>CMY&#8722;2</sub>-positive chromosomal fragment of 350 kb in size was lost and a fragment of larger size appeared after FseI digestion by Southern hybridization analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), indicating that amplification occurred at the original position. Third, increased copy number of <italic>bla</italic><sub>CMY&#8722;2</sub> was accompanied by increased amount of transcription (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Fourth, the <italic>bla</italic><sub>CMY&#8722;2</sub> copy number drastically decreased in the course of serial subculture without selection pressure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Lastly, the frequency of the spontaneous-mutants selection was 10<sup>&#8722;6</sup> and 10<sup>&#8722;8</sup> on 12.5 and 25 mg/L CTX-containing plates, respectively. These frequencies are similar to those reported in previous GDA studies and appear to be higher than those of point mutations. Above-mentioned characteristics are in concordance with those of GDA mechanisms reported previously (Andersson and Hughes, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Sandegren and Andersson, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p><p>Two major mechanisms have been proposed that can increase gene copy number. One is the homologous and/or non-homologous recombination based replication and the other is rolling circle replication (Andersson and Hughes, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Sandegren and Andersson, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The initial step of the former mechanism is duplication either through non-equal homologous recombination between directly oriented repeats or through RecA-independent mechanisms between short- or no-homology regions. Following duplication, higher level amplification can occur as a result of RecA-dependent recombination between the tandem repeats generated by the initial duplication. Alternatively, no duplication intermediates are required in the rolling circle replication; a double-strand break allows single-strand invasion at a homologous or micro-homologous region, followed by amplification. Compared to non-equal homologous recombination, rolling circle replication can generate a large tandem array in a single generation (Sandegren and Andersson, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, the amplified regions in the three mutants selected on 12.5 mg/L CTX-containing plates had directly oriented IS<italic>26</italic> copies at both ends (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The initial duplication appeared to have occurred between pre-existing IS<italic>26</italic> copies in these strains. In contrast, we could not find any homologous sequences at both ends of the amplified regions in the remaining three strains selected on 25 mg/L CTX-containing plates by short-read mapping. However, results of our PCR and sequencing analyses suggested that IS<italic>26</italic> was found at the junctions of the three different amplified regions in strain 25-6. Also, IS<italic>1</italic> was found at the junction of the amplified region in strain 25-11 (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM7">S3</xref>). The IS<italic>26</italic> and/or IS<italic>1</italic> insertions at both ends of the amplified regions may have preceded the amplification in these mutants. In strain 25-6, we observed three prominent <italic>bla</italic><sub>CMY&#8722;2</sub> signals in Xba I-restricted fragments less than 100 kb in size (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>), suggesting these regions were amplified at different loci in the genome. Transposition of the <italic>bla</italic><sub>CMY&#8722;2</sub>-containing region flanked by directly repeated IS<italic>26</italic> copies may have preceded the amplification in this mutant. This signifies that the amplification site is not exclusively in the original position. Because the parent strain contains four copies each of the IS<italic>26</italic> and IS<italic>1</italic> transposases (Sekizuka et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), these insertion sequences may transpose in the parent strain with a relatively high frequency. Reams et al. (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) reported that 97% of duplication events resulted from recombination between IS<italic>3</italic> among non-selectively trapped 1800 spontaneous <italic>lac</italic> duplications, and that the formation of the duplications was stimulated by IS<italic>3</italic> transposase and plasmid transfer functions (TraI). As GI-VII-6 contains <italic>traI</italic>, the multiple copies of IS<italic>26</italic>, IS<italic>1</italic>, and <italic>traI</italic> may increase the duplication frequency mediated by IS<italic>26</italic> and IS<italic>1</italic>.</p><p><italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium L-3553 harbors a 133-kb virulence and antimicrobial resistance plasmid, pST3553. We observed several plasmids larger than pST3553 in part of the spontaneous mutants. For example, the same set of four differently sized plasmids were detected in strains 12-11, 12-12, 12-13, 12-14, 12-17, and 12-18 by PFGE after S1 nuclease digestion with a size interval of 120&#8211;135 kb. We observed both <italic>bla</italic><sub>CMY&#8722;2</sub> and <italic>spvB</italic> signals in most plasmids (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), suggesting that these plasmids were cointegrates of the endogenous plasmids with different copies of GI-VII-6. We obtained <italic>E. coli</italic> transformant harboring the plasmid from strain 12-18. Results of PCR scanning to check the structure of GI-VII-6 (Shahada et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) revealed that the enlarged plasmid contained the entire GI-VII-6 sequence (data not shown). We thus concluded that the enlarged plasmids were generated by the transposition of GI-VII-6 into pST3553. The size of the plasmid is 38 times smaller than that of the chromosome. However, pST3553 shares several homologous regions with GI-VII-6 (Sekizuka et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The regions would increase the frequency of integration of the GI-VII-6 into the plasmid mediated by homologous recombination. In addition, the plasmid copy number in the six selected strains was 1.4 to 4.4 times higher than that of the parent strain. Especially, strains with higher copy numbers of <italic>bla</italic><sub>CMY&#8722;2</sub> (12-14, 25-6, and 25-17) harbored enlarged plasmids and expressed higher copy numbers of plasmid. With the exception of the three non-synonymous mutations (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S4</xref>), we could not detect any mutations among the genomic DNA of the selected mutants. Thus, these results may be due to the copy-number variation of the plasmid and selection of cells with higher copy-number of the plasmid under the selection pressure. These data suggest that transposition and amplification of the <italic>bla</italic><sub>CMY&#8722;2</sub>-containing region, along with the copy number variation of the enlarged plasmid, contributed to the extensive amplification of <italic>bla</italic><sub>CMY&#8722;2</sub>.</p><p>We showed that spontaneous mutants can be selected at CTX concentration marginally above the MIC. No mutants were detected on 50 and 100 mg/L CTX-containing plates, suggesting that GDA is amenable to the mutant selection window (MSW) theory (Drlica and Zhao, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). The MSW theory postulates that antimicrobial-resistant mutant subpopulations present before the initiation of antimicrobial treatment are enriched and amplified during the therapy when the antimicrobial concentrations remain in a specific range, the MSW. The upper boundary of the MSW is the minimum concentration that can inhibit the growth of all types of single mutants, called mutant prevention concentration (MPC). As duplication of any specific bacterial gene occurs at a high rate (10<sup>&#8722;3</sup>&#8211;10<sup>&#8722;5</sup>/cell/division) (Anderson and Roth, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1981</xref>; Reams et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), overnight culture of the parent strain should comprise a certain number of mutants with duplications mediated by IS<italic>26</italic> or IS<italic>1</italic>. These mutants may be enriched in the presence of CTX after amplification of the <italic>bla</italic><sub>CMY&#8722;2</sub>-containing region with directly repeated copies of IS<italic>26</italic> or IS<italic>1</italic> at both ends. Although effective amplification may contribute to resistance against higher concentrations of CTX, there must be a limit, i.e., an increase in the genome poses a fitness cost to the host (Nilsson et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Reams et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In fact, we observed a drastic reduction in the <italic>bla</italic><sub>CMY&#8722;2</sub> copy number in the course of serial subculture without selection pressure.</p><p>Taken together, we conclude that GI-VII-6 amplification occurred at the original position, while it also transposed to other genomic locations, including an endogenous plasmid in some of the mutants. Insertion sequences played important roles in the transposition and amplification of <italic>bla</italic><sub>CMY&#8722;2</sub> containing regions. The copy-number variation in the <italic>bla</italic><sub>CMY&#8722;2</sub>-positive plasmid partially contributed to the extensive amplification of <italic>bla</italic><sub>CMY&#8722;2</sub> in some of the mutants. In addition, the selection frequency of mutants with gene amplification was higher than that of typical mutations, suggesting that gene amplification is one of the adaptive mechanisms that occur prior to acquiring additional mutations in order to facilitate antimicrobial resistance.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C), 2013&#8211;2015 (25460553).</p></ack><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary material</title><p>The Supplementary Material for this article can be found online at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.frontiersin.org/journal/10.3389/fmicb.2015.00078/abstract">http://www.frontiersin.org/journal/10.3389/fmicb.2015.00078/abstract</ext-link></p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><media xlink:href="Table1.PDF"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM2"><media xlink:href="Table2.PDF"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM3"><media xlink:href="Table3.PDF"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM4"><media xlink:href="Table4.PDF"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM5"><media xlink:href="Image1.PDF"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM6"><media xlink:href="Image2.PDF"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM7"><media xlink:href="Image3.PDF"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Roth</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>1981</year>). <article-title>Spontaneous tandem genetic duplications in <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> arise by unequal recombination between rRNA (<italic>rrn</italic>) cistrons</article-title>. <source>Proc.
