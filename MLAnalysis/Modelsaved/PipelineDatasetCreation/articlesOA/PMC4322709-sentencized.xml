<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs) or fluoroquinolones are commonly used as a first-line agent for the treatment of NTS infections, if susceptibilities to antimicrobials are unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In particular, ESCs are preferred, because fluoroquinolones are not recommended for use in children (Hohmann, 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Therefore, emergence of ESC-resistant NTS poses a threat to public health. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Resistance to ESCs among Salmonella enterica serovars is attributed to the acquisition of Ambler class A extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) and/or Ambler class C cephamycinases (AmpC β-lactamases). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Of these, CMY-2, an AmpC β-lactamase encoded by the blaCMY−2 gene, is the most frequently detected enzyme among NTS (Michael et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Typhimurium isolates have been noted to harbor one copy of blaCMY−2 in their chromosome as an element of a 125-kb genomic island, GI-VII-6 (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>A large proportion of GI-VII-6 (99%) shows a high sequence similarity (&gt;99%) with Escherichia coli plasmid, pAR060302 (size, 167 kb). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Directly repeated copies of insertion sequence IS26 were present at both ends of GI-VII-6 (Shahada et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Insertion sequences are the simplest transposable elements and can induce transposition of flanking genes to other replicons with themselves (Mahillon and Chandler, 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>In fact, junction region of this genomic island were flanked by an 8-bp direct repeat, suggesting that GI-VII-6 was acquired by transposition involving IS26 transposase (Shahada et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of oxyimino-cephalosporins against these isolates have been found to be lower than those of other bacteria producing plasmid-encoded CMY-2 β-lactamases or ESBLs (Bonnet, 2004; Jacoby, 2009; Shahada et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>For example, resistance of bacteria to sulfonamides, trimethoprim, and β-lactams can be increased by GDA of genes encoding antimicrobial hydrolytic enzymes, target enzymes, or efflux pumps (Andersson and Hughes, 2009; Sandegren and Andersson, 2009). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>Following duplication, higher level amplification can occur as a result of RecA-dependent recombination between the tandem repeats generated by the initial duplication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, no duplication intermediates are required in the rolling circle replication; a double-strand break allows single-strand invasion at a homologous or micro-homologous region, followed by amplification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>Compared to non-equal homologous recombination, rolling circle replication can generate a large tandem array in a single generation (Sandegren and Andersson, 2009). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the amplified regions in the three mutants selected on 12.5 mg/L CTX-containing plates had directly oriented IS26 copies at both ends (Figure 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>The initial duplication appeared to have occurred between pre-existing IS26 copies in these strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>In contrast, we could not find any homologous sequences at both ends of the amplified regions in the remaining three strains selected on 25 mg/L CTX-containing plates by short-read mapping. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>However, results of our PCR and sequencing analyses suggested that IS26 was found at the junctions of the three different amplified regions in strain 25-6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Also, IS1 was found at the junction of the amplified region in strain 25-11 (Figure S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>The IS26 and/or IS1 insertions at both ends of the amplified regions may have preceded the amplification in these mutants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>In strain 25-6, we observed three prominent blaCMY−2 signals in Xba I-restricted fragments less than 100 kb in size (Figure 4C), suggesting these regions were amplified at different loci in the genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Transposition of the blaCMY−2-containing region flanked by directly repeated IS26 copies may have preceded the amplification in this mutant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>This signifies that the amplification site is not exclusively in the original position. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Because the parent strain contains four copies each of the IS26 and IS1 transposases (Sekizuka et al., 2014), these insertion sequences may transpose in the parent strain with a relatively high frequency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Reams et al. (2012) reported that 97% of duplication events resulted from recombination between IS3 among non-selectively trapped 1800 spontaneous lac duplications, and that the formation of the duplications was stimulated by IS3 transposase and plasmid transfer functions (TraI). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>As GI-VII-6 contains traI, the multiple copies of IS26, IS1, and traI may increase the duplication frequency mediated by IS26 and IS1. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Typhimurium L-3553 harbors a 133-kb virulence and antimicrobial resistance plasmid, pST3553. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>We observed several plasmids larger than pST3553 in part of the spontaneous mutants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>For example, the same set of four differently sized plasmids were detected in strains 12-11, 12-12, 12-13, 12-14, 12-17, and 12-18 by PFGE after S1 nuclease digestion with a size interval of 120–135 kb. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>We observed both blaCMY−2 and spvB signals in most plasmids (Figure 2), suggesting that these plasmids were cointegrates of the endogenous plasmids with different copies of GI-VII-6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>We obtained E. coli transformant harboring the plasmid from strain 12-18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Results of PCR scanning to check the structure of GI-VII-6 (Shahada et al., 2011) revealed that the enlarged plasmid contained the entire GI-VII-6 sequence (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>We thus concluded that the enlarged plasmids were generated by the transposition of GI-VII-6 into pST3553. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>The size of the plasmid is 38 times smaller than that of the chromosome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>However, pST3553 shares several homologous regions with GI-VII-6 (Sekizuka et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>The regions would increase the frequency of integration of the GI-VII-6 into the plasmid mediated by homologous recombination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>In addition, the plasmid copy number in the six selected strains was 1.4 to 4.4 times higher than that of the parent strain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Especially, strains with higher copy numbers of blaCMY−2 (12-14, 25-6, and 25-17) harbored enlarged plasmids and expressed higher copy numbers of plasmid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>With the exception of the three non-synonymous mutations (Table S4), we could not detect any mutations among the genomic DNA of the selected mutants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Thus, these results may be due to the copy-number variation of the plasmid and selection of cells with higher copy-number of the plasmid under the selection pressure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that transposition and amplification of the blaCMY−2-containing region, along with the copy number variation of the enlarged plasmid, contributed to the extensive amplification of blaCMY−2. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>We showed that spontaneous mutants can be selected at CTX concentration marginally above the MIC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>No mutants were detected on 50 and 100 mg/L CTX-containing plates, suggesting that GDA is amenable to the mutant selection window (MSW) theory (Drlica and Zhao, 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>The MSW theory postulates that antimicrobial-resistant mutant subpopulations present before the initiation of antimicrobial treatment are enriched and amplified during the therapy when the antimicrobial concentrations remain in a specific range, the MSW. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>The upper boundary of the MSW is the minimum concentration that can inhibit the growth of all types of single mutants, called mutant prevention concentration (MPC). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>As duplication of any specific bacterial gene occurs at a high rate (10−3–10−5/cell/division) (Anderson and Roth, 1981; Reams et al., 2010), overnight culture of the parent strain should comprise a certain number of mutants with duplications mediated by IS26 or IS1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>These mutants may be enriched in the presence of CTX after amplification of the blaCMY−2-containing region with directly repeated copies of IS26 or IS1 at both ends. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>Although effective amplification may contribute to resistance against higher concentrations of CTX, there must be a limit, i.e., an increase in the genome poses a fitness cost to the host (Nilsson et al., 2006; Reams et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>In fact, we observed a drastic reduction in the blaCMY−2 copy number in the course of serial subculture without selection pressure. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>Taken together, we conclude that GI-VII-6 amplification occurred at the original position, while it also transposed to other genomic locations, including an endogenous plasmid in some of the mutants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>Insertion sequences played important roles in the transposition and amplification of blaCMY−2 containing regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>The copy-number variation in the blaCMY−2-positive plasmid partially contributed to the extensive amplification of blaCMY−2 in some of the mutants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>In addition, the selection frequency of mutants with gene amplification was higher than that of typical mutations, suggesting that gene amplification is one of the adaptive mechanisms that occur prior to acquiring additional mutations in order to facilitate antimicrobial resistance. </plain></SENT>
