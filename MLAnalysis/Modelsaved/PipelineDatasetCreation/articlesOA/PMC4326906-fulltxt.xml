The most common HGPS mutation is found at position G608G within exon 11 of the <italic>LMNA</italic> gene. This mutation results in the deletion of 50 amino acids at the carboxyl-terminal tail of prelamin A, and the truncated protein is called <italic>progerin</italic>. Progerin only undergoes a subset of the normal post-translational modifications and remains permanently farnesylated. Several attempts to rescue the normal cellular phenotype with farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) and other compounds have resulted in partial cellular recovery. Using proteomics, we report here that progerin induces changes in the composition of the HGPS nuclear proteome, including alterations to several components of the protein degradation pathways. Consequently, proteasome activity and autophagy are impaired in HGPS cells. To restore protein clearance in HGPS cells, we treated HGPS cultures with sulforaphane (SFN), an antioxidant derived from cruciferous vegetables. We determined that SFN stimulates proteasome activity and autophagy in normal and HGPS fibroblast cultures. Specifically, SFN enhances progerin clearance by autophagy and reverses the phenotypic changes that are the hallmarks of HGPS. Therefore, SFN is a promising therapeutic avenue for children with HGPS.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>lamins</kwd><kwd>progeria</kwd><kwd>progerin</kwd><kwd>proteostasis</kwd><kwd>senescence</kwd><kwd>sulforaphane</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Hutchinson&#8211;Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS, OMIM 176670) is a rare segmental premature aging disorder associated with rapid growth deceleration in childhood (Gordon <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The most frequent mutation G608G (GGC&gt;GGT) occurs within exon 11 of LMNA encoding a mutant lamin A protein called progerin, which is missing 50 amino acid near the carboxyl terminus of prelamin A (Eriksson <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). This truncation removes the ZMPSTE24 cleavage site from the lamin A processing pathway (Sinensky <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Young <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), resulting in a persistent progerin farnesylation. Progerin consequently is tightly anchored to the nuclear envelope, disrupting the nuclear lamina and causing nuclear blebbing, heterochromatin disorganization, and accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) in HGPS patient cells, as well as in cells in which the progerin is expressed by transgenic methods (Goldman <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Liu <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Manju <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Gordon <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have shown that cells or mouse models of progeria after treatment with either farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI), statins, or isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (ICMT) inhibitor could reverse some of the phenotypic changes occurring in these cells or tissues (Fong <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Capell <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Yang <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Ibrahim <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). To date, three clinical trials involving children with HGPS have been initiated using the drugs mentioned above to block prelamin A maturation (Gordon <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The identification of new compounds that can boost progerin degradation will significantly improve recovery for children affected by this syndrome.</p><p>To date, there are very few compounds that are known to enhance the protein degradation systems. One of them is sulforaphane (SFN, 1-isothiocyanato-4-(methylsulfinyl)-butane), a potent inducer of antioxidant enzymes, and is found in cruciferous vegetables, especially in young broccoli sprouts (Verkerk <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). SFN reduces oxidative stress through the activation of antioxidant response pathways (Verkerk <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) and promotes proteostasis (Kwak <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Gan <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).

The HGPS cells exhibited an increased amount of ubiquitinated proteins in response to MG132 (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3H</xref>), and the administration of chloroquine resulted in a significant increase in LC3B-II (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3I</xref>), a specific marker of autophagosomes that accumulates when autophagy is inhibited (Gamerdinger <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). In contrast, LC3B-II levels were barely detectable in HGPS cells treated with SFN alone or with MG132, indicating that autophagy remained active (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3I</xref>).

This result is consistent with previous study indicating that autophagy is stimulated by proteasome inhibition (Milani <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The progerin levels in cells exposed to SFN and chloroquine for 12&#160;h remained similar to those in SFN-treated cells (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3H</xref>), that is, this duration of SFN plus chloroquine treatment was not long enough to induce a detectable increase in progerin levels.

Of the three isoforms (FHL-1A, FHL-1B, and FHL-1C) encoded by the FHL-1 gene, FHL-1C was the most significantly decreased in HGPS fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">Fig. S2</xref>). SFN treatment was efficient in upregulating FHL-1 levels in HGPS cells, as detected by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">Fig. S2</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased levels of ATP in HGPS cells (Viteri <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). As SFN is known to have antioxidant properties, we next tested its effect on ROS and ATP levels in HGPS fibroblasts. We found that ROS levels were increased in early-passage HGPS cultures and were reduced in the presence of SFN (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3J</xref>). In contrast, ATP levels were significantly decreased in HGPS cells compared with normal cells (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3K</xref>), and SFN treatment induced an increase in intracellular ATP levels in both control and HGPS cells. These data indicate that the antioxidant activity of SFN ameliorates reduced energy levels in HGPS cells.</p></sec><sec><title>SFN treatment improves nuclear morphology in HGPS fibroblasts</title><p>Well-defined abnormalities in HGPS cells include nuclear envelope alterations and reduced levels of the nuclear components, lamin B1, and LAP2&#945; (Goldman <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Shimi <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). We first investigated the impact of SFN on the nuclear shape, including the nuclear blebs and invaginations observed in dysmorphic HGPS nuclei (Goldman <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). SFN treatment reduced the frequency of nuclear blebbing in both control and HGPS cells after 4&#160;days, with further reductions after 9&#160;days of treatment (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4A</xref>). Next, immunohistochemistry with an anti-progerin antibody revealed progerin accumulation in the most dysmorphic HGPS nuclei and localization to the nuclear envelope, with aggregated staining in certain areas (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4B</xref>). In contrast, progerin staining in normal-shaped nuclei exhibited weak signals, with very few dots or foci, and other nuclei exhibited no signal. In SFN-treated HGPS cultures, both the number of brightly labeled nuclei and the signal intensity in progerin-positive nuclei were reduced compared with those in mock-treated HGPS cultures. Additionally, the percentage of nuclei with bright progerin staining was reduced from an average of 38% in mock-treated HGPS cultures to 15% in SFN-treated HGPS cultures. However, the distribution of the nuclear pores was not altered by SFN treatment (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4B</xref>). Lamin B1 signals in the most dysmorphic HGPS nuclei were very low to barely detectable (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4C</xref>), whereas bright progerin-positive HGPS nuclei were associated with weak lamin B1 staining. After SFN treatment, the number of HGPS nuclei exhibiting reduced lamin B1 signals was reduced concomitantly with a decreased number of bright progerin-positive nuclei (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4C</xref>). Finally, a low lamin B1 signal always coincided with a low LAP2&#945; signal (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4B</xref>). Thus, the frequency of nuclei with low levels of lamin B1 and LAP2&#945; staining in SFN-treated HGPS cells was reduced. Together, these findings indicated that SFN normalized the levels of lamin B1 and LAP2&#945; by reducing progerin levels in HGPS nuclei.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment of HGPS fibroblasts with SFN reduces the levels of DNA damage</title><p>HGPS cells accumulate endogenous DNA damage, and particularly DSBs, with passage in culture (Liu <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Scaffidi &amp; Misteli, <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Thus, we determined the basal levels of DNA damage in mock-treated fibroblasts after staining with antibodies against the phosphorylated form of &#947;H2A.X, which detects DSBs. The number of HGPS nuclei harbouring &#947;H2A.X foci was 49% on average, which was significantly higher than the number in normal fibroblasts (8%) (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5A</xref>). However, 9&#160;days of SFN treatment significantly reduced the number of nuclei with &#947;H2A.X foci, to an average of 26% (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5A</xref>). These results indicate more efficient DNA damage repair in HGPS cells in the presence of SFN. Moreover, consistent with previous studies showing that the levels of the DNA repair factors 53BP1 and RAD51 are altered in HGPS cells (Liu <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>, <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), Western blot, and immunostaining analyses indicated that 53BP1 (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5A</xref>&#8211;C) and Rad51 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">Fig. S3</xref>) levels were decreased in HGPS cells.

Therefore, we investigated whether SFN in combination with lonafarnib (an FTI) could exert a synergistic effect on HGPS cells (Fig. S4). Control and HGPS cells were treated either separately with SFN (1&#160;&#956;<sc>m</sc>) or the FTI at a previously described concentration (1.5&#160;&#956;<sc>m</sc>) (Marji <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) or with a combination of both (Fig. S4). FTI treatment alone induced the accumulation of the prelamin A protein in both normal and HGPS cells (Fig. S4A). Progerin levels were significantly reduced only in SFN-treated HGPS cells (Fig. S4), whereas FTI treatment in combination with SFN did not lead to a reduction in progerin levels (Fig. S4). Immunohistochemical analyses also indicated that HGPS cells exhibited a more ovoid nuclear shape in the presence of FTI or FTI plus SFN (Fig. S4). However, a significant number of cells harbored donut-shaped nuclei after 4&#160;days of FTI treatment (Fig. S4C, arrows), as reported previously (Verstraeten <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Wang <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The average frequency of donut-shaped nuclei was 7% on day 4 of FTI treatment and had increased to approximately 35% by day 9. After 9&#160;days of FTI or FTI plus SFN treatment, the frequencies of donut-shaped nuclei were similar, and 75% of these nuclei were binucleated (Fig. S4D). Moreover, FTI with or without SFN decreased the growth rate of both control and HGPS cells (Fig. S4E). Collectively, these observations indicate that further drug titration studies will be needed to determine the potential use of an FTI in combination with SFN.</p></sec><sec><title>Long-term SFN treatment further ameliorates the HGPS cellular phenotype</title><p>To test the long-term effect of SFN on HGPS and normal fibroblasts, cultures were passaged several times and treated every other day with 1&#160;&#956;<sc>m</sc> SFN or vehicle for several months (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>). The proliferation rates of normal and HGPS cells demonstrated sustained increases in growth in the presence of SFN (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6A</xref>,B). Western blot analyses showed a significant and sustained decrease in progerin levels in SFN-treated HGPS cells in comparison with normal fibroblasts during the 85-day period of treatment (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6C</xref>,D). The status of A-type lamins, as indicated by the proportions of lamin A, progerin, and lamin C within each sample, also showed that progerin levels were significantly decreased in the presence of SFN (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6E</xref>). Importantly, the proportions of lamin A increased with these decreased levels of progerin in the treated HGPS cells (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6E</xref>), thus indicating that SFN ameliorated the ratio of A-type lamins in SFN-treated HGPS cells. Gene expression profiling of A-type lamins mRNA levels indicated that the overall levels remained constant under all conditions (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6F</xref>,G). As proteasome activity and autophagy levels were increased in both control and HGPS cells treated with SFN for 85&#160;days (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6H</xref>,I), our results indicated that SFN treatment induced a sustained increase in proteostasis in the cells during long-term treatment.

The abundance of progerin in HGPS nucleome makes this lamin A variant the biomarker of HGPS cells. Moreover, very low levels of progerin were also detected in normal nuclei. Prior studies showed that cells derived from unaffected individuals sporadically use the same cryptic splice site in lamin A, and several immunohistochemistry studies using anti-progerin antibodies have shown that progerin is present in cells from elderly individuals (McClintock <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Olive <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that normal cells might accumulate progerin over time and might manifest similar cellular alterations to those observed in HGPS cells.</p><p>Hutchinson&#8211;Gilford progeria syndrome nucleome exhibits changes in components involved in the proteolytic systems, suggesting that HGPS cells lose proteostasis. These changes include the heat-shock proteins (Hsp70, Hsp90, and Hsp27) that are linked to protein degradation via the proteasomal or lysosomal pathways. These activities decline with aging and contribute to the development of several age-related pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cataracts, and vascular disease (Koga <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). HGPS cells appear to share a similar mechanistic link as they also show a decline in protein degradation activities.</p><p>Proteasomes are present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Breusing &amp; Grune, <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Similarly to a previous study, we showed a decrease in the 26S subunit C2 and reduced proteasome activity (Viteri <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). We also found changes in the expression of several members of the BAG family in HGPS cells. These cochaperones are implicated in protein quality control and regulate the proteasome and autophagy pathways (Gamerdinger <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). As observed previously, we report that autophagy levels are decreased in HGPS cells and appear to exacerbate the cellular phenotype in late cultures (Cao <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">2011a</xref>). Strategies aimed at reducing progerin levels in HGPS cells using molecular approaches or drug treatments indicate a significant amelioration of the phenotype in progeria cells (Gordon <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Previously, AIMP3, an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-interacting multifunctional protein, was shown to interact with lamin A and promote its degradation by proteasomes (Oh <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), while progerin and lamin C, which are lacking AIMP3 interaction site undergo degradation by autophagy (Oh <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Herein, we provide further evidence for progerin degradation by autophagy in HGPS cells treated with SFN.</p><p>SFN belongs to the ITCs, which are derived from cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli. SFN induces several cellular protective mechanisms, including induction of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway (Baird &amp; Dinkova-Kostova, <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Moreover, SFN has been shown to enhance proteasome activity by upregulating several proteasomal subunits and Hsp proteins (Gan <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Vallanat <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Consistently, we report that SFN treatment of HGPS cells increased the expression of components of the proteasome system and of several Hsps and cochaperones, thereby increasing proteasome activity and autophagy. The reduction of progerin levels by SFN in HGPS cells led to nuclear envelope normalization, increased proliferation, and proteostasis, all of which were sustained and even improved over time in the presence of SFN.</p><p>Three previous studies have shown that rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, significantly reduces progerin levels via autophagy in HGPS cells (Cao <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2011b</xref>; Cenni <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Blondel <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), whereas a fourth study detected no reduction (Ibrahim <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Collectively, these studies support the idea that therapies aimed at increasing autophagy could ameliorate the HGPS cellular phenotype.</p><p>Because HGPS cells accumulate DNA DSBs, progerin has been thought to affect the rate of DSB repair (Liu <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Although restoring certain phenotypic effects of the disease, treatment of HGPS fibroblasts with FTIs does not reduce DNA damage (Liu <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). However, one study has shown that the ROS scavenger <italic>N</italic>-acetyl cysteine (NAC) can reduce the basal levels of DSBs (Richards <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In the present study, we provide evidence indicating that SFN treatment can also reduce the levels of DNA damage in HGPS cells.</p><p>Because several preclinical studies and clinical trials examining FTI use in HGPS have shown many ameliorations (Gordon <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), we tested the potential use of an FTI in combination with SFN to treat HGPS cells. At the concentrations used by others in this study, we found that this cotreatment reduced cell growth. However, further titration of both drugs will be needed to determine their potential synergistic effect.</p><p>In conclusion, our results not only confirm the link between the level of progerin in HGPS nuclei and the severity of the associated phenotypic alterations but also demonstrate that enhanced proteostasis can be achieved in HGPS cells. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that SFN, a small bio-compound, can improve proteasome activity and autophagy, reduce the levels of DNA damage, and improve the growth rate of HGPS cells. SFN might also be beneficial for normal cells. Our findings support the use of SFN, with its broad range of cytoprotective activities, as a valuable therapeutic strategy for children with HGPS and possibly other age-related conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Cell culture and drug treatments</title><p>Fibroblasts from patients with HGPS were obtained from The Progeria Research Foundation Cell and tissue Bank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.progeriaresearch.org">http://www.progeriaresearch.org</ext-link>).
