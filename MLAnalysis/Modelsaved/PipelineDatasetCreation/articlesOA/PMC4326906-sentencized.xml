<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The most frequent mutation G608G (GGC&gt;GGT) occurs within exon 11 of LMNA encoding a mutant lamin A protein called progerin, which is missing 50 amino acid near the carboxyl terminus of prelamin A (Eriksson et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This truncation removes the ZMPSTE24 cleavage site from the lamin A processing pathway (Sinensky et al., 1994; Young et al., 2006), resulting in a persistent progerin farnesylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Progerin consequently is tightly anchored to the nuclear envelope, disrupting the nuclear lamina and causing nuclear blebbing, heterochromatin disorganization, and accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) in HGPS patient cells, as well as in cells in which the progerin is expressed by transgenic methods (Goldman et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2006; Manju et al., 2006; Gordon et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Several studies have shown that cells or mouse models of progeria after treatment with either farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI), statins, or isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (ICMT) inhibitor could reverse some of the phenotypic changes occurring in these cells or tissues (Fong et al., 2006; Capell et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2008; Ibrahim et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>To date, three clinical trials involving children with HGPS have been initiated using the drugs mentioned above to block prelamin A maturation (Gordon et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The identification of new compounds that can boost progerin degradation will significantly improve recovery for children affected by this syndrome. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>To date, there are very few compounds that are known to enhance the protein degradation systems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>One of them is sulforaphane (SFN, 1-isothiocyanato-4-(methylsulfinyl)-butane), a potent inducer of antioxidant enzymes, and is found in cruciferous vegetables, especially in young broccoli sprouts (Verkerk et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>SFN reduces oxidative stress through the activation of antioxidant response pathways (Verkerk et al., 2009) and promotes proteostasis (Kwak et al., 2007; Gan et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Three previous studies have shown that rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, significantly reduces progerin levels via autophagy in HGPS cells (Cao et al., 2011b; Cenni et al., 2011; Blondel et al., 2014), whereas a fourth study detected no reduction (Ibrahim et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these studies support the idea that therapies aimed at increasing autophagy could ameliorate the HGPS cellular phenotype. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>Because HGPS cells accumulate DNA DSBs, progerin has been thought to affect the rate of DSB repair (Liu et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Although restoring certain phenotypic effects of the disease, treatment of HGPS fibroblasts with FTIs does not reduce DNA damage (Liu et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>However, one study has shown that the ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) can reduce the basal levels of DSBs (Richards et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we provide evidence indicating that SFN treatment can also reduce the levels of DNA damage in HGPS cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>Because several preclinical studies and clinical trials examining FTI use in HGPS have shown many ameliorations (Gordon et al., 2014), we tested the potential use of an FTI in combination with SFN to treat HGPS cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>At the concentrations used by others in this study, we found that this cotreatment reduced cell growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>However, further titration of both drugs will be needed to determine their potential synergistic effect. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results not only confirm the link between the level of progerin in HGPS nuclei and the severity of the associated phenotypic alterations but also demonstrate that enhanced proteostasis can be achieved in HGPS cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that SFN, a small bio-compound, can improve proteasome activity and autophagy, reduce the levels of DNA damage, and improve the growth rate of HGPS cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>SFN might also be beneficial for normal cells. </plain></SENT>
