For thousands of years, silk produced by domestic silkworms has been a widely sought fair textile material. <italic>B. mori</italic> was domesticated from the Chinese wild silkworm, <italic>Bombyx mandarina</italic>, approximately 5000&#160;years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Long-term artificial breeding and selection have resulted in high silk yield in domestic silkworms compared with the silk yield in its wild relative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, little is known about the genetic mechanisms of increased silk yield in the domestic silkworm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The silk proteins (fibroins and sericins) are produced by silk glands. The gland is divided into three compartments: anterior silk gland (ASG), median silk gland (MSG), and posterior silk gland (PSG). ASGs serve as ducts to transport the silk proteins in the final secretion process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. PSGs are responsible for the synthesis and secretion of fibroins, which are composed of a heavy chain (Fib-H, molecular weight 391&#160;kDa) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], a light chain (Fib-L, 26&#160;kDa), and P25 (30&#160;kDa) with a molar ratio of 6:6:1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. MSGs synthesize the glue proteins (sericins), which are composed of seven major sericins that are encoded by three main genes, <italic>Ser1</italic>, <italic>Ser2</italic>, and <italic>Ser3</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Thus, silk proteins are biosynthesized in the MSGs and PSGs. Silk threads comprise approximately 75% insoluble fibrous proteins in the inner layer and 25% hydrophilic glue sericin proteins in the outer layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>To understand the tissue specificity and functional diversification, the silk gland transcriptome in domestic silkworm has been investigated in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Expressed sequence tags were sequenced in the PSGs on days 1 and 5 of fifth-instar larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Differential gene expression patterns between anterior/median silk glands (A/MSG) and PSGs were examined on day 3 of fifth-instar larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Based on serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE)-aided transcriptome analysis, the gene expression profiles of MSGs and PSGs have also been compared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These studies suggested that the expression levels of most of the protein-coding genes were similar in the MSGs and PSGs of the domestic silkworm, while, as expected, mRNAs encoding the fibroins and sericins showed differential expression patterns.</p><p>Previous studies have focused mainly on the silk gland transcriptome in domestic silkworms. However, there seems to be no study on the silk gland transcriptome in <italic>B. mandarina</italic>, the wild relative of the domestic silkworm. Here, we sequenced the transcriptomes of silk glands from day 3 of fifth-instar larvae of two domestic and two wild silkworms using the Illumina sequencing technology. The goal of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in domestic versus wild silkworms, to help understand the molecular mechanism associated with the difference in silk production between domestic silkworm and its wild ancestor <italic>B. mandarina</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>RNA-sequencing and identification of novel transcripts</title><p>To explore differences in the silk gland transcriptomes between domestic and wild silkworms, two domestic strains, Chunhua (D_CH) and Chunyu (D_CY), and two wild silkworms were selected for analysis. The wild silkworms W_AKBH and W_AKSQ were collected from the Baihe and Shiquan counties of Ankang City, Shaanxi Province, respectively. Intact silk glands were dissected on day 3 of fifth-instar larvae and were found to present similar anatomy structures in the four silkworm (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). For each silkworm, the RNA from the median/posterior silk glands (M/PSGs) from five female and five male larvae was sequenced using an Illumina Genome Analyzer (II). An overview of the sequencing and assembly is outlined in Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1. After quality control, the number of clean bases in the D_CH, D_CY, W_AKBH and W_AKSQ transcriptome libraries were 5.48 Gb, 5.74 Gb, 5.2 Gb and 6.06 Gb, respectively (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

A total of 1,288 new transcripts were detected (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). Locations of exons and introns from each novel gene are also defined. The 1,288 new transcripts was detected by BLASTN against the silkworm transcriptome database (SilkTransDB), which included transcriptomes from eggs, ant worm and whole body at different developmental stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A total of 1,074 genes could be found corresponding transcripts in SilkTransDB (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2).

Only 264 genes had no corresponding homologs in nr database (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3). We analyzed the Gene Ontology (GO) classifications of all the 1,288 novel genes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S1). A total of 584 genes were assigned to corresponding GO terms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Transcriptome profiles of the silk glands from four silkworms</title><p>The abundance of all the genes (15,911) was normalized and calculated by the reads per kilo bases per million reads (RPKMs) method using uniquely mapped reads (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Genes with RPKMs in the interval 0&#8211;1 were considered not to be expressed or to be present at very low levels; genes with RPKMs over 60 were considered to be expressed at a very high level. The distributions of the expression levels of all the genes were similar for all four silkworms (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). We found that about 58% of the total number of genes (15,911) were expressed (RPKM&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;1), and more than 1,118 genes were highly expressed (RPKM&#8201;&gt;&#8201;60) in each silkworm (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). We analyzed the correlation between the topology and biological function of the highly expressed genes using the GO classifications (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S2). In the molecular function category, the most abundant GO terms were &#8220;binding&#8221; (~40%) and &#8220;catalytic activity&#8221; (~40%). We found that eight genes, <italic>BGIBMGA009393</italic>, <italic>BGIBMGA005111</italic>, <italic>BGIBMGA001793</italic>, <italic>BGIBMGA011901</italic>, <italic>BGIBMGA003608</italic>, <italic>BGIBMGA001347</italic> and <italic>BGIBMGA013157</italic>, were extremely highly expressed (RPKM&#8201;&gt;&#8201;10,000) in the silk glands of all four silkworms. These genes either encode silk proteins or play roles in the synthesis of proteins.

Only 20 genes showed common differential expressions in comparisons of D_CH vs D_CY and W_AKBH vs W_AKSQ (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C), implying that most of DEGs between the two domestic silkworm strains were different from the DEGs between the two wild silkworms. As shown in Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B, the numbers of DEGs between the domestic and wild silkworms ranged from 214 to 426. The 56 overlapped genes might be the candidate DEGs in domestic versus wild silkworms (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). However, some of the 56 genes showed expression differences within the domestic silkworms or within the wild silkworms and were excluded from the further analysis.

A previous study revealed that glycine and serine were the major amino acid residues in the silk fibroin heavy chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; thus, the differential expressions of these two genes might affect the amino acid composition of fibroins in wild silkworms.

The selected genes were found to show differential expressions between the domestic and wild silkworms, and no significant difference between the two wild silkworms or two domestic silkworms. As shown in Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Table S6, the qPCR expression results were similar to the results obtained from the Illumina sequencing data (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Table S4). That is, the fold changes in gene expression determined by qPCR were basically consistent with their transcript abundance changes determined by RNA-seq, which confirmed the validity of the expression data.

For example, the cocoon shell weights of W_AKBH, W_AKSQ, D_CH and D_CY were 0.13&#160;g, 0.12&#160;g, 0.32&#160;g and 0.36&#160;g, respectively. Characterization of a transcriptome can help explain the functional complexity of a genome and reveal cell activities like growth, development and immune response. Here, we compared the silk gland transcriptomes from the wild and domestic silkworms with the aim of obtaining useful information for understanding the biosynthesis and secretion of the silk proteins.</p><p>To help understand protein synthesis and development in the silk gland, DEGs in domestic versus wild silkworms were identified (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Table S4). We characterized 32 DEGs, 16 of which were up-regulated in domestic silkworms (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). We manually annotated the functions of these 16 DEGs, and found that some of them were related to tissue development, excretion of proteins, and metabolism (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). For example, we predicted that <italic>Novel01049</italic> might encode an ubiquitin-activating enzyme that could initiate the ubiquitination of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Ubiquitination is an essential process that regulates the turnover of proteins for basic cellular processes such as the cell cycle and cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. <italic>BGIBMGA013477</italic> was predicted to encode synaptic vesicle protein 2B (SV2B), which is a vesicle protein present in the secretory vesicles and is an important regulator of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated vesicle exocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Secretory vesicles have also been found in the silk gland of the domestic silkworm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. <italic>BGIBMGA013477</italic> (SV2B) was up-regulated more than 256-fold in D_CH and 46-fold in D_CY compared with its expression in the wild silkworms (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). SV2B might mediate the release of neurotransmitter and regulate secretion of silk proteins in the silk gland. <italic>BGIBMGA009572</italic> was predicted to encode translocase subunit secA, which might play role in pushing substrates forward like a &#8220;motor&#8221; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The Sec translocase pathway is ubiquitous and is responsible for the vast majority of protein export activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Thus, the up-regulated DEGs in silk glands of the domestic silkworms might be associated with the highly efficient biosynthesis and secretion of the silk proteins.</p><p>Fibroins have been found to be the major components (75%) of silk threads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In the present study, we found that the <italic>Fib-H</italic>, <italic>Fib-L</italic>, and <italic>P25</italic> were extremely highly expressed and showed similar expression levels in both the domestic and wild silkworms (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3). Initially, it was difficult to understand the obvious differences in silk production between domestic and wild silkworms; however, by combining our results with previously reported findings, we propose two possible explanations for this anomaly. In the transcriptome analysis, we concentrated only on protein-coding genes, while it has been reported that microRNAs (miRNAs) may play regulatory functions in the silk protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. MiRNAs play important roles in a broad range of biological processes, including down-regulating the translation of target genes to proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], inhibiting translation initiation, and mediating mRNA decay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. A total of 1,229 miRNAs have been identified in the PSGs in fifth-instar larvae of the silkworm using next-generation sequencing and microarray assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and the fibroin encoding genes <italic>Fib-H</italic>, <italic>Fib-L</italic>, and <italic>P25</italic> have been reported to be the targets of some miRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Because we found that the expression levels of the fibroin genes were similar in domestic and wild silkworms, we propose that miRNAs might be involved in the down-regulation of fibroin synthesis in the wild silkworms. Another possible explanation is, because silk fibroins are synthesized in PSG cells then secreted into the PSG lumen and aggregated in the MSG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], if the synthesized silk proteins are not secreted rapidly, their biosynthesis might be inhibited by the accumulated silk proteins. In the domestic silkworms, the up-regulated genes related to secretion (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) might promote the secretion of silk proteins for the continued synthesis of new proteins. Thus, highly efficient biosynthesis and secretion may be associated with higher silk production in the domestic silkworms.</p><p>Sixteen up-regulated DEGs were found in the wild silkworms compared with the domestic silkworms; seven of them were related to the GO term &#8220;oxidoreductase activity&#8221; (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Table S5) and a further six were related to immune response or detoxification (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). For example, laccase (<italic>BGIBMGA006745</italic>) and dopa decarboxylase (<italic>BGIBMGA002958</italic>) take part in the melanization cascade, which has been proposed to play roles in the immune response of insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In <italic>B. mori</italic>, serine protease inhibitor 16 (<italic>Novel01220</italic>) may be involved in resistance to pathogenic microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In <italic>Manduca sexta</italic>, laccase may play an important role in the oxidation of toxic compounds in the diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Interestingly, <italic>BGIBMGA009199</italic> is thought to be associated with domestication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and we found that it was up-regulated more than 46-fold in the wild silkworms (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Table S6). <italic>BGIBMGA009199</italic> encodes an organic cation transporter, which might mediate the transport of a variety of endogenous compounds and numerous drugs and xenobiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Wild silkworms live in a more natural niche than domestic silkworms and therefore are likely to encounter more xenobiotics and pathogenic microorganisms than domestic silkworms. Thus, the up-regulated DEGs in the wild silkworms may play important roles in dealing with xenobitics and pathogens in the natural environment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, this study represents a significant step in the characterization of silk gland transcriptomes and provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of silk production. The transcriptome comparisons revealed that DEGs associated with immune response and detoxification were up-regulated in the wild silkworms, which is consistent with their exposure to more pathogens and xenobitics in the natural environment than the domestic silkworms. In the domestic silkworms, DEGs that may be associated with highly efficient biosynthesis and secretion of silk proteins were up-regulated. However, further research is required to determine whether these DEGs are the genes responsible for the difference in silk production between domestic and wild silkworms. Further functional exploration of these genes may provide evidence for their future application in sericulture.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Silkworm collection and sample preparation</title><p>Wild silkworms W_AKBH and W_AKSQ were collected from the Baihe and Shiquan counties of Ankang City, in Shaanxi Province, respectively.
