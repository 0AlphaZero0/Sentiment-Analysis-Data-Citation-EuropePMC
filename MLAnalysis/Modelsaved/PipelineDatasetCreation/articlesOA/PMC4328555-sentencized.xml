</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The domestic silkworm, Bombyx mori (B. mori), is an economically important insect in countries such as China, Brazil and India. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>For thousands of years, silk produced by domestic silkworms has been a widely sought fair textile material. B. mori was domesticated from the Chinese wild silkworm, Bombyx mandarina, approximately 5000 years ago [1-3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Long-term artificial breeding and selection have resulted in high silk yield in domestic silkworms compared with the silk yield in its wild relative [2,4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the genetic mechanisms of increased silk yield in the domestic silkworm [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The silk proteins (fibroins and sericins) are produced by silk glands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The gland is divided into three compartments: anterior silk gland (ASG), median silk gland (MSG), and posterior silk gland (PSG). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>ASGs serve as ducts to transport the silk proteins in the final secretion process [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>PSGs are responsible for the synthesis and secretion of fibroins, which are composed of a heavy chain (Fib-H, molecular weight 391 kDa) [7], a light chain (Fib-L, 26 kDa), and P25 (30 kDa) with a molar ratio of 6:6:1 [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>MSGs synthesize the glue proteins (sericins), which are composed of seven major sericins that are encoded by three main genes, Ser1, Ser2, and Ser3 [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Thus, silk proteins are biosynthesized in the MSGs and PSGs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Silk threads comprise approximately 75% insoluble fibrous proteins in the inner layer and 25% hydrophilic glue sericin proteins in the outer layer [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>To understand the tissue specificity and functional diversification, the silk gland transcriptome in domestic silkworm has been investigated in previous studies [10-13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Expressed sequence tags were sequenced in the PSGs on days 1 and 5 of fifth-instar larvae [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Differential gene expression patterns between anterior/median silk glands (A/MSG) and PSGs were examined on day 3 of fifth-instar larvae [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Based on serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE)-aided transcriptome analysis, the gene expression profiles of MSGs and PSGs have also been compared [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>These studies suggested that the expression levels of most of the protein-coding genes were similar in the MSGs and PSGs of the domestic silkworm, while, as expected, mRNAs encoding the fibroins and sericins showed differential expression patterns. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have focused mainly on the silk gland transcriptome in domestic silkworms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>However, there seems to be no study on the silk gland transcriptome in B. mandarina, the wild relative of the domestic silkworm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Here, we sequenced the transcriptomes of silk glands from day 3 of fifth-instar larvae of two domestic and two wild silkworms using the Illumina sequencing technology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in domestic versus wild silkworms, to help understand the molecular mechanism associated with the difference in silk production between domestic silkworm and its wild ancestor B. mandarina. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Here, we compared the silk gland transcriptomes from the wild and domestic silkworms with the aim of obtaining useful information for understanding the biosynthesis and secretion of the silk proteins. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>To help understand protein synthesis and development in the silk gland, DEGs in domestic versus wild silkworms were identified (Additional file 6: Table S4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>We characterized 32 DEGs, 16 of which were up-regulated in domestic silkworms (Figure 4A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>We manually annotated the functions of these 16 DEGs, and found that some of them were related to tissue development, excretion of proteins, and metabolism (Table 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>For example, we predicted that Novel01049 might encode an ubiquitin-activating enzyme that could initiate the ubiquitination of proteins [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Ubiquitination is an essential process that regulates the turnover of proteins for basic cellular processes such as the cell cycle and cell death [30]. BGIBMGA013477 was predicted to encode synaptic vesicle protein 2B (SV2B), which is a vesicle protein present in the secretory vesicles and is an important regulator of Ca2+-stimulated vesicle exocytosis [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Secretory vesicles have also been found in the silk gland of the domestic silkworm [36]. BGIBMGA013477 (SV2B) was up-regulated more than 256-fold in D_CH and 46-fold in D_CY compared with its expression in the wild silkworms (Figure 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>SV2B might mediate the release of neurotransmitter and regulate secretion of silk proteins in the silk gland. BGIBMGA009572 was predicted to encode translocase subunit secA, which might play role in pushing substrates forward like a “motor” [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>The Sec translocase pathway is ubiquitous and is responsible for the vast majority of protein export activities [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Thus, the up-regulated DEGs in silk glands of the domestic silkworms might be associated with the highly efficient biosynthesis and secretion of the silk proteins. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Fibroins have been found to be the major components (75%) of silk threads [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we found that the Fib-H, Fib-L, and P25 were extremely highly expressed and showed similar expression levels in both the domestic and wild silkworms (Additional file 3: Table S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Initially, it was difficult to understand the obvious differences in silk production between domestic and wild silkworms; however, by combining our results with previously reported findings, we propose two possible explanations for this anomaly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>In the transcriptome analysis, we concentrated only on protein-coding genes, while it has been reported that microRNAs (miRNAs) may play regulatory functions in the silk protein synthesis [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>MiRNAs play important roles in a broad range of biological processes, including down-regulating the translation of target genes to proteins [38], inhibiting translation initiation, and mediating mRNA decay [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>A total of 1,229 miRNAs have been identified in the PSGs in fifth-instar larvae of the silkworm using next-generation sequencing and microarray assay [37] and the fibroin encoding genes Fib-H, Fib-L, and P25 have been reported to be the targets of some miRNAs [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Because we found that the expression levels of the fibroin genes were similar in domestic and wild silkworms, we propose that miRNAs might be involved in the down-regulation of fibroin synthesis in the wild silkworms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Another possible explanation is, because silk fibroins are synthesized in PSG cells then secreted into the PSG lumen and aggregated in the MSG [40], if the synthesized silk proteins are not secreted rapidly, their biosynthesis might be inhibited by the accumulated silk proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>In the domestic silkworms, the up-regulated genes related to secretion (Table 3) might promote the secretion of silk proteins for the continued synthesis of new proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Thus, highly efficient biosynthesis and secretion may be associated with higher silk production in the domestic silkworms. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Sixteen up-regulated DEGs were found in the wild silkworms compared with the domestic silkworms; seven of them were related to the GO term “oxidoreductase activity” (Additional file 7: Table S5) and a further six were related to immune response or detoxification (Table 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>For example, laccase (BGIBMGA006745) and dopa decarboxylase (BGIBMGA002958) take part in the melanization cascade, which has been proposed to play roles in the immune response of insects [23,27,41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>In B. mori, serine protease inhibitor 16 (Novel01220) may be involved in resistance to pathogenic microorganisms [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>In Manduca sexta, laccase may play an important role in the oxidation of toxic compounds in the diet [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, BGIBMGA009199 is thought to be associated with domestication [2], and we found that it was up-regulated more than 46-fold in the wild silkworms (Figure 6; Additional file 8: Table S6). BGIBMGA009199 encodes an organic cation transporter, which might mediate the transport of a variety of endogenous compounds and numerous drugs and xenobiotics [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Wild silkworms live in a more natural niche than domestic silkworms and therefore are likely to encounter more xenobiotics and pathogenic microorganisms than domestic silkworms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Thus, the up-regulated DEGs in the wild silkworms may play important roles in dealing with xenobitics and pathogens in the natural environment. </plain></SENT>
