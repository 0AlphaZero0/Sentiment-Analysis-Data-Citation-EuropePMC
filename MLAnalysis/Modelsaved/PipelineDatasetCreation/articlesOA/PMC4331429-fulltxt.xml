We investigated the differential expression of miRNAs between ALK+ ALCL, ALK- ALCL cells and normal T-cells using next generation sequencing (NGS). In addition, a C/EBP&#946;-dependent miRNA profile was generated. The data were validated in primary ALCL cases. NGS identified 106 miRNAs significantly differentially expressed between ALK+ and ALK- ALCL and 228 between ALK+ ALCL and normal T-cells. We identified a signature of 56 miRNAs distinguishing ALK+ ALCL, ALK- ALCL and T-cells. The top candidates significant differentially expressed between ALK+ and ALK- ALCL included 5 upregulated miRNAs: miR-340, miR-203, miR-135b, miR-182, miR-183; and 7 downregulated: miR-196b, miR-155, miR-146a, miR-424, miR-503, miR-424*, miR-542-3p. The miR-17-92 cluster was also upregulated in ALK+ cells. Additionally, we identified a signature of 3 miRNAs significantly regulated by the transcription factor C/EBP&#946;, which is specifically overexpressed in ALK+ ALCL, including the miR-181 family. Of interest, miR-181a, which regulates T-cell differentiation and modulates TCR signalling strength, was significantly downregulated in ALK+ ALCL cases. In summary, our data reveal a miRNA signature linking ALK+ ALCL to a deregulated immune response and may reflect the abnormal TCR antigen expression known in ALK+ ALCL.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the SFB 685 &#8220;Immunotherapy&#8221; of the University of T&#252;bingen, TP B8 (LQM and FF, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sfb685.de/">http://www.sfb685.de/</ext-link>) and by the IZKF fort&#252;ne program (1924-0-0), University of T&#252;bingen (IB, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/Forschung/Forschungsf%C3%B6rderung/Interne+Forschungsf%C3%B6rderung/fort%C3%BCne.html">https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/Forschung/Forschungsf%C3%B6rderung/Interne+Forschungsf%C3%B6rderung/fort%C3%BCne.html</ext-link>).

Merkel et al. [<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] demonstrated that members of the miR-17-92 cluster, which have been associated with inhibition of apoptosis, promotion of proliferation and induction of tumor angiogenesis are highly expressed in ALK+ ALCL, whereas miR-155, which is involved in the immune response and has oncogenic potential, was expressed at higher levels in ALK- ALCL. Using a high throughput TaqMan quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) approach in primary ALCL cases, Liu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] corroborated the high expression of the miR-17-92 cluster in ALK+ ALCL and found a signature of 7 additional miRNAs that could help to distinguish ALK+ from ALK- ALCL cases (5 upregulated: miR-512-3p, miR-886-5p, miR-886-3p, miR-708, miR-135b; 2 downregulated: miR-146a, miR-155). Interestingly, the miRNA signature of ALK-ALCL was found to have a different profile compared with peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL), not otherwise specified (NOS), and to partially overlap with the miRNA expression prolife of ALK+ ALCL, suggesting that the pathogenesis of ALK- ALCL is closer to ALK+ ALCL than to PTCL, NOS.</p><p>The so far reported posttranscriptional regulation potential of C/EBP&#946; in several systems raised the question to which extent C/EBP&#946; controls miRNA expression in ALK+ ALCL cells. Thus the aim of this study was to analyze the differential expression of miRNAs between ALK+ and ALK- ALCLs and ALK+ and normal T-cells, respectively, using next generation sequencing (NGS), and to generate in addition, a C/EBP&#946;-dependent miRNA profile. Our data reveal a signature that may link ALK+ ALCL to a deregulated immune response and may in part be responsible for the abnormal TCR antigen expression known in ALK+ ALCL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Cell culture, virus production, viral infections and patient samples</title><p>The four ALK+ ALCL cell lines (SUDHL-1, KiJK, Karpas 299 and SR-786) and the ALK- ALCL cell line (Mac-1) were cultured as recently described [<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

In the current study, in order to identify the miRNAs specifically expressed in ALK+ ALCL, and possibly regulated by C/EBP&#946;, we performed miRNA NGS of ALK+ and ALK- cell lines, normal T cells and ALK+ ALCL cell lines after C/EBP&#946; silencing. PCA analysis of the sequencing data confirmed characteristic patterns among samples of different entities and with downregulated C/EBP&#946; expression, confirming the use of this approach to characterize the miRNA expression pattern in ALCL. We show that the miRNA signature of ALK- ALCL has a different profile compared with normal T cells, and to partially overlap with the miRNA expression prolife of ALK+ ALCL, indicating that the two ALCL subgroups are closely related.</p><p>Processing of NGS data generated miRNA expression profiles and identified 228 and 106 miRNAs significantly differentially expressed between ALK+ ALCL and T cells or ALK+ ALCL and ALK- ALCL cells, respectively.

These data provided a signature of 56 miRNAs with a specific expression profile characteristic for ALK+ and ALK- ALCLs and T cells. A striking hundred-fold change in expression levels was observed for some miRNAs of the different signatures, which may contribute to certain characteristics of these diseases. Thirteen miRNAs with high differences in expression levels between ALK+, ALK- ALCL and T cells provide a limited, probably biologically relevant miRNA profile for ALK+ ALCLs (<xref rid="pone.0117780.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p><p>Comparison of our data with two previously published miRNA profiles of ALK+ ALCL provided further validation of our results [<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Not surprisingly, using NGS we found more significantly differentially expressed miRNAs between the different entities than it was feasible using miRNA arrays [<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] or a high throughput TaqMan quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) approach [<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although there are considerable differences mainly due to the technical approach and material used (cell lines versus primary cases), our miRNA signature shows overlapping results with 26 miRNAs identified by Merkel et al. [<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and Liu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] (<xref rid="pone.0117780.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). Of these, nine miRNAs were found regulated or preferentially associated with ALK+ ALCL in all three studies (miR-106a, miR-20b, miR-363, miR-17, miR-93, miR-101, miR-20a, miR-146a and miR-155). The overlapping detection of deregulated miRNAs in the different studies indicates that at least some of them most probably contribute to ALK mediated oncogenesis and/or tumor biology. The low expression of miR-146a and miR-155, both on the top of the list of differentially expressed miRNAs in our study, as a constant feature in ALK+ ALCL, is intriguing because evidence suggests that these two miRNAs may have crucial roles in regulating the innate immune response and that the putative targets of both miRNAs are components of the toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling machinery [<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>miR-146a is a member of the miR-146 miRNA family consisting of two evolutionary conserved miRNA genes; <italic>miR-146a</italic> and <italic>miR-146b</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. They share the same seed sequence but are encoded by different loci in the genome. miR-146a expression occurs in an NF-&#954;B (nuclear factor &#954;B) dependent manner in response to LPS (Lipopolysaccharides). Recent studies have suggested that miR-146a acts as a negative feedback regulator of the innate immune response by targeting two adapter proteins TNF-receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) that are crucial for proinflammatory signaling and activation of NF-&#954;B [<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In contrast, lack of miR-146a expression results in exaggerated inflammatory response and spontaneous autoimmune disorders [<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Aging miR-146a deficient mice developed myeloid sarcomas and lymphomas associated with chronic NF-&#954;B activation, which suggests that miR-146a may also function as a tumor suppressor gene. The excessive inflammation seen in these mice argues in favor of a connection between chronic inflammation and cancer. Most interesting is the fact that miR-146a expression might be involved in cell fate determination in T cells because its expression is associated with T cell expansion and a T-helper (Th) 1 phenotype with strong TCR stimulation, and low expression induces a Th2 differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Furthermore, miR-155 deficient mice, in addition to having a defect in the germinal center reaction, show a skewing of their T cells toward Th2 differentiation with low production of interferon &#947; [<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Accordingly, our analysis of the cytokine expression in cell lines (data not shown) demonstrated that ALK+ ALCL cells are characterized by very high expression of IL-10 with very low expression of interferon &#947;. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the low expression of miR-146a and miR-155 might influence the unique immunophenotype of the ALK+ ALCL tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment [<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].

[<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], was recently confirmed to be differentially expressed between ALK+ and ALK- ALCL [<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. miR-26a, miR-29c and miR-150 are interesting candidates because of their very low expression in ALK+ ALCL, as compared to normal T cells. The downregulation of all three miRNAs have been found to promote proliferation and favor migration and metastasis [<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. miR-150 is important for the differentiation of T cells and has been suggested to act as a tumor suppressor in T-cell lymphomas [<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. miR-29c is one of the four members of the miR-29 family, which has been reported to contribute to several cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell proliferation, extracellular matrix regulation, differentiation and immune response [<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. We confirmed also the down-regulation of miR-29a in ALK+ ALCL cell lines, which was recently shown to upregulate the antiapoptotic protein MCL1 contributing to tumor cell survival [<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Interestingly miR-29a and miR-29c were significantly up-regulated after C/EBP&#946; knockdown, indicating that they are not only regulated downstream of ALK but also downstream of C/EBP&#946;.</p><p>Accordingly, another major aim of this study was to investigate which of the miRNAs differentially expressed in ALK+ ALCL might be direct or indirect targets of the transcription factor C/EBP&#946;. C/EBP&#946; has been shown to influence the expression of miRNAs by activation or inhibition of miRNA transcription. Fittingly, we found 80 miRNAs significantly regulated by C/EBP&#946; in the investigated ALK+ ALCL cell lines. Four miRNAs (miR-181a*, miR-181a, miR-146b-5p and miR-203) were validated in all three ALK+ ALCL cell lines but only three of them were found to be differentially expressed in ALK+ ALCL primary cases (miR-181a*, miR-181a, miR-203). Of special interest is the downregulation of the miR-181 family members by C/EBP&#946;. C/EBP&#946; is a key transcription factor regulating monocytic gene expression and thereby involved in the innate immune response [<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In contrast, miR-181a is involved in the regulation of the adaptive immune response. miR-181a regulates T cell differentiation and influences T cell sensitivity to antigens by modulating TCR signalling strength controlling the expression of multiple phosphatases in the TCR signalling pathway. Decreased expression of miR-181a blocks T-cell differentiation and results in hyporesponsiveness to TCR signalling and decrease in sensitivity to antigens [<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In a recent study, it was demonstrated that downregulation of miR-181a was extremely relevant to HTLV1 biology, and an important strategy of the virus to dampen TCR signalling and T-cell activation to persist in the host [<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Similarly miR-181c was found to be downregulated by Hepatitis C virus (HCV) in chronic liver disease by modulating the expression of C/EBP&#946; [<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Accordingly, the previously demonstrated lack of TCR signaling in ALCL [<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] might result from the decreased expression of miR-181a/miR-181a* in ALK+ ALCL and provide a mechanism to evade immune surveillance. The low expression level of several miRNAs in ALK+ ALCL compared to the high expression level in normal T cells could be the reflection of the abnormal TCR signaling in ALCL.</p><p>Another interesting direct target of C/EBP&#946; was miR-203, which was significantly upregulated in all three ALK+ ALCL cell lines. miR-203 is not expressed in normal T cells [<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] and was not expressed in the ALK- ALCL cell line Mac-1 in our study. Although its function remains elusive, miR-203 seems to have also a role in the immune response through regulation of the <underline>S</underline>uppressor of <underline>C</underline>ytokine <underline>S</underline>ignaling-3 (SOCS-3) [<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p><p>In summary, using NGS we were able to identify miRNA expression profiles distinguishing ALK+, ALK- ALCL and normal T cells. We found that miRNAs involved in the differentiation and regulation of T cells of both the innate and adaptive immune response and inflammation are profoundly deregulated in ALK+ ALCL cell lines and primary cases (<xref rid="pone.0117780.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Not surprisingly given the central role of C/EBP&#946; in the innate immune response, some of these miRNAs were found to be direct C/EBP&#946; targets. The deregulation of miR-181a together with miR-155, miR-150 and miR-146a might explain the lack of TCR signaling in ALCL cells. The potential role of miRNAs in the modulation of tumor immunophenotype and microenvironment offers an exciting hypothesis to understand the biology of ALK+ ALCL.</p><fig id="pone.0117780.g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0117780.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>Deregulated miRNAs involved in the immune response in ALK+ALCL.</title><p>MiRNAs with known functions in the immune response [<xref rid="pone.0117780.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] and deregulated in ALK+ ALCLs in our study are shown (red: downregulated miRNAs in ALK+ ALCL, green: upregulated miRNAs in ALK+ ALCL).
