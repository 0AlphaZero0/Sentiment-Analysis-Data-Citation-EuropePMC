</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) represents a distinct group of T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, which are separated according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification [1] into two different disease entities based on the presence or absence of a chromosomal translocation involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>ALK+ ALCL is characterized, in most cases, by the t(2;5)(p23;q35) chromosomal translocation involving the nucleophosmin (NPM) and the ALK gene, resulting in the expression and constitutive activation of chimeric ALK fusion protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The oncogenic NPM-ALK with its transforming ability activates several downstream signaling pathways, mainly RAS/MAPK, PLCγ, PI3K and JAK/STAT pathways, which participate in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival [2,3,4,5,6,7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>One central downstream target of ALK is the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPβ) [8,9,10,11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>C/EBPβ is involved in a number of cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation, inflammatory responses and metabolism [12,13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Moreover it has been associated with tumorigenesis in solid tumors [14,15] and plays an important role in ALK+ ALCL oncogenesis [8,10,16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>We recently reported that C/EBPβ in ALK+ ALCL mediates important functions such as cell proliferation and survival by transcriptional activation of its target genes [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Besides its functions in transcriptional gene regulation, C/EBPβ is able to regulate target gene expression also posttranscriptionally via miRNA induction [17,18,19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>miRNAs are a noncoding class of 17–24 base single-stranded RNA molecules that are able to posttranscriptionally regulate their target genes by either mRNA degradation or translational repression, and have become a major focus of research in molecular biology [20,21,22,23,24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>miRNAs are involved in many important biological processes including the immune response, different stages of hematopoietic development, and the regulation of cellular differentiation and apoptosis [25,26,27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Deregulated miRNAs are able to drive oncogenesis acting either as tumor suppressors or oncogenes [28]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Two recent studies have aimed to characterize the miRNA signature associated with ALCL to identify new downstream effectors of the ALK oncogenic pathway [29,30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Merkel et al. [29] demonstrated that members of the miR-17-92 cluster, which have been associated with inhibition of apoptosis, promotion of proliferation and induction of tumor angiogenesis are highly expressed in ALK+ ALCL, whereas miR-155, which is involved in the immune response and has oncogenic potential, was expressed at higher levels in ALK- ALCL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Using a high throughput TaqMan quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) approach in primary ALCL cases, Liu et al. [31] corroborated the high expression of the miR-17-92 cluster in ALK+ ALCL and found a signature of 7 additional miRNAs that could help to distinguish ALK+ from ALK- ALCL cases (5 upregulated: miR-512-3p, miR-886-5p, miR-886-3p, miR-708, miR-135b; 2 downregulated: miR-146a, miR-155). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the miRNA signature of ALK-ALCL was found to have a different profile compared with peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL), not otherwise specified (NOS), and to partially overlap with the miRNA expression prolife of ALK+ ALCL, suggesting that the pathogenesis of ALK- ALCL is closer to ALK+ ALCL than to PTCL, NOS. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The so far reported posttranscriptional regulation potential of C/EBPβ in several systems raised the question to which extent C/EBPβ controls miRNA expression in ALK+ ALCL cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Thus the aim of this study was to analyze the differential expression of miRNAs between ALK+ and ALK- ALCLs and ALK+ and normal T-cells, respectively, using next generation sequencing (NGS), and to generate in addition, a C/EBPβ-dependent miRNA profile. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Our data reveal a signature that may link ALK+ ALCL to a deregulated immune response and may in part be responsible for the abnormal TCR antigen expression known in ALK+ ALCL. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>They share the same seed sequence but are encoded by different loci in the genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>miR-146a expression occurs in an NF-κB (nuclear factor κB) dependent manner in response to LPS (Lipopolysaccharides). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have suggested that miR-146a acts as a negative feedback regulator of the innate immune response by targeting two adapter proteins TNF-receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) that are crucial for proinflammatory signaling and activation of NF-κB [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>In contrast, lack of miR-146a expression results in exaggerated inflammatory response and spontaneous autoimmune disorders [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Aging miR-146a deficient mice developed myeloid sarcomas and lymphomas associated with chronic NF-κB activation, which suggests that miR-146a may also function as a tumor suppressor gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>The excessive inflammation seen in these mice argues in favor of a connection between chronic inflammation and cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Most interesting is the fact that miR-146a expression might be involved in cell fate determination in T cells because its expression is associated with T cell expansion and a T-helper (Th) 1 phenotype with strong TCR stimulation, and low expression induces a Th2 differentiation [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, miR-155 deficient mice, in addition to having a defect in the germinal center reaction, show a skewing of their T cells toward Th2 differentiation with low production of interferon γ [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, our analysis of the cytokine expression in cell lines (data not shown) demonstrated that ALK+ ALCL cells are characterized by very high expression of IL-10 with very low expression of interferon γ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the low expression of miR-146a and miR-155 might influence the unique immunophenotype of the ALK+ ALCL tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, miR-135b, which was one of the most strongly ALK-upregulated miRNAs in our study and in the study of Liu et al. [31], was recently confirmed to be differentially expressed between ALK+ and ALK- ALCL [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>miR-26a, miR-29c and miR-150 are interesting candidates because of their very low expression in ALK+ ALCL, as compared to normal T cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>The downregulation of all three miRNAs have been found to promote proliferation and favor migration and metastasis [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>miR-150 is important for the differentiation of T cells and has been suggested to act as a tumor suppressor in T-cell lymphomas [53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>miR-29c is one of the four members of the miR-29 family, which has been reported to contribute to several cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell proliferation, extracellular matrix regulation, differentiation and immune response [54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>We confirmed also the down-regulation of miR-29a in ALK+ ALCL cell lines, which was recently shown to upregulate the antiapoptotic protein MCL1 contributing to tumor cell survival [29,55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Interestingly miR-29a and miR-29c were significantly up-regulated after C/EBPβ knockdown, indicating that they are not only regulated downstream of ALK but also downstream of C/EBPβ. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, another major aim of this study was to investigate which of the miRNAs differentially expressed in ALK+ ALCL might be direct or indirect targets of the transcription factor C/EBPβ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>C/EBPβ has been shown to influence the expression of miRNAs by activation or inhibition of miRNA transcription. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Fittingly, we found 80 miRNAs significantly regulated by C/EBPβ in the investigated ALK+ ALCL cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Four miRNAs (miR-181a*, miR-181a, miR-146b-5p and miR-203) were validated in all three ALK+ ALCL cell lines but only three of them were found to be differentially expressed in ALK+ ALCL primary cases (miR-181a*, miR-181a, miR-203). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Of special interest is the downregulation of the miR-181 family members by C/EBPβ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>C/EBPβ is a key transcription factor regulating monocytic gene expression and thereby involved in the innate immune response [56]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>In contrast, miR-181a is involved in the regulation of the adaptive immune response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>miR-181a regulates T cell differentiation and influences T cell sensitivity to antigens by modulating TCR signalling strength controlling the expression of multiple phosphatases in the TCR signalling pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Decreased expression of miR-181a blocks T-cell differentiation and results in hyporesponsiveness to TCR signalling and decrease in sensitivity to antigens [57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>In a recent study, it was demonstrated that downregulation of miR-181a was extremely relevant to HTLV1 biology, and an important strategy of the virus to dampen TCR signalling and T-cell activation to persist in the host [58]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>Similarly miR-181c was found to be downregulated by Hepatitis C virus (HCV) in chronic liver disease by modulating the expression of C/EBPβ [59]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the previously demonstrated lack of TCR signaling in ALCL [50] might result from the decreased expression of miR-181a/miR-181a* in ALK+ ALCL and provide a mechanism to evade immune surveillance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>The low expression level of several miRNAs in ALK+ ALCL compared to the high expression level in normal T cells could be the reflection of the abnormal TCR signaling in ALCL. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Another interesting direct target of C/EBPβ was miR-203, which was significantly upregulated in all three ALK+ ALCL cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>miR-203 is not expressed in normal T cells [60,61] and was not expressed in the ALK- ALCL cell line Mac-1 in our study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Although its function remains elusive, miR-203 seems to have also a role in the immune response through regulation of the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling-3 (SOCS-3) [60]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>In summary, using NGS we were able to identify miRNA expression profiles distinguishing ALK+, ALK- ALCL and normal T cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>We found that miRNAs involved in the differentiation and regulation of T cells of both the innate and adaptive immune response and inflammation are profoundly deregulated in ALK+ ALCL cell lines and primary cases (Fig. 7) [62]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Not surprisingly given the central role of C/EBPβ in the innate immune response, some of these miRNAs were found to be direct C/EBPβ targets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>The deregulation of miR-181a together with miR-155, miR-150 and miR-146a might explain the lack of TCR signaling in ALCL cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>The potential role of miRNAs in the modulation of tumor immunophenotype and microenvironment offers an exciting hypothesis to understand the biology of ALK+ ALCL. </plain></SENT>
