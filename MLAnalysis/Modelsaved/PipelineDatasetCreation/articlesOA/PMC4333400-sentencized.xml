</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Toxin–antitoxin (TA) systems are ubiquitous on bacterial chromosomes and bacterial plasmids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Depending on the nature of the antitoxin and the mechanism by which it neutralizes the toxin, TA modules can be categorized into five distinct types (1–8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Type II TA systems, where both toxin and antitoxin are proteins, are the most common. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Their expression is regulated at the level of transcription through the antitoxin, which acts as a repressor, the activity of which is modulated by the toxin (9–12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Multiple roles have been suggested for TA modules ranging from plasmid stabilization (13–16) to altruistic suicide (17,18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Recent reports indicate that TA modules are associated with generation of nondividing but viable persister cells (19–21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Modulation of the persister state requires entangled molecular mechanisms that link protein activity to transcription regulation via the intrinsically disordered nature of the antitoxin C-terminal domain (22). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The mazEF operon was the first TA system found on the Escherichia coli chromosome (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>It is related to the kis/kid module on plasmid R1 (1,23), and it is homologous to the E. coli chromosomal TA module chpBIK (24). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The mazEF operons encode a long-lived ribonuclease MazF, which cleaves mRNAs at specific sites (25). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In addition, MazF targets the 16S rRNA within the E. coli 30S ribosomal subunit at the decoding center, thereby removing 43 nucleotides from the 3′-terminus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The resulting truncated ribosomes preferentially translate the subset of leaderless mRNAs (26). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The activity of the MazF toxin is neutralized by the short-lived antitoxin MazE, which is degraded by the ClpPA serine protease (17). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>MazE proteins consist of two domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The N-terminal domain has a DNA binding function and adopts a swapped-hairpin β-strand motif, typically of the AbrB/MazE/MraZ superfamily (27,28). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>This fold is common among bacterial transcription regulators and is found e.g. in the transition state regulator Abh (29) and the transcription regulator SpoVT (30,31). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>X-Ray diffraction studies have shown that the C-terminal domain of MazE is intrinsically disordered and upon binding to MazF adopts a unique and mostly extended conformation (27,32). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The MazE binding to MazF stabilizes and protects its own vulnerable C-terminus from specific protease's cleavage, by which the TA system would be induced, leading to antitoxin degradation and toxin activation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The E. coli mazEF operon contains a 47-bp operator region that contains three binding sites for the MazE dimer (‘cab’) (27,33,34). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>These sites are termed ‘c’, ‘a’ and ‘b’ when moving downstream toward the mazE start codon. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Of these, only site ‘a’ contains the perfect palindrome 5′-ATATAT-3′, a hallmark of TA operator sequences (35). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The details of the interaction between E. coli MazE and its operator DNA are not known yet and two distinct models were proposed based on the crystal structures of a EcMazEF complex (32) and a complex between EcMazE and a dromedary heavy chain antibody fragment (27,34). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>DNA binding by MazE/MazF complexes is thought to be primarily due to the antitoxin, with the toxin serving to enhance binding affinity (33). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In this work we studied in detail the structural and (thermo-)dynamic features of E. coli MazE binding to the ‘a’ site DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>We show that the N-terminal domain of the E. coli MazE (EcMazE1–50) is solely involved in DNA binding, excluding any participation of the disordered C-terminus in DNA interaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>We confirm that the functional role of the intrinsically disordered region is purely related to toxin neutralization, which is essential for transcription regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Moreover, EcMazF cooperatively increases the EcMazE-DNA affinity on the single palindrome suggesting how the toxin/antitoxin molar ratio can control the self-regulation of the TA locus transcription. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>As expected, a comparison of these parameters for EcMazE1–50-DNA and full-length EcMazE-DNA, respectively, indicates that there is a substantial difference in terms of size between both scattering particles (Rg 25 Å versus 30 Å, and Dmax 71 Å versus 91 Å; see also Figure 7C). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>None of the two normalized Kratky return to zero, indicating the presence of highly flexible regions in the scattering particle mainly due to the His-tag in both complexes and increased flexibility is even more present in the full-length EcMazE–DNA ‘a’ complex due to the extended disordered C-terminal tails, missing in the EcMazE1–50–DNA ‘a’ complex. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>The E. coli mazEF operon was the first TA module that was identified on a chromosome (33) and remains one of the best characterized TA modules in terms of biochemical and physiological functions of the toxin. E. coli mazEF is autoregulated with MazE being the primary transcription factor and MazF modulating its activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>The mazEF operator consists of three consecutive independent MazE binding sites that differ in affinity up to one order of magnitude. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>Our binding data thus improve the model of three non-interacting, quasi-equivalent binding sites published earlier (34). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>Three EcMazE dimers bind at the promoter ‘cab’ sequence with apparent binding constants in the micromolar range and favorable enthalpic components dominating the Gibbs free energy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>The interaction is specific and the presence of the intrinsically disordered EcMazF-neutralizing tail does not significantly influences the affinity of the protein for either a single site or the complete operator (34). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>We determined an accurate structural model of the EcMazE–DNA complex using a combination of NMR and SAXS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>This structure is in agreement with previous mutagenesis data and confirms that the C-terminal tail of EcMazE remains disordered and is not directly involved in DNA-binding upon interaction between the N-terminal EcMazE domain with DNA. EcMazE binds into the major groove of double-stranded DNA ‘a’, involving side-chains of residues W9, N11, R16 for the main interactions with the oligonucleotide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the R16A mutant is essentially inactive (27). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>In addition we could identify further electrostatic interactions that likely participate in stabilizing the EcMazE–DNA complex, in particular between the positive-charged residues K7 and R8 and the DNA backbone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>K7 and R8 were previously pointed as the primary DNA anchors for the MazE/MazF heterocomplex (32) while the R8A mutant shows reduced binding to the operator (27). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>Moreover, superposition of our EcMazE–DNA complex on the complex between EcMazE and a dromedary heavy chain antibody fragment indicates no structural clash (Supplementary Figure S8B) and thus confirms the correctness of our structural model as the presence of the heavy chain antibody fragment was shown to have no effect on the DNA-binding properties of MazE (27). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>Our structural model resembles strongly the structure of Rickettsia felis VapB2 (RfVapB2) in complex with its operator. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>While cataloged as a ‘VapB’ due to its association with a VapC toxin, this antitoxin contains an AbrB-type DNA binding domain similar to EcMazE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, RfVapB2 recognizes the same palindrome as EcMazE (5′-ATATAT-3′) using identical interactions with the N-terminal β-strand and hairpin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>Interactions differ nevertheless at the periphery of the combining site, where the structures of both proteins diverge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>There alternative contacts are seen, such as the backbone NH of A19 in EcMazE mimicking the interaction of the side chain of K19 from R. felis VapB with a DNA backbone phosphate. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="343" pm="."><plain>The presence of EcMazF influences operator recognition by EcMazE (33). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>MazF proteins structurally resemble CcdB proteins and have a similar binding site for their cognate antitoxin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>The antitoxins and toxins from both ccdAB and mazEF modules form chains of alternating toxin and antitoxin dimers (60,61). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>The F-plasmid ccdAB operon also contains an operator with multiple sites for the antitoxin, and the enhanced affinity of CcdA for its operator in the presence of CcdB is believed to stem from an avidity effect (10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>Native mass spectrometry data on the Kis/Kid module (36), a homolog of E. coli MazEF, support a similar model of regulation within the mazEF modules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>We observed, however, that MazF can increase the affinity of MazE even for a single operator site where no avidity effects are present. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>This is unexpected, but can be explained by either direct interactions between EcMazF and DNA or by thermodynamic stabilization of the N-terminal domain of EcMazE through interaction with MazF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>Such stabilization-induced affinity enhancement was previously observed in the phd/doc module (9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>Superposition of our EcMazE–DNA complex on the crystal structure of the EcMazE–EcMazF complex (32) (Supplementary Figure S8C) indicates additional protein–DNA interaction via the flanking basic regions of the EcMazF homodimer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="352" pm="."><plain>This favors a model where the enhancement in DNA binding by EcMazF is caused by co-operative binding of the antitoxin and toxin to the DNA instead of an allosteric effect. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="353" pm="."><plain>At very high EcMazF to EcMazE ratios, the affinity of MazE for the ‘a’ operator site diminishes again. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="354" pm="."><plain>This resembles the conditional co-operativity phenomenon previously observed for the ccdAB, phd/doc and relBE modules (9–12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="355" pm="."><plain>The phenomenon however occurs only at EcMazF to EcMazE ratios that are never attained in vivo, and its physiological relevance is thus uncertain. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="377" pm="."><plain>Both PaChpR and Gv possess the key and additional residues for DNA binding as in EcMazE and are thus predicted to have the same DNA-recognition site as the other members of this family. </plain></SENT>
