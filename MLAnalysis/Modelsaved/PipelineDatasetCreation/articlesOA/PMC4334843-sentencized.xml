</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Anopheles (Kerteszia) cruzii is a neotropical mosquito that employs the bromeliad phytotelmata as a larval habitat. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Females blood-feed on humans as well as on other mammals and birds [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>This mosquito occurs in natural forest ecosystems [2,3] and forest fragments [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In spite of its occurrence in forest ecosystems impacted by human activities, An. cruzii is mainly a sylvatic species with a low synanthropy index [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>This mosquito can feed on blood during the day and at night; however, its activity peaks in twilight periods [6-9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>It is a primary vector of Plasmodium spp. parasites in areas within the Atlantic Forest biome in Brazil, especially in the States of São Paulo, Paraná, and Santa Catarina [2,10,11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Individuals of An. cruzii were found naturally infected with Plasmodium spp. oocysts in the intestine and sporozoites in the salivary glands [12-15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In rural areas of the Juquitiba and São Vicente municipalities, eastern Sao Paulo state, An. cruzii was infected with Plasmodium vivax (0.149%), Plasmodium vivax strain VK247 (0.086%), and either Plasmodium brasilianum or Plasmodium malariae [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of these species was positively associated with maintenance of transmission of human Plasmodium in the Atlantic Forest in the states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro [14] in cycles that involve humans, Alouatta, and Cebus primates [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The infective biting rate was low in areas in which infected An. cruzii were found; however, the abundance of the mosquito and voracious blood-feeding behaviour maintain the endemic circulation of human Plasmodium in some areas within the Atlantic Forest domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, An. cruzii is a vector of Plasmodium simium and Plasmodium brasilianum, which cause simian malaria [16,17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The coastal region of the Atlantic Forest shelters primate species that can be infected by P. simium and P. brasilianum; these parasites can be occasionally transmitted to humans by infective Kerteszia bites [17,18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In an ecological study conducted in the municipality of Cananéia as biological markers and sampled individuals of An. cruzii from in Sao Paulo state, Marques et al. [19] found that An. cruzii is heterogeneously distributed across different altitudes in the Atlantic Forest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The authors assessed the distribution of An. cruzii in three microenvironments, which were grouped based on altitude (lowland: 5–20 m, hill slope: 33–54 m, and hilltop: 81–263 m altitude). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was monthly for one year; results showed that this species occurred more densely in the hilltop, presumably due to ecological preferences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>We then hypothesised that gene flow is not homogeneously distributed across the altitude range and sought to determine the transience of this scenario. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine 1) if individuals of Anopheles cruzii from lowland and hilltop are morphogenetically similar and 2) if the biological variability of An. cruzii is stable over time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>To address these questions, we used wing geometry and CO-I mitochondrial DNA sequences as biological markers and sampled individuals of An. cruzii from Cananéia municipality from 2009–2013. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>The An. cruzii hilltop and lowland populations showed a pattern of wing divergence between all sampled sets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>The minimum ground distance between these micro-regions is approximately 470 m, so the mosquitoes could fly between them [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Apparently, there are other ecological reasons that prevent them from freely circulating between altitudes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>The preference for specific biotopes and bromeliads within each microenvironment may differ in each population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>The micro-environmental context may influence behavior, genetic drift, natural selection and indirectly drive genotype and phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis was also discussed in a study case conducted in the same locality: Marques et al. [19] found that the volume of water in lowland bromeliads is significantly higher than in hilltop plants; this could be a determining factor in the preferences of each population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>The landscapes of hilltop and lowland also differ in other respects: the levels of sunlight, vegetation cover, relative humidity, and resident plant species may influence the preference of anopheline populations and, thus, their differentiation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Veloso [48] observed that the species is indifferent to special microclimates, being found in large quantity in various types of biotopes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>If the individuals were under selective pressure, as has already been observed in other species of culicids, there would be a tendency to reduce the intraspecific variability of this characteristic [49]; this was not observed in our study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>However, the separation of groups by wing shape indicates a divergence within the species An. cruzii. Micro-environmental variation might affect wing shape, and this interference can be related to flight performance in Culicidae [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>In Drosophila, numerous genes control natural variation in wing shape [51], and the development of shape requires a cascade of genes that act throughout development; this may explain why changes in wing shape are sensitive to a variety of environmental stressors [52] and that minor perturbations during development can lead to large changes in shape [53]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Although wing shape varied over time, altitudinal structure and sexual wing dimorphism were maintained. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Despite its dynamic and rich variability, wings are evolutionarily informative and appear to be canalized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>The morphological variation differential for each sex can be the result of different selective pressures that can shape the wings as part of their adaptations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Models by Lande [54] and Lande and Arnold [55] assume that the genetic basis for sexual dimorphism is polygenic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Males and females have different ecological roles in the environment and use their wings differently; this could motivate sex-specific natural selection [56]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>The comparison of wing shape consensus after Procrustes superimposition revealed that the most influential landmark in the majority of populations was landmark #9, localized in the wing border. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>It seems that this anatomical mark is important in sexual dimorphism of this species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>According to Dujardin [30], the landmarks are differentially affected by the same displacement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>The posterior border of the wing moved in opposite ways, depending on the external stimulus [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>In terms of allometry, the contribution of size to the shape variation was statistically significant for most populations; however, the elimination of allometry before CVA allowed us to say that the observed variation probably is not due to plasticity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>In this study, we found a very high number of haplotypes for each microenvironment sampled, only two of which were shared between lowland and hilltop insects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>The nucleotide diversity was also high, indicating that the analysed fragment of CO-I is extremely polymorphic in An. cruzii. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>The large number of haplotypes found differs from other studies of the anopheline CO-I gene [57,58]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>The high frequency of transitions in the third codon position indicates that the analysed groups diverged recently [59]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>There have been no published population-based studies of mtDNA in An. cruzii [60]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>The large quantity of haplotypes found in micro-environmental comparisons may reflect the proximity to the centre of origin of this species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>The distribution of An. cruzii is restricted to South America [3]; thus, its centre of origin is also located in this region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>In general, older populations have a higher diversity than younger populations [61,62]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Comparing the values of genetic diversity (ΦST) with those of morphological diversity (Qst), we noted that Qst of shape and size, were higher. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>This reveals a greater degree of evolution in the wing than in the CO-I gene; therefore, these markers evolve at different rates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>If the markers were neutral they should converge to the same value [30], which is not the case here. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>In An. cruzii, the CO-I gene was so polymorphic that might not be the most appropriate marker to demonstrate a clear pattern of divergence between populations, as in Anopheles darlingi [63,64] or Aedes aegypti [65]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Although Tajima [39] and Fu and Li’s [40] F neutrality tests did not observe significant negative population values (Table 4), the results of mismatch distribution analyses indicated that the population probably did not have a constant size, but remained in growth-decline (Figure 7). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Studies of Culex [66] and Aedes [67] have demonstrated that altitudinal stratification can be revealed by individual wing morphology; however those studies have compared distant populations, with altitudes ranging from 800 to 2130 m. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Our study revealed variation between closely located populations, where the geographical distance between microenvironments was not substantial (see Additional file 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>An incidental hypothesis of our work is that the lowland/hilltop populations are undergoing an incipient speciation process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>The presence of cryptic species under the nominal species An. cruzii has been reported in other localities, but the occurrence of this phenomenon in Cananéia is still controversial [68,69]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, new studies should be performed using the other taxonomical markers traditionally employed to diagnose cryptic species in An. cruzii: chromosomes [68,70,71]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>The data for wing shape and gene CO-I were concordant, which probably indicates the vertical structure of An. cruzii in the Cananéia region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Despite microevolution over time, the altitudinal structure and sexual wing dimorphism were maintained in this species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>The hilltop and lowland populations differ in several aspects, which might be also reflected in their vectorial capacity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Our proposed scenario relies on theoretical conditions conducive to development of parapatric speciation, in which there is no specific extrinsic barrier to gene flow. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>The population is continuous, but the individuals do not cross randomly [72]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>They are more prone to cross with their geographical neighbours than with individuals of a different group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>There is continuity between the landscape microenvironments, because the bromeliaceous breeding sites are present throughout the forest and there are no physical barriers between lowland and hilltop. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>However, the morphological and molecular evidence suggests that the anophelines do not pass randomly through the vertical stratum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of these phenomena will support our understanding of the transmission dynamics of the Plasmodium sp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>It is also possible that the gene flow patterns differ throughout the year or that population makes demographic substitution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>The gene variability in populations is unknown; however, if this scenario changes, it can be used to understand the epidemiology of malaria in the region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>It opens a demand for studies on sexual dimorphism and genetic basis of altitudinal preference. </plain></SENT>
