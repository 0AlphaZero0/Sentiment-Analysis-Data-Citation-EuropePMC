</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Despite more than 35,000 completed and ongoing bacterial genome-sequencing projects (including over 2,500 genomes from strains of the genus Escherichia) [1] and the fundamental importance of type strains for microbial taxonomy and nomenclature [2], the type strain of Escherichia coli, U5/41T, the most widely studied bacterial model organism and model bacterium per se, was until now neglected in microbial genomics; although strain K-12 substrain MG1665 was in 1997 the subject of one of the first ever published complete genome sequences [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>By sequencing the genome of DSM 30083T, DSMZ’s culture of U5/41T, in the context of the Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea [4], we filled this gap enabling not only the use of this strain as a taxonomic reference in genome sequence-based studies, but also providing access to novel data of an exciting organism whose phenotypic features differ in many ways from those of the often used E. coli lab strain K-12. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The first report on strains of the genus Escherichia (at that time termed “Bacterium coli commune”) were published in 1886 by Theodor Escherich [5] in the context of his professorial dissertation at University of Munich. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Later in 1919, Castellani and Chalmers proposed the name Escherichia coli (E.sche.ri’chi.a, M.L. fem.n., Escherichia, in honor of Theodor Escherich; co’li, Gr.n. colon large intestine, colon, M.L. gen.n. coli of the colon) as the name for the type species of the genus Escherichia, which was accepted by the Judical Commission of the ICSB in 1958 [6] and included in the Approved Lists of Bacterial Names in 1980 [7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Despite its enormous importance for microbiology and mostly due to a lack of type culture collections until the early 1920s, the original type cultures of E. coli got lost (just like those of the early isolates of other bacterial species). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Strain U5/41T (= DSM 30083T = ATCC 11775T = WDCM 00090T) was isolated by Fritz Kauffmann at the State Serum Institute Copenhagen, Denmark in 1941 [8], from the urine of a patient with cystitis, and was accepted as neotype of E. coli in 1963 [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Figure 1 shows the original record card issued by the Danish State Serum Institute in Copenhagen for the deposit of U5/41T. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Since then, E. coli DSM 30083T was a reference strain for many tests and applications, such as serotyping with the method of Ã˜rskov and Ã˜rskov [10], antimicrobial assays [11], ribotyping and multi-locus sequence typing [12], and the PCR amplification of the β-d-glucuronidase gene fragment (uidA) as tracer for fecal pollution in all kinds of waters [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>As a model organism for genetics, biochemistry, metabolic reconstruction and pathway inference, genomics and metabolics of E. coli are well-studied topics, starting with the 1997 publication of the K-12 genome [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The reader is referred to studies of E. coli such as metabolic engineering for the production of chemicals and biofuels [14, 15], recombinant protein expression [16], the process of binary fission [17], DNA replication and segregation [18], small RNA regulators [19], genetics of the capsular machinery gene cluster [20], as well as comparative genomics [21] and the current status and the progress in clinically relevant E. coli strains [22, 23].Figure 1 Scan of the original record card issued for the deposit of U5/41 T .  </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>We present a description of the genome sequencing and annotation and a summary classification together with a set of features for strain DSM 30083T, including novel aspects of its phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Since only the availability of the type-strain genome allows for the application of state-of-the-art genome-based taxonomic methods, species affiliation of all strains with respect to the type strain was determined via digital DNA:DNA-hybridization (dDDH) similarities as computed by the Genome-to-Genome Distance Calculator [24], version 2 [25], and by evaluating the differences in genomic G+C content [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Phylogenomic analyses [24, 25] elucidate the evolutionary relationships between 250 E. coli strains, Shigella spp. and outgroup strains as well as the grouping within E. coli. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>This approach retains consistency with the microbial species concept because the traditional DDH is, on average, closely mimicked, but digital DDH (dDDH) avoids the pitfalls of traditional DDH due to the much lower error rate in genome sequencing [26]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>A quotation from [64] is worth reproducing here: “Subspecies designations can be used for genetically close organisms that diverge in phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>There is some evidence, based on frequency distribution of ΔTm values in DNA hybridization, that the subspecies concept is phylogenetically valid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>(…) There is a need for further guidelines for designation of subspecies.” Particularly because the availability of complete genome sequences allows for the transition to genome-based taxonomy, yielding to a considerable increase in phylogenetic resolution [99], rules for a genome-based, quantitative approach to subspecies delineation in analogy to the 70% (d)DDH threshold for the delineation of species [24, 25, 65], would be desirable. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>However, as emphasized in [26], inconsistencies can occur when distance or similarity thresholds are used and the underlying distances specifically deviate from ultrametricity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>These potential pitfalls are a general consequence of the direct use of pairwise distances or similarities (which is not a phylogenetic method) for assessing taxonomic affiliations [104] and not directly related to traditional or digital DDH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Fewer taxonomic problems are expected when comparisons between two non-type strains are avoided (which is necessary for reasons of nomenclature anyway), but this does not entirely prevent pitfalls [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, whether paradoxes really occur in practice depends on the distance threshold and the specific deviation of the data under study from the ultrametric condition [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Hence, if a threshold for delineating bacterial subspecies is of interest, it makes sense to choose it so as to minimize the potential of taxonomic inconsistencies related to non-ultrametric data as far as possible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>This can be done for bacterial subspecies precisely because by tradition they have not been determined based on a distance or similarity threshold, in contrast to the species rank, hence such a threshold can now be carefully chosen based on the above-mentioned principles. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Using the E. coli data as starting point, augmented by the data set used in [26] containing completely sequenced genomes for 105 genera of Archaea and Bacteria, in addition to criteria from the literature we have devised a criterion called “clustering consistency” for optimizing thresholds for sub-specific bacterial lineages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Compared to the analysis of frequency distributions of (d)DDH values as mentioned in [99], this approach has the advantage that it directly addresses how to best cluster the sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>The analyses described in detail in Additional file 3 show that regarding within-species clustering consistency a distance threshold corresponding to 79-80% dDDH makes most sense for both the E. coli and the 105-genera Archaea and Bacteria data sets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>In addition to clustering consistency, a value around 80% has a couple of other advantages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>For instance, it is sufficiently larger than the species boundary at 70% but nevertheless does not yield too many subspecies if applied strictly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>This is particularly important regarding the low number of currently described subspecies in the literature, which in our view makes it also impossible to estimate dDDH subspecies boundaries from the currently validly named subspecies. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Regarding practice, it is noteworthy that the already established detection of phylotypes [67–69] will help detecting the subspecies, too, because the (revised) phylotypes are either identical to subspecies or to subsets of subspecies (Figure 6). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Crucially, this changes nothing regarding the status of Shigella: if this name is to be retained not to cause confusion in medical microbiology anyway [39], it simply does not matter whether or not it otherwise would be placed entirely within E. coli or even entirely within a yet to be established subspecies of E. coli. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>An approach to describe subspecies for E. coli could start with the largest cluster in Figure 6, which contains most of the genome-sequenced strains including strain K-12, but also all strains of Shigella. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>Following the guidelines of the Bacteriological Code (1990 revision) [2] the type strain of this subspecies would be strain NewcastleT (=NCTC 4837T) representing E. coli subsp. dysenteriae (Shiga 1897) Castellani and Chalmers 1919, with strain U5/41T automatically becoming the type strain of E. coli subsp. coli (Shiga 1897) Castellani and Chalmers 1919. Thus establishing this subspecies of E. coli would taxonomically conflict with the purpose of retaining Shigella [39], hence we refrain from proposing taxonomic consequences here. </plain></SENT>
