</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>It is well documented that an aging society is a general tendency in Europe as well as in the United States (USA). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The number of people belonging to the population aged 65 or over has tripled in the last 50 years and this tendency is expected to continue in the next 50 years [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Dementia is more frequent among women, some form of dementia occurs in 11% of men and 16% of women over the age of 71. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Data on the prevalence of dementia are varying but studies are consistent in indicating the increasing prevalence of the disease in older age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>About one third of people above 85 years of age are affected [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The health care of patients poses an increasingly more serious social and financial burden in an aging society. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Total payments for health care, long-term care, and hospices for people with Alzheimer Dementia (AD) and other dementias in the USA are forecasted to increase from $203 billion in 2013 to $1.2 trillion in 2050 (in 2013 dollars) [1]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Since there is no effective treatment for dementia, the early detection of symptoms and the identification of methods for slowing the progression of the disease have been the main focus of medical research on the subject in recent years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The transitory condition between physiological aging and dementia known as ‘mild cognitive impairment’ (MCI) has gained a significant focus of interest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In MCI mild impairment of cognitive skills can be revealed by neuropsychological tests [2], while global cognitive functions and everyday activities are preserved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of the pre-disease conditions is based on the increased conversion rate of affected patients compared to the average. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>While dementia occurs annually in 1–4% of average elderly population, this rate is 10–15% in case of MCI [3,4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>However the process which later leads to dementia is started even before the symptoms of MCI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In view of the above it is understandable that several studies target the symptoms and differences from the average population that are closely linked to the development of dementia and can therefore be used to assist the early diagnosis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>At present cerebral imaging methods, especially MR imaging of the temporal brain regions and neuropsychological tests are considered to be the most sensitive tools for the early detection of risk [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In the latter case literature emphasizes the importance of the tests assessing visuospatial memory targeting the most frequent type of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease [6,7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the fact that the neuropathological changes in Alzheimer’s dementia start in the entorhinal cortex and in the hippocampus years before the occurrence of clinical symptoms, and then they spread to further parts of the brain [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Hippocampus is the area where information on space and objects converges [9,10], therefore its functioning in visuospatial memory is crucial. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Long term follow-up studies suggest that subjects who achieved worse results in visuospatial memory tests such as the Paired Associates Learning (PAL) test compared to peer groups had a higher risk of developing dementia in later life [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Literature supports the importance of risk population screening, demonstrating that treatment, specifically cognitive training, started in pre-dementia stage prolongs the duration of this stage and subsequently the duration of independent living [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Several studies showed that cognitive training can produce moderate to large beneficial effects on memory related outcomes [12,13], enhance cognitive control [14] and reduce the risk of dementia [15] based on the brain plasticity [16,17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>However, it is important to note that screening for dementia and for MCI may have some negative effects, such as the risk of misdiagnoses due to the limited accuracy of the screening instrument, and the resulting stress caused by false positive diagnoses [17–19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Therefore it is always important to emphasize toward participants in such programs, that the result of the screening is not equal to the clinical diagnosis, it is rather a recommendation to seek further professional help, and that it may be prudent to undergo detailed neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>The difficulty of screening arises from the fact that these neuropsychological tests (the base of diagnosis) were developed for clinical use. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Therefore they are available only for a limited number of patients, since their application requires the active participation of an expert. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Contrary to this, cognitive games provided by web pages dedicated to maintain and improve mental functions are accessible for a wider range of the population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The games on these web pages can entertain a participant, many of them have concurrently demonstrated a benefit on the development of various cognitive domains, therefore on maintaining mental wellbeing [20,21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The widespread availability of these games and the fact that they don’t require extensive expertise can make them suitable for fulfilling the screening function [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Another issue with clinical neuropsychological testing is that in most cases, when subjects visit a psychologist or a psychiatrist, the symptoms of the cognitive decline are manifest and interfere with everyday functioning, i.e. the dementia has already developed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Unlike neuropsychological tests, cognitive games are played by healthy, well functioning elderly people, subjects who should be monitored for early signs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Additionally the games can be played regularly, daily or weekly, which make them a repetitive measurement, and thus ideal for screening. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>In this study, the intention was to analyze the suitability of similar computer games in the detection of preclinical signs of later cognitive decline. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>The major cause of dementia is Alzheimer’s disease, where the visuospatial memory is the earliest function affected [6,7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Therefore for the purpose of this study the well-known ‘Find the Pairs’ memory game (computer version) was chosen, since this game assesses this memory function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Based on the results of previous longitudinal follow-up studies it is understood that the volume of the hippocampus and the related structures, such as the volume of the temporal lobes, and the entorhinal cortex are the best predictors of cognitive decline and the later conversion to dementia [23–25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Therefore the primary endpoint of the present investigation was to show correlation between the volumes of these Central Nervous System (CNS) structures and the results of the memory game. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Since neuropsychological measures as the PAL test are also good predictors of pathological cognitive decline of elderly people, our secondary endpoint was to show correlations between this neuropsychological measure and the memory game. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Currently known preventive therapies and therapies to be introduced in the near future will likely be more effective in the early stage of dementia, when everyday functioning is not affected, i.e. when neuron loss is minimal [6,11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Accordingly the identification of people forming a risk group with respect to later dementia may be particularly important. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Several recent studies have demonstrated that the volume of the temporal lobe structures such as the hippocampus can differentiate between healthy subjects, patients with MCI and patients with Alzheimer’s disease [46,47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>In addition, more and more studies have demonstrated that volumes of temporal structures predict the later development of Alzheimer’s disease in healthy subjects [48] and patients with MCI [49], in other words these brain volumes can identify subjects at risk before everyday functioning would be affected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>In the present study the selection of the hippocampus, the entorhinal cortex and the temporal pole for validation was primarily based on the above evidence gathered during long-term follow-up investigations such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>In addition to the above, multiple studies have underlined the importance of the entorhinal cortex in prediction of developing dementia in healthy subjects, and patients with MCI [47,48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Furthermore the possibility of developing dementia later was significantly higher among those elderly persons whose decreased metabolism in entorhinal cortex was observed by FDG-PET imaging based on the data of a 3-year-long follow-up study including 48 persons [50]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="sec019"><title><text><SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Results from the primary correlational analysis involving healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>The aim of the investigation was to show that widely used computer games can help to identify subjects at risk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>In order to show this, analysis was conducted of the correlations between the results of the 'Find the Pairs' game and the volumes of those CNS structures previously found to be good predictors of later cognitive decline. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>The study found that subjects with smaller entorhinal cortex, temporal pole and hippocampus volumes needed more trials and more time to complete the memory game (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Thus, the results support the initial hypothesis that healthy individuals achieving worse results in the memory game have increased level of atrophy in the predefined brain structures by structural MRI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Additionally the study found no correlation between the results of the memory game and the total intracranial volume, the total cortex volume, and the amount of the cerebrospinal fluid, which shows the specificity of the above correlations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>In other words this verifies that the above correlations are not due to general atrophy rather a consequence of a more specific process starting in the temporal regions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>In addition to brain imaging technologies, the predictive strength of neuropsychological tests has also been demonstrated by several studies [5,6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>In the present study the PAL Test was included to assess associative learning between visual stimuli and different spatial locations [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness and predictive strength of this test in the early diagnosis of dementia was shown by several follow-up studies [6,7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>We found that the subjects who completed the memory game faster, and from fewer trials, could competed more stages and more patterns from first trial, and needed less trials in the PAL test. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>The results of the Trail Making Test part A and B, assessing mainly selective attention and executive functions respectively, did not correlate with the game results, which indicate that decreased performance in the memory game is not part of a general cognitive slowing. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Furthermore it was found that better results in the memory game are also associated with the higher ACE total scores and anterograde memory subscores. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Previous investigations showed that the ACE is a useful tool to predict later conversion to dementia [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>The MMSE was used for the assessment of global cognitive functions and the RAVLT was used for the detailed investigation of the short term memory. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Since exclusion of subjects with MCI and dementia was based on these tests, no correlation was expected with the results of memory game in these tests due to the small variance in the healthy subject group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Despite the low variance the results indicate that higher RAVLT total scores were associated with better results in the memory game. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between the results of STAI and GDS and the results of the memory game indicating that decreased performance was not caused by anxiety or depression. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>A significant difference was found between the study groups in the trials needed to complete the memory game showing that it can differentiate between subjects with MCI and healthy controls with a moderate sensitivity (&gt;80%) and a low specificity (&gt;60%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>A limitation of this finding is the low number of subjects in the MCI groups. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title><text><SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>In summary the results support the initial hypothesis that healthy elderly subjects achieving worse results in the memory game have increased level of atrophy in the temporal brain structures and showed a decreased performance in the PAL test, in the ACE, and in the RAVLT, which were previously extensively validated and considered to be sensitive tools in dementia prediction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Furthermore subjects with MCI achieved significantly worse in the memory game compared to healthy controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Based on these results it can be concluded that memory games such as the 'Find the Pairs' game may be useful in detecting the early signs of cognitive decline. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>However, the evidence gathered in the present investigation is indirect, since the study was cross-sectional, and hippocampus is a promising, but only surrogate biomarker, therefore our results should be confirmed by long term follow-up studies in the future. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>For the same reason test-retest reliability of the memory game cannot be reported. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>A further limitation of this investigation was the relative small sample size. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Compared with MRI and neuropsychological testing, the benefits of computer games are their accessibility, their cost-effectiveness, and the involvement of healthy subjects, or subjects with MCI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Furthermore cognitive games can be played at home, where anxiety caused by the clinical environment is not present and does not reduce performance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>However their lower sensitivity and specificity are definite drawbacks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Therefore they can be used to give feedbacks to the players, and may give a hint to them that it might be useful to seek professional help. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>This may help people to seek help in the beginning of the cognitive decline far earlier than they currently do. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>It must be emphasized toward the users, that these computer games are not appropriate for diagnosing and therefore they cannot replace the detailed neuropsychological investigation in clinical practice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>However the findings of this study support the idea that such games can help people at risk to seek professional help in time. </plain></SENT>
