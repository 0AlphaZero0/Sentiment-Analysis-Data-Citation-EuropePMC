Recent study revealed that NdgR is one of the regulatory targets of SigR, an oxidative stress response sigma factor, suggesting that the NdgR plays an important physiological role in response to environmental stresses.

The ChIP-seq profiles revealed 19 direct binding loci with a 15-bp imperfect palindromic motif, including 34 genes in their transcription units. Most genes in branched-chain amino acid and cysteine biosynthesis pathways were involved in the NdgR regulon.

Through the expression test of NdgR and the target genes for NdgR under diamide treatment, regulatory motifs were suggested. Interestingly, NdgR constitutes two regulatory motifs, coherent and incoherent feed-forward loops (FFL), in order to control its regulon under the diamide treatment.

They have complex regulatory systems for morphological differentiation in response to environmental or nutritional conditions. Genome sequences of this genus also support the existence of complex regulatory networks for sensing and signal transduction to adapt to such conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>For instance, <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> is the most thoroughly studied model organism among this genus that produces antibiotics, including the red-pigmented tripyrrole undecylprodigiosin (Red), the lipopeptide calcium-dependent antibiotic (CDA), and the deep blue-pigmented polyketide actinorhodin (Act). Its genome size has been revealed as 8,667,507&#160;bp, encoding 965 proteins (12.3%) predicted to have regulatory functions, including sigma factors, two-component regulatory systems, and many transcription factor families such as LysR, LacI, ROK, GntR, TetR, IclR, AraC, AsnC, and MerR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The numbers of its regulatory proteins are much larger than those of <italic>E. coli</italic>, reflecting its differential regulatory networks under changing stress environments.</p><p>Members of the IclR family of transcriptional regulatory proteins are composed of approximately 250 amino acid residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The IclR family has an effector-binding domain at the C-terminus, which is supported by structural data and by studies using mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The IclR proteins bind their cognate promoters as dimers or as a dimer of dimers with a helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif in the N-terminal domain. The members of this family are known to do repression, activation, or serve as dual-function regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Members of the IclR family control a diverse array of genes whose products are involved in glyoxylate shunt in Enterobacteriaceae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], multidrug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], degradation of aromatics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], inactivation of quorum-sensing signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and determinants of plant pathogenicity and sporulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>In <italic>S. coelicolor</italic>, 16 genes are annotated as members of the IclR family of regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Among them, <italic>ndgR</italic> is highly conserved among <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species as well as other actinomycetes such as <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> and <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. NdgR and its orthologs are located adjacent to <italic>leuCD</italic>, which encodes isopropylmalate dehydratase, and have been identified as its transcriptional regulator. In addition, the last step of methionine biosynthesis has been identified as a regulatory target of NdgR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Regulation by <italic>ndgR</italic> orthologs in other bacteria has also been revealed. For example, AreB in <italic>Streptomyces clavuligerus</italic> controls the biosynthesis of leucine and secondary metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In <italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic>, LtbR has been characterized as a regulator involved in leucine and tryptophan biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Meanwhile, it was revealed that SigR, an oxidative stress response sigma factor, binds to the upstream region of <italic>ndgR</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. SigR is activated via dissociation of the RsrA anti-sigma factor in response to thiol oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This information suggests a physiological role of NdgR as an oxidative stress response regulator.</p><p>Previously, we developed a versatile PCR-based tandem epitope tagging tool for the identification of direct binding targets of DNA-binding proteins of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Using this tool, we constructed a <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> harboring a 6&#215; myc-tagged NdgR that was successfully utilized for the immunoprecipitation of NdgR-DNA complexes. This experiment revealed that NdgR regulates not only <italic>leuCD</italic> but also most of genes involved in leucine biosynthesis in <italic>S. coelicolor</italic>. Despite the previous studies, the DNA-binding locations of NdgR under physiologically relevant conditions have not been described at a high resolution, and on a genome-wide scale. Here, we further investigate the NdgR regulon <italic>in vivo</italic> using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) and further explore the responses of the NdgR regulatory network to thiol oxidative stress. We also discuss the regulatory roles of NdgR in <italic>S. coelicolor</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Identification of <italic>in vivo</italic> NdgR-binding regions by ChIP-seq</title><p>NdgR and its orthologs have been characterized <italic>in vitro</italic> by DNA-binding experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis of direct interaction between NdgR and its cognate DNA has not been described. To study the binding characteristics of NdgR to the <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> chromosome, we exploited a ChIP-seq method that has been used for genome-wide determination of <italic>in vivo</italic> binding locations of regulatory proteins. We constructed a 6&#215; myc-tagged NdgR strain using homologous recombination for the immunoprecipitation (IP) using a specific anti-c-myc antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. For cell growth, specific nutrient conditions have often been used to elucidate the function of unknown regulators if the phenotypic differences between wild-type (WT) and deletion mutants were undetectable when the cells were grown in complex media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Thus, we used solid minimal media supplemented with N-acetylglucosamine and L-asparagine for the perturbation of phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. To determine the NdgR-binding regions at the genome scale, we constructed a sequencing library using IP-DNA and performed next-generation sequencing. Sequencing of the library yielded short sequence reads of 36 nucleotides that were uniquely mapped onto the <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> genome (NC_003888). Using the MACS program, 19 NdgR-binding loci were detected with stringent cut-off conditions (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt;1.0e-10, fold enrichment&#8201;&gt;&#8201;3) (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

This discrepancy might be due to the differences between <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experimental conditions. In addition, we observed low levels of NdgR binding at the promoters of <italic>metH</italic> (SCO1657) and <italic>leuA</italic> (SCO5559) relative to the other binding peaks.

To determine the putative NdgR binding motif from our validated ChIP-seq data, 400 nucleotides surrounding the peak summits of 19 binding regions were analyzed by MEME, a bioinformatics tool that identifies overrepresented motifs in multiple unaligned sequences. A 15-bp imperfect palindromic motif ([GT]T[CT]CAC[CA][CTA][TC][GC][TC]GGAC) was detected with an E-value of 1.3e-005 (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C).

The metabolism of small molecule category is highly dominant (62%, 21/34 genes). Among the genes in this category, 43% and 33% were assigned to amino acid biosynthesis (9/21 genes) and central intermediary metabolism (7/21 genes), respectively, and 14% (3/21 genes) were included in biosynthesis of cofactors and carriers.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>

For instance, the first step in BCAA biosynthesis is catalyzed by acetohydroxy acid synthase/acetolactate synthase encoded by <italic>ilvBN</italic>. This enzyme catalyzes the condensation of two pyruvate molecules to acetolactate and 2-acetohydroxybutyrate from pyruvate and 2-ketobutyrate. The following reaction is catalyzed by ketol-acid reductoisomerase and dihydroxy-acid dehydratase encoded by <italic>ilvC</italic> and <italic>ilvD</italic>, respectively. The final transamination step, as well as the first step in the degradation pathways, is catalyzed by BCAA aminotransferases encoded by <italic>ilvE</italic>. Leucine is synthesized from &#945;-ketoisovalerate, an intermediate in the valine pathway, through three enzymatic steps. The relevant enzymes are &#945;-isopropylmalate synthase (LeuA), &#946;-isopropylmalate dehydratase (LeuC, LeuD), and &#946;-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (LeuB). Despite the scattered locations of those genes along the chromosome, NdgR directly bound their upstream regions. Interestingly, the NdgR mutant (BG11) exhibited methionine auxotrophy, but not leucine auxotrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Notwithstanding its direct binding at the promoters of genes in the BCAA biosynthetic pathway, NdgR was not essential for BCAA biosynthesis under the growth conditions used here. Thus, it is expected that NdgR plays a role in the fine-tuning of BCAA biosynthesis with the assistance of feedback regulation and translational attenuation common in amino acid biosynthetic pathways in bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>

The pathway of sulfur assimilation into cysteine biosynthesis in <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> has been suggested in previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The genes, including <italic>cysN</italic> (SCO6097), <italic>cysD</italic> (SCO6098), and <italic>cysC</italic> (SCO6099), participate in 3&#8242;-phosphoadenylyl sulfate (PAPS) formation from sulfate. PAPS reductase encoded by <italic>cysH</italic> (SCO6100) converts PAPS to sulfite. The serial reactions are followed by two pathways that result in thiosulfate production by a thiosulfate sulfurtransferase and sulfide production by a sulfite reductase encoded by <italic>cysA</italic> (SCO4164) and <italic>cysI</italic> (SCO6102), respectively. The two metabolites (thiosulfate and sulfide) are sulfur donors for the sulfur assimilation into O-acetyl-L-serine by cysteine synthase encoded by <italic>cysM</italic> (SCO2910) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, NdgR bound to the promoter region of putative siroheme synthase encoded by <italic>cysG</italic> (SCO1553). Siroheme is a prosthetic group that participates in six-electron reduction reactions catalyzed by both sulfite and nitrite reductases. CysG converts uroporphyrinogen III, which is a precursor of heme and cobalamin (vitamin B12), to siroheme using multifunctional activities such as SAM-dependent methylase, dehydrogenase and ferrochelatase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Biosynthesis of sulfur-containing thiamine was also regulated by NdgR. As the active form of thiamine, thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) is an essential cofactor for particular metabolic processes such as BCAA biosynthesis. The thiamine category includes thiamine monophosphate kinase and sulfurylase encoded by <italic>thiL</italic> (SCO5562) and <italic>moeB</italic> (SCO5178), respectively. In addition, phosphomethylpyrimidine kinase encoded by <italic>thiD</italic> (SCO5563) in the polyamine biosynthesis category is likely involved in thiamine metabolism.</p><p>In <italic>S. clavuligerus</italic>, AreB, an ortholog of NdgR, bound to the upstream region of the pathway-specific regulator of clavulanic acid and cephamycin C, and the <italic>areB</italic> deletion mutant increased their production. Moreover, the <italic>ndgR</italic> mutant showed overproduction of actinorhodin in our experimental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

NdgR was transiently induced by diamide treatment in the presence of SigR (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A); hence, NdgR is expected to regulate its target genes in response to thiol oxidative stress. However, NdgR was expressed constitutively in the absence of SigR, suggesting that there are additional transcriptional regulators in addition to the SigR.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>

All levels are normalized by the levels of each sample at 0&#160;min. <bold>(B)</bold> Sensitivity test of WT, <italic>ndgR</italic> deletion mutant (BG11) and complemented mutant (BG13) under thiol oxidative stress. Serially diluted spores of WT, BG11 and BG13 were spotted on R5 agar plates with or without added diamide (0.6&#160;mM). Plates were incubated at 30&#176;C for 5&#160;days.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12864_2015_1311_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p>Next, we sought to examine whether the <italic>ndgR</italic> mutant strain is sensitive to this thiol-reactive compound using a plate assay. We used complex media for the sensitivity test because <italic>ndgR</italic> mutant hardly grows in minimal media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. When WT, <italic>ndgR</italic> mutant (BG11) and complemented mutant (BG13) spores were spotted on the R5- agar plates containing 0.6&#160;mM diamide, BG11 cells were found to be sensitive to diamide even in the complex media (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). These results show that <italic>ndgR</italic> is necessary for the response to oxidative stress conditions.</p><p>The role of BCAAs in response to stress conditions has not been completely elucidated in bacteria; however, <italic>leuCD</italic> induction in response to thiol-specific oxidative stress was reported in <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> BCG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In plants, there have been many reports regarding the accumulation of BCAAs in abiotic stress conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. It has been suggested that BCAAs function as compatible osmolytes since the level of BCAAs is elevated under drought stress in various plant tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Another possible role for BCAAs under stress conditions that has been suggested is that they function as alternative electron donors for the mitochondrial electron transport chain via the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) complex to produce ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Isovaleryl-CoA from the degradation of BCAAs provides electrons to the ETF complex via the action of isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase. In addition, we observed that the <italic>ndgR</italic> mutant exhibited defective membrane formation in minimal media (data not shown). This result is likely due to the fact that 70% of total fatty acids in the membrane are branched-chain fatty acids, which are synthesized from the precursors derived from BCAA degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p>Sulfur-related reactions are well known as anti-oxidation reactions in actinomycetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Expression levels of <italic>cysIHCDN</italic>, <italic>cysM</italic>, and <italic>cysA</italic> are significantly increased by SigB under osmotic and oxidative stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], leading to an increase in cysteine levels. As a component of mycothiol, a major thiol buffer found in many actinomycetes, cysteine would protect the cell against osmotic and oxidative stresses. Because oxidation-labile S-containing factors such as TPP and iron-sulfur clusters are involved in many physiological reactions, NdgR would contribute to replenishing these factors. Thus, we speculate that NdgR maintains the intracellular redox balance and the structural integrity of the membrane in response to external thiol oxidative stress by orchestrating the genes in its regulon.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Elucidation of NdgR regulatory logic</title><p>The members of the IclR family of regulators have been demonstrated to be activators, repressors, and dual-role proteins in many cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, to ascertain the physiological role of a regulator, a comprehensive understanding of its regulatory modes, including higher and lower levels of regulation, would be helpful. In order to elucidate how NdgR regulates target gene expression in response to oxidative stress, we quantified mRNA levels of the relevant genes using qRT-PCR (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). We selected sulfur assimilation into the cysteine biosynthesis pathway as a target due to its significance in the stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The selected genes were <italic>cysI</italic> in <italic>cysIHCDN</italic> operon, <italic>cysA</italic> and <italic>cysM</italic> in cysteine biosynthesis, and <italic>ndgR</italic>. First, we confirmed that the transcriptional level of <italic>ndgR</italic> is induced by diamide. All of the target genes were also induced by diamide regardless of the presence of <italic>ndgR</italic>. This result indicates that other transcription factors related to oxidative stress could also exist for the regulation of them. Next, we observed two regulatory modes based on the measurement of expression levels affected by NdgR under diamide treatment. <italic>cysA</italic> and <italic>cysI</italic> were induced by NdgR regardless of diamide. Meanwhile, <italic>cysM</italic> seems to be hardly expressed without diamide treatment regardless of the presence of <italic>ndgR</italic>. Although NdgR may bind to the promoter of <italic>cysM</italic> in absence of diamide treatment, the expression level may not be decreased because <italic>cysM</italic> is not expressed originally. However, NdgR repressed the expression of <italic>cysM</italic> in the presence of diamide; thus, the role of NdgR as a dual regulator was confirmed.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>

All the values are represented with standard deviations. <bold>(B)</bold> The logic gates of NdgR regulatory networks. NdgR regulates the sulfate assimilation pathway using coherent and incoherent FFL.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12864_2015_1311_Fig5_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig></p><p>We further explored the physiological roles of these two regulatory modes by NdgR using network motif theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The two regulatory modes of NdgR were coherent type-1 feed-forward loop (C1-FFL) with OR-gate, and incoherent type-1 feed-forward loop (I1-FFL) (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B). A C1-FFL is a regulatory pattern in which an activator (D) controls a target gene (T) and also activates another activator (N) of that target gene. C1-FFL with OR-gate shows a delayed response to OFF steps of D and a rapid response to ON steps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Because sulfur assimilation governed by <italic>cysI</italic> and <italic>cysA</italic> is controlled by C1-FFL with OR-gates, cells can maintain sulfur assimilation activity after the signal is OFF. Meanwhile, an I1-FFL is a regulatory pattern in which an activator (D) controls a target gene (T) and also activates a repressor (N) of that target gene. This motif is a pulse generator and a response accelerator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In addition, I1-FFL provides fold-change detection that responds only to the fold-change (rather than absolute change) of the input signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. CysM has an I1-FFL network motif; thus, it may be expressed in a rapid response that is proportional to the fold-change in the stimulus relative to the background.</p><p>We revealed that NdgR controls sulfur assimilation into the cysteine biosynthesis pathway through two regulatory modes. Using C1-FFL with OR-gate, NdgR can initiate a reduction in sulfate immediately in response to the stress and stably protect assimilation systems against transient loss of signal. At the final step, NdgR acts as a memory of stress intensity by using the I1-FFL motif. Thus, it mediates a continual temporal comparison between the present and past levels of stresses. During the stress condition, the memory is adjusted to the new level of stress intensity, and cysteine synthesis by CysM returns to its basal level. Thus, this modulation prevents excess synthesis of cysteine, which is energetically wasteful and avoids potential osmotic imbalances. Using these regulatory modes, NdgR likely provides an advantage for <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> to maintain homeostasis in stress conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We identified genome-wide binding sites of NdgR in <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> using ChIP-seq and revealed its physiological role under oxidative stress conditions. In our growth condition, we found that NdgR directly regulates 34 genes that are involved in the synthesis of BCAAs and cysteine using 19 regulatory binding sites. We confirmed that SigR, an oxidative stress response sigma factor, induces NdgR in response to thiol oxidative stress induced by diamide treatment. Interestingly, this implied physiological roles of the NdgR regulon in <italic>S. coelicolor</italic>. Degradation of BCAAs is known to produce major CoA precursors of branched-chain fatty acids, which are the major components of bacterial cell membranes; thus, their production enhances the robustness of the cell. Furthermore, BCAAs can serve as an alternative electron transport donor for energy production under various stress conditions, similarly to that which occurs in plants. Because the induction of biosynthesis of BCAA under stress conditions has also been reported in other bacteria, the exact roles of BCAAs in stress conditions require further investigation. In addition, many BCAA biosynthesis genes require sulfur-containing cofactors such as thiamine and iron-sulfur clusters, which are vulnerable to thiol oxidative stress; these cofactors can be replenished by sulfur-related pathways such as cysteine biosynthesis, which is also regulated by NdgR. Furthermore, cysteine is one of the precursors of mycothiol, a major redox buffer in <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> that helps maintain redox balance in the cell. The cysteine biosynthesis pathway is regulated by NdgR under thiol oxidative stress using coherent and incoherent FFL, which enables cells to adapt to the environmental conditions by maintaining homeostasis. This study provides a deeper understanding the mechanisms by which NdgR regulates amino acid biosynthesis in response to stress in <italic>S. coelicolor</italic>. In addition, this model system shows a possibility such that revealing the global regulatory network of transcription factors using ChIP-seq technique will enable in depth understanding of their physiological roles in <italic>S. coelicolor</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>All strains used are <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> A3 (2) M145 and <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 MG1655 and its derivatives.
