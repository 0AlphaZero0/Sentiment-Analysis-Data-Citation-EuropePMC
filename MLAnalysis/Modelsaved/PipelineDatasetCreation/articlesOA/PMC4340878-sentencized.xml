<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>They have complex regulatory systems for morphological differentiation in response to environmental or nutritional conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Genome sequences of this genus also support the existence of complex regulatory networks for sensing and signal transduction to adapt to such conditions [1-3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>For instance, S. coelicolor is the most thoroughly studied model organism among this genus that produces antibiotics, including the red-pigmented tripyrrole undecylprodigiosin (Red), the lipopeptide calcium-dependent antibiotic (CDA), and the deep blue-pigmented polyketide actinorhodin (Act). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Its genome size has been revealed as 8,667,507 bp, encoding 965 proteins (12.3%) predicted to have regulatory functions, including sigma factors, two-component regulatory systems, and many transcription factor families such as LysR, LacI, ROK, GntR, TetR, IclR, AraC, AsnC, and MerR [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The numbers of its regulatory proteins are much larger than those of E. coli, reflecting its differential regulatory networks under changing stress environments. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Members of the IclR family of transcriptional regulatory proteins are composed of approximately 250 amino acid residues [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The IclR family has an effector-binding domain at the C-terminus, which is supported by structural data and by studies using mutants [5,6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The IclR proteins bind their cognate promoters as dimers or as a dimer of dimers with a helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif in the N-terminal domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The members of this family are known to do repression, activation, or serve as dual-function regulators [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Members of the IclR family control a diverse array of genes whose products are involved in glyoxylate shunt in Enterobacteriaceae [7,8], multidrug resistance [9], degradation of aromatics [10-12], inactivation of quorum-sensing signals [13], and determinants of plant pathogenicity and sporulation [14]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In S. coelicolor, 16 genes are annotated as members of the IclR family of regulators [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Among them, ndgR is highly conserved among Streptomyces species as well as other actinomycetes such as Mycobacterium and Corynebacterium [15,16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>NdgR and its orthologs are located adjacent to leuCD, which encodes isopropylmalate dehydratase, and have been identified as its transcriptional regulator. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>SigR is activated via dissociation of the RsrA anti-sigma factor in response to thiol oxidation [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>This information suggests a physiological role of NdgR as an oxidative stress response regulator. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>In plants, there have been many reports regarding the accumulation of BCAAs in abiotic stress conditions [34-36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that BCAAs function as compatible osmolytes since the level of BCAAs is elevated under drought stress in various plant tissues [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Another possible role for BCAAs under stress conditions that has been suggested is that they function as alternative electron donors for the mitochondrial electron transport chain via the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) complex to produce ATP [35]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>This result is likely due to the fact that 70% of total fatty acids in the membrane are branched-chain fatty acids, which are synthesized from the precursors derived from BCAA degradation [37]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Sulfur-related reactions are well known as anti-oxidation reactions in actinomycetes [19,20,28]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>In order to elucidate how NdgR regulates target gene expression in response to oxidative stress, we quantified mRNA levels of the relevant genes using qRT-PCR (Figure 5A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>We selected sulfur assimilation into the cysteine biosynthesis pathway as a target due to its significance in the stress response [28]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>This result indicates that other transcription factors related to oxidative stress could also exist for the regulation of them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Next, we observed two regulatory modes based on the measurement of expression levels affected by NdgR under diamide treatment. cysA and cysI were induced by NdgR regardless of diamide. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Although NdgR may bind to the promoter of cysM in absence of diamide treatment, the expression level may not be decreased because cysM is not expressed originally. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>The two regulatory modes of NdgR were coherent type-1 feed-forward loop (C1-FFL) with OR-gate, and incoherent type-1 feed-forward loop (I1-FFL) (Figure 5B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>A C1-FFL is a regulatory pattern in which an activator (D) controls a target gene (T) and also activates another activator (N) of that target gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>C1-FFL with OR-gate shows a delayed response to OFF steps of D and a rapid response to ON steps [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Because sulfur assimilation governed by cysI and cysA is controlled by C1-FFL with OR-gates, cells can maintain sulfur assimilation activity after the signal is OFF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, an I1-FFL is a regulatory pattern in which an activator (D) controls a target gene (T) and also activates a repressor (N) of that target gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>This motif is a pulse generator and a response accelerator [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>In addition, I1-FFL provides fold-change detection that responds only to the fold-change (rather than absolute change) of the input signal [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>CysM has an I1-FFL network motif; thus, it may be expressed in a rapid response that is proportional to the fold-change in the stimulus relative to the background. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>We revealed that NdgR controls sulfur assimilation into the cysteine biosynthesis pathway through two regulatory modes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Using C1-FFL with OR-gate, NdgR can initiate a reduction in sulfate immediately in response to the stress and stably protect assimilation systems against transient loss of signal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>At the final step, NdgR acts as a memory of stress intensity by using the I1-FFL motif. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Thus, it mediates a continual temporal comparison between the present and past levels of stresses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>During the stress condition, the memory is adjusted to the new level of stress intensity, and cysteine synthesis by CysM returns to its basal level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Thus, this modulation prevents excess synthesis of cysteine, which is energetically wasteful and avoids potential osmotic imbalances. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Using these regulatory modes, NdgR likely provides an advantage for S. coelicolor to maintain homeostasis in stress conditions. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>In our growth condition, we found that NdgR directly regulates 34 genes that are involved in the synthesis of BCAAs and cysteine using 19 regulatory binding sites. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, this implied physiological roles of the NdgR regulon in S. coelicolor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Degradation of BCAAs is known to produce major CoA precursors of branched-chain fatty acids, which are the major components of bacterial cell membranes; thus, their production enhances the robustness of the cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, BCAAs can serve as an alternative electron transport donor for energy production under various stress conditions, similarly to that which occurs in plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Because the induction of biosynthesis of BCAA under stress conditions has also been reported in other bacteria, the exact roles of BCAAs in stress conditions require further investigation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>In addition, many BCAA biosynthesis genes require sulfur-containing cofactors such as thiamine and iron-sulfur clusters, which are vulnerable to thiol oxidative stress; these cofactors can be replenished by sulfur-related pathways such as cysteine biosynthesis, which is also regulated by NdgR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cysteine is one of the precursors of mycothiol, a major redox buffer in S. coelicolor that helps maintain redox balance in the cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>The cysteine biosynthesis pathway is regulated by NdgR under thiol oxidative stress using coherent and incoherent FFL, which enables cells to adapt to the environmental conditions by maintaining homeostasis. </plain></SENT>
