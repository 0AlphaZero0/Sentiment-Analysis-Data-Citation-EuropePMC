</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Cystatins are tightly binding inhibitors of cysteine proteases [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In parasites, these inhibitors are involved in internal protective and regulatory biological processes [2] as well as in the modulation of the host’s defense responses [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Classically, cystatins are divided into three groups, known as stefin (type 1), cystatin (type 2), and kininogen (type 3), although in ticks only stefins and cystatins have been reported [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>It was only in recent years that the physiological functions of tick cystatins [4,5] and their target cysteine cathepsins [6,7] during tick blood-feeding, digestion and development became the object of more consistent research. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have also demonstrated that tick cystatins modulate host cathepsins involved in processes like inflammation, antigen processing and presentation, phagocytosis, and cytokine expression [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The regulation of these physiological processes by tick cystatins promotes blood uptake and survival of parasite while it is attached to the host. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The first tick cystatin biochemically or molecularly characterized was isolated from Amblyomma americanum [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Back then, the participation of this cystatin was implicated in host immunomodulation and tick protection to harmful ingested factors during blood feeding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In Ixodes scapularis, two cystatins were biochemically characterized, Sialostatin L and Sialostatin L2 [9,10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Sialostatin L showed host immune system modulation and cathepsins L, V, C, X, B, and papain inhibition, while Sialostatin L2 inhibited cathepsins L, V, S, and C, showing higher expression rate in late feeding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The enzymatic inhibition profile of Haemaphysalis longicornis cystatins for papain, cathepsins L, B, H, as well as tick cathepsins have been characterized in previous research [7,11-14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it was demonstrated that some of the cystatins from H. longicornis play a role in innate immunity [11] and blood feeding [7,14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Cystatins from Ornithodoros moubata were able to inhibit cathepsins B, L, S, H, and C [15,16], and affect T-cell and dendritic cells proliferation and cytokine release [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Additionally, it was suggested that one Rhipicephalus appendiculatus cystatin present in nymph, male and female gut after feeding is involved in blood digestion process [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results indicate that cystatins play widespread and distinct regulatory roles in different tick species. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Rhipicephalus microplus is one of the most consistently studied cattle tick species, mainly because of the potentially expressive economic losses it causes in the livestock industry [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>However, despite the great interest in understanding the physiology of this tick, few studies have analyzed R. microplus cystatins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Some R. microplus cysteine proteases were identified and characterized [19-21], demonstrating the importance of these enzymes in a variety of physiological processes and parasite stages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, few R. microplus cystatins and its target cysteine proteases have been characterized, including only one type 2 cystatin [5], named Rmcystatin-3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Rmcystatin-3 is expressed in tick fat body, salivary glands, and hemocyte, though it inhibits cathepsin L, B, and BmCl-1, a gut R. microplus cysteine endopeptidase [19], which suggests its role in tick blood digestion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the control of R. microplus cysteine proteases activities by cystatins remains essentially unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>In a previous work [22] we analyzed the sequence properties and immunogenicity of putative cystatins from R. microplus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>These cystatins showed a high degree of homology among Rhipicephalus spp., differential RNA expression patterns in tick tissues, as well as cross-reactivity between them, suggesting the existence of shared epitopes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The tick Ixodes ovatus geographic prevalence has been reported in Southeast Asia countries [23,24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Its main hosts are humans, and bite cases have been observed in Tibet, Burma, Nepal, Japan, and China [25]. Borrelia burgdorferi and Ehrlichia species, which are the causal agents of Lyme disease and ehrlichiosis, respectively, are transmitted by ixodid ticks, and I. ovatus was found to be infected with Borrelia and Ehrlichia species [26-28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>However, no human cases of Lyme disease and ehrlichiosis transmitted by I. ovatus have been confirmed to date [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Also, no cystatins were characterized for this tick species so far. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Tick control is a great challenge in livestock and public health management worldwide, and relies on the use of synthetic acaricides [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>In spite of that, vaccines have emerged as an interesting alternative method to decrease tick populations and the incidence of tick-borne diseases in the environment [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Since hosts in several regions are exposed to multi-tick infestation, the development of a single vaccine against multiple species may be advantageous in control strategies against these parasites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>A number of vaccination experiments showed the potential use of tick proteins to protect hosts against more than one tick species, demonstrating the feasibility of induction of cross-protection [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>These tick protective proteins are present in many physiological processes, like Bm86, a gut protein of unknown function [32]; glutathione-S transferase, an enzyme responsible to detoxification of cell xenobiotic compounds [33]; ferritins, iron-storage proteins [34]; a cement protein named 64TRP [35]; and subolesin, a gene-expression regulator [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>In fact, some of these tick antigens, such as Bm86 and its homologues, developed a higher protective host immune response to different tick species, rather than the tick species from which the antigen was isolated [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Vaccination trials using cystatins as antigens were performed against I. scapularis [37] and Ornithodoros moubata [16] infestations, showing the potential of these inhibitors to compose a vaccine against ticks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Despite the importance of cross antigenicity analysis as a preliminary step to detect multi-species antigen candidates, the potential of cross-protection induced by tick cystatins has yet to be analyzed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>In order to improve the understanding of the physiological roles of cystatins and the potential of these inhibitors as antigen in a multi-species vaccine, we characterized the inhibitory profile, tissue expression, and cross-antigenicity of a new I. ovatus cystatin, JpIocys2a, and two R. microplus cystatins, BrBmcys2b and BrBmcys2c. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The presence of these proteins in different tick tissues and their ability to differently inhibit cathepsins suggest distinct roles for JpIocys2a, BrBmcys2b, and BrBmcys2c in blood digestion and modulation of host immune response in tick physiology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The cross-antigenicity among cystatins from these two tick species paves the way for further experiments using JpIocys2a, BrBmcys2b, and BrBmcys2c as vaccine antigens. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>In ticks, however, only in recent years did cystatin roles begin to be elucidated [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>The main goals of these works were the characterization of cathepsin targets, tissue localization and immune system modulation by tick cystatins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>To date, no I. ovatus and only two R. microplus cystatin were biochemically characterized [5,50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>In the present work, we characterized the inhibition profile of one I. ovatus and two R. microplus cystatins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>To uncover the inhibitory profile of these cystatins, we selected three cysteine proteases involved in host hemoglobin proteolytic degradation cascade by ticks [51-53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>In enzymatic inhibition assays, rBrBmcys2b inhibited cathepsins B, C, and L activities, and was detected in all tissues and secretions analyzed, suggesting the broad enzymatic regulation by this inhibitor in R. microplus physiology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Among the tissues from partially engorged females analyzed, BrBmcys2c was detected only in gut, suggesting the role of BrBmcys2c in blood metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>A potential target for this cystatin could be BmCL1, VTDCE and/or RmLCE, cathepsins from R. microplus that were detected in tick gut during feeding stages [19,20,54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>The pattern of native BrBmcys2b and BrBmcys2c expression corroborates previous qPCR results, which showed a higher mRNA transcripts expression in gut, as compared to other tick tissues [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>The presence of BrBmcys2b in tissue that showed no transcription for this cystatin gene maybe the result of cystatin synthesis in gut, and its subsequent exportation to other tissues, similarly to other tick proteins [21,55,56]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>The presence in hemolymph of BrBmcys2b, but not BrBmcys2c, supports this hypothesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>JpIocys2a inhibited cathepsins B, C and L at different levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Cathepsin L and B were highly inhibited, when compared to C inhibition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>The phylogenetic tree analysis show that JpIocys2a grouped together with gut cystatins, indicating that JpIocys2a could be secreted in I. ovatus gut lumen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>In Ixodes ricinus blood digestion, cathepsins B and L hydrolyze hemoglobin secondary large fragments, whereas cathepsin C degrades it down to small fragments [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Therefore, JpIocys2a may have major importance during modulation of initial hemoglobin degradation in blood digestion by ticks. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>In vitro and in vivo experiments have demonstrated the role of tick cystatins in the modulation of host immune system components responsible for anti-parasite infestation [10,16,57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Similarly to Sialostatin L2 [37], rBrBmcys2b and rBrBmcys2c were not recognized by sera of tick-infested hosts (data not shown), indicating that the R. microplus cystatins are not immunogenic for bovines when inoculated through tick bite. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>The presence of BrBmcys2b in R. microplus saliva as well as its ability to inhibit cathepsin L suggests the participation of this cystatin in mechanisms to avoid host immune system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Cathepsin L is involved in mammal immune system process by MHC class II-presentation pathway regulation [58], as well as extracellular matrix breakdown during inflammation [59]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Cathepsin L secreted by macrophages inside tick feeding cavity would destroy host tissue elasticity, which is required for the effective parasite attachment [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of cathepsin L by secreted tick cystatins would help tick feeding, whereas the absence of these compounds would result in inflammation and parasite rejection due to the host’s immune response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>This outcome was observed in tick cystatin knock-down and vaccination experiments [8,10,16,37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Consequently, host cathepsin L inhibition would result in a weaker immune response against tick infestation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>The presence of BrBmcys2b in partially and fully engorged female ovary indicated that this cystatin is important during egg development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>In ovary, a vitellin degrading cysteine endopeptidase (VTDCE) that plays a crucial physiological role in egg maturation through vitellin mobilization [21,54] is a potential enzyme target for BrBmcys2b. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>In silico and in vitro comparative cross-antigenicity analyses of tick proteins, as CRTs [60], or GSTs [61], showed that, despite their high amino acid sequence conservation between homologues, these proteins display different immunodominant epitopes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, antibodies against CRT and GST from H. longicornis were able to recognize native and recombinant forms of R. microplus homologous proteins [60,61]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Moreover, when GST-Hl was used in a vaccination trial against R. microplus infestation in cattle, the number of engorged females decreased by around 50% [61]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>To select immunodominant epitopes to explore the potential of cystatin in an anti-tick vaccine, a peptide from JpIocys2a was synthesized based on their antigenicity and similarity with R. microplus cystatins, and used for rabbit immunization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>This approach seems to be interesting, because the immune response generated against designed peptide could be directed to immunodominant protective epitopes in native proteins. </plain></SENT>
