</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Sexual reproduction in plants results in the formation of two zygotes, the embryo and the endosperm, which together with maternal tissue form the seed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Sexual incompatibility between individuals of different species is commonly manifested by seed death, which is thought to depend on endosperm failure because the embryo can be rescued after microdissection [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Proper endosperm development in most angiosperms requires a 2:1 maternal:paternal contribution entailing multiple differentially contributed factors [2] including those resulting from genomic imprinting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Imprinting, the parent-of-origin dependent regulation of genes, ensues when one allele is preferentially expressed while the other allele is preferentially repressed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Expression bias manifested as down-regulation or complete suppression is associated with differential DNA methylation established by the coordinated action of methylating and demethylating pathways [3–6] such as is the case with imprinted gene MEDEA [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Differentially Methylated Regions (DMR) depending on parent of origin can be found in endosperm nuclear DNA, but not in embryo DNA, and are associated with genes that are preferentially expressed according to parent of origin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Another epigenetic pathway contributing to imprinting involves Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and is exemplified by regulation of PHERES1 [8,9], a paternally expressed gene (PEG) [10], whose suppression in the maternally-inherited allele requires FIS2, a PRC2 subunit protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>This regulation is likely to encompass multiple other PEGs [11,12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>At the same time, PRC2 contributes to regulation of maternally expressed genes, MEGs [10], exemplified by its action on the gene MEDEA, itself encoding a PRC2 subunit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Criteria to identify imprinted genes rely on expression and chromatin state [4,10–12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In A. thaliana, about 300 genes fit at least some of these criteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>A majority are maternally expressed and most are regulated in the endosperm [10,12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The observation of imprinted genes in endosperm is consistent with prevalence of imprinting in organs, such as the placenta, that nourish the embryo in mammals (reviewed in [13–15]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, while embryonic transcription has been reported to be biparental from early seed development [10,16], a temporal gradient involving paternal delay has also been detected [17–19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Indeed, a few genes are known to be imprinted in the embryo and developed sporophyte [11,20,21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Therefore, imprinting can evolve in non-nutritive tissues albeit at a low frequency. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Endosperm-dependent seed failure in interspecific crosses has fostered the hypothesis that parental conflict drove the evolution of imprinting as a means of balancing opposing interests over the allocation of resources to progeny [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Inconsistencies between predictions of the parental conflict hypothesis and experimental data have stimulated alternative hypotheses [23,24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>For example, Beaudet and Jiang [25] proposed that haploid advantage and selection for hypervariability at dosage-sensitive loci may drive rapid evolution of imprinting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Whatever the explanation, plants display considerable variation in gene imprinting: rice and Arabidopsis share few imprinted genes [20] and substantial divergence in imprinting is obvious between rice and maize [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Rapid evolution of imprinting programs is likely to cause incompatibility in crosses between divergent individuals, resulting in failure of the endosperm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this possibility, incompatibility between wild rice species and between Arabidopsis thaliana (At) and Arabidopsis arenosa (Aa) has been associated with subversion of imprinted gene regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In the latter system, seed death was associated with regulatory failure of two imprinted genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Josefsson et al. [27] found that PHERES1 (PHE1) misregulation is partially responsible for seed abortion in this interspecific cross as PHE1 is biparental in hybrid crosses and knocking out PHE1 significantly improved seed survival. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Because PHE1 is regulated by both the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 and DNA METHLYTRANSFERASE 1 (MET1), the aberrant transcription could result from either MET1 or PRC2 failure [27,28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In the same experiment, the maternally expressed gene (MEG) MEDEA (MEA) displayed partial paternal expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Following these findings, we set out to determine if there is a global loss of parentally biased gene expression in Arabidopsis wide-hybrids or if loss of imprinting is restricted to PHE1 and MEA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>We focused on two accessions of A. thaliana, Columbia (Col-0) and C24 (C24), which are known to display wide variation in hybridization success to A. arenosa (Aa) [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we wanted to determine if differential survival of Col-0 X A. arenosa (0%) and C24 X A. arenosa (~17%) is the result of aberrant parentally biased gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The expectation is that, if loss of imprinting underlies differential seed survival, there should be more severe parentally biased gene expression defects in incompatible Col-0 X A. arenosa hybrids. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>To identify aberrant gene expression, we sequenced RNA and used single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis to characterize the parent-of-origin of transcripts of intraspecific reciprocal crosses of accessions Col-0 and C24, and interspecific crosses of the same two accessions to A. arenosa, a close sister species of A. thaliana. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>We found that in Arabidopsis wide-hybrids RNAs of most PEGs shifted from paternally biased to maternal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>In addition to the previously reported PHE1, PEGs such as HOMEODOMAIN GLABROUS 3 (HDG3), ALPHA-FUCOSIDASE 1 (ATFX1), ADMETOS (ADM), displayed derepression of the maternal allele. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>At the same time more than 70 genes displayed unexpected paternal expression because they are not classified as PEGs in A. thaliana control intraspecific hybrids or in the literature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>We consider alternative explanations for the general derepression of paternally biased, maternally imprinted genes and activation of novel paternal genes. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>We examined the pattern of parentally regulated genes during interspecific hybridization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>We compared two polymorphic A. thaliana accessions crossed to each other or to the species A. arenosa, a cross in which the chosen accessions display differential incompatibility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Candidate imprinted genes are detected by genotyping allelic parental contribution to the mRNA of progeny. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>In our case, the interspecific comparison was facilitated because polymorphisms are at least 10 times as frequent as in the intraspecific comparison between A. thaliana accessions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>We chose to assay an early developmental stage, globular embryo at 3 DAP, because incompatibility manifests first at this time [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Each seed was sampled whole due to the challenge of separating the 90 to 120 endosperm nuclei from embryo and maternal seed integument tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Endosperm mRNA was thus obtained mixed with embryonic and maternal RNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Studies employing torpedo-stage seed (7–8 DAP) [10,11], could more easily separate endosperm from maternal tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>In our sampling, we expected that maternal contribution should appear enhanced and paternal contribution diluted for genes expressed in maternal tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Sampling of embryo mRNAs, which is currently believed to be maternally biased [17,18] or express a 50–50 mix of parental alleles [16], could also alter the measured parental bias. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, mRNAs representing paternal alleles was readily identified by their divergence, and could only result from zygotic tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Large paternal bias mRNAs should most likely derive from endosperm because imprinting is very rare in embryos. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>As a result, we could ascertain the effect of interspecific parental bias for paternally expressed genes including characterized imprinted genes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Our analysis revealed that paternally expressed genes were perturbed in response to hybridization, but that the degree of perturbation did not vary between crosses where the seed mother was incompatible accession Col-0 and compatible C24. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>In addition to PHERES1, at least nine known PEGs become maternally-biased during interspecific hybridization (Table 2 and Table 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Increased maternal expression could derive from maternal tissue, which is the same as in the intraspecific crosses, or by expression of the maternal allele in the endosperm, a hypothesis which we favor because it is more parsimonious. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Such conversion of PEGs into MEGs would be unexpected in the context of our current understanding of imprinting mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>PEG regulation involves expression of the paternal allele with concurrent suppression of the maternal one. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>Suppression of the female allele is thought to be the result of an epigenetic state determined in the female lineage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>Derepression of maternal alleles in these reverted loci indicates that this repressed epigenetic state is not hard set. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Rather, post-fertilization factors provided directly or indirectly by the male must be required to either maintain or determine the state. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, expression in A. arenosa sib-crosses could not be documented for most of the A. thaliana known PEGs that were found reverted in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>This could be a technical problem: for unknown reasons, seed and seedling stage RNA-seq libraries of A. arenosa are challenging to make and were produced only through multiple attempts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>As a result, there was lower overall sequencing coverage in this genotype and several of these genes might be expressed at low level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>In the case of PHERES1, however, reverse transcription PCR with A. arenosa-specific primers failed to demonstrate any expression during early A. arenosa seed development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>At least in the case of this gene, it is thus possible that the factor required for maternal PHERES1 suppression may be connected to the paternal PHERES1 transcript itself. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>Increasing the ploidy of the seed parent A. thaliana relieves the maternal induction of PHERES1 even though paternal PHERES1 mRNA is not observed [27], indicating that absence of the cognate paternal mRNA is not sufficient for maternal allele derepression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>Under incompatible conditions, therefore, a mechanism resulting in apparent overcompensation activates the maternal allele. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>Our observations can be interpreted in two ways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>According to the first explanation, it is possible that interspecific hybridization causes a systematic failure of PEG regulation leading to both the ectopic expression as PEGs of genes that are PEGs in either parental species, and to the conversion of most PEGs to MEGs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>Many of the changes observed during interspecific hybridization are consistent with failure of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) [31], which plays an important role in the regulation of imprinting [8,9,46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Failure of PRC2 could thus result in the syndrome described here. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>A second, alternative and perhaps additive explanation is based on rapid evolution of imprinted gene regulation [26,47,48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>Three PEG-candidates behaved as MEGs in our control intraspecific crosses: AT3G03980, AT5G39260, and AT5G59845. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>While conversion of PEGs to MEGs was not widespread in crosses between A. thaliana accessions, it is plausible that further divergence between A. thaliana and A. arenosa might contribute to the frequent conversion observed in interspecific crosses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>Further, Fig. 3-A illustrates the low correlation in paternal bias during reciprocal intraspecific crosses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, a better correlation is observed when different seed-parents are mated to the same pollen-parent of a different species (Fig. 3-B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>This suggests an important role for pollen parents in determining PEGs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>The eight failed PEGs, could thus be explained by the fact that these genes are not PEGs in A. arenosa. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>Seventy-seven additional genes behaved as PEGs in interspecific hybridization, although they were not detectable as PEGs in A. thaliana. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>We define these as A. arenosa PEG candidates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>Verification of their pattern of parental origin in A. arenosa x A. arenosa crosses was not attempted because this analysis is complicated by high heterozygosity in individuals of this species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>The set of A. arenosa PEG candidates are enriched for endosperm genes, including genes predicted to encode proteins whose categorical classification is consistent with that of imprinted genes, being significantly enriched for proteins involved in cell wall metabolism and cell growth (S5 Table) [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="?"><plain>Is the number of these potential PEGs too high, given that relatively few PEGs have been discovered in prior plant studies? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>Perhaps, PEG numbers have been underestimated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>Under rapidly evolving imprinting [26,48], reciprocal crosses of two diverged accessions could fail to identify genes that are imprinted in one and not in the other. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>Under this scenario of rapid evolution, one might expect to find similar variation in MEGs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>We did not focus on MEG regulation because of the presence of maternal tissue in our sample. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, conversion of MEGs to PEGs would have been readily detected by the appearance of characteristically A. arenosa alleles and we can thus feel confident that such conversion was not common. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>The instability of PEG regulation could result from differences in the evolutionary speed of regulatory innovation between PEGs and MEGs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the observed instability in paternally expressed genes during interspecific hybridization indicates either regulatory disruption or rapid evolution of imprinting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>While this is likely to represent a major hybridization barrier between diverging populations, the different phenotype displayed by A. thaliana accessions Col-0 and C24 during hybridization with A. arenosa could not be explained by differences in imprinted gene regulation. </plain></SENT>
