The DNPR registers all patient contacts with hospitals (public and private) in Denmark.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Administrative data include the unique person identification number given to all residents in Denmark (Central Person Register&#8212;CPR-number<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), hospital identification, date and time of activity, patient municipality, etc. Clinical data include types of surgical procedures (Nordic Classification of Surgical Procedures (NCSP)) and diagnoses (International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10)). Data were retrieved on all patients who underwent arthroscopic meniscus surgery (KNGD and all subcodes) either as a primary procedure or as part of other surgery in the years 2000 to 2011 (including both years). The CPR-number was used to track patients with several meniscal surgeries (defined as surgery on separate dates) in the study period. In total, 151&#8197;228 procedures were performed on 148&#8197;819 individual patients.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Data were extracted on age and sex together with hospital identification code for each contact, which enables linkage of performed procedures to specific public and private hospitals as well as geographic location. For regional differences, data were obtained from 2005 to 2011. The Regions in Denmark were first established in 2007 in a merger of different municipalities and counties, however, population data are available from 2005.</p><p>The DNPR has formed the basis for payment of public healthcare services performed at both public and private hospitals since the year 2000 via the Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) system in Denmark. It is assumed that registration is complete for these services at public and at private hospitals since 2000. However, for patient paid and private healthcare insurance paid services performed in the private sector, reporting is not complete even though this has been mandatory since 2003. In 2008, it was estimated by the Danish National Board of Health that 5% of all private surgeries were missing in the DNPR.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Registration of orthopaedic procedures has been reported to be correct in 92% of a sample of cases (inpatients and outpatients) and is even better for outpatients alone.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Arthroscopy codes from public hospitals were recently validated for cartilage injuries of the knee.

Mid-year population was estimated from numbers at the beginning and end of each year.

However, the proportion of procedures performed in the private sector increased from 1% in 2000 to 32% in 2011 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014006659F1">figure 1</xref>) and the private sector also accounted for the largest increase in total number of procedures, rising from 65 procedures in 2000 to 5478 in 2011. Still, the majority of meniscal procedures in Denmark are carried out in the public sector. In the same time interval, the number of private hospitals and clinics reporting to the DNPR in Denmark more than tripled from 16 in 2000 to 52 in 2011, with the largest increase observed in the Capital Region (from 7 to 24). Yearly incidence of arthroscopic meniscal procedures for the private sector in Denmark increased from 1 (95% CI 0.9 to 1.5) in 2000 to 98 (96 to 101) in 2011. The increase in incidence in the public sector in the same time period rose from 163 (159 to 166) to 213 (210 to 217). There was a significant difference (p&lt;0.001) in age distribution as the private sector performed 83% of the procedures in patients aged 35&#8197;years and older compared to 73% in the public sector (<xref rid="BMJOPEN2014006659TB1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2014006659TB1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#160;1</label><caption><p>Number of meniscal procedures distributed by age and public or private sector</p></caption></table-wrap><fig id="BMJOPEN2014006659F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#160;1</label><caption><p>Total number of meniscal procedures divided between public and private hospitals/clinics from 2000 to 2011 in Denmark.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2014006659f01"/></fig><p>Large regional differences were present (<xref rid="BMJOPEN2014006659TB2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>).

In Region North, the incidence at private hospitals increased while the incidence rate decreased at public hospitals. In 2011 more meniscal procedures were performed in the private sector than in the public sector in the Capital Region while the public sector still accounted for most procedures performed in all other regions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s5"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s5a"><title>Key results</title><p>We examined the distribution of public and private sector meniscal procedures performed in Denmark together with regional differences. Incidence of meniscal procedures rose in the public and in the private sectors but the proportion of procedures performed in the private sector increased from 1% to 32% over the 12-year period. In the same time period, the incidence of meniscal procedures performed in the public sector increased by 31%. The proportion of procedures performed in patients aged 35&#8197;years and older was larger in the private sector: 83% compared to 73% in the public sector. While the incidence was stable in two regions (Zealand and North), it increased markedly in the public as well as the private sector in the Capital Region and in the Region of Southern Denmark. In Region Mid the increase in incidence of procedures was observed exclusively in the private sector.</p></sec><sec id="s5b"><title>Interpretation</title><p>There may be several reasons for the increase in incidence of meniscal procedures performed in the public and private healthcare sectors in Denmark. The most obvious would be an increased incidence of meniscal tears, which could be caused by increased sports and exercise participation in the adult population. In Denmark, the proportion of adults who self-reported participation in sport and exercise increased from 50% to 64% from 1998 to 2011. The predominant activities reported were jogging (31% of adult population), strength training (24%) and hiking (23%),<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> none of these is recognised as a high risk activity for meniscal injury.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Even though increased participation in sports and exercise may not lead to direct injury, it may contribute to symptom onset in patients with latent degenerative knee disease such as degenerative meniscal tears. Thus, increased participation in sport and exercise may have caused an increased incidence on patient demand of care (ie, meniscal surgery) but is unlikely to be responsible for the large increase observed.</p><p>Another plausible reason includes financial reimbursement. In Denmark, the public sector and to some extent the private sector is paid according to the DRG rate. DRG is a classification system for patients originally developed in the USA but modified to fit the Danish diagnosis and treatment definitions.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> DRG rates represent prices for treatments within each group based on estimated average costs. This system was introduced in 1 January 2000. The DRG rate for arthroscopic knee surgery increased from 6502 DKK in 2000 to 10&#8197;483 in 2003 and was relatively stable thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014006659F2">figure 2</xref>). Payment per procedure provides a potential incentive for surgeons to provide more procedures because payment is dependent on the quantity of care rather than the quality and outcome of care. Indeed, financial reimbursement has been shown to influence surgical decision-making in the private sector because of greater financial incentives for surgeons.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> To the best of our knowledge, whether this could also be the case in the public sector, where the financial incentive lies within the department and not the individual surgeon, has not been investigated. Still, a concern remains that surgery in this context may be preferred when watchful waiting and/or physiotherapy is the other, less profitable alternative.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><fig id="BMJOPEN2014006659F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#160;2</label><caption><p>Trends of Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) rate (2000&#8211;2011), use of knee MRI examinations (2002&#8211;2011) and private health insurances (2003&#8211;2011).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2014006659f02"/></fig><p>Another potential cause is the political introduction of the &#8216;extended free hospital choice&#8217;, also known as the &#8216;treatment guarantee&#8217;, introduced in Denmark on 1 July 2002. The treatment guarantee allows patients to be treated at another public hospital or in the private sector if the initially chosen public hospital is not able to offer treatment within 2&#8197;months. This likely led to an increase in incidence of meniscal procedures performed in the private sector as well as in number of private hospitals and clinics in the period 2000 to 2011. The increase in incidence of meniscal procedures was further enhanced when the treatment guarantee was reduced to 1&#8197;month on 1 October 2007. In the public sector, there was a decline in incidence of meniscal procedures performed between 2006 and 2008, while in the same time period, a large increase in incidence of procedures was observed in the private sector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014006659F1">figure 1</xref>). This could represent patients &#8216;shifting&#8217; from the public to the private sector as a consequence of the treatment guarantee in combination with a nurses strike in the public sector from April to June 2008.</p><p>The proportion of the Danish population having private health insurance increased from 4% in 2003 to 24% in 2011 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014006659F2">figure 2</xref>). This likely facilitated access to surgery for those with private health insurance and may have contributed to the shifting of patients from the public to the private sector. Providing quick treatment for patients is often considered beneficial for early recovery and prognosis. However, in conditions where symptoms are known to fluctuate, such as in knee OA, quick access to surgery may actually not be advantageous since symptoms could remit without surgery. Indeed, for middle-aged and older patients, meniscal surgery is most often a resection of a degenerative meniscal tear.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The knee symptoms of these patients are likely related to degenerative knee disease rather than meniscal tear,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and it is recommended that the disease be treated according to clinical guidelines of knee OA with patient education, physiotherapy and weight loss if needed.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>MRI examinations of the knee are increasingly used in diagnosing meniscal pathology and could influence surgical decision-making by detecting previously undiagnosed meniscus tears in a painful knee. Meniscal tears visualised on MRI provide a persuasive indication for surgery for the surgeon and for the patient with a painful knee. Indeed, the use of MRI of the knee has increased fivefold between 2002 and 2011 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014006659F2">figure 2</xref>). However, positive findings on MRI are common also in asymptomatic individuals and even more common in knees with OA.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The increased use of MRI as a diagnostic tool could lead to treatment of patients whose symptoms are not related to a meniscal lesion, but to knee OA.</p><p>Even though financial incentives and the treatment guarantee seem plausible causes for the increased incidence of meniscal procedures, these causes are unlikely to account for the regional variations since regions share the same national reimbursement and healthcare policy. In the present study, we found large differences in incidence of meniscal procedures between regions, with the lowest incidence being 124/100&#8197;000 (116&#8211;131) in Region Zealand in 2011, compared to a three times greater incidence rate of 366 (357&#8211;375) in 2011 in the Capital Region. Large regional variations may suggest variations in surgeons&#8217; opinions about clinical indications for surgery. This is known for indications of knee arthroplasty.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> However, a systematic review showed little evidence of different beliefs in clinical indications as a cause of regional variations in use of coronary angiography, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and carotid endarterectomy.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> If different clinical indications are not the cause of regional variation then high surgical rates in some regions may be related to traditions in surgical training or a strong belief in a specific procedure.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In this study, we found a low incidence of meniscal surgery in Region North but a report on shoulder surgery in Denmark found a high incidence of shoulder arthroscopy in the same region compared to the other regions.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> It seems there is little correlation in regional rates of procedures even within the same specialty. Similar discrepancies have been found in the USA.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>Patient willingness to undergo surgery could be another cause of regional variation and has been reported to be higher in areas with higher incidence for knee arthroplasty.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> There may also be differences in the patient information given and in the willingness to incorporate the patients in the decision-making process of having surgery. These variations are also known to influence surgical rates.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>
<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p></sec><sec id="s5c"><title>Limitations</title><p>There are some limitations associated with our study. The DNPR does not differentiate between the regions patients reside in. It is possible that some patients received surgery in a Region other than their residential region. For instance, Region Zealand is closely related to the Capital Region and some patients may have chosen to be operated in a private hospital in the Capital Region. We assumed that registration in the DNPR has been complete for public hospitals since 2000. However, for private hospitals and clinics, reporting is not complete even though this has been mandatory since 2003. The Danish National Board of Health estimated that 5% of all private surgeries were missing in the DNPR.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Thus, numbers of procedures in the private sector may be underestimated in the present study and some of the changes observed may be due to variable completeness of reporting.</p></sec><sec id="s5d"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A large increase in the use of meniscal procedures at public and at private hospitals in Denmark was observed between 2000 and 2011. The increase was particularly conspicuous in the private sector, as the proportion of procedures performed increased from 1% to 32% over the investigated 12-year period. Potential causes for the observed increase include financial reimbursement and healthcare policies along with an increase in number of private health insurances and MRI examinations of the knee. Substantial regional differences were present in the utilisation rate and trend over time of meniscal procedures. The exact reasons for this remain unknown. The increasing use and regional variation of meniscal procedures in the middle-aged and elderly is notable given the uncertainty for added patient-centred benefit from the intervention.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> LSL and JBT conceived the study.
