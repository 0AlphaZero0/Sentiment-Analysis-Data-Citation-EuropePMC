</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Arthroscopy for meniscal tears is the most common orthopaedic procedure with at least 700 000 meniscal resections performed in the USA in 2006.1 A recent study reported a large increase in the number of meniscal procedures from 2000 to 2011 in Denmark.2 This increase was observed almost exclusively in middle-aged and older patients despite uncertainty of the added benefit provided by arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM) over non-surgical treatments on patient-reported knee pain and function in these age groups with or without osteoarthritis (OA).3–11 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The reason for the large increase in arthroscopic surgery for meniscal tears in Denmark is unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Danish media have reported an increase in the number and availability of hospitals and clinics in the private sector since 2005.12 In the USA, ambulatory surgery centres owned by physicians have surgical rates at least twice as high as outpatient surgery in public hospitals.13 14 In addition, higher mortality rates and payments have been observed in for-profit hospitals.15 16 In Denmark, public hospitals are also paid per service provided but the financial incentive for the individual surgeon is likely low as this does not affect individual surgeon salary. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, large regional differences have been reported in the use of surgical interventions.17 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>To further elucidate the increased use of arthroscopy for meniscal tears in Denmark, we examined the nation-wide distribution of meniscal procedures performed in the private and public sector in Denmark, as different incentives may be present and the use of these procedures may differ from region to region. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>We extracted data from The Danish National Patient Register (DNPR). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The DNPR registers all patient contacts with hospitals (public and private) in Denmark.18 Administrative data include the unique person identification number given to all residents in Denmark (Central Person Register—CPR-number19), hospital identification, date and time of activity, patient municipality, etc. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Clinical data include types of surgical procedures (Nordic Classification of Surgical Procedures (NCSP)) and diagnoses (International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Data were retrieved on all patients who underwent arthroscopic meniscus surgery (KNGD and all subcodes) either as a primary procedure or as part of other surgery in the years 2000 to 2011 (including both years). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The CPR-number was used to track patients with several meniscal surgeries (defined as surgery on separate dates) in the study period. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In total, 151 228 procedures were performed on 148 819 individual patients.2 Data were extracted on age and sex together with hospital identification code for each contact, which enables linkage of performed procedures to specific public and private hospitals as well as geographic location. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>For regional differences, data were obtained from 2005 to 2011. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The Regions in Denmark were first established in 2007 in a merger of different municipalities and counties, however, population data are available from 2005. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The DNPR has formed the basis for payment of public healthcare services performed at both public and private hospitals since the year 2000 via the Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) system in Denmark. </plain></SENT>

</text></p></sec><sec id="s5b"><title><text><SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Interpretation </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>There may be several reasons for the increase in incidence of meniscal procedures performed in the public and private healthcare sectors in Denmark. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>The most obvious would be an increased incidence of meniscal tears, which could be caused by increased sports and exercise participation in the adult population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>In Denmark, the proportion of adults who self-reported participation in sport and exercise increased from 50% to 64% from 1998 to 2011. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>The predominant activities reported were jogging (31% of adult population), strength training (24%) and hiking (23%),22 none of these is recognised as a high risk activity for meniscal injury.23 Even though increased participation in sports and exercise may not lead to direct injury, it may contribute to symptom onset in patients with latent degenerative knee disease such as degenerative meniscal tears. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Thus, increased participation in sport and exercise may have caused an increased incidence on patient demand of care (ie, meniscal surgery) but is unlikely to be responsible for the large increase observed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Another plausible reason includes financial reimbursement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>In Denmark, the public sector and to some extent the private sector is paid according to the DRG rate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>DRG is a classification system for patients originally developed in the USA but modified to fit the Danish diagnosis and treatment definitions.24 DRG rates represent prices for treatments within each group based on estimated average costs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>This system was introduced in 1 January 2000. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>The DRG rate for arthroscopic knee surgery increased from 6502 DKK in 2000 to 10 483 in 2003 and was relatively stable thereafter (figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Payment per procedure provides a potential incentive for surgeons to provide more procedures because payment is dependent on the quantity of care rather than the quality and outcome of care. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Indeed, financial reimbursement has been shown to influence surgical decision-making in the private sector because of greater financial incentives for surgeons.13 14 To the best of our knowledge, whether this could also be the case in the public sector, where the financial incentive lies within the department and not the individual surgeon, has not been investigated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Still, a concern remains that surgery in this context may be preferred when watchful waiting and/or physiotherapy is the other, less profitable alternative.18 </plain></SENT>

</text></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2014006659f02"/></fig></SecTag><p><text><SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Another potential cause is the political introduction of the ‘extended free hospital choice’, also known as the ‘treatment guarantee’, introduced in Denmark on 1 July 2002. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>The treatment guarantee allows patients to be treated at another public hospital or in the private sector if the initially chosen public hospital is not able to offer treatment within 2 months. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>This likely led to an increase in incidence of meniscal procedures performed in the private sector as well as in number of private hospitals and clinics in the period 2000 to 2011. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>The increase in incidence of meniscal procedures was further enhanced when the treatment guarantee was reduced to 1 month on 1 October 2007. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>In the public sector, there was a decline in incidence of meniscal procedures performed between 2006 and 2008, while in the same time period, a large increase in incidence of procedures was observed in the private sector (figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>This could represent patients ‘shifting’ from the public to the private sector as a consequence of the treatment guarantee in combination with a nurses strike in the public sector from April to June 2008. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>The proportion of the Danish population having private health insurance increased from 4% in 2003 to 24% in 2011 (figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>This likely facilitated access to surgery for those with private health insurance and may have contributed to the shifting of patients from the public to the private sector. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Providing quick treatment for patients is often considered beneficial for early recovery and prognosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>However, in conditions where symptoms are known to fluctuate, such as in knee OA, quick access to surgery may actually not be advantageous since symptoms could remit without surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Indeed, for middle-aged and older patients, meniscal surgery is most often a resection of a degenerative meniscal tear.2 The knee symptoms of these patients are likely related to degenerative knee disease rather than meniscal tear,25 and it is recommended that the disease be treated according to clinical guidelines of knee OA with patient education, physiotherapy and weight loss if needed.26 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>MRI examinations of the knee are increasingly used in diagnosing meniscal pathology and could influence surgical decision-making by detecting previously undiagnosed meniscus tears in a painful knee. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Meniscal tears visualised on MRI provide a persuasive indication for surgery for the surgeon and for the patient with a painful knee. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the use of MRI of the knee has increased fivefold between 2002 and 2011 (figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>However, positive findings on MRI are common also in asymptomatic individuals and even more common in knees with OA.27 28 The increased use of MRI as a diagnostic tool could lead to treatment of patients whose symptoms are not related to a meniscal lesion, but to knee OA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Even though financial incentives and the treatment guarantee seem plausible causes for the increased incidence of meniscal procedures, these causes are unlikely to account for the regional variations since regions share the same national reimbursement and healthcare policy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we found large differences in incidence of meniscal procedures between regions, with the lowest incidence being 124/100 000 (116–131) in Region Zealand in 2011, compared to a three times greater incidence rate of 366 (357–375) in 2011 in the Capital Region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Large regional variations may suggest variations in surgeons’ opinions about clinical indications for surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>This is known for indications of knee arthroplasty.29 However, a systematic review showed little evidence of different beliefs in clinical indications as a cause of regional variations in use of coronary angiography, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and carotid endarterectomy.30 If different clinical indications are not the cause of regional variation then high surgical rates in some regions may be related to traditions in surgical training or a strong belief in a specific procedure.31 32 In this study, we found a low incidence of meniscal surgery in Region North but a report on shoulder surgery in Denmark found a high incidence of shoulder arthroscopy in the same region compared to the other regions.33 It seems there is little correlation in regional rates of procedures even within the same specialty. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Patient willingness to undergo surgery could be another cause of regional variation and has been reported to be higher in areas with higher incidence for knee arthroplasty.34 There may also be differences in the patient information given and in the willingness to incorporate the patients in the decision-making process of having surgery. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>There are some limitations associated with our study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>The DNPR does not differentiate between the regions patients reside in. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>It is possible that some patients received surgery in a Region other than their residential region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>For instance, Region Zealand is closely related to the Capital Region and some patients may have chosen to be operated in a private hospital in the Capital Region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>We assumed that registration in the DNPR has been complete for public hospitals since 2000. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>However, for private hospitals and clinics, reporting is not complete even though this has been mandatory since 2003. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>The Danish National Board of Health estimated that 5% of all private surgeries were missing in the DNPR.18 Thus, numbers of procedures in the private sector may be underestimated in the present study and some of the changes observed may be due to variable completeness of reporting. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="s5d"><title><text><SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>A large increase in the use of meniscal procedures at public and at private hospitals in Denmark was observed between 2000 and 2011. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>The increase was particularly conspicuous in the private sector, as the proportion of procedures performed increased from 1% to 32% over the investigated 12-year period. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>Potential causes for the observed increase include financial reimbursement and healthcare policies along with an increase in number of private health insurances and MRI examinations of the knee. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Substantial regional differences were present in the utilisation rate and trend over time of meniscal procedures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>The exact reasons for this remain unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>The increasing use and regional variation of meniscal procedures in the middle-aged and elderly is notable given the uncertainty for added patient-centred benefit from the intervention. </plain></SENT>
