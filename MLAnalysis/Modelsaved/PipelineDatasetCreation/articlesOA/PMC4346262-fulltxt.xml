However, the qualitative and quantitative features of ACL MSCs isolated from younger and older individuals have not yet been compared directly. This study assessed the phenotypic and functional differences in ACL-MSCs isolated from younger and older donors and evaluated the correlation between ACL-MSC proportion and donor age. Torn ACL remnants were harvested from 36 patients undergoing ACL reconstruction (young: 29.67 &#177; 10.92 years) and 33 undergoing TKA (old: 67.96 &#177; 5.22 years) and the proportion of their MSCs were measured. The mean proportion of MSCs was slightly higher in older ACL samples of the TKA group than of the younger ACL reconstruction group (19.69 &#177; 8.57% vs. 15.33 &#177; 7.49%, p = 0.024), but the proportions of MSCs at passages 1 and 2 were similar. MSCs from both groups possessed comparable multilineage potentiality, as they could be differentiated into adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes at similar level. No significant correlations were observed between patient age and MSC proportions at passages 0&#8211;2 or between age and MSC proportion in both the ACL reconstruction and TKA groups. Multiple linear regression analysis found no significant predictor of MSC proportion including donor age for each passage. Microarray analysis identified several genes that were differentially regulated in ACL-MSCs from old TKA patients compared to young ACL reconstruction patients. Genes of interest encode components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and may thus play a crucial role in modulating tissue homeostasis, remodeling, and repair in response to damage or disease. In conclusion, the proportion of freshly isolated ACL-MSC was higher in elderly TKA patients than in younger patients with ACL tears, but their phenotypic and multilineage potential were comparable.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT &amp; Future Planning (NRF-2013R1A1A2A10010605, NRF-K20703001994-12A0500-03610, and NRF-2013M3A9D3045719).

While bone marrow is a good source of MSCs[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], these cells can also be isolated from other adult mesenchymal tissues, including fat[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], trabecular bone[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], synovium[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], synovial fluid[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As the torn ACL is usually discarded during ACL reconstruction, and degenerative ACL is removed during total knee arthroplasty (TKA), these removed tissues can be a potential source of MSCs.</p><p>Because the generation of multipotent ACL-derived MSCs capable of differentiating into target cells in a reproducible and controlled manner is critical to clinical success[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], the quality and purity of MSCs isolated from ACL tissues <italic>ex vivo</italic> are important. Despite the potential use of ACL-derived MSCs (ACL-MSC) in clinical applications, especially for providing cell sources for ligament and tendon reconstruction, little is known about the <italic>ex vivo</italic> properties of ACL-MSCs. Moreover, since the ages of patients who undergo ACL reconstruction and those who undergo TKA differ markedly, it is important to evaluate the effect of donor age on the proportion and multilineage potential of MSCs isolated from ACL tissue. To date, however, the qualitative and quantitative features of ACL-MSCs isolated from younger and older patients have not been compared directly. This study was therefore designed to assess the phenotypic and functional differences in ACL-MSCs isolated from younger and older donors, as well as the correlation between proportion of ACL-MSCs isolated and donor age. We hypothesized that the proportion of MSCs in ACL samples are higher in younger patients undergoing ACL reconstruction than in older patients undergoing TKA, and that the proportion of MSCs correlates negatively with donor age.</p><p>To further define differences between ACL-MSCs from TKA and ACL reconstruction patients, we compared the gene expression profiles of these MSCs using microarray analysis. Microarray analyses have been used to evaluate gene expression profiles in MSCs derived from various sources, such as synovium[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], meniscus, intraarticular ligament[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], bone marrow[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], umbilical cord[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and adipose tissue[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These studies suggest that genes participating in various biological, immunological and metabolic processes could be differentially regulated for stem cell survival, growth and development. The gene expression patterns of MSCs could reveal additional information on the effect of age on MSC properties and provide clues to improve the tissue regeneration potential of these MSCs for therapeutic applications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The ethical approval of this study protocol was granted by Institutional Review Board of the Korea Univerisity Anam Hospital (permit no.

Biotinylated cRNA samples were prepared from 550ng of total RNA using the Ambion Illumina RNA amplification kit (Ambion, Austin, USA) according to the manufacturer&#8217;s protocol. Then, 750 ng of labeled cRNA samples were hybridized to each human HT-12 expression v.4 bead array according to the manufacturer's instructions (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, USA). The array signal was detected using Amersham fluorolink streptavidin-Cy3 (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Little Chalfont, UK) according to the bead array manual. Arrays were scanned with an Illumina bead array Reader confocal scanner according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Contrary to our expectations, the principal findings of this study indicated that the proportion of freshly isolated ACL-MSCs was higher in the elderly TKA group than in the young ACL reconstruction group.</p><p>It remains unclear whether MSCs from older patients lack the abilities to expand and differentiate. Although several studies found that age had no effect on the properties of bone-marrow-derived MSCs, including colony-forming ability, adipogenesis, and calcification[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], other studies have reported that age affected cell proliferative capacity at passage 1, as well as the chondrogenic, osteogenic, and adipogenic differentiation ability of bone-marrow-derived MSCs[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. No obvious differences were observed in the yield or colony-forming efficiency of freshly isolated cells at passage 0 between bone-marrow-derived MSCs from younger and older donors[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Moreover, a recent study comparing the characteristics of MSCs derived from the synovium and subcutaneous fat found no notable age-associated differences in proliferative ability at passage 1 or multipotentiality[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To our knowledge, our study was the first to evaluate the impact of donor age on the proportion of ACL-derived MSCs. We found no significant differences in ACL MSC populations between younger patients undergoing ACL reconstruction and older patients undergoing TKA. Previously reported discrepancies on the effects of aging on MSC biological activity may be attributable to donor-related factors other than age, variations in culture conditions and/or MSC tissue sources, sampling site (bone marrow or ACL), and/or methods of isolating and/or quantifying MSC.</p><p>In contrast to our hypothesis, we found that aging had no effect on the proportion of ACL-MSCs. Rather, the MSC proportions at passage 0 were higher in older patients undergoing TKA than in younger patients undergoing ACL reconstruction. Several hypotheses can explain these results. For example, although disruption and loss of articular cartilage are hallmarks of knee osteoarthritis, this disease leads to degenerative and destructive changes in other intra-articular soft tissues, such as the synovium, meniscus, and ligament[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. MSCs in synovial fluid of osteoarthritic knees may originate from intra-articular soft tissue, including the ACL. These MSCs are thought to take part in tissue homeostasis, remodeling, and repair of damaged intra-articular structures in osteoarthritic knees. The severe osteoarthritis of patients in our TKA group may give rise to an increased number of MSCs with regenerative capacity, thus explaining, at least in part, the lack of aging effect on the proportion of ACL derived MSCs.</p><p>MSC characteristics can also be influenced by their peri-cellular environment as well as by the health of the organ in which they reside, suggesting that tissue cells may effectively influence the fate of MSCs and MSC derivatives[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, rupturing of the ACL in younger patients undergoing ACL reconstruction may affect the intra-articular environment, causing the release of MSCs from ruptured ACL fibers and changing &#8220;replicative cell senescence&#8221;. Finally, mild, undetectable inflammation in osteoarthritic knees may affect the proportion of ACL derived MSCs[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A postmortem study of 120 knee joints from patients aged 23 to 92 years found a positive correlation between ACL sheath inflammation and donor age, and between sheath inflammation and damage to cartilage[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Emerging evidence suggests that MSCs may contribute more to the repair of damaged tissue through the secretion of soluble factors that induce local cell regeneration than by direct induction of stem cell differentiation[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This paracrine effect may be due to an increase in the number of MSCs in the local environment where inflammation occurs.</p><p>Interestingly, we found that five genes were upregulated and six genes were downregulated in ACL-MSC samples from older patients undergoing TKA compared with those from younger patients. The relationship of most of these genes to ACL-MSCs from TKA and ACL reconstruction patients remains unclear; however, knowledge of the differential gene regulation could be helpful to clarify the mechanisms of tissue homeostasis, remodeling and repair modulated by MSCs in different age groups. Among the genes more highly expressed in ACL-MSCs from TKA patients compared to those from ACL reconstruction patients was the gene encoding proteoglycan 4 (PRG4). PRG4, or lubricin, is a component of the cartilage extracellular matrix and synovial fluid which participates in the lubrication of joints[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Since lubricin has been shown to protect against both age-related and post-traumatic osteoarthritis[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], it is surprising that in our study, PRG4 was found to be upregulated in patients who had developed osteoarthritis. This may represent a compensatory mechanism in TKA-MSC samples against osteoarthritis and could, in part, explain why the MSC proportion was higher in the TKA group. In addition, the expression of lubricin has been shown to be regulated by inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, TNF-&#945;, TGF-&#946; and BMP-7[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In both a rat model and in humans, reduced levels of lubricin in the synovial fluid has been linked with ACL rupture-associated joint inflammation[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This indicates another possibility that the inflammatory cascade could have mediated downregulation of lubricin after ACL rupture in ACL reconstruction patients. Another gene that was upregulated in ACL-MSCs from TKA patients compared to ACL reconstruction patients was thrombospondin 4 (THBS4). THBS4 encodes a component of the ECM in tendons and ligaments which mediates cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions within the ECM[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Lack of THBS4 was shown to negatively affect the organization, composition and functions of tendons and muscles, indicating that THBS4 was an important regulator of the ECM composition in these tissues[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The higher expression of THBS4 in TKA patients was also unexpected but it does lend support to our finding that the MSC proportion was higher in TKA patients compared to ACL reconstruction patients. It is possible that the expression of THBS4 in TKA patients was increased for better ECM remodeling in response to tissue damage. Interestingly, integrin beta 2 (ITGB2), a receptor for THBS4, was downregulated in ACL-MSCs of TKA patients. Studies have shown that ITGB2 interacted with THBS4 in the regulation of inflammation[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Furthermore, synovial membrane tissues from dogs with cranial cruciate ligament rupture showed increased levels of ITGB2[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Another study reported that ITGB2 deficiency predisposes mice to osteoporosis, thus highlighting the connection between ITGB2 and bone development[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In summary, the microarray data provide deeper insight into the gene regulation of ACL-MSCs associated with the integrative healing processes required for repair in injured or diseased tissue while maintaining similar differentiation potentials.</p><p>This study had several limitations, including its cross-sectional design, which may be associated with a risk of reverse causality[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Samples from the patients who had undergone ACL reconstruction were damaged[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Although we attempted to obtain samples of intact ACL rather than from the rupture site, we could not entirely exclude the latter. Because of their rich vascularity, ruptured sites possess more stem cells than the mid-substance region of the ligament[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which may affect the proportion of MSCs in freshly extracted samples (passage 0), especially in the ACL tear group. Furthermore, ACL samples from the TKA group may not be representative of the normal aging population without osteoarthritis[<xref rid="pone.0117224.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Another limitation was the large female predominance in the TKA group. The female predominance in TKA has been observed universally across countries. However, this female predominant patient grouping may increase the multicollinearity, although the all VIF and Rj2 value for independent parameters in our study were relatively low (VIF&lt;1.5, Rj2&lt;0.3). Finally, we did not confirm that our marker criteria (CD34<sup>&#8722;</sup>/CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD90<sup>+</sup>) actually identified only MSCs; markers specific to MSCs have not been defined. However, we quantified MSCs as cells simultaneously satisfying the four surface marker criteria, whereas most previous studies of MSCs reported the percentage of each surface marker separately.</p><p>Despite these limitations, this study is the first to compare ACL-derived MSCs between young (ACL reconstruction group) and old (TKA group) patients. The results of the study showed that ACL-derived MSCs have similar differentiation potentials regardless of donor age. Given that ACL reconstruction and TKA are the most common operations performed around the world, our results suggest the possibility of using discarded ACL as a safe cell source for MSC production.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the proportion of freshly isolated ACL-MSCs was higher in older patients with osteoarthritis than in younger patients with ACL tears, but their phenotypic and multilineage potential were comparable.
