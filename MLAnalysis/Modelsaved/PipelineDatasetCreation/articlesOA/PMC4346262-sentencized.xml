</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the properties of self-renewal, high proliferative capacity and inherent multilineage differentiation potential, suggesting their possible use for tissue regeneration or repair of damaged tissue[1,2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>While bone marrow is a good source of MSCs[3], these cells can also be isolated from other adult mesenchymal tissues, including fat[4], trabecular bone[5], synovium[6], synovial fluid[7], and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)[8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>As the torn ACL is usually discarded during ACL reconstruction, and degenerative ACL is removed during total knee arthroplasty (TKA), these removed tissues can be a potential source of MSCs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Because the generation of multipotent ACL-derived MSCs capable of differentiating into target cells in a reproducible and controlled manner is critical to clinical success[9], the quality and purity of MSCs isolated from ACL tissues ex vivo are important. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Despite the potential use of ACL-derived MSCs (ACL-MSC) in clinical applications, especially for providing cell sources for ligament and tendon reconstruction, little is known about the ex vivo properties of ACL-MSCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Moreover, since the ages of patients who undergo ACL reconstruction and those who undergo TKA differ markedly, it is important to evaluate the effect of donor age on the proportion and multilineage potential of MSCs isolated from ACL tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>To date, however, the qualitative and quantitative features of ACL-MSCs isolated from younger and older patients have not been compared directly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>This study was therefore designed to assess the phenotypic and functional differences in ACL-MSCs isolated from younger and older donors, as well as the correlation between proportion of ACL-MSCs isolated and donor age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the proportion of MSCs in ACL samples are higher in younger patients undergoing ACL reconstruction than in older patients undergoing TKA, and that the proportion of MSCs correlates negatively with donor age. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>To further define differences between ACL-MSCs from TKA and ACL reconstruction patients, we compared the gene expression profiles of these MSCs using microarray analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Microarray analyses have been used to evaluate gene expression profiles in MSCs derived from various sources, such as synovium[10,11], meniscus, intraarticular ligament[12], bone marrow[13], umbilical cord[14], and adipose tissue[15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that genes participating in various biological, immunological and metabolic processes could be differentially regulated for stem cell survival, growth and development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The gene expression patterns of MSCs could reveal additional information on the effect of age on MSC properties and provide clues to improve the tissue regeneration potential of these MSCs for therapeutic applications. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Contrary to our expectations, the principal findings of this study indicated that the proportion of freshly isolated ACL-MSCs was higher in the elderly TKA group than in the young ACL reconstruction group. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>It remains unclear whether MSCs from older patients lack the abilities to expand and differentiate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Although several studies found that age had no effect on the properties of bone-marrow-derived MSCs, including colony-forming ability, adipogenesis, and calcification[18], other studies have reported that age affected cell proliferative capacity at passage 1, as well as the chondrogenic, osteogenic, and adipogenic differentiation ability of bone-marrow-derived MSCs[19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>No obvious differences were observed in the yield or colony-forming efficiency of freshly isolated cells at passage 0 between bone-marrow-derived MSCs from younger and older donors[20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a recent study comparing the characteristics of MSCs derived from the synovium and subcutaneous fat found no notable age-associated differences in proliferative ability at passage 1 or multipotentiality[21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, our study was the first to evaluate the impact of donor age on the proportion of ACL-derived MSCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>We found no significant differences in ACL MSC populations between younger patients undergoing ACL reconstruction and older patients undergoing TKA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Previously reported discrepancies on the effects of aging on MSC biological activity may be attributable to donor-related factors other than age, variations in culture conditions and/or MSC tissue sources, sampling site (bone marrow or ACL), and/or methods of isolating and/or quantifying MSC. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>In contrast to our hypothesis, we found that aging had no effect on the proportion of ACL-MSCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Rather, the MSC proportions at passage 0 were higher in older patients undergoing TKA than in younger patients undergoing ACL reconstruction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Several hypotheses can explain these results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>For example, although disruption and loss of articular cartilage are hallmarks of knee osteoarthritis, this disease leads to degenerative and destructive changes in other intra-articular soft tissues, such as the synovium, meniscus, and ligament[22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>MSCs in synovial fluid of osteoarthritic knees may originate from intra-articular soft tissue, including the ACL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>These MSCs are thought to take part in tissue homeostasis, remodeling, and repair of damaged intra-articular structures in osteoarthritic knees. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>The severe osteoarthritis of patients in our TKA group may give rise to an increased number of MSCs with regenerative capacity, thus explaining, at least in part, the lack of aging effect on the proportion of ACL derived MSCs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>MSC characteristics can also be influenced by their peri-cellular environment as well as by the health of the organ in which they reside, suggesting that tissue cells may effectively influence the fate of MSCs and MSC derivatives[23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Therefore, rupturing of the ACL in younger patients undergoing ACL reconstruction may affect the intra-articular environment, causing the release of MSCs from ruptured ACL fibers and changing “replicative cell senescence”. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Finally, mild, undetectable inflammation in osteoarthritic knees may affect the proportion of ACL derived MSCs[11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>A postmortem study of 120 knee joints from patients aged 23 to 92 years found a positive correlation between ACL sheath inflammation and donor age, and between sheath inflammation and damage to cartilage[24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Emerging evidence suggests that MSCs may contribute more to the repair of damaged tissue through the secretion of soluble factors that induce local cell regeneration than by direct induction of stem cell differentiation[25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>This paracrine effect may be due to an increase in the number of MSCs in the local environment where inflammation occurs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we found that five genes were upregulated and six genes were downregulated in ACL-MSC samples from older patients undergoing TKA compared with those from younger patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>The relationship of most of these genes to ACL-MSCs from TKA and ACL reconstruction patients remains unclear; however, knowledge of the differential gene regulation could be helpful to clarify the mechanisms of tissue homeostasis, remodeling and repair modulated by MSCs in different age groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Among the genes more highly expressed in ACL-MSCs from TKA patients compared to those from ACL reconstruction patients was the gene encoding proteoglycan 4 (PRG4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>PRG4, or lubricin, is a component of the cartilage extracellular matrix and synovial fluid which participates in the lubrication of joints[26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Since lubricin has been shown to protect against both age-related and post-traumatic osteoarthritis[27], it is surprising that in our study, PRG4 was found to be upregulated in patients who had developed osteoarthritis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>This may represent a compensatory mechanism in TKA-MSC samples against osteoarthritis and could, in part, explain why the MSC proportion was higher in the TKA group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>In addition, the expression of lubricin has been shown to be regulated by inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, TNF-α, TGF-β and BMP-7[28–30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>In both a rat model and in humans, reduced levels of lubricin in the synovial fluid has been linked with ACL rupture-associated joint inflammation[31,32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>This indicates another possibility that the inflammatory cascade could have mediated downregulation of lubricin after ACL rupture in ACL reconstruction patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Another gene that was upregulated in ACL-MSCs from TKA patients compared to ACL reconstruction patients was thrombospondin 4 (THBS4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>THBS4 encodes a component of the ECM in tendons and ligaments which mediates cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions within the ECM[33,34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Lack of THBS4 was shown to negatively affect the organization, composition and functions of tendons and muscles, indicating that THBS4 was an important regulator of the ECM composition in these tissues[35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>The higher expression of THBS4 in TKA patients was also unexpected but it does lend support to our finding that the MSC proportion was higher in TKA patients compared to ACL reconstruction patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>It is possible that the expression of THBS4 in TKA patients was increased for better ECM remodeling in response to tissue damage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, integrin beta 2 (ITGB2), a receptor for THBS4, was downregulated in ACL-MSCs of TKA patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Studies have shown that ITGB2 interacted with THBS4 in the regulation of inflammation[36,37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, synovial membrane tissues from dogs with cranial cruciate ligament rupture showed increased levels of ITGB2[38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Another study reported that ITGB2 deficiency predisposes mice to osteoporosis, thus highlighting the connection between ITGB2 and bone development[39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>In summary, the microarray data provide deeper insight into the gene regulation of ACL-MSCs associated with the integrative healing processes required for repair in injured or diseased tissue while maintaining similar differentiation potentials. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>This study had several limitations, including its cross-sectional design, which may be associated with a risk of reverse causality[22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Samples from the patients who had undergone ACL reconstruction were damaged[8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Although we attempted to obtain samples of intact ACL rather than from the rupture site, we could not entirely exclude the latter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Because of their rich vascularity, ruptured sites possess more stem cells than the mid-substance region of the ligament[17], which may affect the proportion of MSCs in freshly extracted samples (passage 0), especially in the ACL tear group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ACL samples from the TKA group may not be representative of the normal aging population without osteoarthritis[18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Another limitation was the large female predominance in the TKA group. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Microarray data revealed differences at a genetic level between ACL-MSCs from old and young patients, indicating that differences in the regulation of genes, in particular those encoding ECM components, could be involved in the rate of tissue repair or regeneration modulated by MSCs in different age groups. </plain></SENT>
