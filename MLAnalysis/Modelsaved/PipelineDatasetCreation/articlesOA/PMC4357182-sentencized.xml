</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The genus Salix L. of Salicaceae, commonly known as willows, consists of some 450–520 species, is distributed mainly in the Northern Hemisphere, and is one of the main groups of trees and shrubs in the North Temperate Zone [1-3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Because of their diversity, and because Salix species form an important resource for innumerable insect and mammalian herbivores [1,3], there is a clear need for understanding the evolutionary history of the group. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, the taxonomy and systematics of Salix have proven extremely difficult because of their dioecious reproduction, simple flowers, common natural hybridization, and large intraspecific phenotypic variation [1,3-5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Reflecting these difficulties, Salix was once split into at least 35 genera (as reviewed by Argus [6]), but numerous molecular-phylogenetic studies have shown that Salix is a robust monophyletic group that encompasses all of the putative generic segregates [7-11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>This indicates that Salix is a natural group that should not be further split at the generic level, and so some recent systems e.g., [1,12] have opted to treat segregate genera, such as Chosenia and Toisusu, as members of Salix. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>A widely used Salix classification system was proposed by Skvortsov in 1968 ([13]; revised and translated into English in 1999 [3]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In this system, he divided the Salicaceae into three genera, Populus, Chosenia, and Salix. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Within Salix, Skvortsov recognized three subgenera: Salix, Chamaetia, and Vetrix. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>He also suggested that the subgenera Urbaniana and Longifoliae could be recognized, but did not do so. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Because subgenus Salix as used by Skvortsov was later divided into several smaller subgenera, for the convenience of discussion, we will below refer to it as subgenus Salix s.l. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Subgenus Salix s.l. is primarily distributed in the warm Temperate Zone and partially in tropical regions (Figure 1) [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The subgeneric and especially sectional division of subgenus Salix s.l. is in a chaos: section names and their delimitation in different systematic treatments differ, a main reason being that most systems are based on localized floras. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, different systems of subgenus Salix s.l. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>(as well as Salix on the subgeneric level) use bud-scale morphology (margin free or connate) and the number of stamens (two or multiple) as important criteria [1,3,4], but whether taxa classified according to these two traits are reasonable remains unknown.Figure 1 Geographic distributions of the main lineages of Salix .  </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>After summarizing the main recent Salix systems [1-3,12], we found that subgenus Salix s.l. contains approximately 128 species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Most of them (109) are distributed in the Old World, and are placed into seven sections: Tetraspermae, Urbanianae (= subgenus Pleuradenia), Wilsonia, Pentandrae, Triandrae, Octandrae, and Salix (sometimes split into Subalbae and Salix). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Only 19 species are found in the New World; these belong to the five sections Longifoliae (= subgenus Longifoliae), Humboldtianae, Floridanae, Maccallianae, and Salicaster. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>However, while each section in this classification is found only in the New or Old World, morphological differences among species and sections are small. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>For example, the Old World sections Tetraspermae and Pentandrae appear to be closely related to the New World sections Humboldtianae and Salicaster, respectively, and Argus [1] treated section Pentandrae as a synonym of Salicaster, and section Tetraspermae as a synonym of Humboldtianae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Skvortsov’s sections Humboldtianae and Pentandrae likewise contain both New and Old World species. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Skvortsov [3] postulated that the subgenera Chamaetia and Vetrix are more closely related to each other than either is to subgenus Salix, and that subgenus Salix is a natural group, having the most in common with Populus and exhibiting “primitive” features in the structure of bracts, nectaries, androecium, and gynoecium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>However, recent molecular-phylogenetic studies have cast doubt on the monophyly of subgenus Salix s.l. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>[8,9,11] and, based on morphological characters, the group has also been divided into at least five widely accepted subgenera: Chosenia and Pleuradenia, each containing only one species [12]; Longifoliae, with 8 species [1]; Protitea, with 33 species [1,12,14]; and Salix, with 85 species [1] (we refer to Argus’s [1] subgenus Salix as subgenus Salix s.str., in contrast to Skvortsov’s subgenus Salix s.l.). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>In Kimura’s [14] Salix system, subgenus Chosenia is a synonym of subgenus Pleuradenia. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The composition and further division of subgenus Salix s.l. is therefore a central issue in the systematics of Salix. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>However, sparse taxon sampling and use of low numbers of DNA markers in previous molecular-phylogenetic studies have led to restricted understanding of the classification and systematics within the group [9,15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Our former study [9] also revealed a disjunct distribution pattern in the main clade of subgenus Salix s.l., so that Old and New Word species formed robust clades. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the subgenera Chamaetia and Vetrix, which also formed a robust monophyletic group, did not present similar trans-continental disjunctions in their (widely overlapping) geographic ranges (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>The low density of sampling of subgenus Salix s.l. representatives in the study unfortunately left the reliability of, and the reasons for, the disjunct distribution pattern unknown. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined representatives covering all major clades of Salix and all sections of subgenus Salix s.l. using six DNA regions: external transcribed spacer (ETS) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA), and partial sequences of the rbcL and matK genes, and atpB–rbcL and trnD–T non-coding spacers of plasmid chloroplast DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>The main aims of our study were to: (1) establish a phylogeny of Salix subgenus Salix s.l. in order to evaluate the correctness and utility of present classification systems, (2) identify possible inconsistencies between nrDNA and plastid phylogenies, and to explore possible causes for it, (3) estimate the divergence times of the major clades of Salix, in order to explain their current distribution patterns, and (4) assess the value of the two most important characters used in classification and systematics of Salix, i.e., bud scale morphology and stamen number. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Subgenus Pleuradenia and section Triandrae fell out this main F clade of subgenus Salix s.l.: two species of the latter (S. triandra and S. triandroides) formed a robust monophyletic group (clade B) as sister to a clade formed by subgenus Pleuradenia (clade A) and a robust monophyletic group (clade H) that includes all species of subgenera Chamaetia and Vetrix as well as three species of section Salix (S. bangongensis, S. qinghaiensis, and S. sericocarpa) and one species of section Triandrae (S. songarica). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>Instead, the incongruent phylogenies may be caused mainly by biological factors, including horizontal gene transfer (HGT), undetected paralogs, incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), and hybridization/introgression [23,26]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>The divergence times of the main clade of New and Old World subgenus Salix s.l. and subgenera Chamaetia and Vetrix were estimated at 33.99 (about early Oligocene) and 23.76 mya (about lower Oligocene), respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>During the middle of the upper Oligocene, the physical continuity of the Bering Land Bridge (BLB) is certain, but questioned for the North Atlantic Bridge (NALB) [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>However, while paratropical groups presumably could exchange rather freely across the BLB during the early Paleocene and Eocene, intercontinental dispersal of such thermophilic elements was increasingly restricted by subsequent climatic cooling [35,36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Extant representatives of subgenus Salix s.l. mostly inhabit sub-tropical and partially tropical regions (Figure 1), and it is therefore reasonable to assume that the subgenus was ancestrally adapted to temperate conditions, and that they could disperse freely between the New and Old Worlds via the BLB only during their early history. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, willow seeds have fine hairs and can travel hundreds of kilometers by air, and Salix species in the Svalbard archipelago have colonized the islands by repeated long-distance dispersal from Scandinavia [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Hence, the possibility of dispersal between the New and Old Worlds by island-hopping via the NALB during the Eocene and Oligocene boundary cannot be ruled out. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>However, regardless of the exact route taken, subsequent climatic cooling in the Tertiary cut off the floral exchange between New and Old World lineages of subgenus Salix s.l., resulting in the intercontinental disjunction pattern seen in our phylogenetic trees. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>By contrast, most species of the subgenus Chamaetia and some species of Vetrix are Arctic–Alpine taxa that are well adapted to cold, hostile environments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Floristic migrations over the BLB were primarily controlled by climate in most of the Cenozoic [38,39], and large parts of the Arctic and Subarctic in northwest America and eastern Siberia (i.e., Beringia) were never glaciated [38,40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>These factors indicate that the climatic cooling of the late Tertiary [36] facilitated intercontinental gene exchange within the cold-adapted subgenera Chamaetia and Vetrix, and also resulted in widely Holarctic distributions in many extant species within subgenus Chamaetia. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>The number of stamens has been thought to be a key trait reflecting the evolutionary history of Salix, and it is still one of the main characters used in the classification of Salix at the subgeneric level [1,3,12,41,42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Stamen number within Salix varies from 2 to 12, with filaments being either free or partly to completely connate [2], but only 49 Salix species (~10%) have multiple stamens [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Our results revealed a trend of reduction in stamen number from multiple to two in several different lineages of Salix. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>As a result, stamen number states are paraphyletic across the phylogenetic tree, and the frequent changes indicate that the number of stamens constitutes an unreliable basis for Salix classification. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, it seems that stamen number is related to species diversity in different Salix lineages, because the subgenera Chamaetia and Vetrix, which together account for ~73% of the species within the genus, all have two stamens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Pollination in Salix is almost exclusively performed by insects [3], and insect pollination predominates also in the few species that are ambophilous [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Because male flowers reward biotic pollinators with both pollen and nectar, while females only produce nectar, some biotic pollinators might discriminate against female flowers, resulting in reduced female fertility and favoring the evolution of wind pollination or pollination by less-discriminating pollinators [44,45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Pollinator discrimination can also be avoided by female flowers by producing more nectar than male flowers [46-48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Here we speculate that the reduction of stamen number might be an alternative adaptation, in that it may reduce pollen production and therefore might be favored by natural selection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Reductions in the number of stamens may also allow more precise pollen transfer by specialist insect pollinators and, consequently, lead to less expense of pollen and nectar [49-51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>This type of selective advantage of specialist pollination may have played an important role in the diversification of Salix, and could partly result in unequal species diversity in different Salix lineages. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Our nrDNA and plastid trees revealed that, while the genus Salix constitutes a robust monophyletic group, this is not the case for subgenus Salix s.l. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Among the subgenera previously split from subgenus Salix s.l., only Longifoliae and Pleuradenia are supported as being monophyletic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>The delimitation of subgenus Salix s.l. should be redefined so that sections Triandrae and Urbanianae (= subgenus Pleuradenia), as well as a few additional species (S. bangongensis, S. qinghaiensis, S. sericocarpa, and S. songarica), are excluded from it. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Our phylogeny-based ancestral-state reconstructions indicated that the presence of multiple stamens and free bud scales are plesiomorphic within Salix, but also that shifts from multiple to two stamens and from free to connate bud-scale margins have occurred repeatedly; this means that these traditionally used morphological traits constitute an unreliable basis for subgenus-level classifications. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Extensive gene-tree conflicts between nrDNA and plastid phylogenies as well as between nrDNA ETS and ITS regions primarily appear to be due to hybridization and reticulate evolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>This interpretation is in line with the recent results of Percy et al. [5], who found widespread sharing of plastid haplotypes and even signs of possible trans-specific selective sweeps within Salix. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>In the plastid tree, Old and New World representatives of the main clade of subgenus Salix s.l. are reciprocally monophyletic; our biogeographic analysis based on a fossil-calibrated phylogenetic tree indicates that the disjunction results from climatic cooling during the late Tertiary, which cut off northern dispersal routes and, hence, genetic exchange between the continents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>By contrast, in the more cold-tolerant subgenera Chamaetia and Vetrix, continuous floristic exchange via the BLB and/or NALB apparently prevented the formation of similar disjunctions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>In the future, detailed genus-level phylogenetic analyses of Salix could provide important insights into the historical roles of the BLB and NALB as climatic filters for dispersal in lineages with different thermal tolerances (cf. [36]). </plain></SENT>
