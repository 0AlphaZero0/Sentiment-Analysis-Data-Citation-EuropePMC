</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Functional analyses of genomic features, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massive parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) [1,2], have quickly been recognized as useful tools for examining the components that modulate chromatin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The integration of epigenetic information with genome sequences is essential for a complete understanding of genome organization and function [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Massive parallel sequencing allows researchers to identify DNA sequences associated with particular chromatin functions such as protein binding, DNA replication initiation or transcriptional activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>These experiments reveal where distinct chromatin modifications occur and provide clues to the function of protein-DNA interactions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Several combined community efforts have amassed datasets of chromatin features that are publically available and can be used to show the relationship between certain nuclear elements and functional output [2,4,5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>These datasets help to categorize genomic regions and assist in the deconvolution of the relationships between genetic sequences and complex human biology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The many different cell-types and differentiation states that can arise from a single human genome emphasize the importance of epigenetic regulation that controls biological outcome. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>One technique to understand the role that nuclear elements play in controlling genome function and organization is to compare the locations of genomic regions involved in particular interactions with the locations other known elements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Tools that perform analyses of this kind are available on software suites and within bioinformatic pipeline packages [6,7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Some tools can compare user-provided lists of regions, but are limited to general genome annotations (e.g. transcriptional start sites (TSS) and CpG islands (CGI)) [8,9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Others are web-based, and allow users to compare input files to available chromatin features, but lack a graphical output that provides a continuous representation of colocalization over a sliding window [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Further, these tools provide one-way analyses and do not allow for reciprocal comparisons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The tool described below, ColoWeb, is a web-based tool that allows researchers to submit files containing genomic regions and then quantifies the extent of association between the provided regions and previously identified genome-wide features. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>ColoWeb is a web-based application that accepts a region of interest (ROI) file from users in .bed format. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Generally ROI files contain thousands of genomic locations of a particular biological event produced from a peak selection program. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The submitted ROIs are compared to a cell line-specific library of genomic features obtained from the UCSC Genome Browser [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>If the pre-built features are not appropriate for a particular study, users may upload a genomic feature file in .bed format along with their ROI file. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>For each genomic feature, colocation analysis is performed to identify how often and in what spatial pattern the feature is in proximity to the user submitted ROIs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>ColoWeb produces a feature density image, histogram, and several summary statistics for each feature that quantify colocalization. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="Sec3"><title><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Analysis </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>ColoWeb is designed for rapid genome-wide analysis of many genomic features. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>A pre-built library of genomic features is created by an automated process that downloads features from UCSC Genome Browser, splits features into a file per chromosome, and generates summary statistics for the feature (number of features, average width, etc.). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Each pre-built per chromosome feature can be quickly loaded into a binned array in memory to support rapid lookup of any location in the chromosome and identify features within a given window size of the lookup location. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>When a user submits a ROI file, the following analysis steps are performed for each genomic feature analyzed (Figure 1):Figure 1Architecture and analysis flow of ColoWeb. A pre-built library of cell line specific genomic features split by chromosome is automatically built using data pulled from the UCSC Genome browser. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Users submit a region of interest file via their browser to our Tomcat server. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>An analysis thread is started for each user request. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The thread analyses a series of genomic features one at a time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Binned feature arrays tuned to the size of the analysis window are used to efficiently construct a density matrix of feature totals relative to the center of submitted regions (center matrix column). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Column totals from the density matrix are normalized and summarized into a histogram. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Colocation statistics including % of regions colocalized, peak height, AMI, and BMI are calculated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>An empirical p_value for the AMI is calculated by repeated random permutation of features. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Graphical and quantitative results for each genomic feature are placed in a user specific session cache and returned to the user via AJAX as analysis of each feature completes.A feature density matrix is created. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Each row of the matrix contains 100 bins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>The number of base pairs in each bin is determined by the user configurable window size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>If the user selects a 20,000 bp window, then each bin will cover 200 bases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The matrix has 100 rows, each summarizing 1/100th of the user submitted ROIs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>For example, if the user submits 5000 regions, then each row will summarize 50 ROIs.From the center of each user submitted region, a lookup is performed to find bins within the analysis window size that contain the genomic feature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>The center of a matrix row represents the center of the user ROI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>The total in the appropriate bins are incremented when a genomic feature is found in the bin position relative to the user ROI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>The generated density matrix is present to user as an image. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>The shading of the image is scaled based on the highest bin total in the image with dark areas indicating a high density of features.A histogram is created by summing the columns of the density matrix into a single line chart of the total genomic features observed relative to the center of the user ROIs for the selected window size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>To facilitate cross-feature and cross-sample analysis, feature totals are normalized by the number of user regions (totals are per 10,000 user regions) and by the number and size of the genomic feature (totals are per 10,000 feature bins – the total number of bins that the feature occupies in the genome).A variety of basic statistics are calculated for each feature: number of genomic features, average feature size, and percentage of user peaks with at least one co-located feature.To quantify the strength of colocalization we calculate a colocation peak height, Above-Mean-Integral (AMI), and Below-Mean-Integral (BMI) from the histogram. </plain></SENT>

</text></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title><text><SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Usage </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>ColoWeb is intended for analysis of relatively fine-grained genomic features less than a few thousand bases wide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>A simple tab delimited text file (.bed format) containing the genomic position of user regions of interest is submitted to ColoWeb. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Only the first three fields of .bed format are required: chromosome, start position, and stop position. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>The upper limit of user feature width is ¼ of the window size selected for analysis (e.g. 5,000 bases for a 20,000 base window). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Regions larger than the limit will be discarded and there must be at least 1000 valid regions to perform colocation analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>For performance reasons, we process only up to 200,000 submitted user regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>If more are submitted, ColoWeb will randomly sample 200,000 for colocation analysis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>The cell line in which the user regions were identified should be selected for colocation analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>If ColoWeb does not have pre-built features for the cell line used, select the ‘Any Human’ features, upload a custom feature file, or contact us to add cell lines / features. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>The current version supports analyses for only the human genome. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Specification of window size provides a mechanism to zoom in or out for tighter or wider colocation analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>The drawback of larger window sizes is that they are more likely to overlap with other ROIs, confounding the colocation analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Generally the most intuitive analysis is centered on the submitted ROI. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>As shown in Figure 2B, TFII-I binding sites showed a strikingly high enrichment to unmethylated CpGs, while still displaying the bifurcated distribution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>TFII-I exhibited no colocalization with methylated CGIs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>The absence of TFII-I binding from methylated CGIs may be related to the well-established observation that DNA hypermethylation is associated with gene inactivation, potentially by blocking binding of transcription factors to DNA [12,13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Again we have observed a similar relationship when the analysis was centered on TFII-I binding regions. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Similar to the association of TFII-I transcriptional regulator, initiation sites of DNA replication (i.e. replication origins) have also been shown to associate predominantly with CGIs [14,15] and with transcription factor binding sites [16-18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>To explore whether the shared association with CGIs suggests a potential role for TFII-I binding in DNA replication, we investigated the extent of colocalization of TFII-I binding sites with replication origins, utilizing the capability of ColoWeb to compare two user-provided files (Figure 3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>A moderate colocalization was observed with the analysis centered on TFII-I, suggesting that TFII-I does not have a major role in the regulation of DNA replication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>A reciprocal colocalization showed almost no colocalization of TFII-I bound regions to replication origins (Additional file 3: Figure S3A). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Both K562 replication origins and TFII-I binding regions have strong associations with CpG islands, but these data sets are clearly distinguished by their relationship to Rad21.Figure 3 Colocation analysis of TFII-I bound regions with a user supplied genomic feature. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>In the third example that illustrates the advantage of ColoWeb’s quantification, a recently published data set of erythroblast cell origins, and their respective replication timing, was used to generate two files, one composed of the early replicating origins and another composed of the late replicating origins [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>These erythroblast replication origins were compared to K562 features, an erythroid cell line available on ColoWeb. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>There are other good tools that quantify colocalization of genomic regions [6-10] and these software packages provide a variety of capabilities and analysis strengths (Additional file 4: Figure S4, Additional file 5: Table S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>In our lab, we found that the existing tools did not meet the needs of the bench biologists to quickly and easily screen new ChIP-seq data for colocation with many existing datasets of genomic features. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>We needed results that were both graphical and numerical quantifications and that would enable cross-feature, cross-sample, and cross-cell line comparisons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Further, we decided that a web-based service and a pre-built library of genomic features would best support researchers without requiring software installation or bioinformatics support. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>One significant advantage of ColoWeb is its numerical measures of the strength of colocalization, AMI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Among the other publicly available colocation tools of which we are aware, only seqMiner provides a colocalization strength measure (ChIP-seq enrichments, defined as log2[(reads in the window from the data ROIs + q)/(reads in the window from the control ROIs + q)] where q is about 10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>The seqMiner approach has difficulty with sharp and narrow peaks from features with high background read levels because the peak’s size can be small relative to background reads from the control. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>This type of peak can, however, indicate a very focused and interesting colocalization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>ColoWeb’s AMI instead uses the edges of the histogram itself and observed histogram variance to establish a dynamic background level for each feature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>We find that this approach is able to accurately quantify a wide range of colocation patterns in histograms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Further, our ROI and feature bin normalization combined with dynamic background estimation allows the ColoWeb AMIs to be directly compared for cross-feature or cross-sample assessment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>ColoWeb easily and quickly generates meaningful colocalization outputs that can assist users in forming initial impressions and in validating their sequencing results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>We have provided three examples for hypothesis generation and testing using Coloweb. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>In the first example, a recently published dataset was subjected to analysis using K562 features, centering on both the feature and TFII-I allowing for the generation of the novel hypothesis that TFII-I binds to unmethylated but not methylated CGIs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>When performing the reciprocal analysis, centering on the feature, it is not always expected that the colocalization will be similar. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>In particular, if the file has few peaks, reciprocal overlap may be less likely because fewer genomic regions are considered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>In this instance the ROI-centered and feature-center plots are similar. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>In the second example, we surveyed the colocalization of chromatin components with replication origins to evaluate whether origins and TFII-I binding sites share common associations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>This analysis revealed that although TFII-I binding sites and origins associate with many common features, they differ in their association with Rad21. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Rad21 is a member of the cohesin complex, which remains bound to chromatin throughout the cell cycle and is involved in maintaining higher order chromatin structure to allow for competency of both transcription and DNA replication [20,21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Rad21 shows a strong colocalization with TFII-I binding sites, with a very discrete relationship supporting shared function, while Rad21 only had modest colocalization with K562 replication origins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Therefore TFII-I may be cooperating with the cohesin complex to promote its transcriptional program, particularly in the presence of CGIs, and in a manner distinct from the regulation of DNA replication. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>The final example demonstrates how ColoWeb can be used to compare the epigenetic signature of two files. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>ColoWeb was used to characterize early and late replicating origins with the goal of identifying chromatin features that may be involved in regulating replication timing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>The AMI value that quantifies the degree of colocalization was used to compare several features to both early and late firing replication origins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Histograms of K562 “histones” and “modifiers” displayed that several epigenetic features are associated with both early and late firing origins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>HDAC2 was identified as having a high AMI value for early firing replication origins, but a low AMI for late those that are late firing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that HDAC2 may be involved in the regulation of replication timing. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>The quantitative output that measures the degree of colocalization is unique in ColoWeb and of a potentially great value to users. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Bed file intersections can provide the percentage of features within a certain distance from a reference file, which ColoWeb provides in the “Percentage Near Feature” output, but ColoWeb also outputs a normalized quantification of the degree of positive colocalization, AMI, or of the absence of colocalization, BMI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>These values are suitable for direct comparison between features, which is difficult with graphical outputs provided by other tools, as shown in the comparison of early and late replication origins using ColoWeb. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Additionally the Coloweb tool outputs a p-value for the AMI that provides users with confidence in the significance of the colocalization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>The flexibility and ease of use found in the ColoWeb tool presents advancement from existing tools and will greatly increase the ability of any scientist to analyse and compare results from sequencing experiments. </plain></SENT>
