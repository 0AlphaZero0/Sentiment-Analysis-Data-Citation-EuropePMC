On the basis of gene expression, breast tumors are often classified as one of five intrinsic subtypes, luminal A (LumA), luminal B (LumB), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-enriched, basal-like and normal-like [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The original intrinsic subtype classification was obtained through unsupervised clustering of breast tumors based on the expression of the &#8220;intrinsic&#8221; gene set selected for small intratumor variation, before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and large intertumor variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Variants using different gene sets have emerged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Generally, these molecular subtypes are associated with distinct biological features and clinical outcomes. They contribute to insights into cancer initiation and progression and could guide clinical decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Hence, high accuracy of molecular subtyping is critical.</p><p>The molecular subtype of an individual breast tumor drawn from a study cohort is typically assigned to its closest matching subtype expression profile. To increase specificity, each molecular subtype is defined by a centroid based on gene expression values in the training cohort. A tumor is assigned to the molecular subtype that has the highest correlation between the subtype&#8217;s centroid and the study tumor&#8217;s corresponding gene expression pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Gene expression levels vary greatly because of technical biases, so it is necessary to center the gene expression values in the study cohort prior to subtyping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Standard gene centering is typically done by subtracting the median or mean expression per probe or gene across the study cohort. However, standard gene centering introduces errors in molecular subtype classifications when the clinicopathological distributions of the study cohort do not match those of the training cohort used to derive the molecular subtype classifier.</p><p>Training cohorts used to develop the subtype expression signature are often intended to represent the general patient population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. For PAM50 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] classifiers, the original training cohort, referred to as the University of North Carolina (UNC) dataset, is regarded as capturing the major breast cancer types in the general patient population in their relative proportions. When using the intrinsic subtype classifier, the clinicopathological distribution of breast cancer of the study cohort should be similar to that of the training cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. For study and training cohorts with similar clinicopathological distributions, systematic differences in gene expression are assumed to be due to technical biases; after standard gene centering to remove these technical biases, the cohorts are considered comparable. In the case of the PAM50 signature, the UNC dataset was centered probe-wise prior to establishment of the centroids for the subtypes.</p><p>Although standard gene centering is commonly applied prior to molecular subtyping, it produces inaccurate molecular subtype classifications when the study and training cohorts differ in their clinicopathological composition. In particular, if the training cohort is intended to capture the heterogeneity of the general patient population, standard gene centering will not produce molecular subtype classifications on a study cohort with more narrowly defined clinicopathological characteristics relative to the general population, such as a study cohort of only ER-positive cases. More generally, if one were subtyping using standard gene centering and evaluating the assignments by ER status, the assignment to each ER-positive case would depend on how many ER-negative cases are in the study cohort. Similarly, the assignment to the ER-negative cases would depend on how many ER-positive are in the study cohort (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The most accurate assignment would occur only when the proportion of ER-positive to ER-negative cases was similar to that of the training cohort; otherwise, errors would occur, as we demonstrate in this article.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of estrogen receptor distribution on molecular subtype assignments.</bold> The University of North Carolina (UNC) cohort is the PAM50 training cohort. Only samples with available prototypic tumor subtypes and available estrogen receptor (ER) status are shown (n&#8201;=&#8201;118). In each horizontal strip, the vertical bands represent individual patients and are arranged in the same sequence for each horizontal band. First, we considered the UNC cohort, where there was a balanced ER-positive to ER-negative distribution&#8212;46% ER-positive (54/118) and 54% ER-negative (64/118)&#8212;represented by the shaded pie chart labeled &#8220;UNC cohort.&#8221; In the first strip at the top, labeled &#8220;ER status&#8221;, the ER status on the UNC cohort is depicted as dark vs. light gray, representing ER-positive vs. ER-negative cases, respectively. In the second strip, labeled &#8220;Original subtype assignment,&#8221; the original subtype assignments on the UNC cohort are shown. Next, we considered a subset of the UNC cohort (n&#8201;=&#8201;75), which we created by sampling ER-positive and ER-negative cases disproportionally, with 15% ER-positive (11/75) and 85% ER-negative (64/75), as represented by the pie chart labeled &#8220;UNC subset.&#8221; In the third strip, labeled &#8220;Standard gene centering,&#8221; assigned subtypes by standard gene centering on the subset of the UNC subset, where ER is disproportionally distributed, are shown. The misclassification rate is 33.3% (25/75) compared with the first 75 bands in the second strip. In the bottom strip, labeled &#8220;Subgroup-specific gene centering,&#8221; assigned subtypes by the proposed subgroup-specific gene centering on the subset of the UNC cohort, where ER is disproportionally distributed, are shown. The misclassification rate is 5.3% (4/75). Here the classification is similar to the actual classification, shown in the first 75 cases of the second strip, labeled &#8220;Original subtype assignment.&#8221; Her2, Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2; LumA, Luminal A; LumB, Luminal B.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13058_2015_520_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>A few approaches have been proposed to remedy the problem of applying standard gene centering when the study and training cohorts differ in terms of clinicopathological distribution. One can augment the study cohort with additional samples to form a new study cohort that better matches the heterogeneity of the training cohort. However, this approach assumes the availability of additional samples profiled on the same platform. Alternatively, one might consider subsetting or resampling the study cohort to match the training cohort in terms of clinicopathological characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, subsetting makes inefficient use of the study data by removing samples, whereas resampling introduces randomness through the sampling scheme. Moreover, both of these approaches assume that the study cohort contains some fraction of all the subgroups in the training cohort, which would not be the case if the study cohort were only ER-positive patients, for example. Model-based methods (for example, distance-weighted discrimination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]) have been proposed to remove technical bias while keeping biologically relevant signals; for these approaches, one should be cautious about the relevance of the underlying modeling assumptions.</p><p>To perform subtype classification on a study cohort whose clinicopathological composition differs from the training cohort, we propose <italic>subgroup-specific gene centering</italic> that corrects for these differences. Our method is a probe-wise, platform-independent, model-free strategy for subtype classification that does not rely on altering the study cohort by augmenting, removing or resampling it.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>For illustration purposes, we compare our subgroup-specific gene centering with standard gene centering using the PAM50 classifier.

Second, we considered two external study cohorts: namely, cohorts independent of the UNC dataset used to develop the PAM50 classifier.

We considered the five UNC prototypic tumor subgroups: the prototypic LumA set, the prototypic LumB set, the prototypic HER2-enriched set, the prototypic basal-like set and the prototypic normal-like set. These were used to define the average expression profiles (centroids) for each of the molecular subtypes. In addition, we considered three clinically defined tumor subgroups of the UNC dataset, namely: ER-positive, ER-negative and triple-negative subsets. Here the UNC dataset was regarded as a representative cohort of breast cancer, and prototypic labels of the UNC samples were considered the true molecular subtypes when computing the subtyping accuracy. To assess classification accuracy, the prototypic subtypes for the tumors were known but blinded from the classifier.

In contrast, our method produced 81.2% luminal subtypes, consisting of 47.9% (23/48) LumA and 33.3% LumB (16/48) (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>

Subgroup-specific centering of the TNBC set on the triple-negative percentiles (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1 and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S2) resulted in 63 of the 77 TNBC tumors being classified as basal-like (82%), and the remainder were 6 HER2-enriched, 3 LumA, 3 LumB and 2 normal-like samples. With standard gene centering, only 36% were classified as the basal-like subtype (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The PAM50 subtypes published in the TCGA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], generated using the full TCGA breast cohort, had 84% (65/77) of the cancers classified as basal-like (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S5). Compared with the published PAM50 subtypes, subgroup-specific versus standard gene centering produced error rates of 6.5% (5/77) versus 53.2% (41/77), respectively (<italic>P</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.0001 by McNemar test).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Standard subtyping methods produced inaccurate classifications when the clinicopathological distributions of the study cohort did not match those of the training cohort. If one were to subtype a TNBC study cohort using the PAM50 classifier, the results would be an inaccurate representation of the PAM50 subtypes if standard gene centering was done, because the training cohort for the PAM50 classifier was intended to represent the general population, not the TNBC population. Although this problem is often overlooked, we are not the first to identify it. Others who have recognized the problem have proposed more complex solutions, including adding or removing samples from the study cohort to match the clinicopathological distribution of the training cohort. We propose a simpler solution because it does not involve altering the actual samples of the study cohort.</p><p>For accurate molecular subtyping, we present an alternative approach to gene centering that incorporates a routine data transformation step prior to subtyping. In standard gene centering, gene expression values are typically expressed relative to the median (or mean). We show that standard gene centering produces inaccurate molecular subtype classifications when the clinicopathological distribution of the study cohort differs from that of the training cohort. To address this issue, we propose a new method termed <italic>subgroup-specific gene centering</italic>, which adjusts gene expression values relative to the expression level at a specified percentile, where the percentile for each gene is determined from a subgroup of the training cohort with clinicopathological characteristics similar to those of the study cohort.</p><p>In comparison with standard gene centering, subgroup-specific gene centering more accurately reproduced the intrinsic subtypes when applied to the five prototypic tumor sets of the UNC cohort (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Most notable were the accurate assignments to the luminal subtypes, where the differences in gene expression values defining LumA and LumB tumors are believed to be along a continuum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This correct assignment indicates that these two types of luminal prototypic tumors in the UNC set are likely distinct in terms of their gene expression. Predictions on HER2-enriched prototypic tumors were relatively less accurate than the other prototypic sets using our method, and even less accurate using the standard method. The increased error in this subtype is likely due to its heterogeneous nature. On the ER-positive, ER-negative and triple-negative subgroups of the UNC cohort, our method produced lower classification error rates than standard gene centering. Moreover, subtype-specific centering was consistently more accurate than standard gene centering for study cohorts selected with varying portions of ER-positive and ER-negative cases.</p><p>Subgroup-specific gene centering performed well on the two external study cohorts consisting of ER-positive and TNBC tumors, respectively. It has been reported that ER-positive tumors tend be luminal, whereas at least 75% of TNBC cases are basal-like [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Subgroup-specific centering produced consistent findings, with 81% of the ER-positive tumors classified as luminal and 82% of the triple-negative tumors as basal-like. However, standard gene centering produced a more uniform distribution of the tumors between the five subtypes, with only 47% of the ER-positive tumors classified as luminal and 36% of the triple-negative tumors as basal-like. Although the information for triple-negative status is largely missing on the UNC dataset (only ten TNBCs available), our method outperforms the standard gene centering on this tumor subgroup as well.</p><p>The first step underlying our method is to find a subgroup of the training cohort that has clinicopathological characteristics similar to those of the study cohort. We demonstrate our method using ER status and TNBC status as the clinicopathological characteristics. Our method is quite flexible and can handle study cohorts composed of a mixture of several clinically defined subgroups. For illustrative purposes, we constructed study cohorts with different mixtures of ER-positive and ER-negative cases, because ER status is one of the major clinicopathological markers for breast cancer and well annotated in the UNC set. We then computed the gene-specific percentiles based on a subgroup of the training cohort with a similar mixture (for example, a UNC subset with a 15% to 85% mix of the ER-positive and ER-negative samples). Admittedly, this approach introduces some randomness because it involves sampling the corresponding mixture subgroups from the UNC set; however, the randomness can be averaged out by using a repeated sampling procedure. Alternatively, instead of subsampling, the samples may be given different weights based on their subgroup to match the composition of the study cohort.</p><p>Our method is not confined to a specific expression-profiling platform, and it does not require gathering additional samples to make the study cohort match the heterogeneity of the training cohort. In general, augmenting a dataset is subject to data availability and platform compatibility between study cohort and the additional samples. Platform differences often pose major obstacles for extracting biologically relevant signals while effectively removing technical biases.</p><p>Our subgroup-specific gene-centering strategy can be applied only when there are sufficient clinicopathological data to compare the study and training cohorts. If such data do not exist or if the data are highly correlated and do not capture sufficient heterogeneity to compare the study and training cohorts, our strategy cannot be applied. That said, there is no reassurance that standard gene centering is suitable when study and training cohorts cannot be compared.</p><p>Subgroup-specific gene centering is not suitable for study datasets with one patient sample, because it requires a cohort with sufficient sample size to ensure the subtyping accuracy. This limitation is largely technology-related, as expression measurements of microarrays are often analyzed on a relative rather than absolute scale, as well as in a platform-dependent manner. The data augmentation strategy by merging the single sample with a sizable cohort from a compatible platform is one solution under the current expression-based molecular subtyping. Alternatively, one can turn to techniques such as quantitative RT-PCR, which has technical advantages in terms of reproducibility and quantitative assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Subgroup-specific gene centering has capability for immediate use for classifying molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which commonly include the intrinsic signature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], PAM50 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and its extension to the claudin-low subtype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In this article, we do not discuss the METABRIC study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], because that study did not explicitly report a classifier (for example, centroids).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Compared with standard gene centering, subgroup-specific gene centering enables more accurate molecular subtyping in a study cohort whose clinicopathological distribution does not match the training cohort. We demonstrate subgroup-specific gene centering the PAM50 breast cancer classifier, but emphasize that the subgroup-specific gene-centering approach is applicable to any classification based on gene-centered signatures. Moreover, it is not limited to breast cancer and can be applied to any tissue subtyping strategy reliant on a gene centering. It can also be applied to any characteristics for defining the subgroups, even mutational status, provided these are known in the training cohort.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec15"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13058_2015_520_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Table S1.</label><caption><p>Clinicopathological and molecular characteristics of UNC set (n&#8201;=&#8201;232). <bold>Table S2.</bold> Subtype prediction by different strategies on UNC ER-positive subset (n&#8201;=&#8201;107). <bold>Table S3.</bold> Subtype prediction by different strategies on UNC ER-negative subset (n&#8201;=&#8201;71). <bold>Table S4.</bold> Subtype prediction by different strategies on UNC TN subset (n&#8201;=&#8201;10). <bold>Table S5.</bold> Subtype prediction by different strategies on TCGA triple-negative subgroup (TNBC set; n&#8201;=&#8201;77) compared with the published subtype calls on TCGA cohort. <bold>Table S6.</bold> PAM50 subgroup-specific gene centering baseline value for a few standard subgroups for breast tumors, computed using the UNC training set.</p></caption></media><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13058_2015_520_MOESM2_ESM.tiff" id="MOESM2"><label>Additional file 2: Figure S1.</label><caption><p>Subgroup-specific strategy for molecular subtype assignment in an ER-positive study cohort (Trondheim set) demonstrated for a single gene, <italic>ESR1</italic>. <bold>(A)</bold> Computing probe-wise subgroup percentiles.
