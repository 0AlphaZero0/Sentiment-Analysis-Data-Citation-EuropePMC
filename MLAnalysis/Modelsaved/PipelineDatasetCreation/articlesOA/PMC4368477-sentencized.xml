<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>As an initial screen for mutations that contribute to CDR H3 loop stability, we constructed hybrid Fabs from the UCA and the mature CH65 and CH67 antibodies and used a simple co-elution assay to test for binding of the hybrids to a monomeric HA1 head from A/Solomon Islands/03/2006. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Pairing either of the mature light chains with the UCA heavy chain (UCAHCH65L and UCAHCH67L) produced a hybrid that remained associated with HA head on size-exclusion chromatography; pairing either of the mature heavy chains with the UCA light chain gave detectable binding only for CH65HUCAL and not for CH67HUCAL (Supporting Information Table SI). </plain></SENT>
