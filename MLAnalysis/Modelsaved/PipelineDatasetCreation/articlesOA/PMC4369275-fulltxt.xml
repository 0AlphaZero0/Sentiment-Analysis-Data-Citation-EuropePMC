Lack of dysferlin protein results in progressive dystrophy with chronic muscle fiber loss, inflammation, fat replacement, and fibrosis; leading to deteriorating muscle weakness. The objective of this work is to demonstrate efficient and safe restoration of dysferlin expression following gene therapy treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Traditional gene therapy is restricted by the packaging capacity limit of adeno-associated virus (AAV), however, use of a dual vector strategy allows for delivery of over-sized genes, including dysferlin. The two vector system (AAV.DYSF.DV) packages the dysferlin cDNA utilizing AAV serotype rh.74 through the use of two discrete vectors defined by a 1&#160;kb region of homology. Delivery of AAV.DYSF.DV via intramuscular and vascular delivery routes in dysferlin deficient mice and nonhuman primates was compared for efficiency and safety.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Treated muscles were tested for dysferlin expression, overall muscle histology, and ability to repair following injury. High levels of dysferlin overexpression was shown for all muscle groups treated as well as restoration of functional outcome measures (membrane repair ability and diaphragm specific force) to wild-type levels. In primates, strong dysferlin expression was demonstrated with no safety concerns.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Treated muscles showed high levels of dysferlin expression with functional restoration with no evidence of toxicity or immune response providing proof of principle for translation to dysferlinopathy patients.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Dysferlinopathies are a family of disorders caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the dysferlin (DYSF) gene.

In both animal cohorts, the gene delivery resulted in robust expression of dysferlin in the injected muscle as compared to uninjected control (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">7</xref>). Importantly, no toxicity was seen at the tissue level in&#160;the NHPs with a lack of inflammation or muscle&#160;fiber necrosis. For AAV5.DYSF injected TAs, the&#160;muscles demonstrated 104.9% (3&#160;months) and 122.6% (6&#160;months) overexpression of dysferlin while AAVrh.74.DV injected TAs had 122.0% (3&#160;months) and 115.2% (6&#160;months) overexpression as compared to the uninjected control. Immunological assays did not show any aberrant responses to the capsid or transgene by ELISpot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd3">Fig. S3</xref>) or ELISA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd4">Table S1</xref>). In addition full CBC and chemistry panels showed no abnormal values in any of the macaques.</p><fig id="fig07" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Dysferlin expression in nonhuman primates.

Of particular interest are diseases with no current cure or effective therapy, such as dysferlinopathies. The work here provides proof that codelivery of two vectors allows for in vivo recombination events and production of full-length, functional dysferlin. Although there is discussion in the field as to the exact mechanism of dual vector treatments (i.e. repair vs. homologous recombination), our work with AAV5.DYSF,<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and that of others,<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> points to homologous recombination of partially packaged genomes as the mechanism responsible for the generation of full-length transcripts. Work by Lostal et&#160;al. with designed splicing dual vectors showed low levels (1&#8211;4%) of dysferlin expression following systemic delivery of 4&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>12</sup>vg.<xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Here, we present similar levels of dysferlin expression (2&#8211;6%) following systemic delivery of 2&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>12</sup>vg indicating comparable efficiency between the two methods. Importantly, a threefold increase in dose dramatically improved expression levels (15&#8211;27%) and corresponding functional improvement. Additionally, comparison of AAV5.DYSF and AAVrh.74.DYSF.DV expression in mice revealed an increase in dysferlin expression through the dual vector delivery. Regardless of mechanism, dual vectors utilizing either strategy are becoming a viable option for expression cassettes outside the traditional packaging limit of AAV.</p><p>Importantly, the work by Lostal et&#160;al. demonstrated the potential for DYSF gene replacement through a dual vector strategy.<xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Although they were only able to demonstrate low levels of dysferlin expression, this still resulted in an improvement in muscle pathology as well as an improvement in membrane repair. In their work, the low levels of dysferlin expression were not sufficient to restore functional measures to WT levels which led them to postulate that levels of 30% dysferlin expression would be necessary for clinically meaningful outcomes.<xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Following this work, we tested both low (2&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>12</sup>vg) and high (6&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>12</sup>vg) systemic doses of AAVrh.74.DYSF.DV leading to 2&#8211;6% and 15&#8211;27% dysferlin expression respectively. Functional outcome measures in membrane repair and diaphragm specific force were restored to WT levels for the high dose, suggesting that lower levels of expression (&#8765;25%) may be sufficient to see a clinical benefit. This is corroborated by considering carriers of DYSF mutations which have no clinical symptoms of dysferlinopathy but with &lt;50% dysferlin protein expression.<xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></p><p>After demonstration of robust, wide-spread expression of dysferlin in mouse models, we moved the dual vector treatment strategy into rhesus macaques to study the efficacy and safety of such a therapy. Rhesus macaques and other NHPs have been used extensively as an approximation to a human response due to anatomic similarities.<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> As such, we studied not only the expression of dysferlin delivered by gene therapy, but also the systemic immunological response in the primates. Monitoring an immune response was critical as previous work demonstrated toxicity and progressive myopathy in cases of transgene overexpression.<xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> In addition, previous work has shown that pre-existing immunity to the vector capsid results in diminished to absent expression of the transgene.<xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> Thus, primates were prescreened prior to treatment for circulating binding antibodies to AAVrh.74, with only primates negative for AAV antibodies used for the study. We found that AAVrh.74.DYSF.DV treatment in macaque skeletal muscle can stimulate the overexpression of dysferlin with no apparent toxicity or systemic immune rejection, laying a foundation for preclinical safety. Potential immune responses were carefully monitored through both serum ELISAs and PBMCs ELISpot assays. Peptide pools used to stimulate the PBMCs were designed to be 15 amino acids long, overlapping by 10 amino acids so as to capture all possible antigenic epitopes. The lack of immune response shown in all of the primates is therefore encouraging. Our dose level led to thorough transduction of the treated muscle, which will guide our future toxicology studies as we prepare for clinical trial. A formal pre-IND discussion with the FDA (L. R. Rodino-Klapac and J. R. Mendell, pers. comm.) defined a potential path for a dysferlin dual vector clinical gene therapy trial providing no problems are encountered in planned toxicology/biodistribution studies done with the same rigor as other approved AAV vectors.<xref rid="b54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></p><p>In conclusion, our dual vector work is a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of dysferlinopathy patients. Comparison of the dual vector strategy with AAV5.DYSF demonstrated similar levels of expression and functional benefit with no increases in toxicity or aberrant protein production. Furthermore, the success of multiple routes of delivery provides the option to vary treatment according to clinical presentation. The IM targeted therapy allows for the treatment of individual muscle groups affected in MM1 and distal anterior compartment myopathy, while the vascular and systemic delivery methods can be useful for gene delivery treatment of muscle compartments relevant to LGMD2B or MM1.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the Nationwide Children's Viral Vector Core for Vector Production and The Campus Microscopy and Imaging Facility at The Ohio State University for use of the Multiphoton Microscope.
