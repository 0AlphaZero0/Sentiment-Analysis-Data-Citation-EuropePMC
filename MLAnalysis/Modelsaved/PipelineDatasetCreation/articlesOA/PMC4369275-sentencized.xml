</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Dysferlinopathies are a family of disorders caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the dysferlin (DYSF) gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>These disorders include limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B),1 Miyoshi Myopathy (MM1),2 and distal anterior compartment myopathy,3–5 among others.1–3,6 LGMDs comprise 30% of all progressive muscular dystrophies with LGMD2B as the most frequently diagnosed dysferlinopathy.7,8 Mutations in DYSF lead to a progressive muscular dystrophy with chronic muscle fiber loss, inflammation, fat replacement, and fibrosis, all contributing to deteriorating weakness.7 In general, patients present with an abrupt onset in the second decade with progressive involvement of proximal and distal musculature.9,10 Although dysferlinopathies are slowly progressing disorders, approximately one-third of patients become wheelchair-dependent within 15 years of disease onset.7,10 There is no cure for these diseases and limited treatment options are available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Even use of steroids, which have been previously successful for Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients, is ineffective and not warranted.11 Although it has been occasionally reported that treatment with IV-IG or rituximab therapies can be effective by modifying the immune response, to date there remains no cure.12,13 Thus, the need for a treatment is clear. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The DYSF gene consists of 55 exons encompassing 150 kb of genomic DNA.14 The associated cDNA is ∽6.5 kb and codes for the dysferlin protein.2,14–16 Dysferlin, a member of the ferlin family, is composed of seven N-terminal C2 domains with a transmembrane C-terminus.17,18 Dysferlin has multiple roles in skeletal muscle including sarcolemmal membrane repair,16,19,20 vesicle trafficking,21 t-tubule structure and function22 and endocytosis.23 Our group16 and others19,20,24 have studied the role of dysferlin in Ca2+-dependent membrane repair, consistently reporting a decrease in dysferlin-deficient fiber sarcolemmal resealing following acute injury. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>As skeletal muscle is mechanically active, this deficit in repair leads to regeneration/degeneration of fibers with muscle fiber necrosis/loss, and progressive limb weakness.19,20 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Recent years have shown profound development of adeno-associated viral (AAV) gene transfer.16,25–28 Although there was some reported plasticity,29,30 the packaging limit of AAV is 4.7 kb, requiring the development of cDNA cassettes within this constraint. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Groups have reported the use of miniaturized genes and trans-splicing approaches; however, reduced gene expression and protein function hinder the technology.31–34 In our previous work, we delivered full-length DYSF using AAV5 delivery of partially packaged 5′ and 3′ fragments of the dysferlin containing expression cassette.16 Southern blot revealed that all encapsidated DNA was ≤∽5.2 kb in length.16 Overlapping homologous sequences facilitated reconstitution of full-length DYSF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>As the packaging in AAV5 was uncontrolled, it became desirable to develop a strategy for packaging of discrete, well-identified constructs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>From our experience and that of others,16,35,36 we used a dual vector strategy using co-injection of two vectors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>To accomplish efficient gene expression, we split the dysferlin cDNA into two segments with a 1 kb overlap region and packaged them into separate cassettes within AAVrh.74. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Upon co-injection, the two cDNA segments provide a substrate for homologous recombination or repair 29,37,38 to recover the full-length gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In our studies, the dual vector strategy demonstrates higher levels of gene expression than previous work with AAV5.DYSF.16 In addition, membrane repair capacity and diaphragm specific force in the dysferlin knock-out mouse model were restored to wild-type (WT) levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Following demonstration of robust dysferlin expression in mice we performed injections in rhesus macaques (nonhuman primates [NHPs]) to validate a safety profile for the dual vector treatment.39 We found no toxicity following AAVrh74.DYSF.DV in NHPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Taken together with functional outcome measures in dysferlin deficient mice, AAVrh.74.DYSF.DV is well-positioned for translation to dysferlinopathy patients. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>AAV-mediated gene therapy presents a desirable treatment strategy for multiple diseases; however, it is hindered by the restrictive 4.7 kb packaging limit of the AAV virion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Of particular interest are diseases with no current cure or effective therapy, such as dysferlinopathies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>The work here provides proof that codelivery of two vectors allows for in vivo recombination events and production of full-length, functional dysferlin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>Although there is discussion in the field as to the exact mechanism of dual vector treatments (i.e. repair vs. homologous recombination), our work with AAV5.DYSF,16 and that of others,29,37,38 points to homologous recombination of partially packaged genomes as the mechanism responsible for the generation of full-length transcripts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>Work by Lostal et al. with designed splicing dual vectors showed low levels (1–4%) of dysferlin expression following systemic delivery of 4 × 1012vg.46 Here, we present similar levels of dysferlin expression (2–6%) following systemic delivery of 2 × 1012vg indicating comparable efficiency between the two methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>Importantly, a threefold increase in dose dramatically improved expression levels (15–27%) and corresponding functional improvement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>Additionally, comparison of AAV5.DYSF and AAVrh.74.DYSF.DV expression in mice revealed an increase in dysferlin expression through the dual vector delivery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>Regardless of mechanism, dual vectors utilizing either strategy are becoming a viable option for expression cassettes outside the traditional packaging limit of AAV. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the work by Lostal et al. demonstrated the potential for DYSF gene replacement through a dual vector strategy.46 Although they were only able to demonstrate low levels of dysferlin expression, this still resulted in an improvement in muscle pathology as well as an improvement in membrane repair. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>In their work, the low levels of dysferlin expression were not sufficient to restore functional measures to WT levels which led them to postulate that levels of 30% dysferlin expression would be necessary for clinically meaningful outcomes.46 Following this work, we tested both low (2 × 1012vg) and high (6 × 1012vg) systemic doses of AAVrh.74.DYSF.DV leading to 2–6% and 15–27% dysferlin expression respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome measures in membrane repair and diaphragm specific force were restored to WT levels for the high dose, suggesting that lower levels of expression (∽25%) may be sufficient to see a clinical benefit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>This is corroborated by considering carriers of DYSF mutations which have no clinical symptoms of dysferlinopathy but with &lt;50% dysferlin protein expression.47 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>After demonstration of robust, wide-spread expression of dysferlin in mouse models, we moved the dual vector treatment strategy into rhesus macaques to study the efficacy and safety of such a therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>Rhesus macaques and other NHPs have been used extensively as an approximation to a human response due to anatomic similarities.25,48–53 As such, we studied not only the expression of dysferlin delivered by gene therapy, but also the systemic immunological response in the primates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>Monitoring an immune response was critical as previous work demonstrated toxicity and progressive myopathy in cases of transgene overexpression.39 In addition, previous work has shown that pre-existing immunity to the vector capsid results in diminished to absent expression of the transgene.48 Thus, primates were prescreened prior to treatment for circulating binding antibodies to AAVrh.74, with only primates negative for AAV antibodies used for the study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>We found that AAVrh.74.DYSF.DV treatment in macaque skeletal muscle can stimulate the overexpression of dysferlin with no apparent toxicity or systemic immune rejection, laying a foundation for preclinical safety. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Potential immune responses were carefully monitored through both serum ELISAs and PBMCs ELISpot assays. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>Peptide pools used to stimulate the PBMCs were designed to be 15 amino acids long, overlapping by 10 amino acids so as to capture all possible antigenic epitopes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>The lack of immune response shown in all of the primates is therefore encouraging. </plain></SENT>
