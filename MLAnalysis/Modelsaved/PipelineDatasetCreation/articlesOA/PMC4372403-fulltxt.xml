In this work, the &#946;-galactosidase from <italic>Lactobacillus bulgaricus</italic> L3 was subjected to site-saturation mutagenesis at the W980 residue. The recombinant pET-21b plasmid carrying the enzyme gene was used as the template for mutation. The mutant plasmids were transformed into <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells for screening. One recombinant mutant, W980F, exhibited increased yield of glycoside when using hydroquinone as the screening acceptor. The enzyme was purified and the effects of the mutation on enzyme properties were determined in detail. It showed improved transglycosylation activity on novel phenolic acceptors besides hydroquinone. The yields of the glycosides produced from phenol, hydroquinone, and catechol were increased by 7.6% to 53.1%. Moreover, it generated 32.3% glycosides from the pyrogallol that could not be glycosylated by the wild-type enzyme. Chemical structures of these glycoside products were further determined by MS and NMR analysis. Thus, a series of novel phenolic galactosides were achieved by &#946;-galactosidase for the first time. This was a breakthrough in the enzymatic galactosylation of the challenging phenolic compounds of great values.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.

They are widely distributed in plants and animals, as well as in a wide variety of microorganisms including yeasts, fungi, bacteria and archaea. These enzymes have attracted particular interest in the industrial applications owing to their hydrolase and transferase activities [<xref rid="pone.0121445.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0121445.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The hydrolytic activity has been applied in the food industry for decades for reducing the lactose content in milk to help prevent symptoms from lactose intolerance, while the transglycosylation activity has been used to synthesize prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides from lactose [<xref rid="pone.0121445.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0121445.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Recently, interest in &#946;-galactosidases has gained more momentum due to their production of promising galactose-containing chemicals, including diverse oligosaccharides, alkyl-glycoside, glycoconjugates and others that play important roles in the industries of food additives, cosmetics, and medicines [<xref rid="pone.0121445.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>&#946;-Galactosidases produced the glycoside chemicals through galactosyl transfer from lactose or galactoside donors to various acceptors. The formation of glycosidic linkages mostly occurs between the galactose and the alcoholic hydroxyl groups of acceptors. Simple alkyl alcohols are good acceptors for the enzymes to produce alkyl-glycoside [<xref rid="pone.0121445.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0121445.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Even complex compounds containing the alkyl-alcoholic side chains, such as the isotaxiresinol with anti-cancer activity, can be modified by the &#946;-galactosidases from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and <italic>Kluyveromycs fragilis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0121445.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The compounds bearing sugar hydroxyl groups are also common acceptors for the &#946;-galactosidases. One example is that the &#946;-galactosidases from <italic>Bifidobacterium bifidum</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus</italic> sp. 6646K are able to transfer glycosyl to <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) or <italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), producing the &#946;-1,3 or &#946;-1,4 linkages of galactosyl GlcNAc/GalNAc that are related to ABO and tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens [<xref rid="pone.0121445.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Another example is that the &#946;-galactosidase from <italic>Bacillus circulans</italic> could glycosylate myricitrin, a complex flavonol rhamnoside with high anti-oxidative ability, resulting in 480 times more solubility in water [<xref rid="pone.0121445.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Besides linear acceptors, cyclic tetrasaccharide also could be modified by the &#946;-galactosidases from <italic>Aspergillus oryzae</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>circulans</italic>, forming 6' or 3' galactosyl cyclic tetrasaccharides that have the potential to be used as low-calorie sweeteners, drug-delivery carriers or affinity-chromatography materials [<xref rid="pone.0121445.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Despite the flexibility of &#946;-galactosidases toward acceptors, glycosylation of phenolic compounds were rarely reported.</p><p>The phenolic compounds are a class of chemicals with hydroxyl group bonded directly to the aromatic hydrocarbon group. Such chemicals have many physiological functions [<xref rid="pone.0121445.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0121445.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The catechins exhibit antioxidative and antibacterial activities, along with the capability of regulation of cholesterol levels in blood [<xref rid="pone.0121445.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The caffeic acid has antioxidative, peroxy radical scavenging, and antimutagenic activities [<xref rid="pone.0121445.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0121445.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Even simple phenolic compounds, such as phenol, hydroquinone, and catechol, play important roles as basilic intermediate materials that can be processed for valuable industrial chemicals or pharmaceuticals. Despite the importance of phenolic compounds, the use of them is usually limited because they are poorly soluble in water and also easily degraded by light irradiation in aqueous solution [<xref rid="pone.0121445.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0121445.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Glycosylation of phenolic compounds is considered to be a very useful method to increase their solubility and stability in water [<xref rid="pone.0121445.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0121445.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It can mask phenolic groups and protect them from oxidation [<xref rid="pone.0121445.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Also, glycosylation can improve biological and pharmacological functions, including the decrease of toxicity and side effects, as well as the increase of bioavailability of drugs that need to pass through the blood-brain barrier [<xref rid="pone.0121445.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Since galactose is an important constituent of the carbohydrate chains of glycoconjugates involved in a variety of biological recognition events [<xref rid="pone.0121445.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the synthesis of galactosyl phenolic derivatives would be of scientific and/or practical interest.</p><p>To date, only one phenolic compound, hydroquinone, has been reported to be galacosylated by the &#946;-galactosidase from <italic>Kluyveromyces lactis</italic>, producing galactoside with 1.19 times higher antioxidant activity than glucoside (arbutin) [<xref rid="pone.0121445.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The rare report of the galactosidase-mediated glycosylation of phenolic compounds might be related to the low nucleophilicity of phenolic hydroxyl groups which result in the difficulty in the glycosylation by the enzymes in one aspect.</p><p>In this work, the preference of &#946;-galactosidase from <italic>L</italic>. <italic>bulgaricus</italic> L3 toward the phenolic hydroxyl groups was improved through site-directed mutagenesis of the enzyme. The acceptor substrate range of the enzyme was broadened at the same time. The W980 residue that was presumed to be involved in substrate specificity was subjected to saturation mutagenesis. One mutation of tryptophan into phenylalanine changed the specificity of acceptor substrates, resulting in significantly higher preference toward phenolic acceptors. As a result, a series of novel phenolic galactosides were obtained by the &#946;-galactosidase for the first time. This was a breakthrough in the enzymatic galactosylation of the challenging phenolic compounds of great values.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p>

The low nucleophilicity of phenolic hydroxyl groups might account for the difficulty in their modification by enzymes, as compared with alcoholic hydroxyl nucleophiles that are easily glycosylated. At present, the known glycosidases with tolerance for phenolic acceptors catalyze glucose transfer in most cases. The &#945;-amylase (EC 3.2.l.1) from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> is able to glucosylate caffeic acid using maltopentaose as the donor [<xref rid="pone.0121445.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

Later, it was applied to transfer 6'-galactosyl from lactose to sucralose, generating a novel promising compound with potentially combined functions of prebiotics and sweeteners [<xref rid="pone.0121445.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These suggested the enzyme was a wonderful tool for glycoside synthesis. Recently, the enzyme was found to tolerate phenolic acceptors besides hydroquinone, but the conversion yields were rather low (data not shown). This work enhanced the transglycosylation on phenolic acceptors and broadened the acceptor specificity by molecular evolution of the enzyme. The mutation was performed at the W980 residue that was predicted to be important for substrate selectivity via bioinformatics analysis. The saturation mutagenesis was performed via individual replacement of tryptophan by other amino acids at the same time, resulting in 19 mutants for screening. This operation not only ensured the entirely saturated mutation but also avoided the laborious screening work.</p><p>A substitution of tryptophan with phenylalanine at 980 site enhanced transglycosylation activity toward simple hydroquinone. The mutant phenylalanine and the native tryptophan at the 980 site both contain aromatic structures, but they show slight difference in the side chains. The former bears a small benzene ring while the latter contains a slightly bigger ring of indole. The shorter side chains of phenylalanine might reduce the steric hindrance of the enzyme to hold phenolic substrates. Also it might facilitate the stacking action between phenylalanine and phenolic substrates, which would help the substrate enter the active center. Additionally, the catalytic efficiency (based on <italic>k</italic>
<sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic>
<sub>m</sub>) of W980F for the hydrolysis of <italic>o</italic>NPGal reduced about 46 fold as compared with the wild-type enzyme, which was in agreement with the phenomena that the mutant enzyme nearly showed no hydrolysis activity toward various derivatives from phenolic acceptors, thus resulting in accumulation of the products in high yields.</p><p>In the transglycosylation reactions for phenolic acceptors, the self-condensations of lactose by the mutant enzyme were all obviously reduced, thus resulting in a half and more decreases of galacto-oligosaccharides yields (data not shown). Self-transglycosylation of sugar donors usually occurred in glycosidase-mediated synthesis. Such side reactions would have a negative effect on product yields and should be controlled for a general applicability of glycosidase in synthesis. Tran et al. had introduced one mutation (A221W) in the &#946;-glycosidase from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic>, preventing the donor-self-condensation while remaining the condensation at a similar level [<xref rid="pone.0121445.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Also in this work, a single mutation of the enzyme (W980F) inhibited the self-condensation without any harmful influence on its transfer of galactosyl to phenolic acceptors. The <italic>K</italic>
<sub>m</sub> value of the mutant enzyme for lactose displayed an about 12-fold increase, suggesting apparently decreased affinity toward the substrate.</p><p>Using the W980F mutant, a series of novel phenolic galactosides were achieved through glycosidase-mediated reactions for the first time. Except for hydroquinone, the phenol, catechol and pyrogallol were all newly discovered acceptors for &#946;-galactosidase and they were modified by glycosidase for the first time. This wok was actually a breakthrough in the galactosylation of the difficult or unusual acceptors by glycosidases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0121445.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>MS spectrum of the hydroquinone galactoside formed by the W980F enzyme.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0121445.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0121445.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>
