Similarly, the results from An Extension Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of Ranibizumab in Subjects with Choroidal Neovascularization Secondary to AMD (HORIZON)<xref rid="b14-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> suggested that switching from a more frequent treatment regimen, adherent to a strict monthly schedule, to a less frequent, investigator-determined as-needed dosing, regimen (pro re nata [PRN]) led to worsening of disease with poorer visual outcomes.</p><p>More recently, the results from HARBOR<xref rid="b16-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> suggested a slight increase in the durability of the higher dose of ranibizumab, as fewer injections were required in the ranibizumab 2.0 mg PRN group versus the 0.5 mg PRN group, although a greater effect on visual outcome was not concomitantly demonstrated. Furthermore, the variability in the injection frequency among the PRN dosing groups in HARBOR<xref rid="b16-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> (three to 24 injections over 2 years in the ranibizumab 0.5 mg group) suggested that some patients were being overtreated or undertreated in the fixed dosing regimen. This is an important consideration when evaluating treatment burden and risk of adverse events (AEs), as an ideal treatment regimen maximizes outcome while minimizing the risk of developing serious AEs (SAEs), both ocular and nonocular.</p><p>With the presence and emergence of intravitreal anti-VEGF agents other than ranibizumab, studies evaluating the efficacy of these medications have been, and are being, conducted. Such studies have reported similar visual gains in patients receiving ranibizumab versus bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech, Inc./Roche) or aflibercept (Eylea; Regeneron, Tarrytown, NY, USA).

In VEGF Trap-Eye: Investigation of Efficacy and Safety in Wet AMD (VIEW 1/2),<xref rid="b28-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> the ranibizumab 0.5 mg every 4 weeks (q4w)/PRN group gained an average of 7.9 letters with 16.5 injections compared to 7.6 letters with 16.0 injections, 6.6 letters with 16.2 injections, and 7.6 letters with 11.2 injections in the aflibercept 2.0 mg q4w/PRN, aflibercept 0.5 mg q4w/PRN, and aflibercept 2.0 mg q8w/PRN groups, respectively. The results of these studies demonstrate noninferiority between ranibizumab and bevacizumab, and noninferiority between ranibizumab and aflibercept, as similar visual outcomes were seen.</p><p>The results from all these studies showed that treatment of neovascular AMD with intravitreal ranibizumab not only prevented the loss of vision, but also improved vision and that ranibizumab is an effective treatment modality for neovascular AMD with an acceptable safety profile.

The reports from the BRAVO<xref rid="b19-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> study that was extended to 1 year found that VA gains were maintained with PRN treatment from months 7 through 12, but that the sham/ranibizumab 0.5 mg group (patients receiving sham injection for the first 6 months, followed by ranibizumab 0.5 mg PRN for months 7 through 12) did not achieve VA gains as great as those in patients receiving ranibizumab during the first 6 months as well.</p><p>Findings from the CRUISE<xref rid="b21-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> trial also showed significantly greater improvements in BCVA and greater decreases in CFT in both ranibizumab-treated groups than sham (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001 for both factors). Additionally, patients treated with ranibizumab had lower excess foveal thickness than untreated patients.<xref rid="b21-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> These findings were also maintained at 1 year.<xref rid="b23-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The Central Vein Occlusion Study (CVOS)<xref rid="b29-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> preceded CRUISE<xref rid="b21-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and evaluated macular grid photocoagulation for ME in CRVO.

One difference between the two studies was that in CRUISE,<xref rid="b21-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> there was a dramatic improvement in BCVA during the first 7 days after treatment, suggesting that treatment with intravitreal ranibizumab may promote faster recovery of vision.</p><p>In an extension trial for BRAVO<xref rid="b18-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and CRUISE<xref rid="b21-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> (HORIZON),<xref rid="b22-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> patients with BRVO had more stabilized gains with less frequent treatment, while patients with CRVO had decreasing visual outcomes with less frequent treatment. This HORIZON<xref rid="b22-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> study showed that many patients with BRVO and CRVO continued to require treatment with ranibizumab 2 years after treatment initiation and had poorer outcomes with less frequent follow-up. Additionally, the results of HORIZON<xref rid="b22-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> showed that the group originally randomized to sham that crossed-over to ranibizumab 0.5 mg (sham/0.5 mg) and the groups randomized to ranibizumab from the start of BRAVO<xref rid="b18-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> (0.3 mg/0.5 mg and 0.5 mg) had similar visual outcomes.

While the mechanism of effect is unclear, such findings may alter management.

There was variation in the responses to therapy in patients with BRVO versus CRVO, with more pronounced effects in patients with BRVO. Although the reason for this is unknown, this may be secondary to the fact that patients with CRVO tend to have greater amounts of retinal ischemia than patients with BRVO.</p></sec><sec><title>DME</title><p>The treatment of DME with intravitreal ranibizumab was FDA-approved in 2012.

Additionally, while prompt laser treatment was not better than deferred laser treatment, patients in whom laser treatment was deferred required more injections of ranibizumab.<xref rid="b34-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>Improvement in both VA and retinal thickening in patients with diabetes treated with ranibizumab supports the use of this medication for treating vision loss from DME. Other findings noted in some of the above studies suggest that patients treated with ranibizumab may not only be less likely to have progression of DR, but also have improvement in the severity of DR. Thus, visual morbidity could potentially be avoided with prompt treatment with ranibizumab. Although many patients in the aforementioned studies required continuous ranibizumab treatment, some reported that with time, progressively fewer injections were required to maintain treatment effect.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>Numerous trials examining the efficacy and safety of intravitreal anti-VEGF therapies have showed that, while frequent injections of anti-VEGF agents greatly reduce the risk of vision loss in patients with posterior segment neovascularization, these medications can also be associated with ocular and nonocular AEs and SAEs. In MARINA,<xref rid="b9-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> presumed endophthalmitis, uveitis, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, retinal tear, vitreous hemorrhage, and lens damage were reported with an incidence varying from 0% to 1.3% in treated groups. Additionally, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and vitreous detachment were reported in 0.4% and 0.8% of patients, respectively, in the sham group.<xref rid="b9-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In some patients, sterile uveitis was not distinguished definitively from endophthalmitis, and treatment with intravitreal antibiotics in a culture-negative patient was reported as endophthalmitis. An endophthalmitis rate of 1.0% or 0.05% per injection was reported in MARINA,<xref rid="b9-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and similar rates were also reported in ranibizumab-treated patients with RVO and DME.<xref rid="b18-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b22-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b25-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> No endophthalmitis or serious intraocular inflammation was reported in PIER,<xref rid="b12-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and the AEs that occurred more frequently in treated groups were those commonly associated with intravitreal injections.</p><p>Ocular SAEs occurred in &lt;4.0% of patients across all treatment groups in HARBOR,<xref rid="b16-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and nonocular SAEs were well balanced among all treatment groups without a dose-response trend. No ocular SAEs were reported in the ranibizumab group in the RESTORE<xref rid="b31-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> study, although two cases were reported in each of the other two groups, ranibizumab + laser and laser. SAILOR<xref rid="b15-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> is the largest study to evaluate the safety as a primary end point of intravitreal ranibizumab in neovascular AMD patients. Results from SAILOR<xref rid="b15-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> demonstrated that ranibizumab was well tolerated, with a low, dose-independent incidence of ocular AEs and SAEs.</p><p>A growing concern with intravitreal ranibizumab use is the possibility of increased risk of occurrence and increased growth rate of geographic atrophy in patients with AMD. Regarding the risk of developing geographic atrophy in the CATT trial, ranibizumab compared with bevacizumab had a higher risk (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06&#8211;1.93), and monthly dosing had a higher risk (aHR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.17&#8211;2.16) than PRN dosing.<xref rid="b35-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Data also suggests that geographic atrophy expands at a faster rate in patients treated with ranibizumab. The CATT trial reported a growth rate of 0.37 mm/year in eyes treated with bevacizumab and of 0.49 mm/year in eyes treated with ranibizumab (<italic>P</italic>=0.03).<xref rid="b36-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Results showed no significant difference in the growth rate of geographic atrophy in patients treated monthly versus PRN (<italic>P</italic>=0.85).<xref rid="b36-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p><p>Nonocular SAEs (myocardial infarction, stroke, and death) were reported in 0.8% to 2.5% of patients in control and treatment groups in MARINA.<xref rid="b9-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In ANCHOR,<xref rid="b10-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> a slightly higher rate of nonocular hemorrhage and thromboembolic events was seen in ranibizumab-treated patients, although this was not found to be significant. Cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) occurred in 1.6% of patients in the sham groups and in 0.8% of patients in the ranibizumab 0.3 mg groups in RISE and RIDE<xref rid="b25-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and in 4.0% in the ranibizumab 0.5 mg group in RISE and 2.4% in the ranibizumab 0.5 mg group in RIDE.<xref rid="b25-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> While a higher rate of strokes was seen in the higher-dose group (insignificant) in SAILOR,<xref rid="b15-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> there was no difference between the dose groups in the rate of Antiplatelet Trialists&#8217; Collaboration (APTC) arterial thromboembolic events. The incidence of APTC thromboembolic events in BRAVO<xref rid="b18-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> was low, also without a significant difference between the treatment and control groups. Arterial thromboembolic events defined by the APTC criteria were balanced among all groups, sham and ranibizumab, in the CRUISE trial.<xref rid="b22-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Finally, in the DRCR.net<xref rid="b33-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> study, patients treated with prompt laser had similar rates of major ocular AEs and APTC cardiovascular events as patients receiving ranibizumab.</p><p>While most studies reported on AEs and the rates of these events among different groups, these studies were not powered to detect small differences in the rates of infrequent events. Overall, intravitreal treatment with ranibizumab was well tolerated, with low rates of AEs.</p></sec><sec><title>Cost</title><p>With the rising costs of health care and the limited budgets, there is increasingly more data assessing the cost burden associated with intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment. Additionally, patients are not only burdened by frequent treatment, often monthly, but they are also burdened with frequent visits for evaluation and monitoring. For these reasons, some studies have assessed the cost-effectiveness of different treatment regimens and others have attempted to reduce patient visits and treatment frequency. Dankin et al<xref rid="b37-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> reported that ranibizumab is not cost-effective when compared to bevacizumab for the treatment of neovascular AMD, with 2 year cost for continuous ranibizumab approximately five times the cost for continuous bevacizumab and no difference in quality-adjusted life-years gained. Similarly, Stein et al<xref rid="b38-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> reported that ranibizumab PRN was more costly and less effective than continuous bevacizumab, with 20 year costs of $257,496, $163,694, $79,771, and $65,267 for ranibizumab monthly, ranibizumab PRN, bevacizumab monthly, and bevacizumab PRN, respectively. The data from this study showed that bevacizumab conferred greater value than ranibizumab for the treatment of neovascular AMD.<xref rid="b38-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Bevacizumab is used off-label for the treatment of neovascular AMD, DME, proliferative DR, RVO, and non-AMD causes of CNV, and its use will likely continue as there is a significant difference in cost without a similar difference in efficacy when compared to FDA-approved treatments, such as ranibizumab, in studies performed to date.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Intravitreal ranibizumab is a safe and effective treatment for neovascular AMD, RVO, and DME. It can successfully reverse vision loss in patients with these conditions and is well tolerated. The visual and anatomic improvements seen with ranibizumab can hopefully allow patients to maintain their quality of life and prevent severe vision loss.</p><p>Assessment of the data within individual studies and comparison between studies can be limited by multiple factors. In SAILOR,<xref rid="b15-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> there may have been a lack of interinvestigator consistency in assessment of fluorescein angiography, as different investigators made inclusion and exclusion assessments based on fluorescein angiography findings. Additionally, a large proportion of patients discontinued the study early. This was also seen in other studies, especially those with longer-term follow-up. For example, in the RIDE and RISE<xref rid="b30-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> studies, 20% to 32.2% of patients did not complete the study to 3 years. Selection bias may also play a role, as some studies may have been more likely to enroll patients with more severe or treatment-refractory disease while others enrolled patients with less severe disease. Also, in studies requiring investigators to determine need for PRN ranibizumab treatment or laser treatment, there is the potential for significant variability. The HORIZON<xref rid="b22-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> study for RVO was limited as it was an open-label, nonrandomized trial. In addition, interstudy comparison may not be possible due to variability in inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack were excluded from RESTORE<xref rid="b31-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and CRUISE,<xref rid="b21-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> which only included patients with BCVA &lt;20/40, potentially excluding patients with less severe disease. The applicability of the results of the HARBOR<xref rid="b16-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> study may be limited as the studied population was a fairly homogeneous population within the United States only. Finally, interstudy comparison may not be possible due to differences inherent to the studies. The use of triamcinolone in DRCR.net<xref rid="b33-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> likely led to the more rapid development of cataracts in treated patients, confounding visual outcomes.</p><p>While the benefit from ranibizumab treatment is tremendous, and the treatment regimen is well tolerated, many important questions remain unanswered. In patients with ME due to RVO, it remains unclear when treatment should be initiated, as a small percentage of patients improve spontaneously<xref rid="b29-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b39-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> and may be unnecessarily exposed to risk with treatment. On the other hand, many studies showed the greatest treatment effect within the first 7 days of treatment and with earlier initiation of ranibizumab therapy. The role of adjunctive therapy is also unclear and further studies are necessary.</p><p>As the safety of intravitreal ranibizumab is evaluated, it is important to consider that some ocular AEs and SAEs are inherent to all intravitreal injections, not just ranibizumab. Additionally, certain nonocular AEs and SAEs are more common in the diseased population in general, not specific to those receiving ranibizumab. For example, the incidence of death and CVA were higher in the ranibizumab groups in RISE and RIDE,<xref rid="b25-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> although it is known that patients with diabetes and DME are already at a greater risk of myocardial infarction and CVA compared to patients with diabetes without ophthalmic complications.<xref rid="b40-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Additionally, some studies showed the reverse effect, with higher rates of AEs in control patients. The results from DRCR.net<xref rid="b33-opth-9-533" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> showed that sham-treated patients had higher rates of vascular death, myocardial infarction, and CVA than ranibizumab-treated patients.</p><p>Ranibizumab for the treatment of neovascular AMD, ME in RVO, and DME is effective and safe. It has greatly expanded the available armamentarium of FDA-approved treatments for the aforementioned conditions and has been shown, time and time again, to improve vision and prevent further vision loss in patients with neovascular posterior segment diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by Research to Prevent Blindness, New York, NY,
