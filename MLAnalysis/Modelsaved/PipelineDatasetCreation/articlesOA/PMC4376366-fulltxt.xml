During the past twenty years, ALV-J has emerged as a serious cause of mortality and suboptimal performance in domestic chickens. Significant economic losses caused by ALV-J infection can be associated with immunosuppression, weight loss and myeloid leukosis formation. The transmission of ALV-J is much higher than other ALV subgroups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and some birds show immunological tolerance against the virus, thus making control and eradication much more difficult. Due to vaccines are largely ineffective, new measures against ALV-J are needed to be developed. RNA interference (RNAi) has shown a promising antiviral strategy in poultry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>RNAi regulate posttranscriptional gene using small RNAs produced through multicomplex machinery to guide suppression of complementary transcripts. In general, short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) shows more efficient than small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for transient gene knockdown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Simple stem-loop shRNAs transcribed from Pol-III promoters enter the processing machinery at the level of Dicer and can be effective RNAi triggers. Several cases showed successes in interference of ALV replication by using shRNA. Hu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] showed that siRNAs containing sequences of the gag gene of avian leukosis virus (ALV), when electroporated into chicken embryos, were effective at slowing viral propagation. Chen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] demonstrated that cells expressing shRNA-mirs targeting the tvb receptor sequence or the viral env (B) sequence significantly inhibited ALV-B replication. Meng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] also demonstrated that the gag target was shown to effectively suppress the replication of ALV-J by 19.0&#8211;77.3%. Though above data showed effective interference virus replication by shRNA, however, their enforced expression can saturate endogenous microRNA (miRNA) pathways and result in severe toxicities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Moreover, Gu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] revealed that Dicer is imprecise in processing commonly used simple stem-loop designs, which increases the likelihood of aberrant guide- and passenger-strand mediated off-target effects.</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous substrates for the RNAi machinery. They are initially expressed as ~80&#160;nt long RNA hairpin located within polymerase II (pol II)-derived transcripts referred to as primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs), which are processed within the nucleus into ~60&#160;nt precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) hairpins by the RNase III enzyme Drosha and its cofactor DGCR8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The loop is removed by further processing in the cytoplasm by another RNase III enzyme Dicer and its cofactor TRBP, yielding an RNA duplex of ~20&#160;bp flanked by 2-nt 3&#8242; overhangs. The RNA strand is loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and forms the mature miRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The miRNA then guides RISC to mRNAs bearing complementary target sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Base on endogenous miRNA biogenesis pathways, a novel approach established with introducing synthetic shRNA stems into the context of endogenous miRNAs can trigger potent knockdown. A number of miRNA backbones can be used, including miR-155, miR-30 and miR17-92 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we screened the optimal sequence of target siRNA in gag, pol, env and LTR of ALV-J genome for RNAi ALV-J replication.

After transfection assay, ALV-J infected DF-1 cells were transfected or day old SPF chicks were inoculated with single target or double targets recombinant vectors.

RNAi generally arises from two types of intermediary molecules: micro-RNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Both siRNA and miRNA can stop production of specific proteins by triggering degradation of specific mRNAs. However, due to its simple short-hairpin, the interference efficiency of siRNA is less than miRNA. miRNA genes transcribed as larger &#8220;pri-miRNA&#8221; precursors have been found to more effectively generate an RNAi effect. In this case, we designed to replace the stem region of a miRNA gene with the target viral siRNA sequence and its guide RNA complement, namely, constructing a pri-miRNA containing target viral siRNA, and then to test the interference efficiency. The results demonstrated that the method of miRNA embedded siRNA is widely effective for any genes in ALV-J at inhibiting viral replication, and the interference efficiency is higher than previous report regardless of any single target. For getting higher interference efficiency, we used double targets to co-transfect DF-1 cells that infected by ALV-J. Since ALV-J comprise of three constructive genes of gag, pol and env, and two non-coding genes of LTR. So, we designed LTR combining with other three constructive genes. The RNAi result showed that the double-target RNAi dramatically decreased ALV-J mRNA copies in cultured cells, suggesting that double target of miRNA embedded siRNA is more efficient method for inhibition of ALV-J replication and possible for application of clinical practice.</p><p>Comparing simple stem-loop, the pre-miRNA (miRNA-embedded siRNA) which has double loops has several advantages: (1) like endogenous miRNAs, miRNA-embedded siRNA can be expressed more efficiently and higher interference efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]; (2) multiple miRNA-embedded siRNA can be expressed as a polycistron, providing a setup for combinatorial RNAi studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]; (3) miRNA-embedded siRNA are less prone to cause toxicities by interfering with endogenous miRNA pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]; (4) the natural loop configuration of miRNA-embedded siRNA ensures precise Dicer cleavage and reduces off-target effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, a major concern for the miRNA embedded siRNA is the possibility of clinical application. So, we singlely or doubly delivered plasmids into body cavity of day-old chicks by injection. For getting obvious results, we took high dose of 10<sup>5.2</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> ALV-J and Lipofectamin 2000 coated recombinant plasmids. The results demonstrated that the plasmid containing miRNA embedded siRNA can significantly reduce ALV-J viremia and pathogenicity, especially in double-target RNAi groups, although it could not completely inhibit ALV-J replication. The incomplete inhibition could be due to the high dose of ALV-J, the administration route of recombinant plasmids, or the vectors and so on. The apparent higher titer of the ALV-J challenge and improper administration route may have impaired the interference ability of recombinant plasmid. For clinical practice, the optimal RNAi condition in vivo is needed to be further studied in future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study has demonstrated that miRNA embedded siRNA method is an effective method to inhibit ALV-J replication in vitro and in vivo. The double-target of miRNA-embedded siRNA showed more powerful inhibitive effect than those of single target. The RNAi of miRNA embedded siRNA has a potential value for clinical application in poultry flocks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Virus, cells and animals</title><p>The animals used in this study were approved by the Shandong Animal Care and Use Committee (SDACUC number 14-095).

Infection status was identified by ELISA for antibody and antigen test at interval day. Briefly, serum samples from jugular vein were tested for the presence of ALV-J antibodies and cloaca swabs were tested for the presence of group specific antigen (p27). Viral loads in blood were detected by quantitative real time RT-PCR (qPCR). Chickens were necropsied at the termination of the experiment, and the gross and histopathology lesions were observed.<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>
