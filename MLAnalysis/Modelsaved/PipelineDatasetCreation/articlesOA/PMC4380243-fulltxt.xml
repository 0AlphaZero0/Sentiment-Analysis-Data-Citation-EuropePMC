Its specific function is intricately regulated and its aberrant activities have been observed for a number of human diseases. Here we report a remarkable yin-yang haplotype pattern encompassing <italic>gephyrin</italic>. Yin-yang haplotypes arise when a stretch of DNA evolves to present two disparate forms that bear differing states for nucleotide variations along their lengths. The <italic>gephyrin</italic> yin-yang pair consists of 284 divergent nucleotide states and both variants vary drastically from their mutual ancestral haplotype, suggesting rapid evolution. Several independent lines of evidence indicate strong positive selection on the region and suggest these high-frequency haplotypes represent two distinct functional mechanisms. This discovery holds potential to deepen our understanding of variable human-specific regulation of <italic>gephyrin</italic> while providing clues for rapid evolutionary events and allelic migrations buried within human history.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S2"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="P2">Gephyrin is a 93 kDa multi-functional protein that was named after the Greek word for &#8216;bridge&#8217; due to its role in linking neurotransmitter receptors to the microtubule cytoskeleton. It binds polymerized tubulin with high affinity, likely due to a motif with high sequence similarities to the binding domains of MAP2 and tau<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. This protein dynamically provides a scaffold for clustering of proteins for both glycine and GABA-A receptors in inhibitory synapses, plays a crucial role in synapse formation and plasticity, and is believed to hold a central role in maintaining homeostatic excitation-inhibition balance<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Gephyrin has remarkably diverse functions. It associates with translation initiation machinery and has been implicated in the regulation of synaptic protein synthesis<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. It also interacts with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key protein for nutrient-sensitive cell cycle regulation, and has been shown to be required for downstream mTOR signaling<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Interestingly, gephyrin clustering at GABAergic synapses is increased by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-mediated mTOR activation and decreased by glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3&#946;) phosphorylation<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Gephyrin is also indispensable for molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) biosynthesis as it is necessary for the insertion of molybdenum during this essential process<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. MoCo deficiency leads to severe neurological damage and early childhood death. The fusion of an ancient function (MoCo biosynthesis) with an evolutionarily young function (neuroreceptor clustering) is believed to impact catalytic efficacy of MoCo synthesis by improving product-substrate channeling<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Finally, gephyrin was recently observed to localize within a ~600kDa cytoplasmic complex of unknown composition in non-neuronal cells, and it has been speculated that this complex might be involved in nutrient sensing, glucose metabolism, or aging, perhaps due to gephyrin&#8217;s interactions with mTOR<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3"><italic>Gephyrin</italic>&#8217;s protein-coding regions are identical to the chimpanzee ortholog and are highly conserved across species. In contrast, regulation of this gene is highly variable. <italic>Gephyrin</italic> produces complex alternative splicing isoforms, which are crucial for its diverse functions, and at least eight of the 29 exons of this mosaic gene are subject to alternative splicing in species-, tissue-, cell-, and/or environmentally-specific manners<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. It is believed that the gephyrin scaffold in inhibitory synapses is a hexagonal lattice with twofold and three-fold symmetry and some alternative splicing isoforms disrupt this structure<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. These alternate forms may provide a mechanism for plasticity and the dynamics of receptor anchoring by acting as dominant-negative variants which bind and remove receptors from synapses<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. In concordance, MoCo biosynthesis activity is also isoform dependent, with various cassette insertions or deletions inactivating this synthesis<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. For these reasons, unraveling the regulatory mechanisms is essential for elucidating and understanding gephyrin&#8217;s dynamic and diverse activities and functions.</p><p id="P4">Markers within introns and in close genomic proximity are prominent candidates for regulatory elements, and the region encompassing <italic>gephyrin</italic> has been noted previously by two different groups. A 2.1 Mb region of homozygosity (ROH) in this location was discovered in 2010<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. ROHs are correlated with linkage disequilibrium (LD) and have been observed to sometimes bear markedly disparate haplotypes<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. In their 2010 paper, Curtis and Vine determined 20 genomic regions which had the largest number of subjects showing an ROH and studied the haplotypes of the nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the center of each of these regions, observing that the haplotypes showed significant excess disparity, <italic>i.e.</italic> a tendency for pairs to simultaneously differ at multiple SNPs<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. The term <italic>yin-yang haplotypes</italic> was coined to capture the polarity of such structures when a 24-SNP pattern for which two haplotypes with differing states at each site and a combined frequency of 0.50 was discovered by Zhang <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Curtis and Vine noted that the ten most common haplotypes for the nine SNPs in the <italic>gephyrin</italic> region had a combined frequency of 0.67, indicating surprisingly little diversity of haplotypes. Interestingly, eight of these ten haplotypes yielded four pairs of yin-yang haplotypes, each of which bore different allelic states at all nine SNPs, indicating the haplotypes which did occur were remarkably different from each other.</p><p id="P5">In a 2012 study unrelated to yin-yang haplotypes, this region was identified by Park<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> in a genome-wide scan of LD. This study identified an exceptionally strong LD block and discussed &#8216;extraordinary&#8217; frequency spectra for all HapMap<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> populations in a 1 Mb region centered on intron 2 of <italic>gephyrin</italic>. Park concluded that the phenomenon could be due to a selective sweep and reviewed a number of selective pressure analyses, noting that this region had been included in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplementary materials</xref> by two of these studies<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and completely overlooked by the others. Park noted the uniqueness of this region, but the underlying yin-yang pattern went undetected.</p><p id="P6">In an exploration of genome-wide population data, we apply a recently developed method named BlocBuster<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> to SNP data for individuals in HapMap<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> populations and discover a high-frequency 284-SNP yin-yang haplotype pair embedded in noncoding regions within and surrounding <italic>gephyrin</italic>. Both haplotypes vary drastically from their mutual ancestral haplotype, yet they are highly conserved across global human populations, specifying two radically distinct evolutionary paths within a single genomic region. Furthermore, we report several independent lines of evidence indicating the identified yin and yang haplotypes are under selective pressure, thereby suggesting two distinct and functionally significant mechanisms underlie these regions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S4"><title><italic>Gephyrin</italic> is encompassed within a yin-yang haplotype pair</title><p id="P7">We applied our BlocBuster method<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> (see Methods) to SNP data for unrelated individuals in four HapMap populations<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>: CEU, CHB, JPT, and YRI. BlocBuster constructs networks that reveal haploid groups of SNP alleles that are inter-correlated, referred to as <italic>blocs</italic>. The results were highly consistent across all of the autosomal chromosomes, except chromosome 14, which had unusual network characteristics (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 1</xref>). We then applied BlocBuster to HapMap data for four different populations: GIH, LWK, MKK, and TSI<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, and again chromosome 14 was an outlier. A closer examination revealed the source of the anomalies - 73% of all of the edges in the first network were concentrated into a single bloc with 255 SNP alleles and 74% of the edges in the second network were concentrated into two blocs with 264 and 257 SNP alleles, respectively. The two blocs in the second network share 241 SNPs in common, with opposite alleles appearing in each bloc. Furthermore, these SNPs span the same genomic region as the bloc in the first network.</p><p id="P8">Overall, the three blocs found by the two analyses capture a single yin-yang haplotype pair. The three blocs possess 226 SNPs in common and span across 284 unique SNPs overall (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Dataset 1</xref>). We define this yin-yang pair using these 284 highly correlated SNPs. (See <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 1</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> for description of an additional bloc corresponding to the yang haplotype for the first analysis.) This yin-yang pair is located on 14q23.3, encompassing <italic>gephyrin</italic> (<italic>GPHN</italic>) and extending beyond by ~300 kb upstream and downstream of <italic>gephyrin</italic> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Interestingly, all of the divergent markers appear within introns, long non-coding RNA, or intergenic regions. As illustrated by the color coded bar above the first two columns of matrices in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, few SNPs are downstream from <italic>gephyrin</italic> (2.7%, 3.4%, and 5.1% for the 255-, 264-, and 257-SNP blocs, respectively) and none lie within <italic>MPP5</italic>. About one-fifth of the SNPs lie upstream from <italic>gephyrin</italic> (19.2%, 18.6%, and 20.6%) and all three blocs include the same eight SNPs within the long non-coding RNA, <italic>LINC00238</italic>. Most of the SNPs lie within non-coding regions of <italic>gephyrin</italic> (78.0%, 78.0%, and 74.3%).</p><p id="P9">Due to the high proportion of heterozygotes within the Asian populations, we further interrogated these results using computationally phased haplotypes for the CHB and JPT populations provided by the HapMap Consortium. There are few yin-yang SNPs downstream from gephyrin and they are sparser and more variable than the other SNPs, so we omitted them from this analysis (see Methods). The available phased haplotypes did not include all of the yin-yang SNPs, and after removing SNPs with more than 5% missing data there remained 236 SNPs in phased haplotypes for 170 CHB+JPT individuals, for a total of 340 phased chromosomes. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> shows the percentages of yin and yang SNP alleles found on each of the 340 phased chromosomes. These plots illustrate the prominence of the two divergent haplotypes and rarity of intermediate haplotypes.</p><p id="P10">Interleaving SNPs lying between the yin-yang SNPs generally have low minor allele frequencies (MAF), as shown in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figs. 4&#8211;11</xref>. A close examination of the interleaving SNPs for the Asian populations indicate that a handful of individuals tend to possess most of the minor alleles (appearing in the high-resolution images as horizontal dotted lines across the yin-yang region of the matrix). Note that these individuals are not correlated with yin or yang haplotype status and consequently the variants are not likely to be hitchhiking with the yin or yang haplotypes.</p><p id="P11">These results indicate exceptionally high linkage amongst the 284 SNPs spanning more than 1 Mb and primarily located within noncoding regions of <italic>gephyrin</italic> and immediately upstream. Notably, two distinct haplotypes with differing states at all of the SNPs are unusually common and appear across global populations.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Conservation of yin-yang haplotypes within <italic>Homo</italic> populations</title><p id="P12">As shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, the yin and yang haplotypes are prominent for all eleven HapMap populations, with combined frequencies ranging from 0.28 to 0.80. The pie charts in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> indicate the frequencies of the yin and yang haplotypes and the white regions represent the portion of partial haplotypes with one or more alleles that do not conform to an entire yin or yang pattern. The percentages of homozygotes and heterozygotes are listed on the right of each matrix. The two European-ancestry populations, CEU and TSI, have large percentages of yin homozygotes. Three African populations, LWK, MKK, and YRI, have high frequencies of the yang haplotypes and possess a recombination block near the end of the haplotypes, while individuals with African ancestry in Southwest USA (ASW) have a yang frequency of 0.07 and a shorter recombination block.</p><p id="P13">The East and South Asian populations (CHB, CHD, GIH and JPT) exhibit the strongest mix of yin and yang haplotypes. Every one of these four populations exhibit frequencies of at least 0.25 for each of the yin and yang haplotypes and the combined frequencies for the CHB and JPT populations reach 0.76 and 0.80, respectively. The Chinese in Metropolitan Denver, Colorado, USA (CHD) are similar to the Han Chinese in Beijing, China (CHB), although there is some recombination near the start of the haplotypes for the CHD. The GIH, with ancestry from the Indian subcontinent, possess frequencies that are similar to the East Asian populations, albeit with decreased yang homozygotes and increased haplotype diversity.</p><p id="P14">The 1000 Genomes Project<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> includes genotype data for 2,504 individuals from 26 global populations, representing each major human ancestry. Although imputed data are included in these files, we built a BlocBuster network to test the robustness of the results found for the HapMap data, as described in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 2</xref>. The yin and yang haplotypes are pronounced for these individuals (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), thereby supporting the HapMap results.</p><p id="P15">Ancestral alleles for the 284 yin-yang SNPs were determined by comparing human and chimpanzee DNA (see Methods) and are shown in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>. Both the yin and yang haplotypes are significantly different from the ancestral haplotype, sharing only 51.4% and 48.6% identity by state (IBS), respectively. The macaque, orangutan, and chimpanzee haplotypes are also shown in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and are generally similar to the ancestral haplotype.</p><p id="P16">The available Neandertal and Denisovan data also predominantly match the ancestral alleles. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> displays 15 SNP alleles for three Neandertal and the single individual available from the Denisovan fossil site<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> (Neand/Denis) that have been typed on the Affymetrix HuOrigin array<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. The SNP ascertainment approach for the HuOrigin array had a bias for SNPs with matching Denisovan and chimpanzee alleles (see Methods). As shown in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, all but one of the 15 matches the chimpanzee and ancestral alleles. In all, 11 of the 15 SNP alleles, including the derived allele, match the yin haplotype. Also shown in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> are high-coverage genotypes for the Denisovan individual<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. In contrast to the Neand/Denis data, all 125 SNPs match the yang haplotype. Although there is no apparent reason to expect a bias in these data, 95.2% of the alleles are IBS with both the ancestral and chimpanzee alleles. This is unexpected as less than half of the yang alleles are IBS with the ancestral alleles.</p><p id="P17">Overall, while the yin-yang genotypic patterns are not conserved across species outside the <italic>Homo</italic> genus, they are highly conserved across the HapMap populations, with combined frequencies ranging from 0.28 to 0.80 for the pair, as detailed in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Selection for the yin and yang haplotypes</title><p id="P18">Several lines of evidence suggest the yin and yang haplotypes are under strong positive selection and bear functional importance. First, a series of diverse statistical tests for selection indicate positive selection for the region, as shown in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>. The left panel of the figure shows the results for four selection tests computed over four HapMap populations. The right panel shows results for selection tests computed over the 1000 Genomes Project data (released April 2012). The topmost plot on the right represents a selective sweep scan on Neandertal vs. human polymorphisms, followed by rank scores for 13 tests for selection<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> (see Methods). Both panels include results from Fay and Wu&#8217;s H test<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. This test was specifically designed to distinguish between positive selection and background selection by utilizing data from outgroup species. As shown in the figure, the yin-yang interval has a statistically significant H value. Taken together, these results indicate strong positive selection within the yin-yang region.</p><p id="P19">It is worth noting that Nielsen <italic>et al.</italic> found that <italic>gephyrin</italic> showed no evidence for positive selection (p-value = 1.0)<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> in the coding regions of the gene. Their calculations were specifically based upon the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations within coding regions. In view of the strong selection pressure in the host genomic region, but not upon <italic>gephyrin</italic> exons, it follows that selection pressures may be acting upon functional elements within noncoding regions.</p><p id="P20">Second, the size, composition, and geographic distribution of yin and yang haplotypes indicate rapid evolution suggestive of strong positive selection. While the 284 identified SNPs have zero IBS between the yin and yang pair, the appearance of these haplotypes across eleven diverse populations must be identity by descent (IBD) for each haplotype, due to the identical states of hundreds of SNP alleles. Recall that the yin haplotype is prominent in European populations, yang is prominent in African populations, and Asian populations have nearly equal proportions. This observation, along with the assumption that the haplotypes are IBD, suggests that the Asian occurrences arose via gene flow or admixture. It follows that more than one hundred nucleotide mutations became fixed for <italic>each</italic> of the two haplotypes after their split from each other and prior to their migration to Asia. Such rapid evolution is indicative of strong selection. Surprisingly, these mutations remain generally fixed in these haplotypes in modern populations and all of the intermediate haplotypes that arose between the initial split and fixed states have low frequencies or have disappeared entirely.</p><p id="P21">Third, the unusual recombination patterns in this region support selection favoring the yin and yang haplotypes. A close examination of <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> suggests that recombinants comprised of both a yin and yang parental haplotype are generally rare, particularly within <italic>gephyrin</italic> and upstream from this gene. Such a recombinant would appear as a horizontal bar comprised of blocks that are two different colors in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. As shown in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, nine of the 340 CHB and JPT haplotypes have between 10% and 90% yin/yang compositions; six of these represent yin-yang recombinants and three represent intermediate yin or yang haplotypes with more than 10% mutational variations. Indeed, the prevalence of each of the distinct yin and yang haplotypes, despite strong coexistence and recombination opportunities, indicates very low recombination events between yin and yang haplotypes. However, as shown in <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, previous analyses of this region provided by the HapMap Consortium (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/downloads/recombination/">http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/downloads/recombination/</ext-link>) reported moderate recombination within the region, including an estimated recombination rate of 9.2 cM/Mb at rs10133120 in the 5&#8242; end of <italic>gephyrin</italic>. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that recombinants comprised of two yin haplotypes and/or recombinants comprised of two yang haplotypes are more prevalent than recombinants merging yin and yang haplotypes together. This observation suggests that yin and yang haplotypes may have been favorably selected over merged yin and yang recombinants.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S7"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p id="P22">It has been estimated that 5% of the human genome is under selection, yet only about 1% of the genome is protein-coding<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, indicating that selection acts upon more noncoding than coding regions. Furthermore, transcription is pervasive and about 70% to 90% of the human genome is transcribed, producing a vast array of noncoding RNA<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. Some long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) have been documented to play critical regulatory roles. For example, the X-inactivate-specific transcript (XIST) is vital for inactivating the X chromosome for females by directly binding an epigenetic complex. Closer to protein-coding regions, untranslated regions (UTRs) contain the internal ribosome entry sites and riboswitches that participate in regulation of expression as well as alternative splicing<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Furthermore, 3&#8242;UTRs host binding sites for microRNAs that inhibit translation<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. Intronic regions can provide noncoding RNA and are also involved in alternative splicing and transcription regulation<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. Alternatively, transcription of antisense strands can produce noncoding RNAs involved in a variety of biological roles<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P23">The protein-coding regions of gephyrin are highly conserved and its diverse roles are accomplished via regulatory variations. Noncoding elements within its introns and upstream are prime candidates for such regulatory control. Importantly, aberrant regulation of this gene has been associated with a host of complex diseases. Dysfunction in the regulation of gephyrin expression levels and/or isoform production has been implicated for Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD)<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>, epilepsy<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>, autism<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, schizophrenia<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>, hyperekplexia<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, and chorein deficiency<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. Gephyrin levels are significantly reduced in AD brains<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>, and the normally strong correlations between gephyrin production and the abundances of the six most common GABA subunits is corrupted in AD brains<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. It has also been observed that abnormal accumulations of low-molecular weight gephyrin plaques overlap beta-amyloid plaques<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. Epilepsy is characterized by abnormal excessive excitatory neuronal activities, and dysfunction of inhibitory neurons and/or down-regulation of inhibitory circuits may be the underlying cause<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. Gephyrin plays a vital role in inhibitory circuits. Both reduced levels of gephyrin production, as well as the appearance of aberrant gephyrin isoforms, have been observed in epileptogenesis<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. In individuals lacking gephyrin mutations, four aberrant gephyrin isoforms with missing exons have been observed to arise due to cellular stress. These isoforms display dominant negative effects on normal gephyrin in epileptogenesis<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Other alternative isoforms have been identified as risk factors for autism and schizophrenia and may also act as dominant-negative variants<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Athanasiu et al. conducted a GWAS of schizophrenia in Norwegian and European samples and tabulated 32 SNPs in the human genome with the most significant associations<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. Seven of the 32 are amongst the yin-yang SNPs, specifically: rs1952070, rs6573695, rs17247749, rs17836572, rs1885198, rs6573706, and rs7154017. Overall, the associations of gephyrin regulation with a half-dozen complex diseases strongly motivate the need to understand the genetic machinery driving the diverse manifestations of this highly conserved gene.</p><p id="P24">We present a remarkably long yin-yang haplotype pair spanning the noncoding regions of <italic>gephyrin</italic>. This genetic phenomenon is more than an order of magnitude larger than any previously reported yin-yang pair and is prevalent across eleven global human populations. Despite the conservation of these haplotypes across human populations, both are highly dissimilar to their common ancestral haplotype, suggesting they are the result of two divergent human-specific evolutionary paths. We advance this hypothesis by reporting several independent lines of evidence supporting selection for the two haplotypes. Taken together, this research lays the groundwork for a deep understanding of the regulatory control of <italic>gephyrin</italic>.</p><p id="P25">It is not clear how this genetic anomaly arose. Mutation and recombination have created vast amounts of haplotype diversity in many species, including humans. Previous reports have suggested that human-specific traits evolved primarily due to positive selection in noncoding regions involved in the regulation of genes<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. The most eminent of these characteristics is the human brain, with its increased size and enhanced cognition, and it has been demonstrated that selection acting upon noncoding regions is predominantly associated with neural development, whereas selection acting upon protein coding regions is associated with immunity, olfaction, and male reproduction<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. In short, it is viable to expect that human-specific adaptations of <italic>gephyrin</italic> are due to evolution of regulatory mechanisms lying within noncoding regions, particularly those in close proximity.</p><p id="P26">A key question follows: why would two extremely divergent paths arise during such adaptation? One possibility is a chromosomal inversion resulting with a lack of recombination between the original and inverted variant. In such an event, the original and inverted haplotypes would evolve independently. Strong positive selection could drive the evolution of a single high-frequency haplotype for each group. Several systematic searches for inversions have been conducted over the human genome<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>. The most recent investigation mapped 6.1 million clones to distinct genomic positions for eight HapMap individuals (4 YRI, 2 CEU, 1 CHB, and 1 JPT) and identified 224 inversions<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>. One of these is a 31.1 kb inversion in <italic>FUT8</italic>, which is 763 kb upstream from <italic>gephyrin</italic>. However, none of the three studies identified an inversion in the yin-yang region.</p><p id="P27">Another possible impetus for this pattern could be incompatible mutations. Suppose two independent mutations each possess a selective advantage individually, but the combination of the two mutations reduces fitness. For example, each of the mutations could increase the expression of a particular gene in a beneficial manner, but together they produce deleteriously high expression. Selection would favor haplotypes possessing either mutation, and recombinants possessing both or neither mutation would become rare. Over time the two haplotypes bearing each of the original mutations would evolve in distinct manners.</p><p id="P28">At least one other alternate mechanism could have led to the extreme divergence of the yin and yang haplotypes: convergent evolution in isolated ancient populations followed by gene flow<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup>. Opportunities for such events have been common throughout human history. For example, recent sequencing of fossil DNA has led to an estimate that modern non-African populations may possess approximately 1.5% to 2.1% Neandertal DNA<sup><xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup>. DNA related to the single individual found at Denisova is also found in modern island Southeast Asia and Oceania populations, with modern Papuans possessing 6% of their DNA closely related to the Denisovan individual&#8217;s DNA<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. As shown in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, the Neandertal and Denisovan genotypes are highly similar to the ancestral haplotype. However, in addition to the small number of Neandertal genotypes, another weakness of this analysis is that the currently available data is based on few individuals. Increased sample size, increased marker density, and further investigations, such as comparisons with nuclear DNA from the 300,000-year-old hominins from Sima de los Huesos<sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> when it becomes available, are needed to determine the likelihood that ancient admixture lies at the root of this yin-yang.</p><p id="P29">All of the described hypothetical mechanisms are likely to exhibit <italic>differential</italic> recombination, as is observed for the <italic>gephyrin</italic> yin-yang pair. The recombination rate amongst yin haplotypes and the rate amongst yang haplotypes appear substantially higher than the rate between yin and yang parental haplotypes. Selection is likely to be the strongest for chromosomal inversions as a recombination event between yin and yang haplotypes results with too few or too many copies of genes upstream and downstream from the crossover point and general abolition of a gene spanning this point. The existence of recombinants, including those with crossover points within <italic>gephyrin</italic>, casts doubt that an inversion underlies this anomaly. On a different note, a test for differential recombination might prove to be a valuable tool for assessing functionality of other yin-yang haplotype pairs previously identified and those to be mapped in the coming years. In general, if the yin and yang haplotypes are not functional, this type of differential recombination across coexisting haplotypes would be improbable.</p><p id="P30">The forces that produced this phenomenon, as well as the biological implications of its presence, invite exploration of an evolutionary &#8216;road less traveled&#8217; that produced two highly divergent, and uniquely human, genetic patterns intricately interwoven with the conserved protein-coding regions of <italic>gephyrin</italic>. These results solicit new questions and provide material for hypotheses generation. Several avenues of future research have appealing potential, a couple of which are highlighted below.</p><p id="P31">With regard to gephyrin in particular, deep sequencing of the yin-yang region for ancient and modern populations could be valuable for discerning molecular-level function as well as providing insights into the historical journeys of the haplotypes. Also, testing for associations between yin-yang status and various phenotypes could provide valuable knowledge. Candidate phenotypes include transcript isoforms, variations of gene expression, and susceptibilities to complex diseases such as epilepsy, autism, and schizophrenia, which have previously shown to be associated with distinct isoforms of <italic>gephyrin</italic><sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. It should be noted that the use of animal models in previous studies of gephyrin might have been confounded and misleading as both the yin and yang haplotypes are uniquely human.</p><p id="P32">More generally, mapping of additional yin-yang haplotypes within the human genome, and other genomes of interest, may pinpoint genetic mechanisms underlying convergent pathways and/or expose regions undergoing rapid evolution. Additionally, when combined with geographic distributions, these patterns may provide distinguishable flags for understanding the histories of individuals and populations. Importantly, they may capture valuable features of an individual&#8217;s genetic background and their susceptibility to complex traits, perhaps aiding personalized medicine. Looking forward, in addition to increasing our understanding of the human-specific regulation of a vitally important gene, this haplotype pair may serve as a model for studying yin-yang haplotypes and their biological implications for human health and development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S8"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="S9"><title>HapMap data</title><p id="P33">HapMap bulk data were downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>.

Briefly, we developed the approach with an aim to identify combinations of correlated alleles that are subjected to genetic heterogeneity. The correlation metric, CCC, is customized for genotype data and appreciates heterogeneity by evaluating four distinct correlations that retain independence between different types of pair-wise correlations. This specification of correlation types is retained in an allele-specific network construction which increases the network infrastructure yet maintains high efficiency. We determined the CCC threshold using the default method of setting the number of edges in the network equal to the number of SNPs. After preprocessing and cleaning the data, there were 36,542 SNPs in the CEU, CHB, JPT, YRI chromosome 14 dataset and 40,820 SNPs in the GIH, LWK, MKK, TSI chromosome 14 dataset and each of the networks contained the corresponding number of edges, representing the most significant CCC correlations for each analysis. Consequently, the average degree of each node in each of the networks was one. The significance of this correlation threshold was tested using permutation trials<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. After the networks were constructed, groups of nodes that were connected by edges were readily identified as they were completely isolated from each other.

All 125 identified genotypes for the Denisovan haplotype are homozygous for the allele shown and this haplotype matches the yang haplotype at all 125 sites. However it is also highly similar to the ancestral haplotype, with 95.2% of the alleles matching. On the other hand, 11 of the 15 Neand/Denis alleles match the yin alleles while the remaining four match the ancestral, chimpanzee, orangutan, and macaque alleles. All but one of the Neand/Denis alleles match the ancestral haplotype and the derived allele matches the yin haplotype. Note that the variation that defines the yin and yang haplotypes (red font) is predominantly unique as 92.6% of the 284 alleles do not match the Neand/Denis, Denisovan, chimpanzee, or orangutan alleles (blue shading). Both the yin and yang haplotypes are dissimilar from the ancestral haplotype, having only about half of the SNP alleles in common, yet these two haplotypes are highly conserved across modern human populations.
