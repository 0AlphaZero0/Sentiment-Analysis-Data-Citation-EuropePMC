Here, we report key advances in our understanding of the regulation of B-1/B-2 development. First, modulation of Let-7 in fetal pro-B cells is sufficient to alter fetal B-1 development to produce B cells resembling the progeny of adult B-2 development. Second, intact BCR signaling is required for the generation of B1a B cells from Lin28b-transduced BM progenitors, supporting a requirement for ligand-dependent selection, as is the case for normal B1a B cells. Third, the V<sub>H</sub> repertoire of Lin28b-induced BM B1a B cells differs from that of normal B1a, suggesting persisting differences from fetal progenitors. Finally, we identify the Arid3a transcription factor as a key target of Let-7, whose ectopic expression is sufficient to induce B-1 development in adult pro-B cells and whose silencing by knockdown blocks B-1 development in fetal pro-B cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>B cells, a key arm of the immune system responsible for humoral immunity, are generated through a tightly regulated sequence of developmental stages, in the liver before birth and in the BM of adults. During B cell development, Ig heavy and light chains are rearranged and selected, yielding a diverse antigen receptor repertoire that is largely purged of high-affinity pathogenic self-reactivity (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Nemazee, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Goodnow, 2007</xref>). Importantly, mature B cells in mice are not completely homogenous across anatomical sites. In particular, certain functionally distinct subsets, such as the CD5<sup>+</sup> B cell (&#8220;B1a&#8221;) subset, show some degree of self-reactivity (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Hayakawa et al., 1984</xref>). A key unresolved issue is how these self-reactive cell types diverge from the primary B cell development pathway that generates follicular B cells. Study of the Ig heavy and light chains rearranged in these cells has shown that they constitute a biased set of B cell antigen receptors (BCRs; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">F&#246;rster et al., 1988</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Pennell et al., 1989</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Carmack et al., 1990</xref>), some of which have been shown to be selected by interaction with self-determinants (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Hayakawa et al., 1999</xref>), suggesting an instructive antigen-dependent model for CD5<sup>+</sup> B cell generation.</p><p>Early BM transfer experiments revealed poor generation of CD5<sup>+</sup> B cells (B1a) in adult hosts (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Hayakawa et al., 1985</xref>). Later experiments, using more defined populations of B cell progenitors from fetal and adult sources, showed that fetal precursors supported efficient production of B1a B cells, but repopulation of typical follicular B cells was inefficient (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Hardy and Hayakawa, 1991</xref>). These results led us to propose a switch in B cell lymphopoiesis during ontogeny, similar to the well-known switch from fetal to adult hemoglobin in erythropoiesis (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Groudine et al., 1983</xref>). Specifically, we suggested that the fetal pathway of development (termed &#8220;B-1&#8221;) is responsible for generating most of the CD5<sup>+</sup> B cell pool, whereas an adult pathway (termed &#8220;B-2&#8221;) generates most of the CD5<sup>&#8722;</sup> B cells that populate the adult (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Hardy and Hayakawa, 2001</xref>). The latter cells are often identified as follicular or &#8220;B2&#8221; B cells. We hypothesized that a distinctive gene program operating in B cell progenitors is responsible for the fetal-biased B-1 generation of CD5<sup>+</sup> B cells.</p><p>Therefore we analyzed fetal- and adult-origin B cell precursors for mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) expression differences by microarray to rigorously identify potential regulators that might play a role in the B-1/B-2 developmental switch. Cell fractions where initial Ig heavy chain rearrangement takes place, pre-pro-B (Fr. A) and pro-B (Fr. BC), were analyzed because these populations span the stage at which B lineage commitment occurs (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Rumfelt et al., 2006</xref>). Based on this idea of distinctive fetal and adult lymphopoiesis, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al. (2012)</xref> performed and published a similar analysis of pro-B stage cells, comparing gene expression and miRNA expression in such cells purified from fetal liver (FL) and adult BM of mice. They found that retroviral expression of Lin28b in BM stem cells generated innate-type B and T cells in transfer recipients (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2012</xref>). Considering the differential expression of Lin28b and Let-7 that they identified, they hypothesized that this &#8220;axis&#8221; functions to promote fetal development of B1a B cells and innate-type T cells.</p><p>Here we have asked whether perturbation of this regulatory axis can reprogram cells later than stem cells, at the committed pro-B cell stage. We have also asked whether reprogrammed cells still depend on BCR signaling for B1a B cell generation and identified genes altered by this axis to understand the mechanism of reprogramming. We found that ectopic provision of Lin28b as late as the pro-B stage in adults can redirect cells to the B-1 developmental pathway. Conversely, expression of Let-7b miRNA in fetal pro-B cells can switch fetal development to B-2. Transduction of Btk-deficient precursor cells from Xid mouse BM (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Hayakawa et al., 1983</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Rawlings et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 1995</xref>) reveals that normal BCR signaling is required for accumulation of CD5<sup>+</sup> B1 B cells, even when they are generated from Lin28b-redirected BM pro-B cells in the adult. Finally, we report a critical new role for the Arid3a (Bright, E2fbp1) transcription factor in promoting B-1 development. We found this factor in a gene expression screen designed to identify genes whose expression was reciprocally regulated by the Lin28b&#8211;Let-7 axis. Significantly, the Arid3a mRNA contained multiple Let-7 target motifs, consistent with regulation by this miRNA. Strikingly, retroviral transduction of adult BM pro-B cells with Arid3a induced generation of B1a B cells, and conversely, Arid3a shRNA inhibited B1a generation from FL pro-B cells, revealing its key role in the switch from B-2 to B-1 development.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Fetal and adult B cell progenitors: Distinctive progeny and differential Lin28b&#8211;Let-7 expression</title><p>Pro-B cells transferred into SCID mice generate B cells in the spleen and peritoneal cavity: most B cells arising from adult BM transfers are IgM<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>2+</sup>CD23<sup>+</sup>CD5<sup>&#8722;</sup>, in contrast to FL transfers which yield IgM<sup>2+</sup>IgD<sup>+/&#8722;</sup>CD23<sup>+/&#8722;</sup> B cells that are predominantly CD5<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Thus, B cells with distinctive cell surface phenotypes are generated in adult SCID mice from fetal and adult CD19<sup>+</sup> B cell precursors. Microarray analyses were performed to identify genes whose expression distinguished B-1 and B-2 development at pre-pro-B and pro-B stage cells, using two different platforms, selecting genes that showed concordant results in both stages and platforms.

Importantly, Lin28b and Let-7 can function as a molecular switch, in that Let-7 targets Lin28b mRNA for degradation and Lin28b functions to sequester pre&#8211;Let-7 from processing to functional miRNA (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Mayr et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Redirecting fetal and adult B cell development at the B cell&#8211;committed pro-B stage</title><p>To assess the developmental stage at which these regulators determine development, fetal and adult cells were retrovirally transduced to express Let-7b and Lin28b.

The developmental consequences of Lin28b expression in BM pro-B or early lymphoid progenitors were assessed by culturing transduced cells for an extended period. Many of the IgM<sup>+</sup> cells produced in these cultures were CD5<sup>+</sup>, whereas cells transduced with empty vector control retrovirus were not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Mature B cells are not generated efficiently in vitro, so we next performed cell transfer experiments with pro-B cells transduced to inappropriately express these regulators, i.e., Let-7 in FL and Lin28b in BM. Results, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>, were very clear. SCID mice receiving empty vector BM pro-B cells generated GFP<sup>+</sup> B cells that were IgM<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>2+</sup>CD5<sup>&#8722;</sup>CD23<sup>+</sup>CD21<sup>med</sup> (follicular type); in contrast, Lin28b BM pro-B cells generated GFP<sup>+</sup> B cells that were IgM<sup>2+</sup>IgD<sup>&#8722;</sup>CD23<sup>&#8722;</sup>CD21<sup>med</sup> and many CD5<sup>+</sup>. In contrast, SCID mice receiving empty vector FL pro-B cells generated GFP<sup>+</sup> B cells that were IgM<sup>2+</sup>IgD<sup>+/&#8722;</sup>CD23<sup>lo</sup> and many CD5<sup>+</sup>; in contrast, animals receiving Let-7b FL pro-B cells generated GFP<sup>+</sup> B cells that were IgM<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>2+</sup>CD5<sup>&#8722;</sup>CD23<sup>+</sup>. These findings indicate that alterations in the Lin28&#8211;Let-7 axis are both necessary and sufficient to specify fetal and adult lymphopoietic programs even after progenitors have adopted the B cell fate.

(2012)</xref> recently showed that retroviral transduction of BM hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells could generate large numbers of fetal-type T and B lymphocytes. Based on differential expression of Lin28b and Let-7 in FL and BM B cell progenitors, they proposed that the Lin28b&#8211;Let-7 axis functions to regulate the switch from fetal-type to adult-type lymphopoiesis, generating innate-like T and B cells. However, based on this work, it remained unclear whether altering Lin28B&#8211;Let-7 could reprogram development after commitment to the B cell fate had occurred. Here we show that B cell development can be efficiently reprogrammed as late as the CD19<sup>+</sup> pro-B stage. We also show that retroviral provision of Let-7 is sufficient to reprogram fetal pro-B cells to generate adult-type (B2) B cell progeny. Thus, we confirm and extend the earlier study, showing that the Lin28b&#8211;Let-7 axis mediates the B cell developmental switch that we proposed many years ago (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Hardy and Hayakawa, 1991</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, although we find that generation of CD5<sup>+</sup> B cells from Lin28b-transduced adult pro-B cells requires Btk signaling, as with fetal B1a generation, it does not fully recapitulate the fetal B1a BCR repertoire. Specifically, we observe a deficit of anti-PtC B cells that use V<sub>H</sub>11 and V<sub>H</sub>12 BCRs. One possible reason for lack of V<sub>H</sub>11 B cells, where the prototypic VDJs lack TdT-mediated N-addition at the junctions, is relatively modest regulation of TdT by Lin28b. However, even in BM pro-B cells lacking TdT, transduction of Lin28b did not recapitulate the normal fetal B1a repertoire. Considering that the typical B1a fetal-type repertoire requires appropriate initial BCR repertoire generation, selection, and accumulation, the failure of Lin28b-induced adult pro-B cells to generate a normal B1a repertoire may indicate further requirements for the generation of an appropriate initial BCR repertoire and/or fetal antigens lacking in the adult microenvironment.</p><p>Global analysis of genes reciprocally perturbed by misexpression of these regulators generated a relatively short list of candidate fetal/adult regulators. We considered the Arid3a transcription factor to be particularly interesting, based on its known functions of altering Ig heavy chain expression and inducing autoantibody production when overexpressed as a transgene (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Oldham et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, analysis of Arid3a on the TargetScan website revealed conserved Let-7 and miR-125b miRNA target sites in its 3&#8242;-UTR, both miRs which show relatively elevated expression in BM. Transduction of Arid3a into BM pro-B cells induced CD5<sup>+</sup> B1 B cells in SCID recipients, similar to results obtained by Lin28b transduction. Finally, loss-of-function shRNA knockdown showed that diminishing Arid3a mRNA levels in fetal pro-B cells could reprogram B-1 development, generating B cells with an adult-type phenotype. Thus, we conclude that a key consequence of altering the Lin28b&#8211;Let-7 axis is changing expression levels of Arid3a.</p><p>How might Arid3a be inducing the generation of B1a B cells from BM pro-B cells? This transcription factor was originally identified by its capacity to bind to IgH V segments, increasing their expression level in a cell line treated with antigen and IL-5 (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Herrscher et al., 1995</xref>). Later work showed that Arid3a was not restricted to activated B cells, but was also expressed in B cell progenitors (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Webb et al., 1998</xref>). Further analysis showed that Arid3a-binding site motifs were common in the promoter regions of both human and mouse V<sub>H</sub> genes (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Goebel et al., 2002</xref>). We speculate that Arid3a binding could alter the accessibility of V<sub>H</sub> genes to rearrangement, biasing the expression of these genes, selecting for B1a &#8220;preferred&#8221; BCRs. In addition, Arid3a overexpression has been shown to perturb B cell subset generation (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Oldham et al., 2011</xref>), and a dominant-negative transgene diminishes B1 B cell function (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Nixon et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, there is clear precedent for BRIGHT/Arid3a altering B cell development.</p><p>When expression of the Arid3a gene was eliminated in a gene-targeted mouse, the result was that &gt;99% of embryos died at midgestation from a failure of hematopoiesis (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Webb et al., 2011</xref>). Analysis of hematopoietic precursors and common lymphoid progenitors present in embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) FL showed reduced numbers of both cell types, and colony-forming assays revealed reduced function of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Rare surviving progeny (&lt;1%) were significantly smaller in size and had perturbed B lineage development, with fewer pro-B, pre-B, and immature B cells in BM and decreased numbers of transitional B cells in spleen. The follicular compartment was nearly normal, likely because of homeostatic compensation, but marginal zones were decreased and B1a B cells were essentially lacking. Thus, expression of Arid3a is required for normal early hematopoiesis and B lineage development. The difference that we describe between fetal and adult pro-B is therefore not all or none, but a difference in expression level, higher in fetal and lower in adult, that may serve to tune the response of the BCR, as described below, promoting B1 generation from FL and B2 production from adult BM.</p><p>Arid3a consists of an acidic N-terminal domain, an A-T&#8211;rich ARID DNA-binding domain, a transactivation domain, a helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein interaction domain, and a short C-terminal domain. Interestingly, Arid3a has been found to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, under the control of its HLH domain (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Kim and Tucker, 2006</xref>). The transcriptional activation function in mature B cells was found to be dependent on this domain, and specific residues, mapped by mutational analysis, were shown to be critical for nuclear or cytoplasmic localization. Arid3a has been shown to interact with the Tec kinase Btk (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Webb et al., 2000</xref>), and in fact, functional Btk is required for Arid3a activity (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Rajaiya et al., 2005</xref>), by phosphorylation of TFII-I which then forms a tripartite complex with Arid3a and Btk. Thus, Arid3a is not functional in B lineage cells from Btk-deficient Xid mice, known to lack B1a B cells (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Hayakawa et al., 1983</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, Arid3a has also been found to alter BCR signaling because of its association with BCR-containing lipid rafts (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>). Arid3a can be palmitoylated, redirecting its localization to lipid rafts where it associates with the BCR signalosome and interacts with sumoylation enzymes, blocking calcium flux and phosphorylation of Btk and TFII-I. Thus, higher levels of Arid3a decrease B cell responsiveness to BCR cross-linking and so function to tune BCR responsiveness. We speculate that the threshold for selection into the B1a B cell pool is altered in Lin28b/Arid3a-expressing early B lineage cells, facilitating selection of cells with BCRs that normally would be eliminated in BM (B-2) development because of their recognition of self-ligands. The requirement for selection by self-reactivity (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Hayakawa et al., 1999</xref>) accounts for the observation that many B cells developing from pro-B that express Lin28b (or Arid3a) do not enter the CD5<sup>+</sup> B cell pool. Manipulating Arid3a will be key in advancing our understanding of differences in BCR selection during fetal and adult B cell development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>mRNA expression analysis using Agilent Technologies whole genome arrays.</title><p>Total RNA, isolated as described previously (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Rumfelt et al., 2006</xref>), was used for production of fluorescent-labeled probe and then hybridized to the array.

Lin28b cDNA was subcloned into pMIG-EGFP retroviral vector by digesting the original construct with NotI, followed by filling in the cohesive end with T4 polymerase; this construct was then digested with EcoRI, releasing the Lin28b cDNA fragment. The pMIG-EGFP vector was first digested with BglII and filled in to generate a blunt end, then followed by digestion with EcoRI. The Lin28b fragment (EcoRI&#8211; blunt) was then ligated into pMIG-EGFP (EcoRI&#8211; blunt) yielding the Lin28b retrovirus. A similar procedure was used to generate an mCherry retrovirus containing Lin28b. For the miRNA expression construct, mouse Let-7b miRNA stem loop sequence identified from miRBase, along with its flanking genomic sequence of &#8764;200 bp to preserve the putative hairpin structure and proper endogenous processing, was amplified by PCR with primers that incorporated BglII and XhoI sites.
